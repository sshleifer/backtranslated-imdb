Here, other reviewers think that this is a horrible movie. It is simply not true and is a little unfair. The player has good quality and the direction moves well. I do not think Tarantino is wrong with the stories involved. Perhaps it is a new tool for its directors. I thought the movie was more interesting. Perhaps some elements of the script should be strengthened, but the only mistake I can find. Nestor Cantillana, Sylvio, has a great performance, and Antonella Rios is also striking and worth the admission price.
