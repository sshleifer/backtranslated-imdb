Everything that was shown on television before lasts. You can guess who will die or find something, but you will not be able to say anything in Lost. Everything was so strikingly stunning and really a mystery, because there is a lot of secrets, but because everything is so big before it's great. I'm just as hungry. LOST is a work of art. It gives you something to wait each week. This genius. The surrounding area is bright, calm at the beach, and is terribly hot and terrifying in the woods. Heroes, especially those on the island, are a work. The rest are very dramatic, yet we can not predict their deaths, because there are more, and there are secrets that affect the other heroes who want to say more and die with them.
