Thelma Ritter took a picture. I was still watching her. He could not help emotionally on his final scene. He did not take the Oscars. So do not believe the Oscars very much. Richard Widmark has never been a better part of it and it was a perfect cast like a 3-D defective person. Jean Peters was as big as a drunk, challenging girl in her best role. And Richard Kiley should have been very good; Why would I hate another? Yes, patriotism was given weight; but, without it, you do not have many movies. See your faces! The first three stars did not need much script. I would like to see this movie without a dialogue. If you see Ray Milland and Rita Gama at Ray, maybe you know what I mean. When I first had a baby in NYC in 1956, I took my uncle Bronx to the South Street looking for us No. 66. I knew I believed Hollywood would be safe. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ If you have seen this, do not need to explain. Perhaps someone who reads these comments does not see "Pick Up in the South Saki". You like it; you are just looking for 66 South Street in New York City.
