This episode is a little bit confusing. Some say that you have to start from the beginning, but I have to say that I'm a little confused since. <br /> <br /> Clark is hitting on my head and amusing to believe that Fairview Mental is awakening on the ground and believes it is a super hero. Clark said he was at the helm of his life. Delusional. She also finds something unusual: Martha married Lionel; Lex is tied to a wheelchair cut by hand and foot after an accident on the bridge; and Lana Clark. But he gets acquainted; Another one dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also finds that a mentally retarded patient is from a small world. This doctor is a run from Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode calls the buffy episode "Normal," where Buffy begins to understand clearly about a mental shelter. The physician was a figure of imagination that he knew the doctor knew, and was actually crazy. Her parents were still married, still living in LA, there were no friends, Angel never had her lover, and she had no sister named Shafag. There were no demons or vampires either. Both episodes are a bit sad, because doctors say that only symbols are a summary of their imagination, but they state what the truth is: artistic, and it brings us back to reality. However, there is always a sense of reality in a while, but we watch these shows to escape reality. Better, because characters need to eliminate new challenges.
