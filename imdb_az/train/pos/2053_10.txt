First of all, I would like to say that this movie was more than just the last shit we ate from Hollywood's intestines. McBain is a real action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. There are all the classic elements of the 80's / early 90s of the night ... casual acts of violence (that is when Walken and his group go to earn money and kill them when they are against drug dealers) children throwing fire, fire children, building blasting of children, and, of course, children who fired on buildings. Walken is in the best shape in this picture: it offers memorable lines like "Let's sit down ..........". and others who make this movie the top part of the cleaning rack at a local video store. If you have an ill-treatment for unnecessary random acts of violence, rent this movie today and provide your thirst.
