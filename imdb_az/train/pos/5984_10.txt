If you look in the right context, this is a beautiful movie - this is a parody of teenage-horror-devil-worship movies (and I've seen many in the '80s!)! When I went out for the first time, I saw this movie and immediately liked it. It was great to see Gene in the KISS's great admirer. Everyone who hates metal with OZZY can not be bad! Also, Fastway was a favorite for me, so it was great to hear them soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS is playing in the fire zone with a "devil" guitar, kneeling on Sammy's cover for Trick or Treat (DVDs in advance). It was a special order, and at that time the cost of the VHS copy (about 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but it's not a ridiculous price. The 'OZZY-Gen' cover is only for $ 5 aftershocks. Perhaps the only company that released the film was Gene and OZZY. <br /> <br /> Like Jack's Nicholson, the same thing as the Little Horror Store, he was in a five-minute period, but now he's in the same cover as the main star. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the Trick or Treat web site and many people believe that Sammi Curr is really a human! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Undoubtedly, it is not very serious, but I just like it!
