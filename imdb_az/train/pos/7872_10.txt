At the first glance I've ever seen, "finally what does madhur bhandarkar mean?" He says. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> No propaganda. This is a movie that has a lot of angles of a problem (I call it a "matter"), but it does not come with a solution like any medium movie. <br /> <br /> I was very interested when I realized that the movie ended in the same scenario as in the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The film describes many different symbols with completely different priorities and different ideologies, and still all parts of the system are more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there were more spoiler ahead. So, if you want to see one of the most adult movies of the past, look.
