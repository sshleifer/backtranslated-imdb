It's no surprise that the price of this movie won 4, is a movie that lingers into any soul, it's amazing that Paul Reiser finally gave up and took 20 years to talk about Peter Falk's idea. Saba: 10/10, when Sam Kleinman receives a letter from his spouse leaving his wife, we can understand every part of it. Find your child something else and take on a journey away to find it, and find something they lost, to find the love of friendship, family and each other. You know what is happening at the outset, but from the beginning to the end it will not be easy to understand, with a husband and a son, with a husband and wife. <br /> <br /> The same actors: 10/10 Of course, I can not say anything else, what I would say is what Peter Falk is doing with this movie is a legend, he is proud of the film, Peter Falk's romance / comedy what do you think when using the movie? The perfect result is not surprising that this film is perfect and has earned many prizes. His son, Paul Reiser, is a great actor, though he is not a great actor, it does not mean he does not really work; Peter Falk and Paul Reiser are perfect Father and Son, the rest is good enough but you do not see them, so much more shine what they will do for you. Music: 10/10 When using music, it's not always working, it's just not right, but it's nothing more than a perfect music arrangement, and it's even stronger. <br /> <br /> This part of the film shines well as other parts, a great soundtrack for a romantic / comedy. <br /> <br /> Generally: At 10/10, there are many romantic / comedy films, tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray and more, but this movie is one of the special ones. it's not everyday that can create such a story, it needs years to think about, and in fact it is the truth that we have to do to buy a large piece of human beings and look at them. When you look older and look at your ancestors in an old age, I think it will not be built like anyone else.
