Pure Orson Welles is one of the greatest films in the world. Welles is involved in a criminal assault to be set up just as a dropping man. It resembles the word "great doll I am". My land is so complicated that I know that the victim knows that she has lost her life. Mirror scene in the carnival salon is one of the finest films. Only this scene deserves the admission price. This is the only time Rita Hayworth is playing a complicated but convincing character. Nobody except Welles would be nervous to cut his hair and dye. Nobody should miss this picture.
