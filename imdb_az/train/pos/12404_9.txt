When I made this movie, I was Rawlins and had been lucky enough to work on it. Additionally and special effects with Eddie Surkin. Behind the scenes that were alive until Barbedwire's office of the electric chair was all fun. It was also a funny experience to get acquainted with all actors from Viggo to Tiny. The gateway to the prison wall is also called the Disney Gate by locals and is still called. If anyone is interested and is not in Rawlins, most movie sets are still in place and can be seen during a self-guided tour. For R. Harlin and a lot of fun was something I had the chance to repeat.
