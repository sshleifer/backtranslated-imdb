Why do not other comments go to McConaughey and why I do not understand why. He was not a very interesting film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is the writing and the hymn. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw are an unusual comic double, absolute types of fonts. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = font-family: problem Spanish use gives more authenticity. <br /> <br /> The AXCP members rated it at an unusually low price, and I thought it was fun and interesting, and it's worth at least 7. High scores and a large number of cash-makers are less interested in the movie.
