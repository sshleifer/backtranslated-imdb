This movie captivated me with the incredible sequence of sequence that made me flip the full reflection of my head, so when I came in, I was croaking. The theme of this film is trying to repeat itself, but it is not as difficult as identifying or questioning the defendants, but trying to find ourselves a bit more as we create a similar life. The scenes in the chicken storages are spectacular. At one point, Jorgen (having a chicken farm) takes part in a funny seminar, where the worst student is. This, in turn, also allows you to see the depth of your self-satisfaction to change yourself. The film was surprised by the hidden secrets on the surface of the ordinary man I've ever seen. There are many things here. It's pretty easy to imitate the mystery of the old man, but the fascination is trying to find out what all the other characters are doing when they understand it. This film was appealed to me in the same way as Sideways did, although the characters could not have been different.
