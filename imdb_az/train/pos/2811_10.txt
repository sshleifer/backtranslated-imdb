Silverlake Life, The look here, is definitely a stunning film about AIDS and about a gay love affair. Some images are really hard on someone who is afraid of gay or AIDS, and is likely to be sensitive to those who are watching him. Not a film about such a terrible disease and its consequences, it is not easy to shoot a movie about the lives of two people. This film teaches you how to care for each other in these difficult times, but never gets injured, still lives at any time, lives on the outside of the theater or the room, no matter what the fate of any one may be. The heroes are incredibly happy, and we will not bring anything special or sensitive to anything, despite nothing that is beyond the limit. Children, of course, should not watch this movie, but despite having to deal with such situations, they must have grown up and will not regret their tears.
