In the film, family and love had many fundamental values. It was a sense of human emotion and a inspirational story. The scenario was clear (it was easy to understand perfect for kids) and it was sometimes pleasant and humorous. There were several encrypted characters to look up. Cinematography was acceptable. Many cinematographers did not experience it today (with little silence). It was clearly drawn, but with a nice soft quality. It would be great if it was corrected, though it was a nice movie for family tastes. And the organization of the information was something that was thrown on you and I did not like it, but it was a good movie.
