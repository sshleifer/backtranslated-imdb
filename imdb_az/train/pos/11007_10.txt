It is a delight to watch Jeremy Northam's stuttering, a gentle environment guide Morgan Sullivan, and to watch him watch under the influence of single malt lungs and Lucy Liu's presence, watching pieces of empty chemistry and its true identity. Cigarette offer at the bar is an old habit, without thinking or even asking and losing its face, neck and lips. Regardless of the brainwashing, there is a lasting way of love. Love can not be "washed out of his mind" with one of his two fake spouses. Gradually in stages, he begins to walk with glasses, rides and talking differently, and his face looks different as the film progresses. Music is a fantastic, hipnotic, sexy, and timely driving. Extensive use of black and white and gray tones, this is almost a fantastic "movie noir", according to the tradition of many classic works. Lucy Liu had more sensitivity in his description, and he would have shown less of a single dimension to his part because he was talking about various frazzled states, his loved one, and a blind mission based on some weaknesses and genuine sincerity. It's not a match for Northam's talent, but I'm thoroughly happy about this movie, and I would talk about other scenarios written by the same author.
