I liked Antz, but I loved Bug's Life. This animated work has been paid. I'll definitely get it on the DVD. By the way, Disney should create a widescreen version of this movie on the tape. (I've heard all the screenshots discussed in the standard video format of the screen). The most recent credits need to admit that the most fun! I just saw one of the two sets, but I can not stand patiently to see the other!
