USE OF USE Aside from John Wayne, no other actor, in contrast to James Stewart, did not live longer in the saddle in the west, and this film proved it. This supremacy story of revenge around a Winchester rifle has only one weak point that I can think of: Will Geer's falling as Wyatt Earp as a very unearp. The spill of her husband was good: Stephen McNally, a surprise Dutch Henri, Dan Duryea, Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (very versatile playing very good guys and bad guys), as a slippery gun shooter. Stunts between Stewart and McNally are great! I would like to call this West against the products of today's West. They will not give you a chance!
