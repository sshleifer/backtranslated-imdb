Perhaps the most accurate Stephen King adaptation. It is not surprising that the king himself wrote the script. The story follows Creed's family's transition to a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is a nice old man who knows a few things about Judas. First, there is a highway running on their frontier. Another way is to go to Pet Sematari, where children have been buried animals that have been killed by car for many years. Soon, Ellie Creed's cat, the Church, was found dead. Fortunately, this is far from the birthday of Thanksgiving, except for the Louis (father). John is buried somewhere on the edge of Pet Sematarius in Lice. Later, it is met by the Church of Luis (not so polite). He turned and went back because he had come out of the burial bag and went out. Perhaps he was buried alive. Maybe not. <br /> <br /> I thought that all the King's adaptations I saw would be the most terrible. The characters are real and the situation is normal. Mary Lambert is doing a great job of directing the procedures. Thirst, as part of the film, is maintained at a fairly high level for field development. The area where Gage was killed will forever remain in your mind. Then, of course, we have the result. <br /> <br /> Lambert really creates anxiety and sometimes anxiety, moments. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a good movie and a perfect fit. If you enjoy not being scared and happy, it's just what you are looking for, "Pet Sematharius" is not the only thing you do not care about being distracted by the pictures you are worried about. Non Horror fans want to avoid it.
