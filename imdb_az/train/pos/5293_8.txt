This is a very bright comedy about a beautiful family with a child named Pecker because he used Peck's dinner. Pecker, Baltimore, Md. She loves to take pictures of people everywhere in a small suburb, and a group of photography from New York attracts the attention of the lovers. Pecker is a cute sister who just goes to nuts on sugar and takes a bag of sugar spoon, which is really an ADDICT. There are scenes of men who work in the same way as the jigsaw puzzles and gals. It's hard to loosen their ideas with this movie, but only for a few laughs in a simple way in 1998, with whom it cares.
