Watching the footprints of the crowd with sunlight, gentle light and shadow filter in windows and rooms, frequent overlays and extreme rapprochement, photography is an interesting, artistic way to shoot. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film begins as a little bit about a beauty contest. The film begins with a beautiful Lucienne aka Lulu (when performed by Louise Brooks) on a hot Sunday with a local swimming pool - a little show-off in front of men in the pool, and soon they decide to enter. France's representation in the Miss Europe beauty contest is a very jealous, shoulder-to-shoulder fianc√© (really a very boring friend). During the longest pick-up race, the racers exhibit themselves in mayonnaise (I wondered if the girls could just come out slowly to extend their length - and hence the applause!). Lulu is soon followed by a prince and Maharaja, but his hothead does not like her attention paid to or paid to him by others, in this matter (he just wants her home.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A little fun little noise it's a loud noise, despite the fact that it was very surprising and full of surprise that I did not see sound problems and watched the movie in a clear way, and I saw the movie perfectly well.
