Running Man is not a great movie, in fact it is a mockery of insanity. However, Arnie provides you with everything you like in the movie, and it's fun and fun. I do not see how anyone can use this image, it is so unreasonable and almost excites itself. By the way, this is probably one of the best-selling Arnie films.
