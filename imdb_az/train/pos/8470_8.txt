A group of archaeologists find a real treasure? King of Sheeba Queen. From Egypt to Taj San Francisco will be moved. But it will not be an easy journey. There are many thieves who want to get their hands on precious stones on the crown. Fortunately for all those involved, Mr Moto can protect his crown. <br /> <br /> Mr. Moto Gamble, after disappointing, I went to Moto and hoped for the best. , but, of course, the worst. But in the first 10 seconds of the movie, I knew it would be more comfortable. In 1930s, I'm making a secret of a style that has something in Egypt with archeological excavations. Moto is hiding as German archaeologists (Imagine that Peter Lorre plays Germany?), Start-up scenes really hit me. The film could have quickly gone to a bit of exotic San Francisco, though it was so enjoyable. Dark, bad signs hidden in the rainy night; opened fire on the open windows which did not miss the hero's head; complex and probable faulty alarms only encourages them to test; and master criminals who believed in the murder? these are the elements I really enjoyed in the 1930s. And Mr. Moto gets all Vacation. For me, a few other bonuses have always been a beautiful little role of Lionel Atwill, GP. A return to Huntley and Mr. Moto, which is really funny. At the opening scenes, I remembered his mask, and Athletic Moto appeared near the finale. Moto is a dervish who is disintegrating as if it were after his pond. All this and I did not remember the wonderful performance that Lorra had. <br /> <br /> Mr. Moto wins a contest you are looking at. <br /> <br /> Dear Moto series can be understood when you think about it as long as you hate it after the taxi. . The Second World War was in the corner. A movie with a Japanese hero after Pearl Harbor did not go very well. At least Mr Moto series ended with a very positive note.
