This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. It's not just a fun movie or a well-prepared movie. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz takes a place in animation, and even if it does not, it would only provide a place in the animation history of technical skill to do so. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz is a stop-motion movie about the hidden life of insects. <br /> <br /> In this film he explains a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. <br /> <br /> In this film, she imagined an insect world with small frauds such as workplaces, homes, night clubs, movie houses, posters, bicycles and paintings. Mr. Beetle has a relationship with a very dance trail up to a locust snake; but he decided to shoot an operator and rifle. Mr. Beetle returns home, and Mrs. Beetle finds her job. Mr. Beetle saddened his lover, but he forgave his wife. It's two cameras and it's a movie. And the following film is Mr Beetle and the Dragonfly. This statement sounds similar, but once it has been seen that it is a cinematography work. In addition to Emil Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz invents everything that will be used in future animators. Therefore, it should not be forgotten.
