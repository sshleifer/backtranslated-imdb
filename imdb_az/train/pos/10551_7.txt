To sit and write? Nothing is the last "what happens?" Vincenzio Natali's festival and David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller played as two victims. Someone is experiencing a problem of relationship, conserving his / her job (due to problems with the relationship), and the police takes him (due to work and relationship problems). The other boy is an agoraphobic refusing to go beyond his home and calls his mother to claim that he has betrayed him when he does not buy the bread. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Do you destroy all of them? This is not the premise behind 'Nothing'. Two fools, police, girl tracker, cars, lawn, road, everything you know? no. There is nothing but white earth! This is an interesting concept I thought. I also looked at it, going to the movie for about 30 minutes, and had an hour in the movie. Can 2 actors do this and can make us 60 minutes? Despite the fact that the players are working 60 minutes long, there are deadly weather in the film. But two actors and directors with each other had such a great repertoire that they were entertaining to watch for the dialogue and the latter compressing each other. There are plenty of extraordinary elements, but these are more responsive to those elements worth seeing.
