Broadway producer John Thornway returned home to visit his hometown, a little girl living in Indiana, Lily Mars, had a great blessing on the Broadway and the great charity. Lily seeks Thornway to do her best to realize her, but only worries her antics. While traveling to New York to show Thornway show, Lily (of course not John) and Thornway give only a small role in the subsequent show, but it's a blessing to his family, but Thornway begins to fall for this young girl and romantic flowers, the leading lady in the show, Isabel Brings tight, jealousy. When John-Lily was unhappy with romance, causing friction with Isabel show, she left, and decided to make John Lily star. Then Isabel returns and Thornway has to tell Lily that he has returned to a small role in the game, and will endanger romance. There was a refreshing change to see a very attractive movie and Garland's comedy doctrines (when Lady MacBeth read, humorous, never threatened to read his career), and Lily is not romantic from Thornway's (Thornway) character. The film was not predictable and the scenes did not come together, but it was a very unpleasant movie. Rated, 7.
