When looking at John Cassavetes's film on the opening night, I recalled Quentin Tarantino once in an interview with his personal experience in creativity or functioning. He was forced to bring this experience together with him on the stage, even though his life would not end in a game but that he would act as a dog that would influence him and, of course, this comedy. "Otherwise," she says, "what am I doing?" I could not help, but when I watched the character of Gena Rowland, I was thinking about Myrtle Gordon, who was almost a weekly or very similar scenario. The theater is more like a star actress around the actress, how a manners and human nature behave when looking at a character, and how he lives in a human life (Myrtle Gordon more than that in the Cassavetes movie). <br /> <br /> After a short break to the film's start, Myrtle signs autographs and comes to an admirer named Nancy and drops her heart to Myrtle. It's a little touch, but it does not have to get out of the car (rain or rain). She was sitting next to the car, hitting another car in an automobile accident and scared his daughter. She is not sure what's really happening, but the next day she sees that the girl is actually dead. He is so surprised when he thinks he's gone out of his system since then. When faced with an invisible appearance at first, he shows it in a small way while preparing a scene by an opposing actor (by Cassavetes): - Cassavetes, Mormon, Mormon, "Mormon" comes after a search for a sense of feeling, like the past movies, is really a matter for a person to feel and feel, or not, and how it affects others around the world - this is not a new place before Rowlands, but a woman under the influence of alcohol (in this case of alcohol) has not played, nor is it the only thing that happened in Ben Gaszara's murder of a Chinese Bookie, but the actors say that everything is important for the symbols in every field: Cassavetes tells them A to B does not tell you how to go on a stage and you do not need it in the movie Cassavetes you know, Myrtle must have been so contentious, for example, when he was not guilty, but he betrayed and did not agree with the depth of his character and the voice of the game ("The Age of Writing") it also starts to influence the environment <br /> <br /> The question is often what happens when it is ordinary. A conventional playwright says the conflict will "go on stage, will the show continue?" This is not important for Cassavetes, even if it were there, 'Is that fine?' Perhaps getting into a whirlwind game like "Second Woman" can help her to run her personal jinn and lose her loss of reality (Can Sara see and attack the common alien who is surprised by what the hell is all about?) Otherwise, the game's hopelessness causes everything that is wrong with it? Rowlands's depth is intense and elegant with its character, and it's a good movie for you to be honest about one person in this profession, if it's what he expected, it does not mean any widow under the Woman's Commitment, and consequently, other speeches , Is a fact played by Gaura from Nancy to the exquisite Laura Johnson. Cassavetes does not answer their questions, it's not easy. <br /> <br /> One of the real excitements of the opening night, seeing the great actors who perform an incredible scenario, makes Cassavetes the same as in the theater. See how the game is seen - this is a really real game and we just know a bit about what to do. When we see actors performing on the stage, we came to be dealing with melodrama (inter-community disorder and work, occasional clashes and domestic violence) and the birth of actors. I was curious to see how true the press was, Cassavetes allowed how many other actors were completely disbanded in Myrtle's scene or in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> </ p> </ div> </ span> </ div> </ div> </ span> </ span> </ div> </ actors, actresses, actors, and actors come together to see the beauty of the film. The opening night is a powerful drama full of open conversations with death and madness, truth and artistic work, where love is with people, and in fact, what is "action"?
