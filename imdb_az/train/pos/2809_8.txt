<br /> <br /> The most unhappy incident on this film was that only 8 people reviewed and NO-ONE felt the value of commenting on the message boards. <br /> <br /> The same year as Philadelphia ... Tom Hanks Oscar winner ... this is really a movie that people can see and reward. <br /> <br /> There is more humanity, life, love, longing and beauty than any other gay movie I've seen in these two people ... and that's all true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have to quit some text lines when it's pressed: it's enough to say that anyone who really wants to be gay in the 60s and 70s and who can almost understand AIDS as modern drugs is a little easier than cocktails They were allowed to breathe ... This is a movie. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I will add a personal comment about AIDS. In spite of everything, there was a silver lining for all the horrors. When AIDS first came out, it was called "cancerous cancer" and the government favored "letting mortality" instead of spending a red interest for research to earn a bunch of fags. AIDS after that would be heterosexual illness. But the government was not ready; When flat people start to get sick, the only organizations and associations established by the gay themselves (Examples: Names Project: A blanket reminiscent of all those who have died of AIDS. Consequently, the people in their usual life who are not in gay relationships count themselves and need them, because no one there is no other organization ... In my assessment, it finally broke the barriers to prejudice, and the plain world finally allowed gay adoptions to equal ... When AIDS first appeared on the scene, many of us thought that our plain world would use it as a way to make it even harder. and if it does not get sick at once, it would probably be true, however, the steps to be taken in gay freedoms - as I wrote, there are those who have gay marriages in at least 5 countries around the world - these benefits are more than useless without AIDS all together - both flat and gay - have to die before our general humanity becomes clearer - but what I write here is true, and I think it's a little relaxed. Do not understand that not all people are so empty.
