It was definitely one of the best kung fu films and could be one of the best films ever to date ... There is a huge area that acts as a puzzle with many complexity and excitement. This movie is packed with cat and mouse games and deception, and people hide their identity and their nature. The characters of this movie live more than the average kung fu movies and breathe. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are also interesting and interesting, and the film does a good job of giving a scene to show their personality and desires. <br /> <br /> Struggle scenes play as small stories and most of them are original and interesting. There are cool exercises and martial arts skills that are awesome in the world of fantasy. Each poisonous animal has a personality style that simulates the unique ability of each person to be 5 people. For each of these characters, you can see fun and playful techniques used in movies ... When it happens, the director uses a quick return to the training area to parallel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Director Chang Cheh is very concerned about the film's death. This makes some scenes in the film more effective. This film really cares when we kill people. This is because of the horrors of death when the camera is killed by bad guys. Some sequences in this film are really intestinal. <br /> <br /> <strong> When looking for Kerimov's revenge, he really is angry and you feel the pain. <br /> At the same time, this is also a fun movie. There are all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu movie. There is a bad dubbing, Heroes are ready to fight in the hat of the hat. Some of the sound effects are cheerful, and sometimes the behavior of the characters is quite unrealistic ... all this is just added to the size of the movie. <br /> <br /> And do not forget that this is a director's. More stylish than his contemporaries. If you follow this movie closely, the technical skill shown on the screen is virtuoso. Everything is going fast (quick cut style and fast camera actions of the genre) is easy not to see how beautiful the movie really is. Lighting and composition are sometimes spectacular. Camera's work and movement are made in a very advanced and very exciting way, for example ... Imagine that Hitchcock is about twice as fast. Chang Chah was actually a craftsman and artisan who knew his artists and artists and could produce important materials while working on his or her boundaries. He does not touch the boat of the kung fu genre, but in a sophisticated manner he / she holds every stage and every shot, and adds a lot to the quality of the work. <br /> <br /> This is a real pack of A kung fu movies that speak at each level. It's art, this debris is emotionally acting, and it has a sense of fun, true spirituality, but it does not allow the morality to go well. I advise everyone to be an admirer of this genre.
