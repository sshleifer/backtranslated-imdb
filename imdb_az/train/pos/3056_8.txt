<br /> <br /> This film has a similar Altman-like taste. <br /> <br /> This film is some of the industry's really challenging people, and when I finally look, it's a rainy day for a rainy day. (he is mentioned as a "thank you" person in the latter credits) uses the same independent non-incongruous areas as the film draws on its summit. Macy plays clean, honest, and honest, Sutherland plays and describes a small number of people who can not escape from their "fate", Neve adds a leap to intentional reverberation, Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain TV is not possible?), Continuous John Do not mention Ritter and have all the ingredients for a good movie. The scenario is sealed, the dialogue is free from clich√© and thoughtful (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Stop and enjoy faith, it's really a waste of time.
