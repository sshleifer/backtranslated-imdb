The film focuses primarily on a violent hunter hunter and a violent Robert Taylor, who is forced to agree with him. Building a buffalo hunt in the middle of a hunt, describing the end of a tragic era of delusional massacres and drama and decline for Buffalo and native Americans. Taylor hates Hindus and humbly becomes corrupted because the Buffalo flock never loses it. On one stage, he catches the animal after the animal, and in the other, he kills the Indian and then eats the food he eats. This brutal foreigner lies in the fact that a dangerous person who refuses to beg his companions (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan, and Russ Tamblyn) does not abandon him. Films are not the most enjoyed movie and are afraid of the created drama and lead to a betrayal and a fitting conclusion to the accident.
