The National Art Gallery, July 10, 2005, has featured a long-awaited original uncut version of this movie. Restored scenes that were cut off by the release of these scenarios. The character of the slavery released by the original censorship of 1933, the philosophy of a moral goodwill, is presented as a follower of Nietsze and urges him to use it to tear upward. Also, the end of the original I accept is deleted in the existing VHS versions and the end is reset to its original form. A wonderful movie of miracle and power. I hope that this film will be reissue to appreciate all the beautiful DVDs. See it.
