Silent, delicate and sophisticated film, "Man in White Suit" is a breath of fresh air in the film of Ealing studio. <br /> <br /> While some contemporary viewers have doubts about the darkness at the outset, I do not doubt that many will not be attracted by the expertise of the film, the themes and symbols will be languid in the film. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Alec Guinness is another wonderful example of Ealing's inspiration from 1949, not as a virtuous virtuoso as "Kind Hearts and Coronets." This time, he plays only eight characters, but unusual inventor and scientist, like Sydney Stratton, always find the right tone and expression. In addition to the gentle, expressive performance of Guinness, the rest of the section is effective. The main players are Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger. Although Parker, as an ineffective yet pivot miller and trustworthy as his father, Thesiger is compulsory absurd, as a crippled but influential business grandson. His father, Joan Greenwood, is a cunning, funny comedian who is the most powerful peak in this film. Imagination and thought and appeal, he is very elegant in this film, a beautiful distinction with something similar, but more maladroit Guinness. In my opinion, the scene they are trying to deceive is played by the couple in a very attractive way, but also exciting and entertaining ... <br /> <br /> The themes are perfectly immoral and very effective. The complexity of relationships between science, work, and labor is thoroughly and exclusively investigated. It is horrific by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically superior in all areas; Evocative photography, matching sound effects and music and a legendary script, all impress you calmly. <br /> <br /> - ***** 1/2
