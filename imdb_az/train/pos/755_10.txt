Dirty Sanchez's four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey, and Pancho) are the more extreme English version of Jackass, which goes a long way to hack and humiliate each other. This show is better than Jackass because most stunts are not planned to make the reaction even more funny. The show has three series, first watching them around and taking a long look at their lives, for example. There is an episode in their love life, work, and so on. The second series sends boys to try different professions. The third is followed by a European trip. The boys become more brave as the show goes on the arena. In my opinion, the third series is the best but when you are stomach for a week, do not fall asleep in just about every single episode of blood and blood.
