Now I've been watching this movie twice on DVD, and I was not able to regret it twice with my only impartial attitude. Hollywood appears to be more controversial in contrast to the truth than most other travels, especially in a subject discussed. <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; Nowadays, really good films (in brief) are slightly different and the main costs are unpleasant (if you do not have high expectations), but are very commercially inspired. In my opinion, this movie is really a good movie (without a masterpiece) because it saves itself and gives the viewer the opportunity to watch and analyze it, instead of exploring it with the effect and emotion. <br /> <br /> This film is illuminated by a cool, observer and generally good decision-maker. The story has its own flaws, especially with Jewel's character, but then it would be logical to return to a normal life for such a chaotic, young widow, even releasing every boy . He still does not go weak, in fact he thinks he is one of the strongest characters, he is always in control of relationships, men only labeled. And I'm very grateful that he is not a weeping widow. I believe it's something more normal than the death of a loved one in the 19th century. Even small diseases and injuries could easily die, so the death of the one who caused the death is of course a cause of sorrow and has not been traumatized as it is now. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie for the smart people if they are in a mood for something, unlike ordinary Hollywood. Do not ask for an emotion that offers non-stop motion or heart rate.
