When I first saw this movie on the cables, it was immediately one of my favorite films. I am a great admirer of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film reflects the accurate description of the South and racist attitudes. Many of the attitudes came from Solle, a former farmer who was condemned to torture. Soll is a moving object, his funny dragons give us ideas on the way back to the South. I suppose that Soll would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease today. The attitude towards him and a small boy who came to work for the convict is less. In spite of the racist ideas, he began to rely on some of the brothers who were his brothers. The two most convinced two prisoners are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best films, they are real chemistry. <br /> <br /> This movie should have gained more popularity. <br /> <br /> <strong> Ravich,
