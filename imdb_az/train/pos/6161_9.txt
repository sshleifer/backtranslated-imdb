Bedknobs and Broomsticks, established during the Second World War, are an entertaining fantasy adventure for children starting with Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who has prevented the Nazi occupation with three evacu kids and a 'virtuoso professor'. <br /> <br /> With its brilliance of ingenuity, the burden of laughter, this movie will delight kids of all ages with great characters, exciting stories and attractive melodies. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, who brings three children to a lifetime adventure and has three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart, and Ian Weighill), Cockney Special effects have a long history, but with Come face-to-face, kids do not know much about these things as long as they are entertaining. And fun, they will. With a few impressive scenes that have a great effect on live action and animation and are more magical than magical magic than over 100 Harry Potter movies, it would be difficult to use this beautiful slice of kinematic escape. <BR> <br /> <div style = "color: red;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> legend Bruce Forsyth as 'Flash' Harry-style spiv provides a good rating from me.
