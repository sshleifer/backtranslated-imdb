In 2004, I saw "True," Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je T'a. When I saw him, I liked him and got excited. It was my favorite short-length movie and I appreciated it in many formats. Of course, I wanted to watch the whole movie and even check who was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I saw the courtesy of the internet. all you have to say is that it looks AWESOME. Photography is still bright and clear, although it's not a good thing to do in every short and stroke. Then I read the trivia here, and maybe 6K scanning gives more justice to the whole DP's work. My special choices are "True" or "Faubourg" - only on the first scene of "Quais de Seine" (it's sunlight!), Sin City-esquire (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14 Arrondisement" Saint-Denis "still boils gold with those bright colors (my eyes, trembles!) And" Quartier Latin "in silver. Beautiful. <br /> Yes, these are a few BEAUTIFUL short films. <br /> <br /> Let's get it right now. I'm very (and mean to say it) very successfully like eclecticism. You do not have the same subjects or treatments as the two shorts, and I think this formula is limited enough to allow all these artists to explore the beautiful and deeper things in the shorts. From a simple love story to a crazy-Chinese-musical-Paris-Barbet-Schroeder, I liked making a social comment a modest monologue for a terrorist comedy. I love the surprises! And this movie has them! All the directors have the chance to release things that are unusual in common movies (because I look down on them). <br /> <br /> This is very little practice, but I can breathe that these people can breathe. <br /> I love simplicity and love love. I love simple emotions, beauty and eclecticism, and generally, it is a very nice movie to meet with one another or someone. Simply feel. <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, the two best ones for me are: There is shorts - "Quais de Seine" (good-natured, sure, and perhaps even necessary, but feels much like commercial) and "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" Although I liked the night, I felt it was a topic of compulsion. But of course, it's just me. "Tour Eiffel" I did not like, but I think that I'm different from Sylvain Chomet. It's a great question for the people who know the actors and directors of this movie, and I do not know, so they are a big question, from the interactions, surprises (see for a comic role for Alexander Payne) and "What will this director do?" <br /> <br /> I repeat now: my favorite shorts and all of them are a beautiful and energetic mix. I strongly recommend it. Of course! Cautious Beautiful Love You can watch it if you want!
