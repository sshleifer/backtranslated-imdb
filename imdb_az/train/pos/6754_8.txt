Otto Preminger, Laura's stars Dana Andrews and Gen Tierney combine this rude and are preparing for a strange movie: "Sidewalk Ends". This movie is complemented by a well-written crime story with exciting stories, unexpected turns, intelligent dialogue, and great camera movements and a striking look on dark and non-violent film neur lights. Detective Mark Dixon, who has a very tough physique with Dana Andrews's criminals, faces stars like party and party police. In one case, Dixon sees more and more as she sees when looking for suspects and answers. <br /> <br /> Dana is in the role of Andrews - harsh and bizarre, Andrews Dixon, ready to knock down any and all of the bad things. She is the perfect film noir anti-hero - she is not always beautiful, but still rooted for her. Gen Tierney is doing something like Dixon's sweet shoulder for her role. Thierney's role may not be much, but he certainly can knock on top and out of what he can do in the role of others, blunder each member of his audience with a good laugh, delicacy, and shining eyes. Carl Malden, the most memorable, lieutenant, is a very good supporter and enhancer, such as Tomas, who is a player who supports or supports. Sidewalk Ends is where Laura is not, but is a great movie noir full of great characters, stories and pictures.
