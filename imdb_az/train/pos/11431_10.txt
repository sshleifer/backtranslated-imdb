My 3rd year French class has always loved this movie. In a multicultural, urban high school, the film provided plenty of discussion (in the French class, but after many discussions I continued in English). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I always felt that this movie was one of the "sex" scenes I saw in a movie. . One year, a 17-year-old African-American screamed, "Yes!" While describing the scene, Protée explores Aimée's reflection on the mirror at the same place where he is eager to freeze. It uses "mirroring techniques" to try to focus on the internal conflict within one or more of the characters on the scene: this is a perfect example for the technique and it's "sexy." <br /> <br /> Many students had difficulty understanding the end of the movie. One of the film's theme was "Africanism" and how much African and African Africans could do, one would not be "African" (the driver tried to do so) should be an African.
