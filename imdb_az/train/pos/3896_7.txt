Some people loved "Aristocrats" and others hated them, and they often stayed in the middle. Eddie Izzard's reactions are unlikely to be excessive - if a transvestite comedy (which tells the girl) can be used and that the word "f" is used sufficiently, its program will be a long beep if presented on a network television. Most of Izzard's fans were dedicated to seeing no defects in his performances. On the other hand, I thought that this show was sometimes more flattering than Izzard's chest, but it was more fun and full of spots. There is a way in the show that links routines from previous routines. He is not a story wires. He is not a joke. He is not an attractive fantasyman like Robin Williams. For example, San Francisco is a regular idea with a cable car and Alcatraz. However, flopped routines have a sophisticated past, and there is a way to extend the links. I gave this performance to 7 and I can agree to raise it to 8. In no way.
