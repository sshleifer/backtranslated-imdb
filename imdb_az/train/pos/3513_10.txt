Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a soccer soccer player who has just passed through two African players and tries to sell Benfica rivals to FC Porto for these little money. He did not play well, and asked the FC Port to do so wrongly. But, of course, these two players are all good and FC Porto sells them to foreign clubs for a good job. A big movie without a big movie for a small country like Portugal is a very good and funny comedy showing all competition between Portugal's North / South (FC Porto / Benfica). Be advised
