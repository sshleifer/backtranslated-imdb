The effect of the war should be a very good war movie showing a country boy who lost sight of Guadalcanal and should come home and rebuild himself with his family and friends. The actor's great hero makes this movie very entertaining. Eleanor Parker's role as a girl deserved the Oscars nomination. This film has such an innocence. The role of Ann Doran was equally as satisfying as all the small supporting roles. Especially prefabricated as aura of Phildelphia's hometown. Hunting scene is very good. Certainly, the battle scene at Guadalcanal shows the horrors facing our soldiers in this epic war. Well worth a movie and something to be forgotten
