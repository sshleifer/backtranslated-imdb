This movie has some nice elements! Reese Witherspoon's debut, of course, is wonderful, but Jason London and his chemistry. The score is beautiful, bright and clean. James Newton Howard improves the quality of any movie he / she has written. Also, there is a skill to film the missing days, be sure to watch the score for the latest "Peter Pan" and the "Gothic" The Village. I've seen this movie for the first time at the age of 13 or 14, and now I just do not cry, I throw a tear or two for nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. It will become a lifetime of comfort.
