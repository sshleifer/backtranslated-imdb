This movie is very nice. If Tsui Hark is an admirer of Chinese fantasy films, you should love it. This film is the Lord of the Rings: a great fantasy story based on true Chinese mythology. (Many critics have called this film less, I think they should know Chinese mythology zero.) If you love Stormriders or Hell and World Geeks, it should make up your alley. Although it has been purchased for the US distribution with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey, this movie is still hard to find in the United States. Worth the visit! This DVD is worthy of ownership.
