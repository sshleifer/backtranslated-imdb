The original with Barbara Stanwyk is kept only by Stanwyk's performance. Stories and other speeches are very sweet, and the film itself is great. Bette Midler's version is more interesting. She is an independent, liberated woman of Stella Claire, who is pregnant and refuses to help her husband (Stephen Collins) or his friend (Underrated performance by John Goodman). She was very sweet by her daughter, Jenny Trini Alvarado, and then said that Jenny could do something better for her father and eventually changed her life. Through the film, there are many laughs, tears and memorable moments between Midlands and Alvarado. Combined stars like Marsha Mason Jenny's son-in-law, though rich, have a very good impact on her. If you like good movies with Midler, Goodman or a lot of your lover, we'll use the STELLA version of Bette Midler.
