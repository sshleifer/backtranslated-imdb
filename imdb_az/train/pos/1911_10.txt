I love new episodes with CJ and Grandad - I liked the story for Kate and the author. I want to know what Rory, Kerry, and Bridget are next to. I think CJ is very funny and I love her scenes with Grandad. I always love James Garner, and I do not think his actor like James Garner or Rockford, and I believe him as Kate's Dad. This family is very realistic and funny. When John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, it was quite sad, but as happened in real life, these things happened and were written in the arranged and discussed in both funny and sad and always extremely sensitive and lovingly discussed. But generally a very funny show that is very funny and entertaining.
