"Bruce Almighty" will win an Oscar Prize for the Oscars! "Titanic" will be the highest award of all time! Jim Carrey's fame will be so high that he will announce his candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Gentleman! If the filmmakers (including Carrey) have God's power, these fantastic fantasies will only change. After Carrey's new smile, the key point of Bruce Almighty is that. Carrey plays television broadcaster Bruce Nolan, and he is able to become the ultimate lamp that God holds for a complete sin for his own contradictions. The heavenly God, played by Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce "the gift of God" (his powers) if he can do God's work better. Without a doubt, Bruce moves away with his new happy faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey returns with his traditional comedy form at Bruce Almighty. Jennifer Aniston was not "mis.pittiful" as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier Kudos director Tom Shadyac is going to put the house for home 2 home and show us the most hilarious, doggoned bathroom scene all the time! 'Bruce Almighty' is not the deepest Carrey film, but it is still an exhibition that displays a story called 'Carreyism'! **** Good
