There is no idea what Jane Eyre had done before I saw these miniseries. I've read and watched many classics before, and I believe that most classics are stories that have been improved by the most delicate, long-written and medium-sized plot. These Jane Eyre miniaseries have completely changed my concept. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a fantastic actress and gives a beautiful portrait of Jane Eyrein. His emphasis pleases him, and his quiet but firm nature fits perfectly with the character of the young marriage mate. Timothy Dalton is incredible Rochester. His passion and energy in the film believe that he was born to play the master of Thornfield Hall. The miniseries did not fall asleep all night after watching. The area is both excitement and inspirational. The characters are perfectly executed and the story is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is the best version of Jane Eyre's appearance ever. <br /> <br /> Then I read a book and was amazed at how closely these mini-designers followed Charolette Bronte. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a work that will change your life, you can watch Jane Eyrein's 1983 BBC version.
