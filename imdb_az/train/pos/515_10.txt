I remember this movie for the first time - I was at the office on the weekend and the television was ready for noise. But I gradually felt more and more, and did not see or hear it in the movie, as much as I swallowed. The issue of life and death (the English name - the stairway to the United States) is a delightful, attractive, modest, and moving person in a perfectly written, well-directed, perfectly-oriented package. It's a classic, really coming straight into Casablanca, It's a beautiful life, going to the Wind, Citizen Kane and Fire Chariots. WHY has never accepted the same public warning and video store position? Fortunately, some critics have been put on the list of "The Best of All Times". Hopefully, the Fantasia of the 1940s did not have a hit in the 1960s, and the Oz Wizard was a dud at the box office, but hit by a TV. Buy - rent - follow - demand! You will not be disappointed!
