This movie is awesome for three main reasons. It is aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved it. The film, with extraordinary suits and picturesque sets, has a bold color theme. A very photographed (and unlikely) finish looks. I always enjoy the stories about the wrong associations / comrades that come together and become family members. Sometimes they fall into a clich√©, but this is not. This group of actors describes really good, but extremely unpleasant characters. Alan Larkin is the best (with her, the van and the subject of the road movie, I could not help but remember last year's most beloved movie Little Miss Sunshine?). I found Fabrizio Bentivoglio a very interesting actor and was only slightly illuminated by Til Schweiger once. The opening scene, all scenes that violate their deception are very funny. There is a mixture of humor and emotion throughout the film. I love my last. And of course, it's all magician theme. The good magician viewers look at where they want and create an illusion. What happens exactly to a film director, and therefore they say movie magic.
