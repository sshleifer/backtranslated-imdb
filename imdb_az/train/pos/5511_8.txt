Part II, or previously known as GUERILLA, is a great success, but I'm not as entertaining as I, because it's the place where we start witnessing Che Guevara's fall and death. Once again, I'm sorry for the cause and effect of both parts in their stories related to each other. He recalled that head coach Che Guevara is Argentina.
