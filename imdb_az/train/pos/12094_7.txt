The Castle of Blood is a good example of quality work in the genre of horror in Italy in the 1960s. The film has all the right elements - the old dark house, the atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. <br /> <br /> <strong> People have visited, but no one has returned. The hero stays in the castle and returns to win. However, the night that he visited was a special night. <br /> <br /> The killers are each night to return their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only defect I have seen in the film is the time to work. It feels almost padded. In a word, there is a large part of the first move that nothing has happened. Our hero does not find anything interesting in the dark. But after finding something, it takes a movie and it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> The Castle of Blood must be a must for the fan of Steele and the fan of the Italian Gothic horror in general.
