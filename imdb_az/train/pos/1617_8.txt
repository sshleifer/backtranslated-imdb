'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is nothing romantic, there are at least three people, but all belong to the same family. Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) wants to marry Johnny Ciarner (Danny Aiello). He does not like it, but he is sweet and good man. When he went to visit his mother in Italy, Loretta met Johnny's brother, Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny talked about each other for five years, and Loretta wants to invite her to the wedding. Of course, they fall into one another immediately. <br /> <br /> This story and stories of Loretta's parents, uncle, and aunt's development are just something for you. Every seen, watching Cher with a bright star in the middle of everything is a delight. He won the Oscar that year and was truly worthy. Cage is pretty good and is a gopurdur and as terrible as his father, Loretta's mother and Olympia Dukakis like Vincent Gardenia. This movie is funny, attractive and therefore very pleasant.
