Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy movies have very little plot. Instead, it will give them a more secular, and they will only be happy! You'll see films such as HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES, boys working or cleaning at home. The majority of the film is reflected in this film: Stan and Ollie are the chimney cleanser and are trying to clear the film's most mistaken professor chimney (very unsuccessful). <br /> <br /> As you can see from the zodiac, as if you were at home at home, guys with confusion and Stanley argue are working together to make a delightful movie. <br /> <br /> But it's a really strange subplot that starts and ends in a single twist. Naturally, the professor is really a crazy scientist, and he works in a way to make the job younger. In the late movie, you see a duck duck and even a duck with a duck! What happens next when we consider that our sons are left alone in the room? Although this subpot is unnecessary, it worked well enough. The middle part worked pretty well. Do not give the boys an exciting thing and you will be surprised by the joyous results. The team is one of the best films and finally gets 9.
