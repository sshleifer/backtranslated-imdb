This is one of my favorite episodes in the new version of "His Pilgrim Soul" Twilight Zone. As I said in my comment on the new series, there are some drawbacks in this series. Perhaps they emphasize their lessons. According to Serling's version, this is a bit more verbal and artificial. However, this episode can also be considered highly sensitive. In my opinion, I should appeal to those who love what they are doing. I recall that Korea's "Il Mare" (later replaced by The Lake House) did not surprise her. I think I first saw this episode because it destroyed the effect of the next film.
