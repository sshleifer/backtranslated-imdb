Al Gore's hard-earned documentary was shocked by the film "Anxious Truth", and directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Lindfield reminded us of the time to develop our lifestyle to save our beautiful planet. In the "Planet Earth," global warming of our planet is a wake-up call causing catastrophic results for all living things in the world. Al Gore has shown the planet's most intelligent future by providing the hard truths that have long been supported by long-standing examples of documented monologues. The creators of this documentary make a different and equally powerful way to it. They will not change the environment around us with the future representation of things that can happen around the planet, but they will not show the true beauty of the earth in all its glory. We see what we already know, but we did not think it would be so beautiful. In this film, we see that there are a wide array of most unusual places, such as the areas we have seen, the vegetation and the giant forest with flora and frozen landscapes. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that Al Gore needs to be prepared for. In this very different environment, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Patrick Stewart's noise is always comfortable and therefore good work is done, but from the very beginning it was sounded like I watched the X-men movie! Cinematography is probably the most striking feature of this documentary. <br /> <br /> Sadly, it's not unusual for you to be surprised that a single camera man has to draw all these attractive images. <br /> In brief: This is definitely the absolute must have for everyone because this beautiful planet belongs to every human being on the Earth! Truly, I did not think that our planet was so amazing!
