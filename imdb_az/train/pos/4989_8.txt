This is very dated, but this is part of the appeal of the 1933 movie. It can be the same for most Pre-Code movies; <br /> <br /> It was a short time, Spencer Tracy's great player and Loretta Young's beautiful face and sweetness was a good-looking and enjoyable character. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <strong> !! (He started acting as a small child and quickly drove the movies back in the old days.) The camera came close to Loretta's face and eyes a few times, and gently, in many parts of the film. <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> Spencer has conveyed these lines naturally here which made it difficult to operate. <br /> <br /> Although minor roles, actors supporting Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell are 75-minute films. <br /> <br /> I was interested in Konnolly as the camp's father / father. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit far away, but hey - it's a movie. This story applies to two major Depression victims trying to live in a Hooverville camp, and this is a very touching fairy tale.
