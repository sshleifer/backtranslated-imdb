This definatley is one of the best stand-up shows. EVERYTHING. Eddie has been coming out of the wall I've been watching for this past five years, and she's always rolling. Everything from his vast physical comedy to the top of the scalp is the masterpiece. You need to look at this line apart from this line. "The word plant, you say erb and we call the plant, in which f ### ing h". Brilliant.
