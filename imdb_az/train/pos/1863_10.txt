ANTWONE FISHER is a story of the young emotionally troubled US Navy. Her problems lead her to the psychiatrist Jerome Davenport, who helps her understand her problems from her childhood upbringing. <br /> <br /> Get ready to shed a tear or two. The film might have melted the coldest heart. I liked one thing to turn from a very unpleasant thing to a positive end. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful film on forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner, Denzel Washington, has been instrumental in starting the directorship. There were many scenes that followed. They are the last (the dreams come true) the beginning of the story (a little boy's dreams are huge pancake eyes!) That connects the story to each other beautifully. <br /> <br /> Another beautiful scene is to find the answer to questions about the family of Dr. Antwone It was an incentive for the United States. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when the young son finally turned against his mother and reacted to it. Expensive. <br /> <br /> All actors represent their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to Washington's directorships, Washington has been awarded the Oscars and continues to succeed in its roles. <br /> <br /> There was a strong event in this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor, Derek Luke, showed why he was right for a part of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Chemistry it runs well between romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who plays the treacherous character of Mrs. Tate deserves a special mention. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The actress, <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
