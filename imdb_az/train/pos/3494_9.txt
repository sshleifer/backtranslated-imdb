For this, it is close to perfection as it can get the movie "Raising Victor Vargas". Only one genius of these lucky mixes clicked on any refugee auteur or everything (probably each one), their simple little language-city-life ethnic love first flick their minds so you can instantly read their depths with their minds. The film begins with a tremendous "street" taste, but the Latino family is focused on it and then focuses on a story about young people's uncertainty and their desire to love others. There have never been much work in my practice (tyros, novice director, etc.). Criticism is highly valued, but not for everyone, "Victor Vargas's Removal" is now recommended for lovers and realistically rich human tales. (A)
