I've read other reviews and found some to compare movies and real life (for example, what you need to get into a music school), Britney Bashing, and so on. Pay attention to the film and the message. <BR> <br /> I have rated this movie from 8 to 14 years old, from 10 to 7 years old. <br /> <br /> I love pop / rock music, I am 45 years old. I know Britney Spears, but in fact she really was strongly singing. loans and reviews this. <br /> <br /> <strong> "I myself did not even think about myself." Casting, lighting, manufacturer, director and so on. I'm not interested. What is the movie and what makes me entertain. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for a message. The world's largest epidemic is to show one's self down (this is another story). The film is light, bright and bright, and good for kids. I just started fade along the Texan twang movie and there are only a few ways to deliver / deliver delivery, of course, that can probably be predicted a little bit. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie, but for a block that watches itself, Hannibal.
