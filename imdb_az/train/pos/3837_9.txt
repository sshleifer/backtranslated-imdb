The films in the '40s, when referring to issues that were still unacceptable in the "polite" society, while referring to those who were giving knowledge to others, resorted to codes that most of the viewers were convinced of. Probably, no movie in the decade was loaded with innuendo, like a strange Dark Desert Fury, set in a small gambling oasis called Chuckawalla, in the California Desert. Mary Astor, the Princess of the Purple Sage and the casino's owner, is a smoker and smoker; $ 20 million in Technicolor, with several daughters Lizabeth Scott driving the city. Listen to the conversation between a younger Lesbian and his young, unwelcome friend (only the AI ​​Bezzerides's original text can surprise us with this link). Even more like his insanely jealous torpedo like the British John Hodiak gangster and Wendell Corey. Add Burt Lancaster as a city sheriff and go back. Both Lancaster falls for both (surprising) Hodiak Scott. However, it seems that Hodiak has just passed through Astor, but he had a wife who died in suspicious circumstances. The desert sun rises to these ingredients in a boiling source, with the ability to germinate and delicate combinations. If this happens, do not throw this green melody outdoors, full of creepy exotic flowers; this is a beautiful movie.
