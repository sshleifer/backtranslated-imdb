This movie is about me, family. Jimmy Morris was not alone, but also for his family. How can I tell you how my little girl will go to Kansas City to cover Pope Holmes and Kansas City presidents? Like Morris's son, he's the best thing. What is the dreams of living with the family? I can only judge what Jimmy Morris did with a close relationship with his family.
