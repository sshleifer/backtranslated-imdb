If this movie had come a little better, there would be the best Astaire and Rogers there. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie, but with a very tedious sublime, ie, Roberts Scott, Roger's sister's romance by Harriet Hilliard. <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two Denizli guys. Scott is first acquainted with Hilliard as a stereotypical librarian, and then Ginger Rogers surprises him after asking his comrade (a blonde, but unmistakable Lucille Ball). Meanwhile, Astaire is trying to get to the place where he and his old dance are gone. As a result, there are some beautiful dance numbers, such as the Astaire and the Rogers teams: "I put all my eggs in a basket", "Let's go" and "I would handle more bandwidth". Hilliard, a sweet, but a little letargic straight Jane turned into a glamor girl, though he reads two songs well, "But where are you?" and "Get Devil Behind Me" - a poster did not care about this song, but I love it very much. <br /> <br /> The purpose of the film is one of the most recent songs written by "Let's Play and Dance" and of course it ends. One of the most brilliantly performed by Rogers and Astaire. These epitomize the glamor and fantasies of the 30s. It's really worth gaining and re-watching.
