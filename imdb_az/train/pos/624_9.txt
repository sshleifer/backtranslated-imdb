The summer is packed with a very limited number of refugees and films, and I'm sorry to find a movie that I can sit and enjoy, just because of the disappointment of these comedies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> parts, small scenes with a small blood and a small blood), but it does not try to overcome excessive darkness or boundaries. Imagine a little more serious, a little magical Princess Bride and you will be near. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- I'm probably not as passionate about a movie like others ... Maybe once a month or twice, I feel active. I'm also a great Sci-Fi / Fantasy fan. <br /> <br /> By the end of August (August), I'll play back the recurring storylines and movies with faster than faster than you can count up to 10. I did not see Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust, but suffered a great deal of hits from expectations. <br /> <br /> My hopes were completely washed by the Transformers for my fantastic addiction, and Stardust's looks were attractive, but I was scared. <br /> <br /> Many here have surprised me. Here, I'm going to see another fantasy movie clip except for breakfast. Do not be fooled, most definitely a fairy tale and really witch, magic, and absolutely cunning to stop ... But the most inspiring thing I've ever seen, is that I've seen or read in the last 15 years and is a really good movie. <br /> (I sign a book this year, in contrast to 90% of permanently re-populated films, that Hollywood ideas can escape, and in two years, the film's other epic fantasy tales, LotR and the others loved, as NYT says so and there is nothing like that!)) <br /> <br /> Stardust did not want me to join my seat because of the strongest moves every time; dramatic tension, echoing across the theater with a high boom. I did not even use big sound bombs to draw attention to what happened on the screen (Transformers, look at me). It does not work to show the latest CGI methods, nor is it simple enough that I can imagine them in my 3rd class (I hate boys). <br /> <br /> I just watched it. He looked at my eyes and opened the refreshing CREATIVE storyline. Of course, I know what will happen in most of the film, but it will make you forget. <br /> <br /> Even for a few days, my heart has gone up to several parts, but the most important thing I've seen is that I feel better than when I left the theater. <br /> <br /> This is really a surprise. This summer, most likely, after many remakes and films that I did not follow my expectations, it looked like a cold sweet river tea that sat with others <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, but for yourself; Only time test (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, Dark Crystal, etc.) If you enjoy fantasy fantasy movies, you really need to see this movie. <br /> <br /> This little diamond is finding its way to hit the store in my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Simply beautiful.
