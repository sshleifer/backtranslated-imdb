Another pipeline to the South Park is nearing completion. That was not a strong episode I had hoped for, but the Night of the Nightless Homes was later the Stanley Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary, or Erection Day. <br /> <br /> The "Living Homeless Night" is only the mind of the zombie genre, which is thought to be just a South Park. . <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are locked at the Community Center, though this time on the roof. Investigate the scene. <br /> <br /> Along with this, four people set off to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> Besides, Randy left her home without choosing something else. The whole story behind the seizure of the homeless while trying to convey a message, but seriously thirsty. South Park is the best of times in a very ridiculous situation. Matt and Trey played this week safely and did not criticize the homeless problem, only lamp. <br /> <br /> The moment of the episode's shock comes when a scientist shot himself to escape from the homeless. In South Park, a suicide was wrong for the first time, and we tried to hit him a few times until he had missed the poor man's brain and then died painfully. Another inspirational South Park moment. <br /> <br /> Generally, the episode was funny, but she escaped from any real commentary about the homeless and was zombie rifle. The latter is somewhat funny, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait for the next episode party by the end of October. For a long time, however, we need to applaud for the work of South Park. Despite the end of the steam last season, the show is now full.
