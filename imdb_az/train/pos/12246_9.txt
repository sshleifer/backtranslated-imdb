When I started watching it, I realized I was watching a wrong product, and I was not surprised by the script written by Andrew Davis and by Sue Birtwhistle, both of which brought us the perfect 1995 humility and bias! So here's my only fault - Emma 3 or 4 or even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The digital player was very nice to me because Prunella is perfect as Miss Bates, but I love Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. Language is a delight to listen, can you imagine having the right to go to a person who truly promises you today and at the age of? Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith, actually cast as Pride and Prejudice. I loved it, I watched twice in two days! Thanks again to BBC for some quality TV. I saw the Paltrow version and this is good, but the BBC version is very high. I am very happy to be the owner of the DVD.
