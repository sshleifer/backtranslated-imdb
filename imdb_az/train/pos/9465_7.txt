Steve Carell once starred in a romantic film about choice, family, and pressure. By judging the essence and scope of the film, I was expecting a straightforward comedy, very funny and unrealistic elements, but I think it's wrong. There were some comedies in the film, but I felt a very dramatic drama for me and Steve Carell had a great performance. The film really solves true observations and was a strong element I found. However, the last one fled and felt unpredictable. The film was great, the cinematography was great, the player was great, and the message was open, but it is still very important. However, the old, straightforward and predictable ends. At the end of the film, it would be a good introduction if different choices (probably bad, even) were made. Still an entertaining movie.
