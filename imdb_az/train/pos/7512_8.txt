First, I've heard great things about this movie, at least in the retro / vintage scene and the Bettye page who love the socks who love it and did not dream. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Firstly, network aggression has occurred, then, first attempts to develop an actor's career, and then chic images Irving, although first of all, has taken pictures of the camera club, and then Klaws, Paula, and Baghdad and fetish photos, Irving appears to be extremely pleasant and friendly. If only modern pornography developers look like this, perhaps better porn outcomes! The film is largely a diatribe against pornography, but it is an attempt to show the current environment for women who produce fetish and naked images in the 1950s. This environment was extremely stressful, maybe it was a good way, because it shows that when it comes to pornography today, there is no saturation effect. And it turned out to be very tough. It looks like someone who loves the job and does not seem to be broken by him. Many of his photographs have been photographed and adorned with photos that are astonishing and compared with a funny appearance as seen in "Initiative style" films. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (pbuh) said: "Believers, faith in God and Jesus never diminishes, even insists that God has been given a" gift "in order to 'do this' even when he is bound and caressed." When I see this movie, I find the page about its humility, beliefs and behavior, I'm more aware of the feeling of fear than the clone blonds of a person who is in our day and says, "Life after porn".
