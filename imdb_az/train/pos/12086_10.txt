A wonderful family drama / comedy starring MacClaine and Garr, whenever I see it, enthralls and warms your heart. It is recommended at all ages, from 9 years old to old age. Beautiful epoch of 1962 The story is Harry, his two children and his wife Zena (MacClaine). The "family" leads the West to take over the long-forgotten brothership of the West, and at the end of the 1940s Garr runs to the cafe on the runway. Sweet but intense mix, like a mother, turns the whole family into a restoration and opening of the caf√©. But wait ...... Aunt Zena is an old circus performer with card tips, magic powders and a gentle look ...... she loves children and is unhappy and sometimes dangerous ... .. What happens next, The delightful combination of the Cuban missile crisis (with the original television news from a true event) and a "ghost Lord" song with a completely ghosted song. This film is filled with fear of Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, gives a sense of fears, philosophy, and questions of piety. Finally, a miracle of faith, family, and rediscovered love remain. Oh, and music of the early 60s era is just great! <br /> <br /> GOOD MOVIE SUGGESTED OFFERED 10 10
