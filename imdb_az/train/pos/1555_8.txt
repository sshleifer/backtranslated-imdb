At noon, after seeing the incredibly indifferent WW1 spy trilogue, Madam Lili (1969), who played the lead role on Julie Andrews on television, suddenly I saw a WW1 spy trilogy. I was reminded that it was developed by Dino De Laurentis. Only a Fraulein Doctor searched the IMDB for a short search. The memories were back when I knew the title. It is a well-prepared story that, in the past, reverted to true events such as Kitchener and German attacks in 1918. And there is a more credible woman spy than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first and most powerful memory was well-prepared combat scenes and men's and horses in gas masks. If you are interested in war movies, especially in WW1, it's a worthwhile movie to see if you have this opportunity.
