This is a real eye candy. The world of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Our preferred method of attack is the great monsters who chase the chairs in their opponents ... Who can resist? Ancient prophecy, a lovely bride who is looking for heroes and heroes of old heroes ... is familiar? Yes, we heard it at the beginning of the song. But when you look at a magnificent scene you forget. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch while the movie goes on. <br /> <br /> <strong> You may want to add some more stories after the movie is released. <br /> <br /> What is behind the 30-year-old circle? What did the knight's craze go on? Who built these magnificent monuments, fortresses and cities ... and why did they leave one another? And apart from a pair of farmers, what are people? Indeed, this picture looks very interesting, but not the Lord of the Rings.
