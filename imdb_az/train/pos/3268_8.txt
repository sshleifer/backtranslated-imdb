A charming romantic comedy. The area is a bit complicated - I tried to summarize three times and I can not. It is enough to say that we have to see. The movie is funny, beautiful - the plot is completely non-realistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is very nice and everything looks great - it creates a sweet, romantic feel throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The actor is very good - enjoys all kinds of Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepherd. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are good but good. Well, if you're a sucker for sweet emotional movies (like me), keep it. And Downey looks great in her dress! Additional bonuses - a title song by Johnny Mathis and another great song called "All After", featured by Cher and Peter Cetera.
