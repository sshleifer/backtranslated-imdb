Perhaps you have 10 ... for a 2 1/2 star movie you've been asking for, and maybe this will be more meaningful ... Hitchcock did not mix the scenes in a better place ... The movie is a film that covers scenes from the very beginning When you work with many characters trying to develop, sometimes you can not get this scattered feeling. You feel that the heroes show something unusual about themselves, and then they will not betray you. Screenwriter / Producer Phil Hay mixes his life with a completely new soundtrack, thinking more about the same subject than the film's 6 degrees of life ... I'm looking for something better than this producer.
