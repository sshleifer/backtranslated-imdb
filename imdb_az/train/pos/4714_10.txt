The owner of the nightclub, Roman Maroni, said that the whole film is a "lousy fungus" that irritates the English language rather than the rival Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> Finding another underrated classic daytime matin√©es or "Late Delay Late Show", Johnny Dangerously is terrific about a good hearted boy who lives a secret criminal life to help his mother pay for medical care and put him through his brother's law school is a satirical hit. yes <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr. <br /> <br /> There are so many laughs to put here. As an airplane, you need to pay attention or miss something. Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two!
