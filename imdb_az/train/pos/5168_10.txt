I'm a sucker for movies like this. Movies that pull you back and leave your child free. I have grown up now and have plenty of responsibility as a mortgage, a child, a dog, a wife, and a part of others. I am very glad of my life, but as I was about twelve years, it's not innocent and careless. Mike Binder's Indian Writing knows it and investigates it as it is twelve years old. Life brings you back at a time when you are more simple and more entertaining. This will bring back anxiety about your first kiss and a time when you are interested in whether the camp marathon ends. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Hindi writing is a fantastic movie and at least once you have to watch once again to sit back and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> The film's stars are Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (a few names), as their childhood friend, called back to Camp Tamakwa by their former Chief Camp Advisor, Amcle Lou. Lou Uncle is well-run by Alan Arkin. He is a patriarch of the band. He is a person who knows everything and understands the true spirit of a father figure and understands simple things in life. When it comes to a great beauty like Tamakwa, there are hard times about today's children. It is a camp, which travels through the camp, turns colors that God gives them, and gives them water until they look. Uncle Lou is fresh for the old days and recalls his old camps to see if any of them will capture the camp. <br /> <br /> As we have seen above, though they are together, they are experiencing their trials and hardships, and maybe new love can arise among them. <br /> <br /> When the elder returned to the camp, the children again played again with a typical camp game. Toilet paper puts scabs, toothpaste, sleeping bags and so on. <br /> <br /> <strong> All of these with actors like Pollak and Paxton are fraudulent. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising, however, that we have to deal with a lot of realistic emotions that can have a relationship with everyone. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollock and Elizabeth Perkins are looking at a boy who is used to as a child. Pollak can not be as small as it can be, and Perkins says that the Gulf is not smaller, it's just bigger. It's not coming home, but it's fine. We are all growing up, we are all moving together and unfortunately, unfortunately, we can not live as we did 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The " There are many touchscreen scenes, and there are many hilarious ones. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything about it and this is a real secret. <br /> <br /> 10/10
