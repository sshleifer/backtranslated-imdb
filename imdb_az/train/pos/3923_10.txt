This is a wonderful film from a unique film, which is about the incredible energy of the frenet flamenco dance, as well as the story of the moviemakers with the story of the scene production. Spellbinding is the only word that can be used to describe the experience. This is not the usual standard of "Bizetin Carmen". It is not a usual movie of any standard. Every discomfort, every lane of the foot, and every piece of music look like one another so you can take your eyes off the screen. Opera or flamenco (I'm not), you do not need to be attracted, attracted, attracted by this movie. Thin and direct; high and still; One of the best films is a kind of movie, if it's so small.
