This artisan Lynch is a puzzle for many of the crowd. They are trying to write Lynch as a trivial, raw, side-by-side project. At the same time, Lynch holds gas among the real works of film art. <br /> <br /> <strong> Dumbland is an art that goes beyond this art. What can you do with the aspects of modern life, but laugh? If you take it seriously, you'll be nuts. You closed it, smoked it, tasted it, felt agony, senseless fools, and then expressed it in any environment you chose. Art called art, art is not dumb. But this is Dumbland.
