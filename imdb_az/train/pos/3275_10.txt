When I was 10, I saw this movie for the first time. Unfortunately, it was late in the night and could not watch it until the end. <br /> <br /> This is not really an ordinary horror movie. There are some horror elements, but I classify it as a fantasy. I liked it, but I was hoping for a bit more horror and scary scenes. When Anna's father comes to the newspaper trying to kill him, the scene is a little short. <br /> <br /> Now on the plot. This movie is about a young girl named Anna who is ill. He must be sleeping in his bed, even though he is sick, because he turns to complete a painting of a home where he is less - a paper house. When he comes to sleep in a strange moment, he finds himself in a large green area near the house. She knows that she is perfectly fit for the house, and every new detail appears in her dreams. One day, a boy takes home to talk to someone. He does not forget to pull his feet (because he is sitting behind a window), the boy can not go. Then he knows that a boy also has this strange illness, and that the boy he is dealing with has his ill-gotten dreams. He also sees that it is more difficult and harder to wake up from his dreams. If he misses his father abroad, he will take his father home. He is mistaken and his father is very angry with art. He tries to rubber him, but he understands that something that has already been raised can not change. And when it comes to sleep the next time horror begins. His father is naked and cordoned (because it is marked as "unreliable" at his head) and is trying to get into the newspaper and kill Anna and his friend. His dreams became a terrible nightmare. Anna can finally wake up to escape and kill her father. Anna finds himself in a hospital where her parents are next to their bed. Doctors thought they were in a coma. Anna says the other boy died and wants to go to the ocean to overcome these tragic events. Anna draws a splendid tower, and the same corner tower can be found near the hotel they are traveling to. He runs to the tower of protection and gets acquainted with the boy (I just do not remember because I do not remember and do not want to go back to the previous html page) and I can tell him kindness and forget about these horrible desires forever. There are a few things I do not understand in the film. First and foremost, I was the last to absolutely dislike. When the main part of the film is a little short, I think it's too long. Like a boy, a boy flies a helicopter and talks with Anna? Why would you have put it on a wall of a stupid radio? I hated that scene, it was very indifferent to me. <br /> <br /> <strong> This is a horrible scene. </ P> <p> I like the boy. The actor was awesome. Better than Anna. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> I'll give it to 8.
