When I first saw it around Easter in 1993/4, I did not even think much about it, and last summer I started getting this DVD on Michael Jackson (I first liked his music), and I'm very glad I am old. It's a good movie, but it's not a classic movie like Sound Of Music, West Side Story, and Oz Wizard. Michael Jackson was as good as an actor and was the other player members. There were some anxious scenes such as the collision by the gangster Frankie Lide, played by Joe Pesci as the little Katie. When Michael was younger, the scene I was scared was a robot. My favorite song was Smooth Criminal, which I think was better than Thriller.
