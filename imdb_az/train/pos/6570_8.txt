This movie is a fun-running entertainment. There was nothing in the recent Tomb Raider movie. It is not possible to wait for the DVD to get. People can think this down and still do not go to the Titanic and see an innocent conscience they do not know. Anything in Karen Kopins and his underwear should reach an extra point or two degrees!
