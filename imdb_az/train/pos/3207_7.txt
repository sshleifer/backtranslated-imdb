Of course, according to any normal movie criticism, Soldier is really a very bad film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is a superhuman soldier killed since birth, <br /> <br /> Abandoned on an evil planet, he is friendly with a community of naff space hippies, who teaches gardening, family life, and health and breastfeeding. Wolf does not speak too much. Finally, when the real super soldiers fled and missed them, they killed and killed the hippie. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. Okay, okay. The last one. <br /> <br /> If the Academy does not start a new category for the "Best Explosion", the Soldier will not be able to win any award. However, as ridiculous, it remains a pleasant experience. Military equipment does not disappear from Aliens (especially APC) and 90 minutes later.
