Young Victoria is a beautiful movie and presented Queen Victoria with a different light about everyone. Movies show Queen Victoria's "I'm not fun" impression that she is a happy young woman. <br /> <br /> As I love the history, especially the history of Victoria, I can imagine the first reaction I've seen in this movie ad, I am very excited and count the days until it comes to the cinemas. I was a little worried that it would not be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria was one of the greatest rulers of all time, with a lot of light, and this movie draws a picture with her. what is the true personality and life. He was being treated badly by Sir John Conroy, whom he wanted to resign. It was inspired by Victoria to be a fantastic Queen! The romanticism between him and Albert was so deep, and it was also very good by the brilliant Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend! Young Victoria feels a heart love story, but at the same time a great deal of great part of English history ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
