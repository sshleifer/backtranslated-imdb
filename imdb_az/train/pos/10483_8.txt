Yes, this movie is projected and is not necessarily a prize. But then it does not try to be something he does not have. A fun funny liner made by Peter O'Toole, an entertaining full of fun and very funny performance for Joan Plowright's groundwork and fall. The band's performance was in place, each playing a comic role. The music was good, though it was good, but it was a great way to fill the movie. According to some of the negative thoughts, some of the humor has passed on to their heads. A good example is a comment about a "strange baseball game", but my dear American was a cricket - it was funny for those who knew the cricket because the baseball was being won and an ignorant US team. Also, when Carl broke a window, you did not say anything; Lord Foxine, "oh yes!" what were they saying? earning more money for breaking, and the manager also said "oh no" to money. Certainly, every genius needs to be explained to some people ... All of this I liked and was a great laugh! It's worth seeing.
