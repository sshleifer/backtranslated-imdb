How frustrated is how my friends and only our films, and especially how romantic comedies are. <br /> <br /> Not all are good, except for a few bright spots as in this movie. The actors of the big name do not have a big budget, I hire a Hollywood Video, and I believe there is no big bulletin, the biggest budget romantic comedy is that nothing happened. <br /> <br /> But this was a major disadvantage. Among the interests of love there was a great chemistry between Parker (Jonathan Schaech) and Sam (Alison Eastwood). Their love story was compelled by a large number of us. The director took the time to recognize these characters really. Their story reminded me of one of my favorite "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> Supporters have added not only funny comic moments but also depth of story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely priceless. Samin was gay-friendly hysterical. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
