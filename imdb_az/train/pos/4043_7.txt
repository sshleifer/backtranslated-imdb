Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very entertaining SCI-FI movie from Japan. I saw cinemas that Versus had for many years in desperation and liked the director's debut feature or the third film, Azumi. I've heard that swords and zombies and all kind of good blood are cooled films. Obviously, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I was a good thing with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for wallpapers to end, Alive is not your choice. There are many moves, but it comes as a pay-per-hour charge. Of course, many areas are as meaningless as some SCI-Fi movie, and I think the subtitles used by an external object can be replaced by parasites for more impact. <br /> <br /> I hope this is part of the film. <br /> <br /> In some cases, however, the film does not suffer. A bonus for this movie is gothic imaginations that are made with great artistic flaws during many Flashbacks and sleep sequences. <br /> <br /> This rental!
