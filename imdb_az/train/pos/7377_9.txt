it is not practical to describe this film. alternate title "Do not look" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese movies, the story is not as straightforward as America. The story is packed around a director who draws a story out of ww2. One of the actresses (?) Who died in the filming of a television show in the 1960s is the ONLU who sees this show. If you see Rings (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and I liked you, you would be a dream actress. I loved the actress more than the ring. a movie that is really scary and disturbed. a 10!
