Three Stooges are always one of my favorite actors. I love each one of their shorts. I love all six of all Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All of the shorts are funny and many other great actors and actresses from the stars, many of whom have many other shots! In my opinion, Three Stooges is one of the biggest players and the most funny comedy team! <br /> <br /> This is a good three Stooges short. It's funny and includes casting Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. Stooges acted very well in this short time! I recommend this!
