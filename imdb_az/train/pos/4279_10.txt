Years ago, I was lucky I had seen this gem at a Gypsy Film Festival in Santa Monica. As you know, it will not be rosie and it will strike the tragedy, but actually travels, characters and their dynamics, and all of them adapt to Yugoslavia. I'm not a Yugonostalji and even though I have to move away from my current production of "Yugoslavia" ("Ademir Kenovic to Kustarica in the late 1990s"), I still have the chance to resemble this movie. my celluloid shines in my memories. 15 years ago "Did I hear the theme of the" Gypsies "on the title 15 years ago" since I've been there "? "I'm tormented, it was born of me" and the comedies and melodies were funny and sad, but late, great actor Pavle Vujisic (the "Baba Zaman" case stopped from the Museum) was as memorable as a bus driver.
