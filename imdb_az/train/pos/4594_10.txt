The best martial arts film ever made. This movie is nothing better than Bruce Lee. A classic, full of fun and puzzling peaks. Jackie Chan is the real king of martial arts and kung fu. Bruce Lee is a great pity, but Jackie Chan's eternity is so great to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie Rules !!!!
