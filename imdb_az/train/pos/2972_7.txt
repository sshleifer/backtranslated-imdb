I have to admit that I'm a great fan of the South Park, and I was expecting basketball to be funny, but it was as good as near anywhere! In my opinion, this happens when David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker are together. This movie has a replay value and does not take seriously anywhere. Smooth stick style, combined with Stone and Parker, works perfectly in humor. The type of humor in the basketball did not become popular with this release, and said it would be a hit if it came out today. Do not try to be critical, just leave your brain in the door and wait for endless laughter. It is recommended to everyone with a good sense of humor.
