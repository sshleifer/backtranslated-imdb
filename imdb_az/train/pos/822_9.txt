The latest film of Lucas' saga is a luxurious, magnificent look. Often the original trilogy is considered an ugly ducklings, but I think it is the upper part of the IV episode (and only one niche under the III and V episodes). In fact, in my opinion, this is the third best film in the 6th category. It's still a great fun movie when I'm upset. This is not a movie that has a start, uplifting and ending; the film's mechanism works only for one purpose: the connection to Lucas's universe. There is a sense of end to everything, which makes the film very emotional, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it's very funny. New symbols are presented and older people face new, unexpected problems. C3PO and R2D2 (as usual) provide great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duet, and Luke is still a great character to identify. Still, the inner deficiency of Luka (and Vader) is that the saga gives his backbone. Lucas's aggressive ideas are still very clear and the film's loyalty, hope, and purchasing themes have a strong resonance. I am happy that Lucas finally thinks of preparing the VII, VIII and IX episodes because this is a great book for a long, interesting and charming epic. It is not a perfect movie, but the best matin√©e style fun.
