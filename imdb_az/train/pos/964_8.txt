"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film prepared by Takashi Miike, but it's a bit dark and scary for young people, as you may expect. <br /> <br /> But great guys can eat it well, if you play in English <br /> <br /> The story has moved to the country with her mother after her divorce with her father. During a village festival, the boy is selected as a great honor "Cyrus Rider", but that honor, of course, creates much danger and adventure. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the evil deed is a woman's white skirt, go-go boots and a faded hairstyle, badly disappearing groups, hacking people, and removing items against them. This scum Rage itself has shown itself as a city flying in the form of a monster leading to the city of Tokyo. There are two destructors on one of the most funny scenes watching the monster's flight over the city ... one says: "Oh, that's just Gamera". <br /> <br /> The young boy was probably a friend of Jacob, a kind of monsters who had escaped from the people, and all Yokai in Japan fought against evil. In many ways, Miike and crew dropped the late 60's / 60's Yokai films and turned me into a modern action adventure movie for aging guys combining some weird mechanical monsters that brought me to the "Transformers". The movie has great looks and feelings, the effect is entertaining, and some humor goes right over the heads of the children, but the elderly can still do it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> As for adults, you are an admirer of Japanese monsters, if you do not want to be very much loved. <br /> <br /> But maybe only Miike ... and what a wild fellow. 10 to 8.
