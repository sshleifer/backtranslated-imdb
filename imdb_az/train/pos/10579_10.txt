The energetic young producers of theater producers (mostly dramatized performances, mostly music) in the past, have to deal with entertaining competition, fraudsters, loyal fans, and amateur talents to realize her dream of dreaming FOOTLIGHT PARADE. <br /> <br /> If one of the other Warner musicians is closely related to the magnificent music, especially GOLDDIGGER, this movie has no other charm: Jimmy Cagney. He is a miracle, looks like one another, and is as agile as everything else - in fact, it is a living being that is somewhat of a mimic. <br /> <br /> Cagney draws the attention of the viewers and never goes away, boosts fast fire dialogue and carnivorous plotting and strengthens the treacherous charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the castle is doing its best. Joan Blondell is perfect as clever, great-hearted blonde secretary who packed with Cagney (keyword - why did not he have the music number?). Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler play once more fans and off; his reading and acting skills are somewhat compensated for his dance; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert is very entertaining, as he is planning to deceive Cagney in various sources. Ruth Donnelly considers Kibbee's wealthy wife as a woman dedicated to her beautiful prosthesis. Frank McHugh's mixed choreographer Cagney's mind is a foil. Herman Bing is hilarious in his small scene as a music arranger. Mavens, Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin, and possibly even John Garfield's musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Busey Berkeley, who is not a costume maker. The sweaty sweets that were scattered until the end of the 1930s were a great example of the kinematic runaway they wanted to enjoy from Depression audiences. A great joke about Berkeley's creativity, of course, meant to be a scene production, as part of the field. However, no theater master could ever save these products. <br /> <br /> Berkeley's musical suggestions have generally described two different approaches - one song (very bizarre) in song and dance; or stunning geometric numbers, candy candy, abundant choir girls, up-camera shows and a romantic melody. In a spasm of extraordinary password, FOOTLIGHT PARADE, with three Berkeley essays: Honeymoon Hotel and a Pre-Production Code on several Wedding Evening; "With a Waterfall" - women with dazzling, floating and diving in perfect designs and designs (see how they are closely linked and how they get synchronous effects); and ultimately, Shanghai Lil, a respect for Cagney & Berkeley's talents.
