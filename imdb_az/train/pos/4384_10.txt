SPECIAL FEATURES! This film is for people who will FILM! <br /> <br /> The rebels touched a lot on the subject of "honor" in the film and compared with the "Braveheart". <br /> <br /> I'm going to point out a few things about this movie that I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely different. The first character to stay pregnant is the girlfriend of a man (Roth) and a cold abortion, suggesting it is too late. The shame of his condition ("I have a bastard whisper") is then taken to the scene more suicidal. After the rape character of the second character Roth (and at least one sex scene with her husband Rob) to find herself, Mary is the wife of Rob. Rob, as he left for a final confrontation with Roth, in the subsequent film, Mary asks what should be done about the pregnancy of suspicious origin with a tinting tone. Rob responds in a noble tone, "this is not the fault of a child" and then says that he thinks what his name is, girl or boy. I think this hero's "pro-life" position is very un-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Roth's character is a bastard, someone who does not know who his father is, goes to the brilliant corner of the house to make that comment. <br /> <br /> There are very few good words for her mother, though she is taking a picture of her neck hanging. It is coincidence that Roth is a definition of psychopaths, Rob is a strong husband / father and, of course, hero. In the last sword struggle between Rob and the Abuse (Roth), old slices are deeply on the chest - on the left side of the navel, on the heart. <br /> <br /> Her employer and her loyal father (John Hurt's character) keeps his mother's shape and looks at him before the dead Roth's neck. <br /> <br /> The direction of the aggression area is quite non-timid and beyond the camera. I found it a bit surprising to see Mary's character and the subsequent traumatic stress (as we now say) with the character of one who has passed Mary's difficulty. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, aggression is not sensational or intended, and I find an interesting midpoint for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the final battle scene I have to make the previous commenter: Roth chose a rapier (or maybe a short sword), Claymore, who chose Rob Rob. One really did the homework assignment in all of this area. Roth would have been in such a position, but Claymore is certainly a weapon of Scotland. What is even more striking for me is that this latest sword fight is one of the most convincing of any movie: Actors are actually trying to kill each other - The opponents we have seen in most film shootings (including cinematography) not the usual sticks against the knife. More precisely, Roth appears to be using the rapier, a few times the weapon, this is the purpose of the design! (The rapiers were an outsider of the edges, but first of all, on the contrary, used to make the opponents flippant.) This design intent is because Rob uses Claymore's wide badges. The war brings me down as I expect - Roth is gaining momentum. <br /> <br /> If Rob Roth's gun (more symbolism) and hit by a powerful red scarf, Rob is ignoring the historic accuracy of a sword fight. <br /> <br /> I will also note that in 1995 (free year), it is clear that for some reason the US government was unreliable. Hollywood also blocked it with the release of "Rob Roy" and "Powerful", and I think it's both a comparison of these films and anti-government accusations. <br /> <br /> I was tired of the old and secret messages coming from Hollywood on the different perspective of this movie.
