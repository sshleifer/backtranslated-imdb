This exciting music has more than its own star, esotism, and the music genius of the prince. <div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> A drama to add a dimension to the music numbers There is a sign. Although this movie is a good example of up to 8 miles, it's no less entertaining and the sound program is better. The dramatic side of excitement centers around a spotlight on a regular artist and a club around a kid around Kid (Prince). The owner of the club is frustrated with Kid's pride and Kid knows that he will soon be dismissed and will be replaced by an opponent. Kid's parents, on the other hand, are worried by their father's violent abuse. During the film's course, Kid learns a few lessons in life and more and more friends. Of course, what we see in the history of old drama is everything, but it is combined as a musical, very stylized music. <br /> <br /> Players are good. The princess is dramatically good, she is not pretty. It looks human and relative. Clarence Williams is as good as a father who insults him. Appollonia Kotero is a good debut as the interest of Princes sex interest. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the movie is an outstanding soundtrack. Musical numbers are staged and excited. The prince is undoubtedly very eccentric, though it is a music maestro. When he inspires, he is great, but often on the flip side he often sings songs for his taste, and sometimes his experience loses, but it is the same for many music geniuses. Although it is a sounds for the movie, it is only a weak point in Sexshooter. Although Purple Rain's show-end performance is in sight. This is my favorite song of all time. *** <br />
