Amazing! Wow! Recently, I've seen poorly-funded low-budget movies, but that's great. A very realistic view of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong difference from other crime movies and series. I liked the absolute rejection of the main actress and any spread clich√© on the police. This film is just as a document and fun as a drama. Perfect trade!
