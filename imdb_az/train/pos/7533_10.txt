When I was in WB, I liked this series, I saw the original show ending in 1995, and I do not believe a Batman extinguished when this show came out in 1997. First of all, Robin solves the murders. This is an interesting perspective for the relationship. I liked the addition of Tim Drake's series, and once again this happiness, this show was great story lines, great animation (better original), fantastic soundwork and, of course, bright text. The only thing I did not like was when it was in the United States that often had episodes under a 15-minute story. I wish some episodes would be longer. My favorite episode of any Batman animated film comes to this series and it is called "Edge", if it is not good in my opinion, "Ice of Heart" and "Robin account". In general, with this beautiful show, Superman, this show was very happy with my childhood.
