Six degrees closed me. I was expecting in the future, and the trees in the trees were completely disappointed when they changed the place. I thought it was only solved and would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised. We can associate with real-life symbols. We talked about each episode and had the characters we love. I did not like anyone at the show and it was felt that the player was outstanding. It's probably like seeing the guide programs in cities that can identify local areas. I want to challenge a cancellation for a show and I ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give a good time, do not move from now on and advertise it so that people can know it.
