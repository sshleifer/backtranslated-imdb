I am very excited when Japanese singers have filmed Gackt and Hyde as a great admirer and have come to see my mission in life. I'm not disappointed. In fact, this movie was more than my expectations. I know that Gackt and Hyde are not only actors, but also singers, but I was prepared to do brave but not fulfilling performances, but both of them captured me and believed that the story was going on. Moon Child has just the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. I can not say that I'm crying more often in a movie, and this is more like a moment when it comes to couples, and in my opinion, their ability to act as an actor. Struggle scenes are absolutely stunning, and it's quick to get in touch with the characters, even though there are a few minutes of uncertainty to get started. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, especially to Gackt and Hyde.
