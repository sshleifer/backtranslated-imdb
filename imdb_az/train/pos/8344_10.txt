This is one of my favorites all the time. It's simple and sweet - it's definitely a chick romantic comedy. I love a movie with very good quotes and it looks like ... Albert Einstein commented on Ed Walters, "Do you think I'm thinking?" And Ed says, "What is the probability of what is happening now?" In my opinion, if you can watch it again and enjoy the same amount of time, the movie is so fantastic and with it! I liked Einstein's description more than Walter Ms's way. I think all the characters are in a really good place and the story runs smoothly. I often smile myself along with the movie, and when I look at it, I find myself referring to the lines I love! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and who has a good romance comedy now and then feeling!
