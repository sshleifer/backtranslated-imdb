My family returned to New Orleans at the end of the 1600's in the late 1700's and watched the movie I knew was my mother's never talking. My brothers and sisters are obviously black and white, African Americans and others. It's a difficult date to watch when your family is talking and Cane River is part of the whole history. It wants me to cry and it forces me to hit the "donkey" of my great ancestors who have planting plantations, and my great grandmother of the African heritage is surprised how they live under pressure and still aristocratic ... And at the same time I did not go out of history, maybe today's fair I am a successful woman who successfully lives in an integrated world. The actor was both excellent and fair, depending on the actor, but this is a necessary movie. Anne Rice is incredible, and I ask myself, why the "symbolic" writes about my family and I am not. I recommend this movie to anyone. Leza
