99% of this time is a good movie. <br /> <br /> I feel that this movie has ended with approval. <br /> <br /> This is a ghostly one. <br /> <br /> This is clearly done in order to create a feeling of a cold in filming. Because of this technique, the insulation will soon become apparent. <br /> <br /> Terrible characters move very well and in particular called 'nutcase' Joe. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film starts slowly (also). naive camera work "B") and it's very normal, but you'll soon feel the roughness that comes up. One of the most 'twisted' films on cold-blooded violence. <br /> <br /> After the sad and incredible lamentation, I was disappointed. If the film is suitable for the rest of the film, you would give it to 9, but it's only 7 in the movie before the "eeriness" and the nail-irritation scenes. /> <br /> Give a watch and forgive what is going on!
