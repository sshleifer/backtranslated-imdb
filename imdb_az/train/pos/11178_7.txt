PEOPLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Small Stephen King downs the shock. Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby's good performances are still perfect, even if they were a mystical storytelling to fight. Rachel's deadly brother's old Micmac graveyard and Jacob-Marley-a Victor Pascow actually did not come together to each other, and the film was mixed and overwhelmed. But a few horror movies are really perfect, and this is the absence of other shocking situations. "Pet Sematari" can actually be one of the most horrible horror movies in the last warranty, its deadly zombie baby and Zelda's insanely unmanageable appearance. It is politically wrong, it's sincere, it's disrespect - it's still safe to do "terrible movies". Add the best performances of Fred Guinea and one of the witty directions of Mary Lambert and you'll also have a very strange scary movie when the hockey ends. It is highly recommended for admirers. From 10 to 7.5.
