A very good movie. A classic fantasy movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a large number of foreigners. We see the leaders of the reformist Union and most of the emperor's forces. The Emperor is somewhat original. I liked the Ewoks which represented some of the valleys and Vietnam. (Perfect references) is the best saga of duel between Vader and Luca. The epilogue of the first trilogy over the return of Jedi is over, and the empire has finally fallen. I also appreciated the victory of Vader and the victory of Anakin Skywalker, along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. Gives sadness and tears. The biggest scenes of Star Wars are among this movie: when Vader becomes an Emperor. Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father (see 1997 version Hayden Christensen) find comfort. The next best scene is to go back to Darth Vader to protect Luke. Despite a good end, this film has a deep darkness. I felt it was more than just meeting the eye. As always, John William will bring classic music into the Star Wars universe.
