Ghost Train is a fun and entertaining movie for the best English comedians of the 1930's and 40's. Comicist Artur Askey's antiques are not as funny as they once were, but they can overcome it as part of a period or interest. <br /> <br /> For low-end warfare, the Ghost Train provides an atmosphere-effective, effective and some original decline. Dark (and yes, stormy) is very entertaining for the night. Relax, take the critic's hat and enjoy it.
