I watched this movie a few years ago with television and saw this movie when I took my assignment. I thought it was very good. Not all movies are good, but good enough. The film has a lot of talent to inspire many people, especially small children. The player was good, Danny Glover became a boat leader. The field line is not very convincing, but the script was written well. This movie can also be of interest to fans of the baseball fans. It is not applied directly to one action-packed sports film. Directly to a beautiful movie you can watch with your family and learn some of the information hidden in this movie. Generally, the movie was good, but not good. I give this movie 7/10.
