The 14-year-old guys inside me are very happy to be able to make really good-looking fantasy films and think of how angry they are with the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Narnia's Chronicles. Cash in the cash register. This year (and have already seen it) you will see a few more, especially the Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've ever seen. Based on Neil Gaiman's novel, Stardust showed less than one review in theaters this week. There were no previews for that, just a few ads. Critical reactions are something like that. When I did not have to wait for a friend to see Bourne Ultimatum, I did not see anything else interesting this weekend. If you forgive a terrible paw, the stars should be correctly formed, because I went to see Stardust and loved it. It's not a big movie like the Lord of the Rings. The field line is your ultimate fantasy quest (hero decides to search for a star, full of obstacles). But in this basic context, the story is vivid and creative. It just wants to be a little fun and attractive little romance. And that's a great success. There were many great movies this summer, but none of them had a bit of fun. It goes a long way, but the story is good and almost entirely related. It's not a masterpiece, but definitely the same thing as The Princess Bride has the same place (although I do not like the previous movie as much). If you were a fan of the genre, here's a lot of fun.
