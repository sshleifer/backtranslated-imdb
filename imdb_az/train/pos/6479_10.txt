This is, first of all, a fantastic set. This is very nice and very interesting. As a great II World War, I have learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things to do is compare with former people when relatively fresh in the war. Today's programs are nothing against the men you interviewed, but most of these people have not really participated in the events that have happened in the future. One of the best parts is provided by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn from the Second World War, but I really think that only those who have died (like me) want to buy or watch more than once. Only one real complaint about this series is that certain truths are no longer accurate. In particular, the information on the Soviet Union has been exaggerated or justified in places. Now this information is different now that the USSR collapsed. In general, during the Second World War and a WWII historian must have a serious look like a professional or personal.
