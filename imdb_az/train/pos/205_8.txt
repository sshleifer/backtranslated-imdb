Firstly, one explanation: In spite of my title I would only give this movie 8 stars because it is not one of the best films. All criticisms mentioned here are valid. Also, be aware of using the script you really need to evaluate Neil Simon's brightness by actually finding the mind within the human jokes. He has a different New York ears, especially for dry, Jewish, loving, gentle, especially dry, Jewish, and love-like, and if you have a problem of adulthood as an expression of love, you may have trouble accepting the optimism in your heart. <br /> <br /> Much to warn. Here's my main point: Walter Matthau is perfect in this movie, even perfectly straightforward. I have never been disappointed with it, or I have not seen it much more - at the same time it shows us our inadequate relationship, despite the fact that Big Star refuses to show himself, or whether its consistency declines. , it also shows us a person who is more sensitive, perhaps with a fear of heart failure. And it simply shows us a loyal part - it's just enough to reach you if you're struggling with the frustration of your fathers or man (I would like to note it as a warning), but it is only artificially enough that this character ways to give you the most rooted roots in any movie. This is the method of operation - Matthau's performance is as delicate as a delicate taste of character work and funny delivery. <br /> <br /> Richard Benjamin: I personally worry about his work in general, and his work is no exception, though there are wonderful moments here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ STRONG> </ s Nest "to be counterproductive. It was a murderous year for the lead actor; if there were separate Oscars for comedy and drama, then the best actor Oscar was going to "Dog Day Afternoon" for Al Pacino and Walter Matthau for "The Sunshine Boys" - I think Jack McMurphy, but Pacino and Matthau Nicholson I think it is a relatively more masterful and astounding, effective and conscious legend. Also, I believe that Burns was an actor who supported Oscar for the very good reasons for his performance - it was good in this movie, but not good. (Burns is a nice show, but to show that Brad Dourif's really glorious debut in the "Kukuoyun NeÅŸti" to show a unique-self, because Chris Sarandon's "Dog Day Day") <br /> <br /> Aside from the theory of Oscar, I look at it downstairs: If you want Matthau's funny actress, then watch this movie, and her genius inspirations and gestures inspired by her beautiful grandmother, facial expressions, and unwanted edges. (Be aware, however, that when you are experiencing the pain of an elderly person, it is a very painful situation for this movie to be a comic relief you need or to watch the truth.)
