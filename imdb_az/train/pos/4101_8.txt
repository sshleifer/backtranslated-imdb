Like me, if your films are unique and unlike most other films, I strongly advise you to check Beast. The film is a strange, erotic, fantasy fairytale that sets up centers around a mythological "monster" to visit a French mansion and women after the ladies. The film is very brave about its subject, and it's something to give it. The subject of excitement is a specific subject and can be added for a good reason; but the film transmits it; straight and point. Like other filmmakers in the center of his taboo, he could go around The Beast and used our imagination to fill the gaps, but Borowczyk did not do it, and in that respect he was courageous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The film starts with a series of randy male horse carrying a woman. This opener puts a longing on the film and prepares for an incredible, round-robin eroticism that the viewers want to see in some ways. The scenes with the animal with the woman are frustrating and shocking, and are obliged to insult many people (for this reason they have been forbidden for 20 years), but these scenes do not shock the audience for Borowczyk; this movie has a certain point. As it is said in the film; The only difference between man and animals is zakat. Both human beings and animals have instincts, only human beings can handle them. Beast explores these differences between sex and human beings; the fantasy sequence seen by the animal epitomizes the control of human desires, and only allows the central female characters to overcome her control to see her. <br /> <br /> There are stories related to the story of 'beauty and animal' in the film, and this is usually a shocking lust for lust, but not morally. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize the scenes to be intense around the film's shocking sequence, but these scenes are important for the film's story. Without these scenes, you know the animal's characters or story, and most importantly; 'The beauty and the animal' story will not have a terrific view of the audience and is one of the key elements of this film; it would be a real shame. In addition, Borowczyk is entertaining his audience not only with shock but also with the scene, but with the high level of dialogue and family identity, he does not see the beautiful copy of the living room and, therefore, is the Beast shocking film . This is a taboo theme and a shocking description of how this movie is for everyone. But you can shake the movie and embrace Beast; this is a great and beautiful thing of art that should not be missed by anyone who wants to give this movie a chance.
