Of course, it was cheese, unique and sometimes dark, but at least the filmmakers did not try it. Although most television films are on the border of their medieval threshold, this movie really has some remaining qualities. Cinematography was pretty good for television and Viggo Mortensen shows Aragorn's shades in a film about a man playing with his own rules. The Flashback sequence was mostly cheese, but the scene was tight with the mountain lion. This is Jason Priestly's directorial role as a rebellious shock-jock, but still this TV movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack is intense. But the film was beautifully seen in the famous Tucson, Arizona.
