This movie was highly recommended by Matt Groening. Indeed, I have also watched The Simpsons and Futurama, and both have turned into a word. The film brings home a few "what's happening" that we are lucky we are today and at the age when we just get simple things like soap and water. In 2022, men are still interested in shaving with a knife-safe end! Responsible films include unnecessary special effects, ray guns, and so on. They are not good at downloading. What this means when you say some nice-looking 'furniture'. Remember, "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
