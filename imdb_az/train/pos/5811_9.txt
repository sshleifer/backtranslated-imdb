Only a 9/10, a perfect movie, would have been more of a film than a movie, but Moonwalker remains a music, dance and fun entertainment festival so far. Starting with video clips from Jackson's long career, he recalls that the audience is frequently seen as "The King of Pop". In the benefit of Africa, the award-winning charity record 'We Are You,' he hit when hit. However, the Oscar award-winning script is a perfect film, though it provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. 'Be Together' ends with the perfect (sexy!) Concept. The whole family can enjoy watching and enjoying it.
