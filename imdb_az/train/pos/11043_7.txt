Malefique graduated from the audience with a charming atmosphere from the start. Approximately all the films are placed in a prison, which turns around four characters, the most striking way to go through the trawler Marcus and his younger children. Soon, prisoners find a day before the former prisoner behind the bricks dealing with the disobedience of hidden and black magic that led to a single cell. Here he is engaged in opening the book's secret and his magic to escape prison. <br /> <br /> It is said that this event is very weak and the last bending is beautiful, but the ends look the same for me. In any case, the atmosphere of the film is unique with the minimal setting and layout, because I am thrilled to the last moment. Deaths are raw and scary ... it does not look like he's cooling your waist, and secret issues too work well and reminds Hellraiser hell. Malefique, a green cloth, gives a claustrophobic and cold feel to the dirty. In some cases, it is striking when it is described here in a real or hidden world ... when the late boy loses his fingers and when Marcus is lying to breastfeed his breasts, how can the gloomy doors shine? With its budget, the film creates a rare atmosphere and shatter the audience in a very different way than the majority of attractive shocks. I just wish that the story brought you to a more consistent finale. A few elements such as a visitor to the camera, the other prisoners in the book, and the toy doll story, referring to the word, do not intensify. In any case, I will keep my eyes open for other films by director Valett, though, in its turn, the Hollywood version of "One Missed Call", which is already obsolete and useless in the Miike version.
