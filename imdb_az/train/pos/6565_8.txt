I know snorting movie snobs. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a stunning fun ride through the B-movie jungle, try "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> When a little slim, but only a liner and place to prepare for it. It looks like John Hurt (God loves him), playing the role of ultra bad white ear. Crawfords, Jake Speed's nemesis. It adds a dimension to the film that can only provide a pro like Hurt. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good band, though why they resemble each other. However, both Crawford and Christopher have a very entertaining team that describes how you can act as a child in situations that can provide you with a moment and in a state of consternation. Tasty Karen Kopins is doing a great job as a woman who is worried more about her savior's motives after entering trouble. <br /> <br /> I have found a very entertaining movie while still drowning the film without propaganda or very difficult test. Not every movie should be the latest "Citizen Kane". And trust me, Wells was original. So sometimes, the movies are entertaining. It is a social commentary or political aspect of the audience. But for a cheerful fun of talking about living and living at a time when the heroine lived in a celluloid size.
