Like Hitchcock films, what I love the best in this movie is a tension that does not take very seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understood that people would go to the movies for a good time. Something that Hollywood has forgotten in recent years. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is as beautiful as ever. Cillian Murphy is more dragger than he started in Batman. In the old days there were always guys playing bad guys. <br /> <br /> We think Hollywood agents think of a bad career, so we do not see much in these days, but Cillian Murphy is better off than we are. <br /> <br /> The director is surprisingly stylish. The story is good, but the dialogue could use several sprucing ups. <br /> <br /> The "Red Eye" is really a fun movie, and people clinging to the circulation loans spread. If you have a mood for a happy runner, you may have a "Red Eye" ticket.
