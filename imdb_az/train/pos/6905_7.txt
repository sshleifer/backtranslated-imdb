I thought that Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, has played equally well. It was interesting to see how Richard Dreyfus replaced the will of the dictator. However, over time, he played a more secure and relaxing role. Since everything was a reason for life, he meant to stay there for the year he was there, as he was forced to replace the dictator. I guess that his life has to be seen in Parador as to how good he is compared to the poverty he has seen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "# text-align: justify; .. anyway ........... so I gave this movie from 10 to 7.
