This film was as good as any biblical movie, except for Susan Hayward's wooden trim. Henry King welcomes this film with epic respect in all smaller areas, and Peck is always as flawless. The mixer Alfred Newman's voice score is memorable after many years with this initial mix of twenty-three. With Goliath, the scene is not a bit of a hockey side, but very bad things have not been done for this period. It goes along with the least epic of the day, along with Ruth Singh and Esther and the King. It's worth watching and is excellent as Raymond Massy's Prophet Nathan. The film is always rolled by James Robertson's Justice, Abishay and Michal, David's first spouse, as Jayne Meadows.
