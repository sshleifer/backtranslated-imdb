I read the book and saw the movie. Both are excellent. The film is not a diamond in this period. Liebman and Selby prefer the screen and indicate the intensity of their characters without any defects. This movie should have starred them. Regrettably, in the studio, to keep everything behind this movie. It could have been a franchise easily. DVD is a must-have film, and a decent remake will play this movie. See your TV guide and see it no matter how late you are on the list. You will not be disappointed. Make yourself another blessing - read a book (same name). He'll keep you away. From those days, events have dramatically changed, or at least we want to think about.
