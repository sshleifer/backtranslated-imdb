This film started slowly and then gained momentum in the middle. However, the fact that the movie flies over two nights has broken this momentum on its peak. The second part was really interesting, but it was a sad ending. Do you play football in the yard? Is it really sincere and maudlin? Now I hear a similar movie plan based on the 70s. If I have something like the '60s', I will not make much effort to adjust it.
