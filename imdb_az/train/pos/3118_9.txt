I have never seen two previous Bourne films, I was a little unwilling to watch the Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> But this was a very exciting experience and I did not understand what happened because of not seeing the first two films. Every piece of story was easy to understand and I fell in love with Bourne Ultimatum! I do not think that such an elegantly designed and drawn movie, especially an action movie. It's been a great news for me since I've been away from activities and trilogy films. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon just played a role as Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Ultimatum is one of the most exciting films. I have heard a lot about his great performances at Bourne 1 + 2 and now this spectacular actor has one more to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of the films in the future. <br /> <br /> The buttons were still worked out - each was brilliant and I was shocked by the impression of this movie. Yes.
