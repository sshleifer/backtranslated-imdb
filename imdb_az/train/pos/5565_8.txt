I'm an admirer of C & C and return to their notes, and I love this movie, but in the mid-1980s, San Jose was at a point in California's cable television. All references to cannabis have been replaced with "diamonds". There are diamonds instead of cannabis bags that fall to the "Red" of Chong, but the conversation is still unique ("... $ 3000 / lb worth"). On a boat, there is a subtotal of foreigners' clips added to C & C observations and talking to each other by getting diamonds. In the end, there is something else instead of "cosmic coke". I'm not sure who created this version, but it was terrible and obviously trying to make a family / child friendly. It would be better if this network was not broadcast in any way.
