The best ensemble I've ever seen is a comedy / musical "B" (and I'm 40 years old and now I'm not an expert, but I've seen all the well-known films there). The actors who have been playing for a few minutes at a time are pretty much involved in comedy music, and frequent music tracks break the comedy. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I see it in TCM Europe, I laugh loudly! Who smiled at me? Undoubtedly, Mischa Auer caused me to smile a bit of a terrible gut, even stealing the end, it was wonderful! In my opinion, although the cause of this film is L & H's one point of sale (and I look forward to watching them and Hal Roach, I love them in their early Hal Roach articles) At least they are at least at the forefront and the way of adults (1930 according to the standards of the year, if you read between the lines, rather than today's standards). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I confess that I know him only from WO OZ and I love him there and shot his waitress on the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme returning to me in the 30th movie (something that spells me in real life); The musical numbers are of real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) that distances me from what you use in this genre. I can continue, but I am sure that I love this movie. I've seen 8 out of 10 in TCM Europe and I'm going to write TCM back to my wife in the United States. Good things!
