People come. This movie is better than 4. I see that this can happen ... Rich people have done so much more. <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> This movie is exactly what it is. I appreciate a film based on its essence and do not compare living Christmas with the False Saddle. I grew up as a caring, humble person who could not work completely out of my house on the street. My "favorite ..... must follow the holiday season" will remain in my list. If you just want a fun 90 minutes, look at this one.
