Why is a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this ordinary movie? Casting gives some good performances (like Elizabeth Berkli Barbie girl, without a girlfriend's mom and Justin Whalin, a boy who has forever dropped his anxiety), but the direction is very boring and the story is not so exciting and original. I do not believe such a movie is prepared for the big screen! Julie Corman (Producer): You CRAZY ??? !!!
