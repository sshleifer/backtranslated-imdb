I say, I liked the Vanishing Point. I've seen the original and this is a pretty good remake. <br /> <br /> Although he did not explain the original story (though he gave it from 10 to 8), it was still very good, and it's probably a better storyline. <br /> <br /> DJ's comments about Challenger, which goes straight to the cloud at 185 mph, are quite impossible (and, as you can see, the speedometer pushes at 145-150), but the first scenes they did not see in one of the engines were the original scenes was a supercharged Hemi, so it is possible. For those who say that aerodynamics will not allow this, the Chrysler 300C, which is normally aspirated, can travel at 168 miles today and if you look at it, it's pushing a brick wall in the 70's if you go one way. mph If you put an air dam above Challenger in a wind tunnel test, it would be more aerodynamic.
