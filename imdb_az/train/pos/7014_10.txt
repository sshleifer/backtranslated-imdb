Wow ... I do not know what to say. I only watched seven pounds. Nobody will cry like Will Smith. Man is very convinced by many human emotions. This film has done wonderful and beautiful things. It's rare to find such intense humanity in Hollywood today. Let's compare it to "Forward" and "Crash" as well as a lightweight, lightweight show. It definitely stays with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I love my love and passion for such films. In most cases, it does not look for a "bad ending", but rather a fact that encloses something more than emotion, life, and loyalty in abundance all around. Therefore, in the end I do not feel a little pain. Life is always right because there are no happy endings. Sometimes I think it should be only a happy ending. Many people lived a happy life, but lost love and some of their lives. If you have someone who looks a bit deeper than your rest, you will love this movie!
