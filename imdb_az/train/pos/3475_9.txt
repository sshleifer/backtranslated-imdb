When I was Beatlemaniac, with the combination of fear and fervor, we were drawn to two of us. After seeing "In his Life: John Lennon's Story," I was worried that nothing would be better than our two Imams. Despite everything like Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney? even with some makeup and matching hair? <br /> <br /> But I was a little pleasantly surprised. Probably, thanks to the participation of Michael Lindsay-Hoggun, director of "Let It Be" in 1970, and John and Paulo knew quite well that the characters and dialogue are quite satisfying. (Two Writing Loans are given to a man named Mark Stanfield and I will not know anything about them, and I'm sure Lindsay-Hoggun is a little bit more involved with the script). Beatles's biographies; In fact, there are very few land plots and all day in New York City. In 1976, John and John were living in New York City while meeting John and Paul. Of course, this meeting is not entirely imaginary? he really can not deny that such a meeting took place. But would you give an impression of these two great musician's personalities through this imaginary conversation? their intelligence, the sense of humor, the different reaction to ants, and most of their relationships; <br /> <br /> Because, after a few hours, nothing is a discussion film, except for the dialogue between the two characters, so it can do all that. Beatles fans; but it is a fantastic writing and story writing, both informative and touchable. For those of you who are interested in these two music giants, will you be surprised how soon the actors are different from their colleagues and how they feel about the life of John and Paul? it is so sincere and convincing that it has become actual and up-to-date. Two Genius, two geniuses give a valuable insight into their lives and are both a sad and funny tale. Of course, it is recommended.
