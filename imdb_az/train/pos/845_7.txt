Matador is better than the defect, because it looks and looks light at that time. Humor is always medium-sized, never unforgettable, but the intestine is irresistible. The story is a very simple subject. The features of the plot are often recurring features, namely a bad guy who needs a palace and a good guy wearing a flat glass in need of security in life completes one another's life styles. I also do not need to find a parallel glimpse of the story, because it is simply a cruel thing and symbolism is not strong enough to carry it. But it is really a good movie because it would not have been so subtle and ineffective at first. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I believe it's slowly the cause, but I'm thinking of bringing the audience together. Because this is not something new, even humor, the two main characters, almost symbols, were welcomed and met. Call them real. What I mean is. I do not mean that Pierce Brosnan's dirty, handsome, confusing man is a comic character, but he is strongly determined by the writer and how Brosnan is surprisingly happy about the applause of the fresh air of James Bond. Greg Kinnear's character seems to be the same as his separate scriptedness, but he was given a lot of unexpected footnotes due to the lightfootedness of the film that shot us for a moment but then shot us. And then we realize that the film is not just about transferring these or airplanes, trains or cars. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> But with its lightness , what can be the main purpose of the film? No, attention is focused on Brosnan and Kinnear's relationships. It is strange that Matador is a film about pity and loneliness. Brosnan deals with each other alone and regretfully, though Brosnan Kinnear is slowly understood as a means of regaining feelings in order to get off the lower version of the Kinnear even though we do not admit that Kinnear is so soft and that Brosnan is constantly killed. The latest scene in the movie is with me. In my opinion, the subtle side-by-side effect of the movie begins to finally seep.
