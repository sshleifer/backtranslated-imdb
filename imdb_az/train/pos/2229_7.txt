I read some terrible things about this movie, so I was ready for the evil. "It's a shame, though, that some of these accusations are worth doing, but this is a terrific DVD DVD programmer, in fact it really was a wish to try something out of the typical monster / slasher nonsense." <br /> <br /> The Prophet (pbuh) said: Barbeau is a miracle to see. <br /> <br /> This film is square in its shoulders. <br /> <br /> This does not mean a masterpiece, but UNHOLY eventually fell under his weight. there are plenty of undisclosed subplots trying to live in. The plot gaps from time travel are never directed to the truth: for example, if Haman knew his mother was bad and would eventually kill his brother then why not just kill Ma first? <br /> <br /> Let me also note that so far, a bit of casualties is not a bad thing.
