We often talk about cinematographic sources - Kane, The Godfather, Bout de Souffle. A movie is often ignored by critically acclaimed critics. Of course, I'm talking about classic Doc Savage (M.B.). <br /> <br /> This film is not only interesting, but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of developing countries by US imperialism. <br /> <br /> There was also the biggest movie of the movie (until Flash Gordon's breath-taking job). Though it is rare, this movie is worth the search - it will end your search ten times.
