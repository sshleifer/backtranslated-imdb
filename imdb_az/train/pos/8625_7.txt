Jörg Buttgereit, even a little farther away from films and themes for my taste, is a difficult thing to do, especially for movies. They are prepared with craftsmanship, and often have a profound meaning in his subject. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of the film's work. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to label this movie. It's really a movie that's a story, but it's a start, middle and end. <br /> <br /> The head of the Caucasian Muslims Office is "interesting" and realist in comparison with others. They are not necessarily linked, but they still talk together. The film does not matter. All different stories have a different perception, and Buttgereit speaks without difficulty using every word (also typical of style), but instead lets you describe the characters and sensual emotions of the characters to the whole story. <br /> <br /> However, production values ​​are not very high, and this may be something that can frighten some people. <br /> <br /> <strong> br /> 7/10
