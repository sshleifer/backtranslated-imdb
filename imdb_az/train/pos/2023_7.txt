Spoilers ..... I've seen the original of the TV some time ago, and I remembered that this production was less festive than the Beeb costume drama. I returned to DVD this week and still has the same impression. This is first of all a good event, but the hero is very courageous and noble, and when he is ill he returns to his completely lying husband and when I am completely irritated with his holiness. I believe that when this story was written, it was also a "good thing" when it was written, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband because she had done nothing but her husband. Scandalous with many of her lovers, because she liked to see many contemporary audiences. But it is difficult to accept today's elegance, and especially when this hero has a strong, courageous admirer ready to defend everyone and everyone. That is, I heard the story again as it was in the movie. <br /> <br /> Ancient hero Gilbert was a saint to change his ladylove and raise it with frequent secret behavior and persistent self-denial and loyalty, not a novel, but a little annoying. it should be very consecutive support. So, when Helen ended up with him, I felt a great shame that the script did not allow him to quickly open one another before the headlines went off before a few minutes. Until now, unfortunately, it was completely funny to expect unexpected husbands to hold a good dialogue and expect something unpleasant for a good embrace between a hero and a hero. Instead, the end was dependent on whether filmmakers were running away from time or money. <br /> <br /> "For a minute, you can do what you want, and then, as the director wants to go home ....." I'm feeling completely dissipated. However, Toby Stephens, a very good actor and a very nice hero and Rupert Graves, gave a superb and self-deceiving life. <br /> <br /> Tara was hospitable to the Fitzgerald scenario. <br /> <br /> I love these classic dramas and almost all of them are one. do not look much better on television than "modern" drama these days. So it's still a good clock, although 7 stars, because of irritation.
