This movie is regarded as one of my favorite 10 films. Many people who have never seen a lot of them in the film and I do not know why it is so surprising, so I'll try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The film is rich in detail and cultural insights, and although they have a few small anachronisms, they can be completely forgiven. This story is a repetition of popular dances among Monk Benkei and Young Prince Yoshitzune on the Gojo Bridge. During the war legionary Yoshitsune bests becomes a loyal arm of Benkei and the monk's prince. This film is a manifestation of that story and concerns war, dark prophecies, and political maneuvers. <br /> <br /> One of the main topics in the film, Mappo, is Prophecy by Buddha. His teachings will fail for 1,000 years and the world will fall into chaos. After the civil war between Miy Fuji and Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji), he believed in the world of anarchy and that everything would collapse into Heian Japan. <br /> <br /> In the next film, Karma's Tennis (Raven Goblins) has a way to deal with Yoshitsune's sword education. The defeated clans often fled to the mountains and hid themselves as demons in order to intimidate the local population. It is said that the ninja clans began as a history. Yosix, who lives in Goja, is satisfied with all of this. <br /> <br /> Then Benkei and various strains of Buddhism, many reflect the Esoteric Buddhism of the Shingone sect. All of these are illustrated in a very precise way and simply add a little bit to the film's power of meditation and to energize the energy of the story in a way that is inextricable, that is, this magic realism uses to add an extra dimension. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> Decoration and costume are absolutely unacceptable and very reliable. The soundtrack is great, it's so awkward and dark. I also thought that the actual activity was striking. Benkei, a great dark anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune), is described as a young man who tests his limits and becomes more and more intoxicated and Tetsukichi uses the sword of the garbage "common man" and <br /> <br /> <strong> There are sensitive thoughts towards people living in the Caucasus. </ strong> <br /> <br /> <p> This retelling becomes a strange tale of intrigue, violence, and infernal karma with almost a regular Robin Hood's Little John story.
