"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before marriage last year. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I was looking for after my marriage, because we promised to give our priest a copy. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, the reality is different. I recommend that everyone who writes like "Don Camillo" visit the Priest Pe if they are not in real life. Nuno Westwood, Estoril, Portugal :-) I would recommend that others see this movie just before and after "I do it". day :-) <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
