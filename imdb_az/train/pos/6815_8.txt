Elisha Cuthbert plays his fourteen year old daughter, who lost her mother and communicated with her father, finds a hidden magic lift that keeps her in the basement of her home until the end of the 18th century. <br /> <br /> < I watched the film .. Elisha did not see the movies before ... 'The daughter of Next Door and 24 'Elisha provides a satisfactory performance, the plot is a little cheese but the movie runs. How this young girl believes Hollywood is the hottest baby!
