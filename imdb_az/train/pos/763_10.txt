This movie changed it all for me ... I heard breakdancing and hiphop, but I never saw it professionally (hey, I'm a 11 year old boy from Holland!) It all changed when I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Today, I still consider this movie a personal favorite. Of course, the importance of shooting and "cinematography" may not be significant. But if you have a large film shot or if you see a microphone hanging over someone else, who cares? This is what you personally count ...
