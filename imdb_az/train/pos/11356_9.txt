This is a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a series of series, the Soviet Russia bureaucracy, the driver of a man, and the link between this man (leading detective) and his superiority. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland), which is the most intense, is with me. For some reason, he sees their evolution as a result of hostility and respect for the crime and the connection and co-operation. A line in the movie sums up for me: "No idea would say, but it's overcome with emotion." <br /> <br /> The perfect movements of all the pencils, even the smallest parts, were also convinced. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast moving motion; In fact, it moves at a time like a slow drama, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
