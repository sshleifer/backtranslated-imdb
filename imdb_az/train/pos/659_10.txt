One of the latest French New Wave classics. For Direktiv, kinoza Jean Eustache pulled from the simplicity of the film early in the century; Eustache suffered the pain of his own complicated love for his story. There is much to say about this movie - the bright observation; self-overstatement; sometimes sad; emotional draining ... and so on. In my opinion, any complaint that can be settled against this film easily shadows by numerous forces. Every film maker, writer or simply sharp cuts, no music video overstyling, no soap operas, consistent twists and no banal dialogue give anyone a point to see this movie, anyone wanting to manage the movie for 3 hours. Everything you need to admire: writing (short, smart, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, quite simply, perfect in their role) and simple direction (like a random observer in the film) is unforgettable. No doubt, this is a movie that will stay with you.
