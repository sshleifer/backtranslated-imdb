This movie is not as controversial as the roots of Care Bear and Care Bear Cousins. I do not deny it. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate movie, it's a good movie. I remember it by watching it in the early 80's (and its adapting to its targeted demographic audience) and much more than the first movie (I did not like it at all), this is just a little extra). Of course, it's darker than the first one, but maybe it's so good. And a deeper kind of darkness (children can not fully understand, but they're still afraid that they can protect the atmosphere and adults look at it now, at the age of 20) instead of anything else where a young girl who deals with an evil soul / devil. Get a picture? But just watching as a child, as I said, it can be a little scary, but it's not a trauma. In fact, if I had anything else, I would play another fantasy game that I could play when I was old. I can not say the number of Dark Heart I wanted to arrest, help me to take care of me, turn me into the darkness, and so on. The film was also good for my imagination. And for that, it has a great emotional depth. <br /> <br /> Also, Hadley Kay is the perfect choice for Dark Heart (I've always thought so and I will always be there). <br /> <br / Now they do not create a very bad noise. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I just want to hear growth, just watching the movie. <br /> <br /> "What good is love and care if it can not save it?"
