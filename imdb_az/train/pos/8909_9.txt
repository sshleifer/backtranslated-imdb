This is a pretty good acquaintance, and I do not go deep into it. The main story is about two teenagers who find on a slimy alien magnificence goo from the earth through the meteor. This bone ball is burned through the flesh in acidic contact. It also creates human organs as it grows more and more. No one believes in teens (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend), and finally it seems that the block can be stopped. It's really good for the age and the speed is pretty fast, unlike the other 50 flicks. The story is very unique and should be for the fans of old intelligence and monsters. If you are able to drag into the 80s, check 'remake from' 88.
