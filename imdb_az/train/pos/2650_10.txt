Along with the meaning of the list of my favorite cinemas: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) The rest of God (Allmighty 3) ... this movie is really better than the book (and regardless of TV's miniseries, this is an easy feat, given the director)). Flawless shooting style, moving, and music (Kubrick's all-time skill) turn it into a masterpiece of horror. A few years ago, I watched television TVs and loved the story and hoped for it. GREAT GREAT! It's better than I ever thought. It's a slow start (Kubrick trademark) and there's a lot of support for stopping it. The presentation scene is classic and I have watched it about 20 times for a careless atmosphere that has taken him to the entire movie. Also, the film is a trend that I hate from extremely scary movies (just enough and in no way tasteless). Just watch!
