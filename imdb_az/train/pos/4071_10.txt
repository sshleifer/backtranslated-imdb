For the first time, I saw this movie at the age of seven, and I was totally intoxicated, but I could not understand what the film was. Now I'm twenty, and two weeks ago I shouted at the movie accidentally and took a copy. Although my memory was a bit laughable, I was not disappointed with what I was seeing. the animation in this film is appealing to the entire world, making it as convincing and very good as you are involved in the movie. But this movie also has a structure that will entertain and entertain adults and children. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a flying island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a good love story.
