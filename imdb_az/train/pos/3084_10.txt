Ah, why? The word "six degrees" is a show of theoretical theory that all of us associate with one another. If you pay attention to the lives of a group of people and the outcome of their actions <br /> <br /> When I heard about this show for the first time, I was not disappointed. In fact, it seemed very ordinary. Then I saw some episodes ... and I liked it! First, the characters. All are well-written and different. A woman with an alcoholic is betrayed by her fianc√©, only a woman who lost her husband, a driver with a troubled brother, and so on ... Unlike the one we use, most of the characters interact with each other In the wounds, routine routines . Adults! <br /> <br /> My favorite is Mae, Carlos and Whitney. These are all great. Jay Hernandez shows his ability to work in more than 3d characters from the "Hostel", his previous job as Paxton. <br /> <br /> When I come to IMDb after watching some episodes, I do not believe I believe that special Campbell Scott, playing Steven and Bridget Moynah, has been abolished. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> This will really be a good show!
