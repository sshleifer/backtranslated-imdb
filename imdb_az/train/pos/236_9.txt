It's rare when I want to see a movie again. "Amati Girls" is such a movie. In the past, we have put more demonstrations in the cinemas. Has this story been autobiographical to the writer / director? This truth is aura. <br /> <br /> All the stars present their heroes faithfully and sensitively. Who does not want Mercedes Ruehl as his oldest sister? <br /> <br /> I really liked the job for "Gulanna". <br /> <br /> Most movies, actors, producers, directors, voice technicians, and so on. Stopping this belief in Amati Girls. It feels like a part of a family! How do I get to the Dolores defender when my family is drowning in her emotional life? And he wanted to please Lee Grant for criticizing Cloris Leachman's hair color. <br /> <br /> The love described in this movie family will be arrogant and appreciated. <br /> <br /> That is why this is the love depicted in the movie family. <br /> <br /> The name of the Amati family, translated from Italian, means "loved ones."
