Miike, The Neverending Story, is different from children's adventure film. This is actually one of my favorite movies. Even the worst Miike is better than very good movies, and the Great Yokai War has many things to offer. At least as high as American kiddie flicks and ugly. I think kids will find a lot of things to love (DVD on the English dub), but like Miike movies, they can move very slowly. Well, sometimes there is a loud noise sequence and there is a strange inequality that will drag to the next stage to chat with the characters. The story itself is not very good, and Miike's unusual flaw takes on the ugly head. Some things came from the technical side. This should be Miike's most expensive movie and look fantastic. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits and they have done a remarkable job of anyone who is different in all the different fantasy uniforms and costume designers, special effects group and designs. I've seen it based on Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare, which I saw in 1968, and the cheese rubber suit monsters you find there have become more convincing with the most modern makeup and specials. effects. I like the look of one of the bad guys (or girls), Agi, who has a dark eye shadow, dense white dress, white linen hair and lashes. He accidentally performed by Chiaki Kuriyama, you remember that Lucy Liu is one of the teenagers in Kill Bill: Vol. Ryunosuke Kamiki, the protagonist of the film, plays for Miyazaki's Spirit Lying and Moving Fortress.
