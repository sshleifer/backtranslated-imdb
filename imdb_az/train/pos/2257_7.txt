Sarafina was a fun movie and some songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. I'm not usually like music, but it's not as bare as the box I read. The film was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective on Soweto's 1976 anniversary. This showed something of the students' perspectives during the rebellion and showed them to be a real symbol. If you see them as real characters, they love you more and more as a white government victim, more sympathetic to you, and no one to suffer. Pupils are right to read, because we know from the data that the students who are intensely angry read and dance. Students' clothing in Sarafina is very similar to the dresses from Soweto's paintings. The film actually shot the Soweto movie, so it looks very clear in many parts. All this shows that someone who uses the film is more accurate. As audience viewers, we need to criticize how the Apartheid history is presented. As I said before, being sympathetic to students is potentially more reliable and objective. Also, some details from other accounts change. In Sarafina, when the police enter the classroom and hit students, they get chaos. The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto, but this is probably an exaggerated event. Police and army students were hit, but there is no evidence that they would enter the school and execute such people. The battles were more in the streets and were plundered and murdered. This is perhaps done in the film to think that the school is more upset for the students. If you have some information about the film's aparthied, the film would be more useful. The teacher was arrested for resisting the government, working for the mother in the white man's house. There is no information about the government and why it does, or there is no detail about racist policies and laws. - George S, Chris and Finlay
