Amazing! Wow! Stacy Peralta, Dogtown and Z-Boys, watched a stunning documentary about the history of the great wave-surfing culture in America. <br /> <br /> Together with the legendary surfing, bringing together the ideal archival documents, we pass on to the daring and free life of the first pioneers in which our passion for sports has created an industry that has touched millions of lives today we move. /> It is possible to know the symbols and their stories that provide the film's warmth. We can feel Peralta's respect for this group because we challenge the 50-meter swing of Hawaii's northern coast to hear the accounts of Greg Nolle off the coast-surfers. Or, Mr. Jeff Clark has been discovered only 15 years before the shores of northern California on the dangerous Maverick, and turned into a surfing destination in California. And Laird Hamilton, the history book of the today's surfing book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Digital Guidance, because it was as sweet as the movie, as well as men like Clark. this unusual athlete praised us with the powerful and terrible power of the waves wishing to conquer us, the vertical drops of the gut needed to enter human beings, and the fact that the adrenaline and the fear did not go deeper. <br /> <br /> All this and movie is more. For those who did not live in California in the 1960s, we get an idea of ​​the impact of surfing on American pop culture. (And, of course, my surprise, the effect of the movie guides on surfing!) Peralta also touches a primer on some technical aspects of the sport and the novelty of the equipment. I'm not a surfist, but as a Sundance audience, I've been totally involved with this movie. Peralta claims that American documentary films are Big Kahuna.
