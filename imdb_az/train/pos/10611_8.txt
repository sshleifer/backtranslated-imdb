When I called another reviewer's character development, I downgraded it. The film is a head bash with a backstory that has long been started or unnecessary. Yes, we had only a glimpse of many unexplained stories, but it was a daily illustration based on an event that catalyzed changes in the lives of all the characters. Henry Thomas's performance is a really good job of acting power rather than action. Good rentals.
