You go into a movie house in the rain or shine outside. This makes you happy. (If not, turn right.) The lights turn off. You put it in an ice cream bar. The shape of the shake vibrates on the screen. You feel the content. In the dark, you are back at the beginning of time. Sitting around the camp ... looking at the modern version of flickering flames 24 times a second, sharing the joy of finding the unknown types and corners of the scenario with the rest of your clan / audience. <br /> <br /> People who are not happy with themselves should not comment. (Long live romantic comedies ...)
