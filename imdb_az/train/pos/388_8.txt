... and I love it. For a movie that has a lot of special effects and is not related to the mega budget, this movie is really a great job to create a fantasy masterpiece. I was a kid who could not understand the story, but it was still a great flick to watch. Indeed, there are standards above the standards, such as the Density of Rings and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing I really love about this movie is to extend the adventure film, which is a lot to a movie. Outside Hong Kong. The subject is exotic and original. The quality of production is no different than the HK's fantasy action movie, and the toy is great. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , they will continue to work in this area until they go on Hollywood adventure movies. <br /> <br /> Just fantastic.
