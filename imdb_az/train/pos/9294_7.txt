Before I start, I have to admit that I know the editor of this movie. We did not meet at all, but we talked about the same fanzine (coming in front of message boards), so we have an approach here. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Finally, in the late '50s and early' 60s, the Rat Package culture, in the mid 90s, was akin to one of the original Rat Packages was a flop. Only this was a critical flop; I believe that Peter Travers Rolling Stone was not alone in this arrogant (I remember that this gave a mixed review). I do not consider it to be the world's biggest film and I'm not an admirer of the Rat Pack or the "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> For something, it looks stylish and moves right. First, key speeches are good. Richard Dreyfus is here, surprisingly limited, as a gangster from a sanitary authority and he has a kiss. Like Jeff Goldblum, BIG CHILL, he returns to his quietly-rehearsed performances in the days we destroyed. When Ellen Bark is asked to be a vampire in this movie, he does it fun. No doubt, this is not a big movie; The dialogue is mostly windows and many do not work (like the word "Zen of Ben"). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrifying here. Still, I am enjoying it and you can be a gangster movie if you like it.
