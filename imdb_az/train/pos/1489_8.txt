Generally, the movie is complete. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than a basket and its story is better than Gubra in terms of feeling. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that touch me. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) is doing very well. Brilliant. However, the song "Me Me Quitte Pas" by Nina Simone is actually a 'menaikkan' song called 'roma'. <br /> <br /> I love my song. Both the song and the song. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just uploaded a song. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Give me a smile. The film ends with me again. <br /> <br /> Yasmin can see how she appreciates her parents in a rare way. <br /> <br /> I think the film is worthy of the Berlin Film Festival's International Jury Grand Prix. <br /> <br /> I am 8.5 stars.
