Briefly summarize a long story. I loved every minute of it. A great fantasy in the style of true Arab-Nights. A evil sorcerer, a beautiful prince, a jinn and everyone then lives happily. Modern Hollywoond has one or two things to convince this classic. The only word: special effects are on the agenda (although tomorrow is loved by the demons!)
