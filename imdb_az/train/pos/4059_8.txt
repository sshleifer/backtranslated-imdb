One of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to Nausicaa before, but Nausicaa was epic of SF, but it's a comedy adventure with a very weak SF's premise. <br /> <br /> I think about the first half hour of the movie, I'll love it. Once again, you find the ability to surprise Miyazaki's attention and to delve into a imaginary world with a meticulous, beautiful perfection. <br /> <br /> <strong> Nusicaa is better than anything else. <br /> <br /> <BR> <! - style. Here's a bunch of bandits. They provide a comic element in the film, although I'm in need of a comic element, but I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa and I think it's better for that. Still. the most memorable character in the movie (you will not be surprised when you remember the timeline of Treasure Planet, even if a woman is Long John Silver) and the pirate leader Dola says that the English voices in fact they really feel good. But something about half the mark began about something that started in the form of pearls for me about this movie. The best way I can describe it is that the characters are swept away by a wide range of stories. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Laputa, a lot of people are open-minded, almost ten or eight. The word that I am here is "admired". <br /> <br /> It was important for me: I really did not really care about any characters. Disney would have been focusing on developing the characters, but could actually fall for them, on the contrary, while leaving the magnificent excitement of the movie, it does not release it as two-dimensional fragments for relocation. Even if there were some difficult SF in the story, it would have been a collision, but mostly gobledegooks about princesses and magic crystals. Laputa is the place where she is concerned about me, and she has 10 potentials in 10 films. Recognizing that Miyazaki was a lee in front of Disney in 1986, it should be taken when you think that the same movie is a terrific "Great Mouse Detector". <br /> <br /> <br /> Laputa In some ways, a beautiful movie, an incredible movie and you have to see it, but I feel that it is very appreciated. <br /> <br /> BST, if you can watch them chronologically, look at Nausicaa's puppy squirrel in Laputa in a short time.
