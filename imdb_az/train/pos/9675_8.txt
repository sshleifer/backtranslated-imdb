Most people say they should really be bored if they watch a movie on a Saturday night. In fact, I left the house and returned to the television and there was "Paulie". <br /> <br /> I missed the loans I opened, so I did not know the name, but I saw that it was Cheech Marin, so, of course, "I was born in the East" <br /> <br /> < strong </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> As you know, if there is no longer any Paulie and she tries to get back to her original owner. Years spent to find him. What is Paulie's superiority is, of course, a benefit. People meet a literate parrot and everything they see is a way to make money or to benefit themselves. <br /> <br /> Although the character of Czech Marinis "earns money from him," it does not matter to him. <br /> <br /> Dancing sequences with cemeteries are thought to be a favorite thing for kids, and I found them entertaining. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who is naive, learns quickly that all people are not good people. Especially the owner of animal research lab. The man says that he will help him find his owner during animal communication research. Paulie has been squeezed out, but Pauli's vocal ability is to fool others in a demonstration. <br /> <br /> Pauli tells the indoor floor of the object to end his story, releasing a few other animals and the owner of Paulie. This is a touchscreen combination. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8, the wing scene should be taken and should not be shown. This part may be worried about younger children. Otherwise, it is a great movie for adult children and adults who have a good heart. (END)
