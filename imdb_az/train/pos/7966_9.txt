As a child, I thought this movie was great. There were animals, there were wonderful music and my favorite actor was Michael J. Fox. Now I love this movie for different reasons. There are well-trained animals equipped with stunts and scenes that are perfectly visible on the camera. There are beautifully-built music, perfect scenes, swiftly-traveled melodies and heartbreaking theme yet still cried. Even when people respect you. And my favorite actor is Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> According to one book, three stories of domestic pets, intelligent, extravagant, trustworthy and well-known father labs, intelligent and idle - fear of water called Sassy and a street-ridiculous ridiculous and somewhat neurological Bulldog, Chance. When the family leaves, three are taken to a friend's farm. Achilles and anxious animals plan and plan a trip to the Sierra Mountains for their lives. A truly incredible journey. Yes, maybe the house is on that mountain. But what if? <br /> <br /> I suggest that Homeward Bound are the three beautiful players who provide the leading animal sounds for people and for everyone ... Yes, everyone is watching it.
