Since I'm a little kid, we can remember this movie, and then I love it, and now I am doing it. I succeeded to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday, and before that I found it hard to find it, and when I was just young, I rented it. My favorite character Charlie learns to be a good dog. The movie is packed with entertaining songs and music. Animated shiny and character sounds perfect. This movie has always been a tearjerker for me, but I think that when I was little, I did not see the movie and then I still would like it, but nevertheless I can not find it as bright and attractive I'm really into cartoons.
