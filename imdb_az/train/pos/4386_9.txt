This is a powerful film. The first time I saw it, Scottish accents became difficult for me to understand a lot of things and broke their viewing experience. I refused, but I owned the DVD, I used the English subtitles when I needed them and I actually learned how well this movie was. Perfect. <br /> <br /> Wide-screen images make it spectacular with some spectacular solid beaches and the story reminded me of Braveheart. Here's Liam Neeson (good) with Tim Roth (bad). They both do good deeds. <br /> <br /> Several players like Roth face shame. Man, you really want to push this guy with a haughty, irritating cat. (She is more critical of critics than anyone). Like Gibson Braveheart, Neeson is the hero of a man and hero of a man. Jessica Lange is stronger as a female leader here. The film draws you and completely attracts you, so it is prepared to have an emotional experience.
