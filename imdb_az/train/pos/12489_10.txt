First, nobody can understand why this film is so bad. It's been a long time since the very first real horror film, for a long time, starting with driving through dark slippers (driving trains) like a child, with many decades of horror experience. Secondly, Cherry's main actress has a face that hopes to become a leading actress in the core of the future. Thirdly, this woman is very nice about how my retirees are the names of all Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes and these ephemeral lamp bullets. Ms. Christian is not the light but the sun. However, the "Persistence" also has significant metaphysical importance. The reality of photography and the "dream" indicate that one of the creatures of the mediator's power is nothing new with their own eyes. But I have not seen in a movie that these creatures appear in photographs only for certain people and only at certain times. This is not a symbolic image of truth (reality turns into a sign), but an alternate alternative form that can change as "real" truth. As a sign, the change of shape affects the pictures, meaning that the sign behaves as an object. Now, in our ordinary world, the signs of the objects change are spread. F.ex., if someone breeds a bird, it will show the photo as well as the beard. Instead, changing objects with signs suggests that the photo with the beard is the first and only the beard grows over the man. This is just an event that takes place in the film with the main characters in prison. It's a new thing, and generally we should be grateful for everything in silent films, and usually just repeat and repeat the effects and features that have been known since silence.
