In the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) is a hot, sweet and remarkable movie about two familiar mixed workers. Ernst Lubitschin, the key to the success of this film, calls for an encrypted sentimentality and giving his actors low, non-arbitrary performances. <br /> <br /> The angels who wrote in this film have a strong sixth position. The alienation is the main topic that most clearly represents the character of the shop owner and manager, played by Frank Morgan in a beautiful manner. It is not enough for her to neglect her husband and not to feel alone when her successful life created for her is not a shared partner. This is even more strange than Stewart and Sullavan, because they also do not look at the other, because they think that each one of them even knows before. Of course, we know that everything will come true, but if the film realizes that the truth is not fantasy, it does not allow them to forget the terrible feeling that neither of them will feel. <br /> <Lubitsch fills with a crackerjack cast with a chemical carrier. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> A small group of shopkeepers express themselves as a small family throughout the film and how does it feel to us? <br /> <br /> This is fine, /> Az: A +
