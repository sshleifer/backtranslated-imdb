A boiling police officer accidentally kills a murder suspect and then encompasses offenses, but he must deal with a guilty conscience while trying to solve a criminal case. Andrews and Tierney are merged with director Preminger in a film that has been acting as "Laura." Andrews beat the perfect charming police, as a good man captured in an unfortunate state. All around the game, Malden's tough copper captain and Tilly seemed to be as beautiful as Tierney's protective father. The scenario of Hecht, a large and productive screenwriter, is modest and suspenseful, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
