While Steven Spielberg is managing a movie, people do not look forward to a bright, and this movie is no exception. Some of my favorite movies were weak at the box office, but this movie is not one of them (over $ 9 million, I do not think it is bad for that). The character was fun, the animation was clear and fuzzy and the music was modern, which is unusual for a charming movie. I did not think Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for younger children (target audiences of this film), but it was too dark for the kids at the end of something that happened to the creepy professor. Generally, this movie is my favorite beloved and entertaining classic for me.
