Finally, after watching the song of South Walt Disney on MySpace, I decided to look at the response of Afro Video-Coonskin, which I connect with Ralph Bakshi's Google Video. In this live action list, Preacherman (Charles Gordone), with his wife Sampson (Barry White), Pappy (Scatman Crothers) and Randy (Philip Thomas), Michael's name, was named after two professional jailers. Pappy tells a story about the adventures of Randy Brother Rabbit, Brothers Bear, and Preacher Fox (Gordone) and Harlem during their attempts. As it is expected in some of these Glance efforts, there is animation and live action, a unique source of thought from the writer / director who is sure to insult some people. Another interesting cartoon character, Miss America, is a black woman in black, black, white and blue stars, and black women in a black woman in every way, and one of the frail women they hit in one of the most intriguing, sexually explicit ways to shock me !! Another picture related to Fred's Bear's frontal anatomy is that there are scenes scattered along the picture that gives me great laughs. There is also a female segment that speaks of a small "pumpkin", a friend who abandoned what was related to the comic artistic artist George Herriman. I also heard Grover Washington Jr's "No Sunshine" account, as part of the account I heard. The most complicated part of the picture was to read and slay a song that Scatman described in silhouette, using satirical N-word during the opening credit sequence. When he saw a VHS cover of the film a year ago, he described Brother Rabbit in a strange fashion in front of something similar to the Warner circle with the slogan "This movie betrayed everyone". This is an extensive alert for all cartoons intended for kids. Here, I propose Coonskin to the fans of Baker and to all animation.
