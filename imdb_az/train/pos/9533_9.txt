That could not have been better. Strong restrictions on Mike Sullivan's testimony could not be described in any way. Tom Hanks provides the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel; Play the main character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman gives you one of his best character performances for a long time. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a strange graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is mainly a story of a father / son who is just disadvantaged for the role of the two candidates. John Rooney took him to Mike Sullivan because he was not the father of the child. Mr. Rooney was a generous person, but he was engaged in organized crime. Thus, Sullivan's debt was repaid only by hiring himself. Now Sullivan has a wife and two children and works to keep his children safe and at the same time returning his head. The ongoing events will test Sullivan's loyalty and cover the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> Dialogue with David's great adaptation is rare, but it's still a legend. The story was beautifully covered in a dark, rainy (with snow on Earth) scene in 1930 (bright art direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh). Speeding up the story is Thomas Newman's beautiful Irish account, settled only when it is needed. <br /> <br /> The most important technical element of the film is the beautiful photo of Conrad L. Hall. This is the best cinematography I've ever seen; and watching many movies. Mike and Michael are in the car scene, entering Chicago is quite impressive. The shooting car begins at the front, and Mike (Hanks) opens the front window. Then, dolls near the car to wake up Michael (Hoechlin) and look at his side window. As can be seen, the truck moves back to the rear, completely moves around the car and shows a beautiful scene in Chicago in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> A principal man with a big shot and crew creates a treacherous beautiful movie. In 1999, I talked to American Beauty about Sam Mendes, his debut film. (who earned him various awards) worked in the US before Mommy, a game director for the Mendes English Theater, but thought he wanted to act by saying that he was nothing new in the theater. Only two films, Sam Mendes, have been featured in my book as one of the greatest directors (about twenty-five). <br /> <br /> The film illuminates the genre of betrayal that speaks about its hits and food, and it is a brilliant way to express its true theme. Photography, action, and story are phenomenal. I'm still waiting for New York's Scorcesee, but now I am absolutely sure that it's the "Best Movie of the Year". Consideration of the Competition (Signal, Insomnia, Minority Report) is a strong statement.
