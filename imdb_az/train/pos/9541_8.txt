Wow, this is really some awesome Asian horror and strange naked film. This is a Japanese splatterfest that Tetsuo has recalled a bit, in this case there is a strange love story, with all the blood and disarray. It is difficult to imagine how this visual stunning film is imaginable, people are turning people into parasites, turning them into fragile machines, or guessing cyborgs. After taking a person, something wrong with these creatures, killing each other and eating something else. hmmm, yum yum. It's an excellent soundtrack to add to all the entertainments that would probably be called an industry splatter or something. The film also borrows Carpenter's "The Thing" from a great deal of designs and effects. I would definitely put it to the gorehounds as it was non-stop killing and some pretty good eyes. There is a need for stoners because there is no need to even read subtitles, only vision images are just a mind-blowing trip. The design of small creatures living in the human body as a liver reminded me of a few Frank Henenlotter's films, which, in turn, respects a few strange films with humor. The "Canvas Machine" is a great entertaining thing, and there is no doubt about it, and I just loved it.
