This film is definitely a single love story. Nicole Kidman is on the film, but Hertfordshire Life with Ben Chaplin's St Albans and Hemel Hempstead is a very good job, but it's a city center that reflects the true essence of the region. Something that begins to appear as a regular episode of the famous English TV series Heartbeat is soon turned into a strange gangster run. Indeed, it's really memorable in this simple little movie, and ends with a very worthwhile weekend. It's a good thing to watch, and if you love the hero John, there are only thirty things you can find in his character.
