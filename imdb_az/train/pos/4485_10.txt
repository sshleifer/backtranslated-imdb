This old 40-year-old Tom & Jerry is the best of my cartoons. The original version of Mammy's Two Shoes is featured in Tom & Jerry's Spotlight Collection 2 set, a beautifully detailed animation of the disc and an early animation. The gags on it are aimed at anyone watching the Avery style, rather than the slim and scary movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to a creepy radio show and Jerry decides to play some tricks to deceive her. There are nine life-long flocks here, and I'm a couple of times vacuum and I do not know if I'm trying to report a scary one when I'm a kid. When the owner of the Tomo woke up, Mammy was not a servant, it was EVER home - a heck of surprise with a great laugh. Prepare the pause button, it's worth it!
