No day goes without a new computer animated film, so we have a chance to see more than a few beautiful effects. After watching the Ice Age, I felt that it did not affect me more than some other genre of this genre. <br /> <br /> But now I'm a Big Guy and I'm sure it's a very nice movie for kids (maybe 14). The story is very simple and "actors" are funny in a lovely way without any raw or complex humor. Even "bad" is a cute, hairy big cat with these funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending. It was a small disappointment for me (most of the main characters are deprived of sadness), but it's a wonderful thing for kids. <br /> <br /> No one, except for some battles (even if not shot several times by mammoth), has created an animated feeling. <br /> <br /> Part of the computer animation is beautiful, when you feel like a beautiful cartoony feeling scenes, a beautiful painting or a rumor's pages. <br /> <br /> Some gags smiled at me - I admit that the creators were not satisfied with these adults, but they (in my opinion) are hard to come to a better place. In general, it's a good movie, but it's not ideal for the world and for the wild animals is disney clich√© for kids. If you do not hate cute animals to do fun things, at least once.
