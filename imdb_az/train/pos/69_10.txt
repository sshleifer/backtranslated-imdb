I delayed one night cable channels and ran about 10 minutes to watch this movie - every time I thought about going to bed, even though it was something that kept looking at me, bedtime. <br /> <br /> This film could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun movie, but instead chose to explore the results of the shooting. And even better, the film goes on with a real life - when you think it's going to be easy and straightforward, a twist comes along and changes the entire outlook of the movie. This film, along with just watching the form, shows how other events often occur and / or illustrate subsequent effects. More than just anti-depressant drugs for filmmakers - children from Columnbine who have been filming for years have been in it, and Deanna has been afraid to watch the road leading to the nightmares. Until recently, they have disintegrated their products like candy and are now starting to understand the long-term effects of drugs. It was strange to see that the film was a little bit frustrated by the fact that the story of a mentally ill person in the mental illness aspect of the story was a dead hazel in every aspect of the mental illness. Bravo is for the director and writer who clearly sees homework on these topics. For those who think that certain things do not happen in a hospital (I do not want to give any information), you are also wrong about it - I've been there. <br /> <br /> <strong> It is disrespect to the people living in the Caucasus. One day we will thank you for that.
