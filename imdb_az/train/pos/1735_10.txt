Miss DeCarlo's main role is played by the United States Civil War, the Greater America West, its top, ballet, opera, vudeville, stage chief, and the Chinese in the French-Prussian War. When you think you can no longer buy a screwdriver, it does. This splendid, cheeky tongue is taken. DeCarloun's character (here referred to as Anna Marie - not Salome, but his dance role) is based on the famous career of Lola Montez, a freelancer of the King of Prussia who caused a revolution in his crown. . He ran to the west of America. There is a city called "Salome, Where's Dance" in Arizona, based on the history of Lola Montezin dancing here on Salome. StageCoach Cleve and his enthusiastic Russian nobleman are not accurate in terms of history, nor do I think the Chinese intelligent man with Scottish accent - but one of my favorite all-time camp classics and DeCarlo is breathtakingly beautiful.
