I love this episode, Ruth Gordon is good if it's not as smooth as it always is. It is said that music is very good and there is a mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is a huge hole in it, so you can handle a large truck fleet. It is determined that the light does not work. Do not you think that Clever Columbo or the rest of the police thinks that the light bulb is working? You thought you would not break the lamp in the shortest possible time, so you recorded it. <br /> <br /> This will not make Columbo a secret genius when the light does not work. but the expression "death bed" is unfounded for days.
