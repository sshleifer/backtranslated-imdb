Written by a writer who has featured a series of Murder Rooms series that featured ACD's adventures with Dr. Joseph Bell. I was expecting it and I was not disappointed. He made very slow movements, paying great attention to Sherlock Holmes's frustration when Doyle was described in a very precise and perfect way. It was an interesting character and was shot very well (digital video, unusual for a while). Although the actor is an actor who is not affected by the unwanted ACD, the player, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, was perfect. An excellent character exploration with the same twisted amount as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. See if you have the chance
