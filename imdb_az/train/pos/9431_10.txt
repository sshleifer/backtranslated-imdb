and this is a very disturbing movie. I can be wrong, but this is the latest movie Burt Reynolds has ever seen and acted as the actress Burt Reynolds. <br /> <br /> John Voight and Ned Beatty are also good. They are cautious and unaware; business people who want to enjoy the country. <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven's day before. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this film is that it still exists. In America, the people of the country are still vulnerable to urban disasters; <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It is still in rural areas of South Georgia. Not Just Past, Mobile, Alabama; Hurricane Katrina has not been repaired in this area yet. 10/10.
