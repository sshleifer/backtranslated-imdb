Hitocrine (translated as "assassination") shows the Hideo Gosha in the form A / k / a "Tenchu", which translates as "divine penalty." Do not miss this one, or the other classic, Goyokin Gosha! Hitokiri was not just one of Gosha's best films, but one of the best "samurai / chambarak" films and probably one of the best Japanese films ever exported. Be aware that plot details in all the complex Hitocrats might be a bit challenging for those who do not know Japanese history of the 19th century. Nevertheless, the main human drama is open and open to all viewers. According to the norm for Gosha, Hitokiri performs the traditional "loyalty to the lord" and "the right thing". However, Gosha develops her favorite theme with such a development that it really is to see this movie (actually with Goyokin). <br /> <br /> I think this is broken down in this way: a simpler, action-oriented fairy tale, we want to see Goyokin. <br /> <br /> If you want a very thoughtful, versatile (dramatic) drama, look at this one. <br /> <br /> (Okay, okay, to reform the Tokugawa Shogunate among many different samurai clans in the historical background, and to try to preserve it yet, and (2) try to establish the Emperor Mejiini as the supreme ruler of Japan. Of course, "Emperor Meiji" was officially annulled as one of the first reformations of the Meiji government, with the "reform" of Japan, with the pleasure of providing more power to its clans in the "new world order". <br /> <br /> In Goya's other films, Gosha's mature cinematic concept differs from Hitokiri, with each hit incredibly drawn, and Kubrick's Barry Lyndon can still be a part of the film, of course, the typical Dashnah Hitocrats are really distinguished by stunning backgrounds (As with Goyokine) many gravel seaside. Only the opening sequence xen and hook! Do not make a mistake, this is not a time in English: Hitocrats are extremely severe (do not tell if they are not warned). <br /> <br /> Does Hitokiri differ from anything else except the cool camera work? Performance is a bit thin in this sense. Katsu Shintaro (Zatoichi / Hanzo Razor's fame) turns out to be a star performance such as conflict hero / antihero, Okada Izo. Katsu instills a character that looks more like a wild beast against a human-like animal. Throughout the film, you're not sure if you're dealing with Okada's character or rebel. At the same time, Katsu's vision of Okada's honest hunger and respectful attitude to such a man looks like a person, but we are empathetic / sympathetic. Of course, Nakadai Tatsuya plays such a cruel man in Hitokiri after playing the heroine of torture in Goyokin. <br /> <br /> Like the last note, it is more interesting for miracles than casual fans, do not miss the last screenshot of Mishima Yukion (yes, the closed gay was a right-wing ultranalist who committed suicide by burying in front of the massive Japanese military squad in 1970 writer, made in 1970 by Paul Schrader, and shot a film about his life and works), in fact, honorable (for a murderer) Shinbei Tanaka.
