Very few films have influenced American culture in the way of Urban Cowboy. Thank God, it was temporarily. But you can not just pull your eyes off the UC when you miss the channels at 3:00 pm on 3pm on the 3rd floor .... my first trip to Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but next to this point. You remember that Urban Cowboy hit theaters and opened up every corner, and men did sports cowboy hats with cents and did not know how the two steps were counted as a social moron! Personally, I think it's a great movie. Travolta was really surprised at the SatNiteFever heels. Who was the seed? He really believes. Soundtrack is awesome. Very bad Charlene Tilton, the TV's Dallas fame, destroyed Johnny Lee's career, the boy was terrible. Here's the theft sting Scott Glenn, like a mossy ex-con redneck cowboy. And I do not have anything against slaughtered cowboys, but I always feel that I'm the biggest power line ... "Pack-S * # t" "Sort Clint's Day." Sissy watching the slap, the closest thing I'll see is my Julia Roberts fantasy ..... I said it was beautiful.
