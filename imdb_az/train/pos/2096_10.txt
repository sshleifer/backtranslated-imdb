With the IMDb's release, this kidnapped movie can now find an interesting audience. Why? Here, users who search twice over the Oscars, Glenda Jackson, find the "Soldier's Return" among his loans. Those who control Oscar Prize laureate Julie Christie may be the same. Ann-Margret's admirer, Alan Bates's career, can give his title one click. Ian Holm and Frank Finlay have no additional bonuses. Any film that has multiple assignments here is rewarded by IMDb, taking into account all the cross references that go there. So why is not this movie on the DVD? Do not the manufacturers understand that the internet movie base is a marketing gift for such a movie? And 'The Return of Soldiers' is a gem that is definitely waiting for discovery. Go, people.
