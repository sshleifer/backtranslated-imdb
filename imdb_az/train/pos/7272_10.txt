Before I get started, this stand-up sounds special when I play at Sonic Adventure I DX at the same time (especially the Red Mountain level) Director's Crisis. So when I stand watching this stand-up, I suggest - not REQUIRED, REQUIRED. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia goes to the stand in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > again. He sees a great deal of people's entertainment, and at the same time doing a great deal of truth on this subject; Several times I said that Carlos said a joke: "Damn, this guy is doing a good thing!" Sonic Adventure I DX: Game Over screen came on my TV after I forgot to forget that I played the Director's Cut. My worst :) So, yes, this is a stand-up special complaint nothing. If you have TiVo or something like this, give yourself a favor and celebrate this date.
