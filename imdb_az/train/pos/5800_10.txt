THIS WORLD WANTED MANY BONUS FILM !!!!! When I was 4, I enjoyed it and still enjoy it at 16! His absolute masterpiece! Completed without any video collection! I'm very pleased with every second part of the movie, and the movie has some great special effects, but it sends a great message to the audience, but the movie really is really cool! Although Michael Jackson is still in movies, people still do not see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He is very talented! Incredible! MOONWALKER MUST SEE !!!!!!
