The three main characters are literally captured by almost all film, Japanese refugees and philosophy, due to strange occurrences and funny coincidences. When they run away, we see what happens in their minds and how they see their current location. Running movements are a metaphor for the lives of these unfortunate people. As a rule, what we are pursuing for them is not really what you are pursuing, but in order to avoid their sense of meaning and personal problems and their dreams. Running makes them all really alive. The great-life-moving adventure ends in a very flawless manner, by chance, when it is in the middle of something big, severe, and cleverly laughable. Terrible director Sabu is one of the most favorite films of all time.
