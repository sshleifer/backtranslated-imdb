Stephen King's show is one of the best (if not the best). Darkness can be dark, non-Hollywood ends, a terrific atmosphere, good book cost, superior manuscript, education (playing with the next life) can be a short thing - everything should be a great horror ... <br /> <br /> My favorite horror film, flat 10 +.
