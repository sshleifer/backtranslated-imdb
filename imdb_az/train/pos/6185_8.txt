I saw a POPULAR WANE with the new Universal Pre-Code Kit and I was very pleased with the end of the car. The majority of other commentators covered the story, hiding a crime in music, but I wanted to add a couple of notes. Brisson and Carlisle are even relatively soft compared to even the smallest gamers, nor do they sound really good to read (Carlisle trained opera singer, Brisson a bit of his high and low notes). Big Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well with each other, with a great sense of timing that protects the ball from the number of music. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan Vanities girls, but do not forget Ernestin Anderson, an outstanding jazz singer in the "Ebony Rhapsody" number. Gail Patrick makes some of his early speeches, like Eve Arden; Patry would continue to be the executive producer of the Perry Mason TV series. Later, Jessie Ralph, like a wardrobe mistress - David Copperfield also (like Aunt Peggoty) and BANK DICK will spot her. Music is very good - Brisson presents standard "Cocktails" on two different scenes; Peyote buttoned girls with fried grass on the background of "Sweet Marihuana" (the blood is a fine splash on the abdomen skin); Together with the Duke Ellington Orchestra, Ebony Rhapsody and the combination of black and white dancers blended it. And I believe that it is one of the earliest music that makes this kind of confusion, and suits do not make any sense.
