Edward D. Woodun Haunted World, Jr. is not a particularly good document. From aesthetic point of view, it is indestructible and inexpensive, very discreet in people and looks like one, but adds to this attraction. I say that because oddball is a documentary about an oddball that prepares images and encircles each other, so there is no other way to document the life and career of a man and an error squad. There are both ideas about the genius and the tree's foolishness, and the description of both qualities is a credit that meets the true nature of the documentary. Generally, Odun admirers and generally a movie for a movie, but I do not expect glitter here. We are looking forward to a documentary prepared after the tree's own heart.
