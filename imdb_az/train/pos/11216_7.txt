The story is very unique. These 2 pilots who survive the earth have to use a special speed of speeding around everything. All serial time-laps, comrades, and pilots dealing with the teacher were the last ACTIVITIES. In general, I started putting down a low note and left a real mark, but instead, I'm glad that Disney has ended and it's too bad. <br /> <animation is worthy of 89, but can not be compared to today. I have heard too many complaints about nudity cheesiness. I really found a decent amount. Most nakedness episodes <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong>
