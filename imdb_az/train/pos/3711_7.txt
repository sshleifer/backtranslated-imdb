"Gingerbread Man, the first trilogy I've ever seen!" ?? Robert Altman In 1955, Charles Laughton directed Robert Hunter's "Hunter's Night", a fierce slice of South Gothic, starring Robert Mitchum, a sly killer. One of the most famous followers of the film is Mitchum's two children, who flee from a scissors when Mitchum sees them as a monster, raising children crazyly. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played an equally scary killer in another film in the southern United States, Cape Fear. This film is a local lawyer trying to protect his family, and at the same time Mitchum ended up with a terrorist attack on a ship. <br /> <br /> In 1991, Martin Scorsese tried to create and solve something more basic, "Cape Fear", the boat scene and all of it. <br /> <br /> Now we are Robert Altman's "Gingerbread Man" in the Southern Gothic language. Altman inspired "Hunter's Night" as he wanted to "wave his wings and take a pop-red picture" and he solved such a major movie, but what he's trying to do here secretly is in the Southern Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> So on a small ship we can get a showdown on a giant ship instead of a showdown. Instead of kidnapping two children, we ensure that two children are safely returned to the police. Instead of keeping the money hidden, it is given by the last will and the money of our money. We get a three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branag instead of a 1961 justice lawyer and a pardon decree in 1991. Instead of following the monster, we will get the hero who follows the wicked. Instead of entering the monster's family's home, the hero hunted the monster on the "home ship" of the monster. In the same way, Robert Duvall plays an innocent weapon instead of a murderer murder killer. . .etc and so on. <br /> <br /> Altman keeps running and doing his job by pulling the edges out, slightly reducing every side. His touch is the film that has been shot in the first half of the film in a harsh space, such as the traditional plot film and Altman's overlapping dialogue, casual narratives, accelerating camera movement, and lack of symbols. <br /> <br /> Despite the best intentions of Altman, the film does not actually go up in the Middle Ages. Altman is very prone to the trilogy conventions for the "very decadent" film, its style is too lethargic to create tension, and the film is not quite radical enough to reflect other canonical films in the genre. <br /> <br /> "Gingerbread Man" is thus far too basic to act as a cleaner Altman movie and Basic Thriller. <br /> <br /> Film is not a complete waste. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and generally unbearable Daryl Hannah, turn into turns in juicy performances. The film also has a beautiful atmosphere set up for a nearby hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting connections and turns. <br /> <br /> In the '90s, Altman, in the south of Kansas, , "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". Unlike Gingerbread Man, Kansas City and Cookie's Fortune solves the genres of Altman's most comfortable, wider, more relaxing canvas. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is more important than the desire for radical descent from the hierarchies of class, politics and crime and typical gangster genre frames. century film criminal writers (see, for example, "The Wire"). It should be noted that Altman claims that this is the first tension, but he pulled a tension film in an art house called "Images". , In 1972. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
