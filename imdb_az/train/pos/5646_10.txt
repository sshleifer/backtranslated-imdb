Recently, when I went shopping, I saw the American Gothic box and said, "I remember it!" In 1996, I was thrilled to come back and watch at CH at 1.30am (I was 14 years old). More and more, it was really terrible and strange, no one could have been as terrified as Lucas Buck (B !!). <br /> <br /> What is troubling me? Funny episodes, when did Dr. Matt think he was leaving? - so confused. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a writer, producer, or director's error (TV tuners behind the pulp are still the same thing - just watching shows like Carnivale and Farscape are not original in studios). <br /> <br /> - If you have not seen it and you say yourself a Sci-Fi Fantasy, Horror, supernatural drama ... FAN = YOU MUST. They said in the SFX when reviewing the box box.
