For the first time in 30 years, I watched "Elephant Walk" and emphasized how the story line resembled "Rebecca". Others say that a sweet young man stood upright by the lord of his soul, to find the marriage whose life was longer than one another, but to the marriage which was threatened by the imminent memory of a frail man. <br /> <br /> Allegedly, Elephant Walk owes a few debtors: <br /> <br /> Maltin is just two star Elephant Walk and is named IMDb, Bild Davis, Sri Lankan not the tea plantation, but the triangle in the Singapore rubber plant. Readers are not very good, but I am very glad that despite its predictability. Although Elizabeth Taylor has never been to a lovelier, Peter Finch acts as a good man, who can not be shaken by his unhappy father. Dana Andrews - Laura and Elizabeth's favorite, loved by the "Best Year of Our Life," are consumed as an admirer of imagination. The real star is a bungalow, one of the most beautiful halls in movie history.
