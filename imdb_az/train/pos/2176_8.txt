The story of obscure love pushed her boundaries and beauty into a beautiful quanta, which knew much of their premature death. The PRIX DE BEAUTE, which is placed at the front of the presentation, delivers a thin line for silent and full-silent film with noisy and noisy sounds with noise and sound effects. Everyone who comes to this movie is a little worried about the effect, because the sound is long-lasting and does not just help her. An adjusted soundtrack on a beach is part of the movie, such as listening to a talk, for example, an actress who dubs Louise Brooks's dialogue and breaks a spectacular performance audience. In addition, the film is much more or less good, here and there with a few jumps in sustainability - something quite common in the films of this era - and this indefinitely sped up feels silent. As a rule, this film is closer to a trial and closer to the style of Sergei Eisenstein, with visual representation and intimate climax, which is much higher than the pedestrian level. Here, Louise Brooks plays a lesser role as a recognized smuggler: she is a stenographer who decides to enter into a beauty contest, despite the strange opposition of a darling beloved lover. His role is quite 30th and modern for him; flash / Jazz was featured on the last screen of Baby's roles and now women are professionally represented in the film with the start of women's independence. The character of Brooks decides to leave his beloved (even if he is "at peace" with him) just before his time. But he is ready to believe in the things that do not have the fatal defect of his character - his lover wants her to succeed-and this leads to his ending in a movie theater. This last sequence was something that was beyond Hitchcock's extreme (something seen in MAN), and Brooks cut off his screen image and spit. Placing the "live" Brooks still alive, with a dramatic, surprising effect on a noisy, strong film.
