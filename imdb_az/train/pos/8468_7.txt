It's a strikingly fascinating thought that regrets paranoia. There is a lot to do for just a 74-minute business, but it works. Fears are extremely subtle, and are the apparent jumps that cover the latest Asian fright film. The way of "fears" is similar to those of the "The Uninvited" (The 4 Inyong Shiktak), but this is almost not the same level. The film does a great job of balancing a classic fantasy story with something more unusual and psychologically. It is not perfect, but it does what it should do. If you get a chance, I advise you to check it out.
