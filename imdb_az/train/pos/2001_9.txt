"I had the chance to see Oliver!" When he was a young teenager in a large classroom in Boston in 1968. Later, in the summer of 1969, I was delighted to see that this movie was featured in London's Leicester Square in a prominent movie after receiving the Best Picture Academy award of the previous year. <br /> <br /> <br /> Oliver's success recalled that both the scene and the screen will have all talent in Broadway and will not end in Hollywood. This legendary story made by Charles Dickens, part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was brought to London by the British Lionel Bart. Her charming music hit a hit in New York and around the world. The film adaptation was released in England in the summer of 1967, in 1968. Sets and musical numbers mixed the mind. "Who will buy?" Hundreds of actors and English filmmakers demanding the song have truly deserved the Oscars by properly combining the Oscars. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but mostly dedicated to the delicacy of English cinema studios such as Shepperton. Good show! Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have also been featured in many other film studios throughout the world for many years.
