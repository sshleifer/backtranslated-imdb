This is a good movie, a good story, great actors and great songs. Cinematography was unfortunately not bad. One of the weakest points in the film is the unwanted chain of the series that is copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Is there any harm to break some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Everyone? <br /> <br /> The film is about a new married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman-Rani). Priya can not understand after an accident during the previous pregnancy and finally decided to use an abortive mother who would carry her child. They get Madhubala, a strange prostitute played by Preity Zinta. Is the film really not realistic, is not easy to master? And if a girl chooses to do so, what does a man's sleep with? Did you hear the tissue? Perhaps, if the writers had not heard about it, the film would not have been prepared, so the concept was intentional. <br /> Salman works very well. It's good to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and inexplicable dialogues about his great love for his wife, and sees how difficult it is to sleep with another woman. Come on, cheesy and unreal. Rani is OK only; she is generally effective and tries to do something with her, but it is completely shadowed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, which holds the show with its impeccable performance. She is making a highly vulgar woman easily and naturally sensitive woman. She lives, emotes and loves the film, and at the same time she admires her from her role, partly for her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of his best performances. It is undoubtedly more promising than its contemporary. <br /> <br /> The end of the film shows what I have just said above. Tears, excitement, and very good moves. <br /> <br /> At 7/10 on the movie! 10/10 - For Preity!
