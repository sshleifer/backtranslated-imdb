Attention: soft spoiler. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith's story stands out as an incredible, even moving episode in American history and World Religion history. This film reflects the events that took place in the life of Joseph Smith, who paid for Mormons as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith was first shown as one of the youngest of a Brother Trinity (Alvin, Hirum, and Joseph). A very young age was needed. Operation without our modern facilities was bloody and difficult. The scene helped Smith to unite his family and show their parents, Joseph and his brothers. <br /> <br /> Yusuf's religious confusion and subsequent supplication, which led to Muslims' first appearance, were described in an interesting way. The face of Jesus is never shown, but you can see nails in their hands. <br /> <br /> This film does not accurately describe the history of the Church of the Mormon, but simply jumps. Stage scene. This is not a criticism - just a note about style. <br /> <br /> The practice of tuber and fur is shown, and this is especially dramatic and moving, because Joseph gives a sermon about the Savior's love with a terrible face <br /> <br /> The film is also a baby church of immorality as well as joy and growth, at the same time skillfully portraying a modern opposition that spreads to the heights of local governments. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes in the film, including Yusuf's life, including several beautiful moments that reflect his attitude to Emma. He tried to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, his bitter love for his wife, his infinite love for his children, his mind, his courage in the face of evil and dangerous opposition, his religious endurance and compassion. <br /> <br /> Joseph and Hirum have never returned to return home to Carthage, and most of the characters in the film that touched Yusuf's life were shown along the way, <br /> <br /> Recently, Joseph and Hirum's martyrdom depicted and filmmakers remain only to think about the events they are witnessing. <br /> <br /> When I watched the first movie, I thought it was accepted by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. Now, I do not think the movie can do something like that. As inside, I see that the film is Joseph's feast, and it strengthens what we already know about him. <br /> <br /> I would like to see how the film is watching foreigners - would it be like propaganda, a US epic story or something else? <br /> <br /> The beautiful weight of the movie, family friend, action and I hope it is a good thing for everyone. In fact, it is interesting to argue with many aspects of the events in the United States, our culture - freedom of expression and generally respected respect for the law - we accept the contemporaries.
