Oh, come and learn a little fun. When I was a kid, oh, this movie was worth the Oscar. I thought it was absolutely heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Now, a little stupid, but come. "Perfect adventure", most likely, should be entertained by Bogus Journey. This is, "Dude, where is my car?" It was before the movie. Only this thing is really funny. As I said, it's a good time. It should not be taken seriously and the first one should be like "Bogus Journey". A funny movie with some memorable characters. Just remember for a taste, look, leave, and memorable comedy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
