I did not know what Ned Kelly was looking for, but I really liked it. It was dark, dramatic and flammable. I also felt very safe, and I felt that I was transferred to the 1800s. Heath Ledger has never been an admirer, but I've just seen him in a teenage film, but this role is pretty complicated. Ledger plays with Ned Kelly's dignity and intensity, and showed us that a high-profile child was the worst Australian murderer. Naomi Watts plays a supporting role as Kelly's lover of society. Highly recommended - and from Aussie!
