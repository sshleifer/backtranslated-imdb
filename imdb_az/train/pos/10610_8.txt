A sweet-looking young man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) comes to a baby girl abandoned in the forest and instantly becomes in love with her. While Cara Seymour is a large part of a new family, elders in the city usually help to keep the child alive. There is parallel stories combining a fateful, small girl with a merchant (David Strathairn, in his creepy work) who is on a long hike and a terrific journey. This is a seductive slice of life in the same vessel as The Lillies Bloom Where and The Dollmaker. All three lived on these beautiful hills and covered the life of simple life - but not simple - the American people. Minimum strength is a language and short, but the violence shown is a fairly safe family viewing.
