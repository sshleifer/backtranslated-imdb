I loved this movie as a young child. At that time, I was thinking that the foolish baseball antics were funny and "cool" because the movie was connected to sports. Now, after a few years, I can look back and see what this is a good movie. This film opened my eyes as little children and looked at the struggles and real world issues that it has with other children. This kind of exposure, I think, is that the absence of children's societies in these days brings benefits to our society. Five baseball ants are now really indifferent, but they have pulled the kids away. The 7-year-old boy will not want to see a film about orphans, but they will ask him to watch a movie about baseball. Disney understood this truth and used it to teach children a meaningful lesson in the world. Al and other angels' performance in a young adult seems very little impressive, but I'll give a credit as well as all of the guys playing with Danny Glover and a fantastic job.
