Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot secret. I admit that I have not read a book, though the logical Agatha Christie fan. While there was no problem of adaptation, there were times when courageous attempts were made to humor and guide, and the events taking place until the final solution fled. I thought there were some slow moments, so some mystery was full. However, Hickory had a very similar visual style for Dickory Dock, a brilliant ABC Crimes, and actually put the atmosphere in dark with the camera work and dark lighting. The dark moments were somewhat creepy, this was helped by one of the worst musical scores of a Poirot adaptation, maybe one of my two shoes was not a concern in My Shoe, but gave me nightmares. The site is mixed with all the necessary ingredients, although it is not as good as covering my shoe and it's a good thing. The player was very good, David Suchet was impeccable (I know that I can not use it forever, but I can not say a better word to describe his performance in the series) Like Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran, Poirot, justice is brilliant in their integrated characters. And the students had great personalities and were well-developed, in particular Damian Lewis Leonard. In general, it is a mystery, but not the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
