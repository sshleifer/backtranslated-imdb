During the Second World War, most war films in the United States were of great interest, but they were seriously damaged by realism because they were more prolific in propaganda to raise their spirits at home. I'm filming these films, and most of them are still waiting. Nevertheless, they often hinder the fact that they are really great films for lack of realism. An excellent example of John Garfield's movie was Air Force - a B-17 took about half of the nearly one-fifth Japanese air force! However, the pride of the seas is a welcome move - it points to high points to describe a true story in a fairly accurate way. When I first saw this movie, I was convinced that it was not the truth, and I thought it would not be true. However, after having studied it, it is true that the true story of the two men who work hard to win the Honor Medal. This is a very realistic situation for real life!
