<br /> <br /> Many viewers understand that they are guilty of the film being shot as we are in the slam-bang part of today's cineplex experience. This film, like Ecstasy, appears to have wandered from one planet to another. Why do you think there are a few good reasons? <br /> <br /> Mainly, in terms of poetry, camera hills, trees, clouds and so on. a world that unites men and women alike. Together, they often cause a lack of style and dimensions in today's technology-driven cinemas, where firefighting focuses on the audience and is not concentrated. In addition, the story is not in the eye, but near the ear, but there is almost no dialogue to tell what happened. This is a far-reaching departure from today's very literal way, which means that the visuals are counted as thrilling audiences. But maybe the most disturbed movie is silent because we are expecting silent films sometimes. But I think that when we wait for the symbols we speak rarely. Thus, the burden of the story is distributed between the filmmaker and the audience. <br /> <strong> </ font> <strong> <span style = "font-size: - Prepare, just like Machaty I point out that the film has come out of a very different aesthetic today, and I do not claim to be better or worse, but I claim that Ecstasy is a missing perspective of the present-day cinematic experience that such imaginary values ​​are rhythmically slow and dull. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a masterpiece, and sometimes it is the artistic heights, so the beautiful beer combines the finer crane with the finest paintings below: The pantheistic nature of the life, nature and restoration of the village, slow pans are beautifully expressed, these are the scenes you do not choke, but instead give you a half chance - who is the spearhead of Jaws <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is particularly heavy when it comes to Machati's image, especially in the final, labor-gas circulation. It is difficult to know what a terrible situation is. Perhaps symbolism is linked to the heroic dimension of a loving hero and generally a hard worker for people - a topic is later supported by influential Soviet cinema. But his presence here is more tediously over-done. <br /> Anyway, I have to admit that at the outset it set up to see the prominent in the Target LaMarr buff. But now I have to admit that in this process there is more than a peek-a-boo romp in the woods.
