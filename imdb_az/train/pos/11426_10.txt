I think it would be more enjoyable if everyone thinks this is not a story, but as Colonial Africa in the 50s and 60s. Because there is no real story here. A vignette on top of one as a small light spot that does not give enough to capture just one picture. For the first time, I saw Chocolat that I really did not "win" until I thought for a few days. Then there was a lot to go, and I realized that there was not a single corner, even at the end of colonialism. Anyway, this is one of my favorite films of all time. The incident at the airport with short shower and beautiful music was a transparent poem. If you love "interesting" movies, do not follow it. But for some of you, then you can thank me for thanking you.
