Absolutely classic! The movement is flawless, the player is only superior. Words are short for this great job. The final film in the Mumbai Police. This movie has tested times <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a perfect performance, Smita Patil is less. All actors excited the best and movie racing at any moment. <br /> <br /> This film is totally shaken and forces you to re-think about many of the issues facing our society. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a police (Om Puri), who started out as an honest man in his career. eventually becoming a murderer. The first attempt at Bollywood shows the surprising truth about the backdrop of the Mumbai police. Kudos to Nihalani! <br /> <br /> After this movie, the Bollywood movie soundtrack broke out against the criminal politician-police. So this movie is really a pitch. This tendency over ten years preceded the Indian film scene. <br /> <br /> This film was a massive box office jacket. <br /> <br /> Open film must have a vision for fans.
