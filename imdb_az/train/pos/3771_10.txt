In 1991, the two best albums of all time were released: TERMINATOR 2: RIGHT DAY AND BILL & TED BOGUS JOURNEY. Secondly, I always liked BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. TERMINATOR 2: HUMAN RIGHTS is better, but there is nothing like Bill and Ted. In TOMMY BOY, along with Chris Farley and David Spade, it's hard to think more about comedy than Bill and Ted. <br /> <br /> According to your opinion, O.C. and created by Stiggs, Bill and Ted Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson. In the 1980s L.A. two literary writers who made a double inventor while performing in a local theater. Two people often began writing a scenario twice and long ago BILL & TED's AWARD ADVENTURE was born. The film, shot in 1987 and the 1989 film, became a big box office success and became a cult class immediately. Later on, the work did not start long ago. Stephen Herek, the director of the "Perfect Contract", after considering that he was very excited, and unlike his first, Peter Hewitt was the continuation of his debut debut. He could not have been a better director for the job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY has been strikingly directed. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY has become one of the best albums that is darker than the original, but it's just fun. Most characters do not change characters as well. Bill and Ted are the same lovers in the first movie. The reason is that it was written by original writers. Most of the tracks are not written by the same writers, but 'BOGUS JOURNEY' has the same scenario, but it's a good result, although not the best. First, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is completely cheerful, well-written, entertaining, and above all original. Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler, with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedy performances. The unforgettable "journey". 10/10
