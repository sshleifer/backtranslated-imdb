It begins about a year after the events in "Home Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. Speeding up in a car that runs at a speed of 110 miles per hour, he gets out of the way when he has sex with a player and ends up in Thames. He survives - he is not. The police psychiatrist hires Michael Camin (David Morrissey) to study whether he is psychologically tested. <br /> <br /> This film was even sentenced before it was opened. It continued forever to become a cast and director, script problems were fixed and the player was not happy (Morrissey often complained about the movie). Not too bad at the moment. There are many things like the first one - a tremendous music account, beautiful places, lots of sexuality and nudity (it should be edited for R), a beautiful place and a good toy - but it has no effect. First, it feels like a retread. People are killed with a buckwheat here (believe me) ... as the first one was killed by an ice pile. At a moment, Stone chooses an ice ball and looks diligently. He can play intelligent games with a man and connect him to the fence. The similarities are very clear. <br /> <br /> This is also the R rate - very open sex, men's nakedness (Morrissey looks bare better than Michael Douglas), women's nakedness (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The actor is good on the board. Stone here is simply fantastic; Morrissey looks magic but OK; <br /> <br /> So this is not bad at all, it looks like a restoration first. I still recommend it. People simply attack him, because Stone is not a good thing, and they think it's foolish to pursue them 14 years after the foundation ...
