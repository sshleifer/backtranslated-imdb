A very beautiful movie given by Boston City and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and a light film addict, he hit my homerun. Plenty of original baseball scenes with lots of laughs and real ballplayers and real references to the past Bosox failures. And how good it was to watch a movie with a baseball theme without trying to build a sad, hilly, self-serving Kevin Costner from a critical audience of religious believers? Jimmy and Drew did a wonderful job like a pair of young ladies suffering from Jimmy's Bosox "jones". It was a little bare and left from the field, but really Sox fans live through this fanatic and favorite team fortune. The film quickly accelerated and ended, though it had been predicted, without the ambitious ambitions, many other films had charm and emotion. <br /> <br /> Willie Garson's return to the screen was also nice. I missed the eternal celebrity Stanford Blatch of sex and city. He always laughs and even says a little. <br /> <br /> So you have to put yourself in two boxes, get some popcorn and get ready for fun. Winner of "Fever Pitch".
