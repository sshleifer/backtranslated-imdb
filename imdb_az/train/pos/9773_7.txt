The terrain is really terrible, the atmosphere is really depressive, a similar low budget production is unusual, and at least for German production. Together, Indian morality, mystical tension and slasher movie mix together. The development of plot and characters is great, with no studio-atmosphere very close to reality. It could have been perfect, but, unfortunately, some things have been a bit disappointing, it is not unavoidable for this unique low-budget movie: 1.) The cast is sometimes not at the moderate level. Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some people do a good job or a very good job, but some of them behave as actors in the notorious German court proceedings! But Mathieu Carri√®re's actor really liked it! His player (his many players in his movie was good) was here below! 2. Dialogs are sometimes at the soap opera level. But why is he still involved in the German soaps or channels on television today? 3.) Bad voice is sometimes very difficult moments that did not understand what the characters say. I've seen it on the DVD and I'm glad I can listen back and listen again. <br /> <br /> But all this is an interesting movie, a worthwhile movie to watch. often out of commercial movies that are more horrible.
