I just drew an episode about Brad, after his cruises, cocaine cocaine, which turned into a drug addiction on the street, came out as quickly as it had begun. I have to say that the story about biking career is more heartbreak than drug addiction. This young man, who has won bicycle races from left and right, is invited to train with the Olympic team for two weeks, and immediately after he comes out, he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes in the world, and generally is elegant and hostile to everyone. Obviously, she wanted to leave her soon. <br /> <strong> </ div> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> In any way, it's about how the show is put together, because Brad shows its height . We lay her in shooting and dancing, and even smoking cigarettes. I did not know that it was right to show it, but why is a camera crew watching it and filming it? <br /> <br /> Does this person hope that he will turn his life and give them a number of materials for a good TV episode? <br /> <br /> In any way, this is an illuminating demonstration, because it is a total control that can deal with various relationships and human lives. Sometimes it is difficult to watch because you really see how bad your family and friends are in the face of addicting indifference, so at the end of the day everything seems to be very clean. There are times when terrible events happen and everything is lost, but still, I have to warn about spoilers, everything will eventually be felt in a happy way, and it is a very unusual thing in real life. But still, there's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can not even complain about such a thing?
