This is my second time through A Perfect Spy. I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it. I still love it. Compared to Bebenin's other great Le Carre series, Tinker Tailor Soldier is naturally versus Spy. Tinker Tailor pays attention to the game "spies"; Perfect Spy gives us other arrows - what kind of spy. <br /> <br /> These films, along with others in the genre, also participate in a number of themes. <br /> <br /> Changes are moral, sexual, and male - multitasking, responsibility for love. <br /> <br /> Therefore, these characters are most happy when treated with the most swollen by those who love and respect them. <br /> <br /> The subject of fathers and father-figures is also important. . One of the most exciting heroes in A Perfect Spy is Rick, the main character Magnus' maybe the father of ersatz. He betrayed and betrayed the story. Every time you look at it, it's always a matter of trying to raise the ladder back to the point where others are not careful. Whenever they meet, Magnus says, "Do you love your old man?" and never, "Do you love me?" Maybe it's another place, but the Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another topic is malignancy. The nature of business is to transform others into their government, friends and colleagues, to turn them against their values ​​and beliefs. In every Le Carre movie I see, the Spy from Cold, Visible Glass War, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley People, and the Perfect Spy is the cornerstone of the transformation that turns to transformation and transformation. Finally, it's not an artistic touch - it's usually just a weapon shot in each of these films, or it's probably two shots that have ordered the story. Violence, torture, and cruelty are always on the surface. <br /> <br /> Their results are not like the streams of blood and dank prisons, but Le Carre's symbols, regardless of the complexity, are captured. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned films, and a perfect Spy pleasure, For treatment, I advise you to reach the level of complexity of the Sandbagger series (Yorkshire TV) in the 2nd and 3rd seasons, with the IPCRESS File and Burial in Berlin, although lightweight, is a great deal of English coup for political intrigue, House and Yes, Minister / Yes, the Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only one Brit will let his hand make three kingdoms - a movie with intrigue and complexity.
