Here's my skinny, I thought it was much older. But it's still cool. Bicycle mechs are cool and work for most part of the story. Some of the characteristic issues I hope are the biggest complaint I have ever tried to compel myself to work with Part 2 and to suppress all the MACROSS. Not just an animated style, but a few character designs. For example, all girls in this movie appear as MACROSS LYN MINMAY. The legs resemble MACROSS and other symbols. This is not really for kids, but graphically violent, nudity, and graphic sexual content. To make a long story short, I give this cool MACROSS 7 STAR.
