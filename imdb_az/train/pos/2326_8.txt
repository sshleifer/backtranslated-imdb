Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been so close to his older brother, Maureen (Emily Warfield), to begin to fall in love with his own brother's court (Jason London). <br /> <br /> It's not after a profound tragedy that these two brothers realize that nothing keeps them apart and their love for each other will never fall. <br /> <br /> This was really a heartwarming story about love first. It's probably the most painful story I've ever seen. All acting beautiful and Reese Witherspoon is a great performance in its first film. I would give 8.5 / 10 people per month
