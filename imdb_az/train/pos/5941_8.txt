This is an adorable short film that looks like a front view for a new movie by Batman and Superman Couples! <br /> <br /> This movie is a movie made by ComicCon, and by watching and watching BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> It's easy to separate from this movie. The effect of CGI is not perfect and I'm sure suits are far from perfect. BUT, this is a budget and a fan film has been prepared for this incredible. Especially surprised by the surprising Superman - he was a small man who had no children! If only for a real movie to be a front-view - there were fans prepared for Omaha to see them here. Great job.
