This is a continuous film that is an unusual movie. At some points, the clich√© appears to be oriented, and then it can actually be an exciting thing. This will go too far to talk, but you will be bored with this movie and will be rewarded richly. William Haines is very nice - he is, of course, a star worthy of being re-discovered. Jealousy subtext with Jack Pickford is beautiful - there is a scene where Haines sips Pickford's chest (Pickford's cold). Both actors play these subtitles well because there are many moving moments. And as I have seen in this movie, I never thought I would be involved in a football match, and I did not understand the rules! Also, the best of Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph, Haines's opponent for the girl (yes, it is not entirely gay movie). The magnificent silent classic is the best example of commercial cinema in the 20s.
