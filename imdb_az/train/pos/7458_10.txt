This game is a bomb and this year's 007 game and should be the biggest hits. I thought the Agent Fire was a good game when I bought it but then Nightfire came around and it was better, but now it's a new James Bond game. At this time, this 3rd person is a shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the game's graphics come out of this house. In this game like all the great actors and actresses like Pierce Bronsan, just like all James Bond, M (like William Dafoe, immoral Nicolai Diavolo and Judi Dench) (like if I write wrong). <br /> <br /> I'll give it to 10/10
