Dark Angel, a conflict between Huxley's Courageous New World and Perce's Love of Dream, describes a far-away future as the worst of the word, as well as a chaos and a harsh blaze of fear. Once all modern technologies can be stopped by Pulse, it provides an entertaining view of two main characters - Max (Dark Angel / bike messenger) and personality relationships. Logan (rich rebel). Perhaps some writers appear to be incomparable, but also powerful, sensible and sensitive, energetic, beautiful and attractive by Jessica Alba. I think Fox did it again.
