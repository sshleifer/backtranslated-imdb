This movie is beautiful. It's not real and heartless, but also completely insane. It is easy to fall in love with the heroes, because they have very different minds, but each of us can at least refer. In Canada we do not have many movies from Eastern Europe and Loners is the best I have ever seen. Very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and fresh, look at the Loners.
