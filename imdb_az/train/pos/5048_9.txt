It is a very dark and frightening horror-type tension based on the idea of ​​religious offenses. <br /> <br /> A man in the state of Texas in the United States is a full-fledged man who was executed by a person who killed one of their two young children after being instructed by God to save the world of the wicked. <br /> <br /> Bill Pakston is the film of God Clay, while Matthew McConaughey plays his best performances as the oldest son Fenton Meiks. <br /> <br /> The film is happening around Fenton. He will no longer be able to keep the burden of his deadly childhood and uses flashbacks to tell the story to the stranger for the FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> It is one of the many films from many movies that keep audiences chained up from start to finish. Even if you want to stop watching, you can not do it because of the true power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The directors have shot this movie very well and they help to build good scenery. . This movie is great, but if there are any shortcomings, some parts are very powerful and may some people feel uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Although the concept of this film is very dark, young children have ideas describing the bright motions. This is really a backbone movie and is guaranteed to provide you with the edge of your place. <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to see everyone who wants to watch this film in fear, anxiety and strong cinema or something else. <br /> <br /> 8/10
