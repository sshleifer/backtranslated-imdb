OK. I'm biased. I live in Shrewsbury, England, where this beautiful movie is shot. Now it looks the same. I remember quite a lot of shooting here, and in the streets I've been fooling for days. Often, when I travel to Shrewsbury, I see a street or a house, and I will remind this movie. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott's Scrooge is much more realistic than other screenshots. His physical appearance is not typical wrong. Scott's big and firm. <br /> <br /> After the past, the book is one of the most favorite in English. I do not believe in a large number of people who say they are unchangeable and can not substitute. This movie version shows all of them very well. George C. Scott may be an American, but he plays a part of his English-speaking brother with great skill. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you had not seen this version, I would invite you to this. Can be used in a very small amount ... or is it too meaningful?
