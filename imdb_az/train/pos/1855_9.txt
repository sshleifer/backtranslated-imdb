I have not seen all the films released in 2002, and I can not say it's the best film of the year. I can say that it is the best film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The majority of Americans are in the interest of the Americans with "Roma people" or "racial relations" or fall into the claws of the city's ghetto, an ebonic-phrased jargon that can create every stereotype. Antwone Fisher proudly stands in this regard: apart from a battle that can or can not be a racist accusation, not racist. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher's story, the resonance of any empathic individual. He describes Derek Luka in a thoughtful way. Denzel Washington remains in the background for the most part while using star power to capture the obvious film, allowing the movie to be the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> BET and generally the popular culture is a movie that speaks to all humanity at a time when many Americans (and Canadians know too well) want to protect their ghetoisity. Hopefully, the non-Black Audience will see this movie for humanity and will not see anything else but avoiding it. Because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the film. It would be a sad comment about North America and its racial connection. <br /> <br />
