I really love this movie and really want one day. It's an interesting legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, and I love it and want to see it again! I do not remember much about it, but I live in a beautiful village with a native American boy and do not remember what happened, but you have to go alone into the desert. His brother nourishes him a little and goes. There, though, some other Indian children run away and make some feathers and turn into an eagle. The legend says that you see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, that boy. I've always been amazed at myths, especially in American American legends, and would like to see a DVD on this freedom.
