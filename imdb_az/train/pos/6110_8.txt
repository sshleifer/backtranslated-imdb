Like "My Sassy Girl," this film is based on a true story from the internet, but similarities end. This story is usually a tutor called Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), whose name is Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo), who is trying to finish secondary school, but at the same age as her. Some obstacles, such as martial arts (always after Ji-Hoon, for revenge swings), then a respectable, frightening love-patient girl, the ability to teach lesson, and, in general, the whole story. Did I remember that it was a romantic comedy? This film has a good fight scenes, great visual humor and a lot of courage, thanks to good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, brings a lot of energy to the story. That's why romantic elements are also working. And, I must say that a girl like Kim Ha Nuel would like more than a girl from My Sassy Girl. There are some tracks, but this is more sweet, sweet, and good-hearted. The characters are more popular (as it has a hill to climb more than the "My Sassy Girl") - this is an obstacle to the film's credit, and the film is very elegant and interesting. The story sags, though, about 2/3 of the road (this is where it goes without a really interesting thing, on a standard road, where it goes a row), but gets closer to the end, getting it back a bit. Generally a fun, favorite movie. 8/10
