Neil Simon's job is pretty much, but it's his Odd Couple. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have a great chemistry. <br /> <br /> Those who support this movie are also beautiful. <br /> <br /> About two people living together are opposite planets. The scenario is humorous in this situation. It was previously made in some forms. <br /> <br /> Simon is engaged in a number of other good jobs, but this is actually the best part of his business. It's hard to imagine Simon's pressure so far.
