Cannes after the start of the word "Can Give Me This" titled "Father is still far from work". Why so many think that Kusturica's same but unique expression is still in her new movie, and critics are not going to touch her. My rest was a two-hour clean energy. Kusturica is still unique and unspoiled even if it suffers from lack of concentration and free space. Stribor Kusturica's stunning performance. More and more pictures of landscapes are then called "Life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has femme fatal world-class potential, please do not break it. Undoubtedly, I advise everyone to see this movie.
