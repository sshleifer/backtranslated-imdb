Okay, I really saw the front of this movie and thought for myself, what are the manufacturer's ideas? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY? How could a monotonous actor compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, both were the kind of chemistry that did not look like a kiss. Even David's humor heard Jolie's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he played very well psychologically, contrary to what Davut's life conveyed to dangerous situations. In general, I was very upset about writing and character development. I gave it 8 stars.
