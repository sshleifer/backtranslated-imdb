Raggedy is the first movie I've seen in Ann & Andy theaters. My dad took our brother and me and was funny - when we came home, my dad asked us: "What do you want to do now?" and we said we would like to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol and daddy took us to the theater to watch us again - at least I remember it. <br /> <br /> This film was scary at the age of five. With a scenic and hypnotic camel scene with the giant sweets ocean .. I do not remember much of this movie, of course, the beginning was magic and several scenes - I would find it again and would like to remember <br /> <br /> Raggedy Ann & Andy loves to remember .
