Yes, this is probably one of the best films I've ever seen, and I love it so much that I remember most of my script (especially when Jerry Lee stormed the windscreen in the storage unit) and even wanted to watch for Jerry Lee, the German shepherd's hysterical and really to see who is smart. Label line is also true. Although Christine Tucci is distinguished by a whisper, it's hard to say that the player is big (see filmography under CSI, I do not know what I mean). This movie is a film that only works with Dooley and Jerry Lee, so it would be great to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had grabbed.
