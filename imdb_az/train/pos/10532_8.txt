Leave the world. Take off my shoulder. <br /> <br /> So, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller), a kid, for the bull's theft. Neither was innocent, but faced with accusations and they did nothing to destroy their homes. <br /> <br /> Some countries have left their homes, except for houses. <br /> <br /> It's very strange, but funny. If you were alone in the world, what would you do? Two friends love each other's company and fulfill what they want. But it seems to be an old surprise. <br /> <br /> Then, hating memories, they begin to improve their lives. During this time, sound effects were great. <br /> <br /> Things were really strange at the end. This film is a product of a great imagination and was written and directed by Vincenzo Natali with the help of two stars. Just visible.
