This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a very low budget, it was good; As with my sleep problem, I can betray my head, even though my sleep problems have never been intense or worrying. <br /> <br /> I did a lot of work in research, focused on a good topic that I created and perfect a movie for, and acted well. There are several different goofs, but they can be designed; you will see it after watching the movie. The film is very personal and worthy to look twice. No movie was perfect, the Hollywood version could not have made the story better. all, 8/10.
