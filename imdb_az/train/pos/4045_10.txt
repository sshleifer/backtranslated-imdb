I'm very glad that a film has the chance to see this rare little ship. I saw it at an independent film festival, so do not expect it soon to come to town. In the film, I noticed that there were ten people going upstairs. They are very bad for them (in the south, people do not like to read subtitles). The film starts slow, but the dialogue I do not feel weak is rich. When the move finally came, I found myself rolled into a roller coaster as a tiny little one. <br /> I've also got a big shot of Chapter Headlines that have been seen before, especially when familiar characters appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> If you encounter this level boss, Zelda (Time Ocarina) recalled. <br /> If you have a future of these "video game / comic book" movies, I accept it.
