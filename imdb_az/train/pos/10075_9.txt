"Masks" is a moving movie that works on many levels. The simplest thing is that a street artist is a thrilling story with a small child trying to pass creative art (masks) to future generations. Although this story is very well-written (writing, moving, directed, beautiful production values), it's easy to get out of the situation, even though the old man is transformed into a job. And if you depend on it, the film is extremely sweet and invigorating. Kudos around. This is a nice movie for kids and adults. How to see Americans who do not like foreign language movies!
