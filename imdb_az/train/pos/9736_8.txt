Pegg appeared in "Hot Fuzz 2007" in 2004, "Run Fat Boy Run" in 2004 and now comes several times in the last few years, starting with "Shaun of the Dead in 2004". <br /> <br /> One of the most loved comedy in the film, "How to lose our friends and lie to people?" He shoots the movie. <br /> <br /> The film writes a famous newspaper called Sydney Yound. because he is not one of them. Anyway, one of the most successful magazine owners (Played by Jeff Bridges) invites you to work in the magazine (outside the nostalgia). <br /> <br /> <strong> Sidney, of course, was excited and moved towards the United States, where she met a girl who wrote a book there and said it was disgusting. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope this will be the case in the near future. Pegg once again gave people a good movie everywhere and I can not wait to see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy "Paul". Rate this movie 81%.
