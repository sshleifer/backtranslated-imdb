Now this is more like it! The first film was iffy dialogue and some weak players, but the team behind it later brought together its products and put a solid, thoroughly enjoyable, unpleasant and creative comedy that would keep everyone out of the seat. <br /> <br /> Seriously, It's full of great stuff full of creativity, and at the same time, there is less parody in the 80's. The scenes are great in Hell, and so are those in the heavens. Indeed, I promise you that you have promised this movie. The film's true final movements are not as bad as the first one, and generally enjoy a delicate and family-entertaining movie bliss's extremely stereo repertoire. Even Keanu Reeves, though roughly 30, is not bad here. <br /> <br /> I like something good.
