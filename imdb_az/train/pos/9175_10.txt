There are many adaptations of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel, Jane Eyre, and if there are numerous reviews about them, there's a lively discussion among them. Not all short films are able to turn the whole movie into a 100-minute movie. length, so these films only show a few parts of the novel. The TV series proved to be a more convenient form to show all the different episodes of the heroine's life. <br /> <br /> There are three TV mini series released in '73, '83 and 2006. not the least of all, is a brilliant example of all the worst and completely overrated movies of all Jane Eyre adaptations. The beautiful lines of the novel are replaced by insipid and subtle ones, and important scenes are erased or replaced with scenes that are not related to the novel. All of this leads to the fact that the novels do not have anything to do with Rochester and Jane and act as opposed to what is shown in the book, but their behavior and language are not entirely compatible. behavior of the period determined by the novel. These actors are an intelligent soap opera, apparently visible and moving in the suitcases of the 1850's. This "Jane Eyre" (as she challenges himself) is really a slap in front of Charlotte BrontÃ«. <br /> <br /> The 1973 version is very loyal to the novel, with Mr Rochester and Jane showing nearly full length. But the novel works fine, it does not necessarily work fine on the screen. Sometimes the language of the novel is very complicated and it looks naturally on the screen, and the constant interruptions of paranormal noises add an artificial and crowded impression. Despite the devotion to romance, the essence of the scenes is not addressed. Another problem is the loss of key characters. Sorcha Cusackin, a brave, self-confident, secular intelligent woman, confronts Jane's description with a literary model, and Michael Jayston, although not a good player, has the physical presence and the character he needs to play, Rochester. Despite a good adaptation, it simply does not convey the passion and intensity of the novel and will not actually capture the audience. <br /> <br /> All the errors in the '73 version 'are corrected by the '83 TV mini series' Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. From the point of view of the Prophet Timothy Dalton enjoys the important features for the role he has in terms of being a very nice, long and light Rochester: He has great physical presence, great magnetism and self-confidence and empowerment. And despite the touch he can not be denied, Thornfield's strange masters seem so awful and tough to play confidently. But the perfection of performance indicates all aspects of Rochester's character. All Rochester actors are the only ones to catch him: Rochester's harshness, provocation, moody and strangeness, its humor, sensitivity, modesty and deep and sad love. Dalton's performance with Charlotte Bronte's language is equally superior. Rochester's true and intricate thoughts are realistic and natural even when Dalton delivers them. <br /> <br /> <strong> She worked as Rector of Qafqaz University. Zelah Clarke plays an even more difficult role to play even better than any other Rochester player. He describes the parody of a novel, a shy, protected and protected young woman, but with great emotion and great will. On the one hand, his modesty and respect, on the other hand, his fever and ambition, his appearance and his sense of right and wrong make Jane's duality in a wonderful way. He and Dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes are pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> Like this version of the '73 version of this version, the Dialogue has been shortened in this version, but the key lines that characterize the character and character of the plot are unchangeable. Thus, despite the fact that the screenwriter was afraid of any artificial language, Charlotte Bronte's originality preserved the beauty and originality of his language. And, unlike the previous BBC version, the essence of each scene is perfectly captured. <br /> <br /> Romani's structure is being pursued with more precision than the '73 series. Jane is about a scene in which every episode of his life is staged for a romance where time and attention is given. Jane Eyre is a decent black-and-white scene of this novel, and Jane and Rochester are the only ones who have made fairness to the main and most sophisticated scene of the novel he's interviewed after the wedding. Especially Timoti Dalton plays this field with great skill. She works with painful intensity, with the sadness of Rochester, as Janein describes her decision to leave her, her attempts to kidnap her and indeed the last hopelessness she has left. <br /> <br /> It is a heartbreaking, almost destructive scene that will remain with the audience for a long time. <br /> <br /> It's definitely true and just right "Jane Eyre" with a perfectly executed, perfect script and two leading actors.
