I'm delighted to have Delany watching this movie with her. I knew them, but that was all. This film has bravado and courage to my eyes. What a pair. What sacrifices did they make to fulfill their lives on their own terms? This is not a film for all Americans but for African Americans. This is a history lesson and one kind of documentary combined with an entertaining movie biography. The players had the advantage of everyone, and we look at the difficulties these two sisters have had for years. Both sisters are very different from each other. They came to a very loving family and a very strong family. Sadie does not regret that her father did not allow her daughter to continue to see her due to a possible misunderstanding. I strongly recommend this movie and am happy to be closely acquainted with today's television.
