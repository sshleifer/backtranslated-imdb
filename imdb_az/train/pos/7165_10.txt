It's been a century ago, but today there is a round to watch. Because I'm sick, things have gone to watch! I saw that I'm glad and it's something I can wipe out and look back for the first time. This movie is so beautiful! The Whistlestop Cafe reminded me of Fried Green Tomatoes very much. <br /> <br /> When the story is over, and at the end of the movie, we see what the relationship is. Some people have said that this is a baby movie. I do not agree - this can be done by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I like it! There were moments when my waist cried. The story is different from any movie these days in adventure. I ordered my book from Amazon, wait!
