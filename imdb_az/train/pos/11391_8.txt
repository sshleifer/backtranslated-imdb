An American in Paris, Gene Kellyin, is a showcase. In any case, it goes out of Paris, moves and dances. Some are absolutely magnificent, others are pure corn. You can imagine Kelly as the only one who created this movie just one year ago as "Singing in the Rain". He is definitely one of the greatest of all time. In particular, Kelly's characters are interested in looking at parallels between the two films, but the main difference is in Paris and the other in LA. Some say that Leslie Caro's player is less than clean. Perhaps Cyd Charisse has done a lot better, but Caron's role is quite convincing and chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's short role in this film, just what he needed was someone who did not look like Gene Kelly. It is not easy to fill everyone's role, but Levant has acted as more than any other lead. <br /> <br /> Singing and dance routines are all excellence. At the end of the movie, even a ballet similar to it makes it a better movie. Seeing that there was not really much screen time to convince such a kind of affection, Minnelly used this sequence to make it look like he had spent four hours together with them. Great! <br /> <br /> I have to evaluate this movie with Singin because it's very similar to the story and song. <br /> <br /> <strong>
