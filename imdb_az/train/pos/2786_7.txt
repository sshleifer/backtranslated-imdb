It was a great surprise to me about the movie, it was a spectator. Anita and my films, as in this movie, have never been angry, maybe, perhaps because of Beckham's not being forgotten more than anything else. <br /> <br /> A film that has a bright shining message - if you have enough, you can do everything, and put your mind in that movie with those positive feedback. <br /> <br /> I think Keira Knightley has some of the best films she has and I think she's a brilliant actress and she's great for her role. Parminder Nagra was very bright. Unfortunately, I can not say for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers because I do not think he is a very good actor and his eyes were a little scary to be honest. <br /> <br /> All this is a bright film and a brilliant story
