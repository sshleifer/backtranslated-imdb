In the beginning of the film, Hughie (Billy Connolly) said that there was more than 70 people fighting with a rock festival to stop the strange fruity strange for the 70th British Strange Fruit song. Indeed, the release of music was popular and looked like an unpleasant antidote to punk. I am a fan of Stark Fruit, a longtime, weird combination of what I have agreed to (including my religious nature calls) as well as punk, and still a classic rock or glam rock. One of the main reasons for the movie is that scenes is the concern of the people behind. Brian Gibson directed the love of dealing with Tina Turner (with the dramatic parts of the film, the music was well developed), writings by Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais, REQUIREMENTS AND BACKGROUND English TV show RADICA and Harry Fruche's songs by Mick Jones (Written by Clash not to be mixed with Mick Jones), so it was about meeting people with conversations. Both of the actors themselves are musicians (Bill Nye does not know, but he gives it as he reads it and he looks like the lead singer of that era, Jimmy Nail is a television show with another British Music department, although I forgot EVITA), others they agree with it. As I said, more than 70 groups, such as Strange Fruit, have been mistreated by women, the movie does not make the same mistake (except for the woman in Timothy Spall); As the head of the merger, Juliet Aubrey is pretty good and completely round. <br /> <br /> Other actors are all good, Stephen Reaya, who plays a better role without a special praise. There are several unexploded land plots, but in general it's pretty nice. Oh yeah, music is very good.
