I saw it in the early 70s (when I was 16), and after the outbreak of the desert, long-standing, meetings, reforms, and so on. However, all of them fell into the context and I liked it. (Yet, I'm a very good age.) Then I seemed to be a minority. All the criticisms focused on the absence of action and story. Fortunately I'm no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Thank you for this tragic film, cruel repressions, commerce, and deception. I grew up and glad it.
