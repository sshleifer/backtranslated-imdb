This is a CGI animated film based on the French 2D animated series. The series ran short of the Cartoon Network in a short time, but for a short while, most of the people that I could say was "Huh" that I would be one of the potential Oscar nominees for the best animated film this year. This is the story of Gwizdoun, which is in the brain of the operation, which is more like a dog with Lian-Chu, the subtle heart muscle and Hector's fire farting spear. Travel around the world, providing services like Dragon Hunters, but without pay. A fairy tale comes from Zoe, who loves the only daughter of a blind king. Apparently, the world is overthrown by a great monster, and the knights sent by the king have never returned, or if they return as boats. In desperation, the king employs dragon hunters to stop the world eater. Zoe is certainly along the labels ... <br /> <br /> Why can I say something else, why is this film hidden under a rock? This is really a good little movie that totally stops the radar. His beautiful-looking, fantastic-looking movie (Continuing world, floating lands and naked creatures) always said to me "Wow." English Voice Lian-Chu (Forbid Whitaker) and Gwizdo (Steve Bucsemi) think that for the first time I heard one of the best vocal performances and Rob Paulson. At the same time, the scenario that speaks to the audience, using some realistic expressions, which is not normally heard in animated films (not Disney or Pixar), is also great. <br /> <br /> It's a perfect thing. No, some bits take too long, but at the same time damn fun. <br /> <br /> If you see your chance. One of the best animated films since 2008, and continues to be my favorite surprise for 2009.
