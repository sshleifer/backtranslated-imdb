This comic book style movie has a fun, beautiful pace of action and a great futuristic style. Commando writer Steven de Souza gives a lot of lines to Arnie after signing the contract and writing a pencil to the lawyers: "Send me a copy"; "Pains on the neck" after drowning subsea in the barbed wire; After splitting his body between his legs, he had to "split" himself. When Killian hit his billboard with his face, Arnie says, "It's hitting the ground now." Sincerely, there is a general similarity to Schwarzenegger's other fantastic figure.
