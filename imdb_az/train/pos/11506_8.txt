"Kolchak" was really a television series that did not fit into any category. The horrors of the party, the party's comedy, some public consciousness, and what we have in our minds are something that human beings are not ready. It's really shameful when I start watching these shows on the Chiller network, and I've never seen the original, and how different and interesting it is. Darren McGavin, Kolchak's International News Service correspondent and Simon Oakland, always showed the angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, followed by the requests of the Chicago News correspondent, who dubbed the story of the windy city for the horrors of the day scorching in a symbolic city. part of it. The main attraction of Macgavia splits shows. A weaker person who is always wearing the same suits can not help him, but you love him. His jokes are great, and he and the undoubtedly editor-in-chief of Oakland are obviously cheerful. <br /> <br /> Many of the stories are pretty good and the move is very good. 70 is not a great time for special effects, and the show suffers for it, but if you cease your blasphemy, it's a fun series at the start of this time.
