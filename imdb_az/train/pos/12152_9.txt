I saw this movie at HBO and it was really good ... really a tragic love story! The truth of the truth is that he does not use his foot as a result of an accident. It is rare to see a story of love that covers a person with a physical disability. I would like to think that love, which develops in this character, can heal one's love. Laura Leighton ... When preparing the 27th movie ... it was as big as a woman full of life to revive her heart. Unfortunately, his family is rich and his "problems" are developing. <br /> <br /> This month he plays HBO several times. Check the program here - http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ ScheduleServlet?
