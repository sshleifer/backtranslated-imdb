Cassandra Peterson first found out that Elvira's night-and-day fear films were created as TV-makers and suddenly discovered something unexpectedly popular, with suddenly finding himself with Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show. <br /> <br /> In the late 1980s, he reached the peak of his popularity, and the DOLLAR MISTRESS OF ELVIRA film was the result. Elvira, the owner of the television fears movie, is dreaming of the success of Las Vegas. When her big lady dies, she hopes that she will have enough money to go on stage; he is disappointed to find that he is an old home, a poodle, and an old book inherited. It is nothing more than a city's interpretation, and every kind of righteous wrath rises to the ground. He also intends to seize his secret cousin over a hidden evil robbery and "old book." <br /> <br /> No one will accuse him of being a cinematic work and now and then dragged. Take a woman who hates a few teenagers, a sack of bread, and a felony. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates a great sense of humor from the beginning to the end: combines humorous, sexy and acute comedy flashs with humiliating humor, dancing through movie booths and often as a ringmaster in jokes for self-deriding. From the FLASHDANCE disaster to the madness of gambling, it's less fun than fun. This is a great entertainment and the film's summary can create even greater stability. Will Elvira save her good cousin but save her day? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < STRONG> </ If you're in a mood for something stupid, you answer that way. And if you have not seen our curves, you will be in a cure. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
