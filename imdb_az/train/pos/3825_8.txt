After the accident, a young woman comes to her husband's house. He lives in this small town with difficulty, but soon he loses his son and loses all his hopes ... This can lead to any sort of outcome after a scene in a normal movie: finding a new partner and finally being happy; or suffers from depression enough to kill himself and eventually kills himself ... He tries to kill himself, but after a series of heavy battles with God. He trusts in God, sees Him alone, and even forgives the murderer. Well, I must be careful about God here, the film does not mean anything in front of God. The subject of the film is quite interesting: not in terms of women or in God's view (in this case grass plants will grow, clouds will blow, I suppose). <br /> <br /> Notwithstanding some of the movies, part of the movie, part of a movie. There is a lover around her and obviously there is a girlfriend, but she's on her way. He's a comic man, like a clown, who does not want to say, lonely around our hero. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < / STRONG>> We recommend.
