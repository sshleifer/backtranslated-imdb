I enjoyed the innocence of this movie and how it resolved the reality of having a strong animal among the characters. The scorpion looked horrible and the eyes were particularly vivid. Sometimes it is a little scary, and children are a little afraid without leaving. Rene Russo is a wonderful woman. Normally, Hollywood movies of this kind often feel the need to create a straw-man's life, but only the enemy gorilla. An interesting view of how some animals are closer to people, how they feel the same, and how they really can not behave as humans. Many movies are not included in this area and you do not want to think about human-animal similarities.
