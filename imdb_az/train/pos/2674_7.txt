If you have a boat, a boat, a bus, or a bus, it's a waste of time, then you need to place this part in an assembly to return to Hollywood movies. and do not miss out on doing this, and it is the result of showing realistic truths without restricting cinematic. Long-haul followers allow 'wait-in-line' to really make the audience feel the same frustration and feeling of characters. Sad? yes. Vital? Indeed. a sign of this journey is the key to the "homelessness" of this Turkish family. Excellent acting movie. Sad, but it's worth it.
