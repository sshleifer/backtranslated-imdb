It just came back from the first show of Basic Instinct 2. 2. I thought it would be quite unhappy with the critics and I was pleasantly surprised! If you like the original basic instinct, I think you will be invited at # 2 if not more. Great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. Music is superior to repeating the original theme. Look forward to the Academy Award material, enjoy and enjoy. Movies - Designed for escapism. I do not think a better way to escape the escape of Sheron Stonedan. I think I'll see it again this weekend. Go, look!
