What can I say about a film that is one of the darkest, most nihilist, and sometimes the most strange one? - I'm saying "sympathetic." I will talk about charismatic traitors and the best sword fighting in film history. Flynn and Fairbanks were at their peak? These stubborn, sometimes unreasonable, incredibly courageous and honest people struggle for the sake of honor and freedom. I liked it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great traitors. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender and sensitive.
