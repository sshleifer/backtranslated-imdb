Anyone who thinks about anime is nothing more than sex and will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a film that has investigated Tetsuro's revenge on his mother's death and is also a growing film. The holiday trip reflects Tetsuro's departure from childhood to male. The film's music and visual styles are somewhat historic (about 70 films) and the animation is only slightly better than the "Star Blazers" episode. But the stories and characters are very strong, not really important. Must be for any animated admirer!
