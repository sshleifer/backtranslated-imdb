The movie was very sweet and hearty! Every time I watch the movie, I cry. I would recommend this movie to everyone. The film was very inspiring for me. The actors played a great role and the movie played very well and began to be played. The movie was about a little girl with a parrot named Paulie. Paulie was separated by her parents because they would be the best for her. <br /> <br /> Paulie reached the cage in a cage where many people lived. Finally, this is a Russian man with a Russian job. Paulie found him in the basement, and Paulie began talking to him to tell him the story of his life. In the end, the man united with Paulie Marie (the little girl who raised Paulie). Love overcame all obstacles.
