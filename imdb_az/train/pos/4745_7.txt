I do not understand why they decided to release this movie to introduce the American audience to the dynamite of Jet Li. Legend Fist would be a better choice. In any case, Black Mask is not afraid, but this is certainly not good. The final battle sequence is staged by Yuen Woo Ping, who coordinates the Matrix. But English freedom suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I challenge Hollywood studios to release these films with subtitles) Jet Li shows the characteristic character of the lead role, and Fran√ßois Yip plays a cool, but short role as 701. <br /> <br /> The Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds some of its benefits, but is heavily loaded by gunfire and explosions. More attention was paid to Li's fantastic physical abilities. Black Mask is a decent film, but if you really want to see a great movie showing Li's skills, pull yourself a good and legendary Fist.
