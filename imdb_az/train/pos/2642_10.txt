Indeed, this is a "heart warm" film. He won the George Peobody Award, winning over "The Roots" to say something of the essence of the film. I'm looking at the internet to order this movie, because my old-time mother-in-law, Eugene Logan, co-writer of this movie died a few years ago and could not get any information from me later. I just want to see his grandchildren, my daughters, this movie, and this wonderful story for these grandchildren. When I was broadcast on TV, my eldest daughter was seven years old and I hope to see it again. One of my friends said he was a favorite movie. I will not let this movie out for you.
