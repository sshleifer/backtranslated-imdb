This is simply the best of Dicken's classic fairy tales. The scenario actually follows the story he wrote by Dickens and captures a perfect balance between the movie atmosphere and the playing environment. Followers who love both forms will find a story that is rooted in the presentation style of the selection. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott brings a true realistic approach to Scrooge's character and is encouraged by ghosts visits, which is very convincing in character development. It seems to me that he would convey me to the point where I echoed from the old darkness that rarely happened in other versions. The outstanding work done by the supporting actors adds a great deal to this product. This is just what I like most Christmas Carol versions.
