this is a great Disney flick.it is a story of an elderly high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid) who is on his way to big leagues like a whip once, but a damaged career has been damaged through the event series. Jimmy Morris (Quaid) is an inspirational that he tried with a big league team and even roster.this a great family movie, but it is very thick.it's fun and fun. but I am certain that they have some freedom to explain the story of children, though it is based on the truth. Quaid is a scenario like a hood character, very convincing. you can not enjoy it. 9/10
