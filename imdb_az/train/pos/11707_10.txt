I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, but it did not have any special effect, but the player was really good. Despite the fact that technology has changed, there is still the same message for today, perhaps it would be interesting to see if this movie should be rebuilt. I liked music from the movie, Larry Norman was a really good songwriter in this era, although now Christian music is now worshiping and praising. It was always interesting to know what happened to Patty after the end of the series? He went to shoot more movies, got married, and raised his family? I would like an update.
