One of the films exploring the cultural contrast of Eastern-born people in western cultures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sadly, Ken, a rock n'roll fanatic, marries Japanese Kyoto, and remains in the United States after his visa expired. The marriage is expected to be only temporary, until Kyoto re-acquires legal status. However, missing in every contact, Ken is pleased with Kyoto and works hard to get the job done. <br /> <br /> This is worse than rock n 'roll, thrown into Kyoto and avoiding all the girls' commitment to writing a song about jealous hearts and all of them. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto is the most serious Japanese upbringing and Ken does not expect to be all so married. Not only that, she is married and wants to return to Japan. It is a pity that someone thinks that Kane can and will be with her, and she thinks that if she thinks she can think so, she will not wait for the girl to stay for a long time. He does not want Ken, it is not just a thing, it's all used for life. She says: "I can not say how I feel English, and Ken can not tell me the sense of it in Japan." <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> < a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzzzzzzzzz&feature=" http://www.waplog.tv/default.php?show= "http://www.waplog.tv/default. php? show = id = 2 & Itemid = 2 & Itemid = 2 & Itemid = 2 & Itemid = 1 & id = 4) </ b> <p> <p>
