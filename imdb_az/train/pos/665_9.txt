"And All at Home" is not a special season, not for the first season, but I've seen this episode first! I saw this episode along with my younger parents in the summer of 1989 in South Carolina in my HBO room, and I remember that right and then buried in Crypt! I've always been in the horror series and loved the monster movies, and I enjoyed this again with a scary comedy, starting with HBO. The first episode I've seen is for me and for me as a favorite, it's like a memorable, beautiful twist. There is a wonderful comfy miracle on a snowy Christmas Eve, the perfect way to relax for the holidays with "And all through the house" holiday! In any case, you are also Mary Ellen Trainor (playing in a few scary brothers, usually playing in smaller portions), like a treacherous betrayal who wants to take care of her husband while waiting for some money and a new romance. Just watch out for the worst of the series, the worst and the worst of all, to get what they deserve. A manicade dressed like a Santa, who flies off a local nuts, prepared for a delay on the eve of the Christmas Eve is packed pretty much! Old E.C. When it comes to comic lessons, teach the bad guys the axes! Well, this fairy tale ends with a great holiday festoon! Also, this story was shot in 1972 and was featured in Joan Collins, which was undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the classic cript episodes of all times!
