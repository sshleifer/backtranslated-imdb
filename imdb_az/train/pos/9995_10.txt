This is a type of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, fire, and foot. It does not require much of the brain's power, but after a long day it's good. I would say that it is very unreal - do not worry if you expect something serious, but it is very funny. I think a businessman has agreed to live a while ago and will continue to enjoy it later ... I really do.
