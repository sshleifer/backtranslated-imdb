This film was nominated for the best picture, but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas beat Humphrey Bogart for the best player. I do not see why Lucile Watson is the best supporting actor, but I do not think he's doing a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and come to the United States on the first stage of the film. They go to Davis's relatives' home by train. Davis and Lukas were underground to stop speakers, so they were very tired and relaxed. But when it comes to home, there is a speaker there, and most of them can do that. After leaving the Nazi, he is interested in money and is ready to agree with Lukas. They have more areas, but you can find it for yourself.
