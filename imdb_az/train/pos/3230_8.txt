It's probably not as deep and meaningful as the Soldier Blade Runner, or like a large budget like Terminator 2, but we all found it pretty enjoyable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, in fact, made the most emotional moments of human corruption. I found a description of emotionally more restrictive impression from Arnie's T-films (and I knew Arni was a cyborg and Kurt was a human being, but the premises that both films were the same). <BR> Thus, the film's essentially a US / Brit cast can carry out this little story. I'm not really sure Gary Busey and his two deputies are baddies or goodies, so I could not decide whether I liked them or not. <br /> <br /> <strong> Kurt </ b> <strong> Kurt Russell is good and unlike other commentaries , I do not think it will have a negative impact on his career (perhaps, from the rescue of LA - sequels such terrible creatures!). Sean Pertwee, in fact, continued his family's Sci-Fi lineage and proudly made his late father. <br /> <br /> In some cases, in many cases, in many cases, in many cases, in many cases. I do not think you will not be disappointed.
