Although the Shining is more than a quarter of the century, I challenge everyone to make Jack Nicholson's oppressiveness to the nakedness. This is a rare example that no one has disassembled it; Instead, it has been appealed many times in pop culture. Gemini, Blood Leader, RedRum, insane "writing" ... should be seen to understand all the allies in everyday life when this is nothing else. The film is also scary, suspenseful, beautiful and psychologically interesting. Hitchcock's classic secrecy and terrorism of a modern tension. And what a great scare movie, a great script.
