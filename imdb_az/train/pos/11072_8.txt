all this is very simple. Jake goes to jail, goes through concerts and chess masters for five years. he lives in the history of his loss and failure as he is compassionate and believes in the observance of small pressures and the rules of small slavery. They decided to give Jake the ultimate freedom: because he believed he was the most feared of himself. <br /> <br /> Therefore, they take all their fears, all their pride and all their hopes on a journey they leave to rebirth as true master of their will. <br /> <br /> Includes the journey of fatigue, endless gambling, and games with us and ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
