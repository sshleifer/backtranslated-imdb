This movie was recommended to me by a friend. When I saw no advertisement or a trader, I did not know that Clooney was this and did not bother with the fact that its role. I thought the whole cast was appropriate, and we found the movie very enjoyable. The opening scene, along with a small group of military men standing on the edge of the road, immediately drew my attention to the whipped and mixed appearance. Here is a way to say, "Do not go, it will not be boring," and it really did not exist. It turned out to be a curious, light-hearted comedy with twisted folds enough to reach where you were ending, but at the end I felt a little deceived ... a little. The events have improved the way you expect to build a building, but it was a disappointment that ended up at some point, at some point that I could not define. I think it was expected that a larger bull would rise, but it was a low-grade species. If you're watching the movie and you're able to survive without a high dose of George Clooney, this flick is very fun and you have to watch something good. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's a rare coincidence in the United States.
