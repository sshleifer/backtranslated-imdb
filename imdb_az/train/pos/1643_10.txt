This is a movie that everybody needs to see if you want to see great play. Mr. Torn and Ms Farrell are doing a great job. I still think about updating it on television, so a new audience can do it. Spectacular speeches. <br /> <br /> The truth is that professionals need to be both physically and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Ms. Farrel was seen to be very young. I've always thought like a comedian, but that's not a comedy and it's just beautiful. There are very few dialog boxes, but it just looks real. Mr. Torn has a great presence as always, and his breath is a great feeling. You should not see the movie.
