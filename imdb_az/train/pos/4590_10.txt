Perhaps the film itself is not one of the best Jackie Chan films, but I think everyone is one of the best battlefields in the shopping mall. There were also some memorable stunts that made this movie a classic of action. This film has influenced many other action movies and I think that those who make action films have to learn from this movie (as they can make this scene, I can do things with modern technology). Although Jackie did not fight, there were some funny scenes that made this movie happy. Of course, in this film they can shoot more battlefields.
