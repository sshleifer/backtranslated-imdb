The "Last Hunt" was reminiscent of me since 1956 when I was 13 years old. This is the current contrast between the short and long term effects of indigenous people, the environment, and longing. This is related to the deepest and most relevant cinematography discussion in 1956. Fine tuning and cinematography are excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me until the end of the day.
