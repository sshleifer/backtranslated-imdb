This great movie could not get more than 5 ratings! Why not! Johnny Cash has done great things for God, which is inevitably inevitable and overlooked. In areas where less than a month to shoot films, Johnny said that he felt the strong presence of God who guided him through his steadfast sensation of Christ's passion. A great credit for anyone who is always in love with this bold film, at least Billy Graham's master of war has highly valued him to use it as the primary source of education for new Christians. Tailoring Fox to produce. The fact that this man is going through a difficult time proved to be freakish on his own is not a masterpiece.Movies canonized with the sound of this proven production! As a summary, I believe that this film is one of the world's largest documentary films and is clearly described in detail and is a great witness of Christian faith!
