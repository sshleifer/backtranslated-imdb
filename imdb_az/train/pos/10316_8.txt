Remember these two stories with joy and first of all in a very distant future, and see a young boy preparing for the test day and state i.q test. Some of her friends have already gone over and are eventually going to take the exam because the kids were a little surprised as their parents were concerned. Upon arriving, an injection is given to him and why he is interested. The exam is smiling and tells her to make sure she tells the truth. The boy asks, is still surprised, why not? Later, and when parents appear to have a message and state that they are upset, they are worried about the screen when they ask that their son has exceeded the national level and that they can ask for a private shop. The scene of the last scene! The Message of Philanthropy is a heartbreaking story about a blurry intelligence link between a girl from the past and a son of her day. In the past he went to a strange story of ghostly accusations and shaded the pages of his day. A beautiful story is a heartwarming conclusion.
