*** ALLEGATIONS *** *** APPEARS *** The story is full of memory moments (immortalized by Primus at the above price), Rescue explains the story of four children traveling to desert forests to raft their white water, turns away from the big city for a while to find it. This is not a Hollywood movie. There is really no special effect, the setting is extremely real and nothing is sugarcoated or beautiful. City boys resemble urban boys, and the tough guys of Louis, who are vulgarly described by Burt Reynolds, also resemble wild spirits during this visit. This is a perfect example of the film. A few friends were trying to avoid being deprived of the crime they allegedly did not know and forced them to save their lives, unless they had been rafting in the river forests. <BR> <br /> <br /> There is a very strong element of the film that interests the society and its class structure and the relationships between the rural and urban peoples. When four children come to the woods in the early hours of the film, they are unable to communicate clearly with those living there, and they are uncertain whether they will understand or communicate. This communication block is shown in the dueling banjoes scene in the most memorable way that they try drilling a car and a truck and driving a car down to someone else. Drew, and the invisible, and probably the mentally-guilty guy, dueling with guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis has trouble getting gas, and Bobby's genetic deficiencies and all that's so gruesome. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> When Drew returns to offer her a wink, after Bobby's death, Bobby tells her to give her a few dollars, knowing that she is not sure if anyone will react. /> This is something we see in the fire that constitutes most of the ongoing tension. It has ended with everyone, no matter what a lot of entertainment (including the funniest 'redneck dancing' scene of "O Brother") has been around. These people are apples and oranges and live in a completely different way of life. People in the mountains Louis, Bobby, Drew, and Ed are separated from modern society and contemporary laws and are not the ones who do not cover death to live according to nature. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is different from each other. Bobby is set up by the above-mentioned scene - it's going to make the most of the tension during the event, and it has crossed the river that quickly turns uncertainty about the lives of these people. I know that such a good quality of tension is a tragic element of the film, that is, attacks and actual murders, but it's one of the most memorable parts of the film. <br /> <br /> It is connected with the violent confrontation of two different types of people, and when can it happen? they suddenly find themselves in the war with each other. After a film hit the rest of the river, the trip to the rest of the river creates some spectacular tensions and keeps you alert by bombing you. Ed does not have tension when it comes to imagining that he knows very well the killing of a wrong man on the cliff and the tension in the movie when the team's three survivors reach the bottom of the river <br /> <br /> This is to give a suspicious explanation to the police about the events taking place in the river, because the deputy's mother is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a very uncomfortable movie. Its success is akin to a film like that which is intended to shake people a little. Hillbillies is the version of a sub-human redone (ie, a more realistic), apparently seen as a child, but shown in a very similar film like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2. None of these can ever be compared to a time dedicated to a time like Restoration. When natural elements follow these four people in the woods, the natural element is very real and we are well aware of it, and we know that such a spectacular figure is really the fifth member of the team, as individuals. Frequently a movie can not be found in this way.
