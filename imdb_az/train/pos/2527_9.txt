This is called "Sci Fi, Sci Fi". In this incredibly good "mood" movie, there is nothing better than Lugosi / Karloff. <br /> <br /> <strong> Karloff sees himself as a scientist, a self-righteous, proud and scientific companion. I thought about watching a man as if he were drowning in the above three concepts. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies I have something very pleasing. This time, Harrison put Ford into Carloff and thus Kieffer Sutherland in Bela Lagos. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best produced by Hollywood EVER. I said it would be okay. In no way.
