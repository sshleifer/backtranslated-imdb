Simon Pegg plays Sidney Young, a young fun writer who began his career as a well-thought-out magazine specializing in widening the loyalty and richness of wealth and dignity. Although he has a desperate desire to become famous, he is a career lampooning celebrities. Based on a very strange career of Toby Young, the magic of a small magazine called The Modern Review in England, the film offered all sorts of criticisms that many people could imagine that the magazine was packed in verbal bullets. and then went on to a magnificent career as a writer for Vanity Fair, which is said to be part of his life. <br /> <br /> For the first time in a major edition (called Sharp's Magazine in the movie), she was surprised at the start of the day, despite her nervous breaks. He meets with the editor-in-chief, Clayton Harding, who is difficult as his nails, but is the editor for the young refuge, such as Young, to continue his work. He offers very little in the form of immediate adoption, but it can only be described as liberal tolerance of Young's unsound antiques and inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> Most of the comedy in the film comes from the generally accepted general public behavior code of Young, or its misunderstanding or indifference to a specific label to deal with rich and famous people. But he believes that Sidney is causing such a strange act and has been outraged by the fact that he believes in respect for all popular cultures and believes in these old words. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to beat your hand. First of all, it is a striking example of Sophie (Megan Fox) representing the famous culture of Olsen (Kirsten Dunst), who was welcomed by Sidney's obvious stupidity and femininity. The endless attack of Sydney's creativity and stardom is a superficial lust, Sophie, with a star's appearance. <br /> <br /> Sophie is a very striking thing, it's true, but it's like having no idea at first. Alison is a normal girl, not very interesting or seductive, but Dunst's performance is a real person. His relationship with him will have all the facts of a Britney Spears marriage, and the film is still at an incredible level because it is clear, we feel it too. Saddam's pain has nothing to do with it (I felt it). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Danny Huston, Alison's other love has a great deal of interest. He also respects the white Russia, which is still up to date, one of his favorite drinks, Big Lebowsky (also playing the role of Bridges). Surely, and the purchase of Kahala in China is about $ 350, but I do not have any cuisine anymore. <br /> <br /> I was expecting Simon Peggin to be a little fame because I love his films, but I'm not absolutely convinced of his interval. He played a serious character in Hot Fuzz, but it was serious about the foolishness surrounding him and, as a result, he began to regain it, he was pretty Dead, Run, Fat Boy, Run and now Shaun How do you lose friends? He is a rising star, and will be interested to see what else he can do.
