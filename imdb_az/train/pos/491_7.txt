Take the connections to four people in a rock and put them in an island paradise where 26 people will be exposed to the temptation. It was a premiere of the show, simple, but ugly and funny. Leave the window to Fox for immorality and foolishness. It was like a real life version of Melrose Place. A good thing about the show is not about giving cash to each other and not manipulating each other. <br /> <br /> Lovers loved or hated love. It was like slowing down a terrible road accident. You know that you do not follow, but you can not help. There were many eye-brows on the edge of the drama.
