For the first time in 1996, I took a one-week job at a movie theater. <br /> <br /> A documentary about Edward D. Wood, covering life and movies. There are interviews with those who work with or know him. Among them are Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with movie clips or some stunning relaxation. It's interesting (somewhat) but it really needed it? I've seen all the Wood movies and they are just scared. The tree had ambitions, but there was little talent to do it. I was not the worst director, but there is. Do we really need a document in a really mediocre film? I'm not trying to be some kind of sacred. Some of the interviewers (especially Lugosi Jr.) have long been hated by human beings, and this is a great and clear way. In the 1960s and 1970s, the adult film industry did not have their entire movie. If you are an admirer of trees, there is still interest. The best interviews are Vampira (with tears from the tree) and Dolores Fuller (longtime girlfriend).
