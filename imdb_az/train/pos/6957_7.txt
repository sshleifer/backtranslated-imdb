My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a more entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The story is calm. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) faces Jenny (Uma Thurman) in the subway and gets involved in it. At the top of her relationships everything looks good, but then sees Matt G-Girl. It looks pretty cool from the start, but G-Girl is very jealous and in need. Thus, he decides to break up with her and make contact with her colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). <br /> <br /> G-Girl is very stylish, and she begins to take revenge on her former lover. <br /> <br /> Most of those who love me in the film are G-Girl scenes protecting themselves on Matt. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 10 to 7 and advise everyone who loves a beautiful comedy. Anna Faris,
