The former, great-grandmaster's exploiter filmmaker, Aladdin Adamson, is actually manifesting himself with a terribly delusional, fantastical, soft-core musical comedy oppression, which creates a foolish and dull depth of elegant celluloid silliness and jaw foolishness. Sexual totalitarianism in 2047 was regarded as an illegal act by the non-impotent bumbling idiot Controller (an entertaining go to Erwin Fuller) as Big Brother in the future. However, sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (bright blonde cutie pie Catherine Erhardt) remains certain to change the good things. With the help of Cinderella, its effeminate Fairy Godfather (a luxurious campy Jay B. Larson), Cinderella is a positive, unpleasant and fully accepted action of involvement in a great gala ball with a special deception of deception to her beautiful sister Tom Prince (dorky Vaughn Armstrong). <br /> <br /> Adamson addresses this ridiculous rope, tradition and tradition skills and inadequacy. A terribly surprising wonder about a terrible sect without a countless "absorbed" animal suits, like a crooked "forest", is surprisingly surprising; the rattling of the same "Mechnik Man" rattling a bunch of cunning cavorting robots. Louis Horvarth's raw, static cinematography, sticky plastic miniatures, Sparky Sugerman's glowing glowing disco account, and many unequal nudity (especially special for the special thanksgiving coyle Coyle) Robot law buyers are particularly irritating) and equally terrible speeches (Renee This great prize, Harmon's story about Cinderella's worst-minded stupid male police officers), has plenty of embarrassment in terribly intolerable intolerance.
