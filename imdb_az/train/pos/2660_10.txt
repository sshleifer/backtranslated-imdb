When I went to watch The Shining movie, I was expecting a decent movie I heard about it and liked Stanley Kubrick's many other things, but when I looked, it was better than I thought. Sometimes I felt a bit of my ridiculous feelings and could not look at my eyesight; there is still something in the film that is very disturbed about everything. Now some of them do not like Kubrick's The Shining version, which does not completely follow Stephan King's book, but Kubrick's version, mini-series, and the whole book are great. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance. You're even looking for a good original movie that will continue to think about The Shining movie after the movie.
