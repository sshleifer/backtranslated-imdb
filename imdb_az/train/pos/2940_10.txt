I've been to Delirious for the first time, just heard. I listened to all the comedy performance and never laughed at my life. Eddie's imagined pictures are attractive in painting and imitation in the minds. Finally, when I saw this to fulfill the order, he had to have me. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious shows his genius! With the new millennium, his actions in 1983 are funny as well as today. My parents loved it as teenagers, and I too (eighteen years old) love it too. At this point, I have to see other films such as Murphy's coming to America and Harlem Night. There will be no comedian like Eddie.
