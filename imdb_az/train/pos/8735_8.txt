Pixar's fault A happy world has been created for us in our lives; we are immersed in a universe that can only be described in a film, but it is a universally documentable animation world. Forgetting what a magnificent and charming world animation offers? Bug Life is a warm reminder when it is in its right hand. <br /> <br /> Only Pixar's second animated feature is that it's just about the hottest part of the movie and it's just a high-caliber movie production satisfaction. The Disney band, together with the movie Toy Story, three years before 1995, created a spectacular debut in the film world and perhaps a completely inadequate footprint. It was a film that challenged, re-invented, and animated a new life, and set a new level of excellence. <br /> <br /> Before seeing the film, they returned with double effort. To be honest, we all have a frustrated feelings before seeing the film. <br /> <br /> This is a film about ants. All trips to the world of insects and kidneys are covered in A Bug's Life, but this is the main point in the film, because people have dramas, romances and so on. How could such an insignificant animal like an ant can act as the protagonist of a film, able to provide the whole structure of a similar feature film? Surely, they shout. However, in Toy Story, we have forgotten that a bunch of toy box items could be the most beautiful, most inspirational and loved band of the amazing heroes and cunning. Children at Pixar are able to get out of the same job, and a group of dirty and tiny beetles are likely to turn into the most enjoyable and enjoyable group of fun you can encounter. <br /> <br /> Everything is absolutely delightful and pleasing? there is no unpleasant character in the eyes; even the villains have riveting characters? but they are colorful, they are eclectic and they are idiosyncratic. And it is even more strange to have a better era than the range of symbols, since it's just starting from the beginning, adds a different layer of clays that are already squeezed onto A Bug's Life. We will begin with our main character and our hero. His name is common to say the least of Flik (David Foley) and his character. The "black sheep" of the ghost, as seen in the film's opening moments, from thousands of loyal and obedient worker ants on the aquatic, beautiful island of Ant, by accidentally destroying the product of the season, the product of the mixture, Hopper (Kevin Spacey) because they are a group of locusts led by them, they want to continue their rage and autocracy. torn little ants; When they come to Ant-Island for their annual feast and see that their suggestions go, they get crazy because they do not have a better time. Hopper offers the package to get rid of the mixture in its hands; But there is a negotiation that is impossible to do. According to Flikin, the poor and the clock work in full hill despite the guilt and shame, and he suggests to rescue some of the strongest warriors who can come to the colony's rescue structure and hit Hopper and Grasshopper. If you think about it, A Bug's Life Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai or America's remake The Magnificent Seven is a serious, resemblance to the area that is intimidated, but a good-hearted nation has some serious resemblance to the bad and filthy by enemies? A single village village searches for help in the big city, finds it, and returns to the colony to get it wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a low and off circus troupe, which was mistakenly accepted by fighter fighters in an incorrect bar room by Flyk, who helped during the kidney life. <br /> <br /> This scene is more fun, and these circus group bugs are very fun. Among them are the faint-stick insects (David Hyde Pierce), the quasi-femme fatale ladybug, which is semi-obese obliterated German caterpillars and actually a twist and male ladybug (Dennis Hopper) by the name Heimlich. <br /> <br /> As we know, there is a lot of fun and greatness, because it monitors mistakes and insects interact on the screen. character lines, beautiful stabilizers, and flicker situations, and often give the character of a movie that's going to be seen. A Bug What makes her life even better is that children do more than just watch this movie, but most of the film is just not limited to children as it can take it? Small child-friendly situations are a bit higher than we want. <br /> <br /> Despite this scene, it's easy to ignore these errors, and it's incredibly easy to use this movie. <br /> <br /> Although Bug's Life does not reach the standards set by its predecessor and what's happening, it's a startling thing here. Pixar showed that Hollywood was a very talented and talented group of Hollywood filmmakers, not merely a wonder. It raises the bar forever, and if someone always exceeds their standards, it is always permanent. What else is there about talking about life? it's not as good as Emeryville, the California nation, but is it thrown most of its year? <br /> <br /> <strong>
