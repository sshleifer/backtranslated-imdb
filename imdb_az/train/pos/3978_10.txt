I was delighted to read Martin Torbo's book, "I Can not Find My Home", which is packed with information about American drug culture, covering the 1945-2000 period. This guy knows himself! I found it was a perfect spokesperson for this documentary. Especially I am delighted to watch the hippie movie clips and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. It was related to melodies of every era that composed the absolute. Hopefully pack them and sell them as CD kit. I would greatly recommend those who would like to know how the US culture has changed in the 1960s when talking about the experiences of the LSD. One missing thing is the record of George Jung (Johnny Depp's "Blow" movie), responsible for most marijuana and cocaine that came to this country in the 1980s.
