This movie is not for everyone. You do not have enough brightness to get "it" or not. The admirer of fantastic films, who do not admit too much, will definitely use this movie. It comes to those who appreciate this film for consciousness and parody. Everyone I recommend this movie delights. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you will probably enjoy this one. Sound features are made in a dingy manner and a liner flies quickly and furiously.
