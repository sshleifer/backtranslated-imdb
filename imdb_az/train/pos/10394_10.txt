A magic journey prepared by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. The two TITANS movies of the British cinema blended some incredible items to create a masterpiece! The most entertaining early Technicolor, SUBIMA and Shimmering Miklos Rozsa completed a wonderful work, including a musical ball, Sabu's young theater, Conrad Veidt's theatrical and harmful treason, and the beauty and voice of June Duprez. Miles Malleson, the father of Basra's dictator Duprez, also wrote a spectacular scenario. YOU ARE UNDERSTANDING! Since I wrote the comments above, I can say that I have not seen a picture after viewing DVDs in the last few years since the DVDs - the accuracy and resolution are very precise and the colors are very striking - a beautiful classic can be watched once and never gets charmed, rejoices.
