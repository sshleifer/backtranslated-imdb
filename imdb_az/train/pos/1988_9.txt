First, in 1958, the final music to win the "Best Picture Academy Award" was called Gigi. This is the wrong information, such as the West Side Story, won in 1962. In 1965 he won the "My Fair Lady" and "Musical Voice". So this movie is fantastic! The story from the novel has changed somewhat, but there are more restrictions than it is at a stage where one film does not return to a version. But I'm crying. In fact, I think that all production is better than the novel. I love Nancy Oliver bringing him to bridge and then killing him in the apartment. The subtleties in this movie are laughing at me. Mr Bumble and Mrs. Bumba, at the outset, love to leave the governorship. The bottom line for this moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, the best Dodger player in any movie version of the story, Ron Moody, fun and humorous Fagin (this feature is better than in the book), and Sani Wallis is Nancy's most powerful, most striking version. The only reason I have given this movie from 10 to 10 is the two major production numbers called "Yourself to yourself" and "Who will Buy". I always hate it when it's like people who do choreography in music. Especially when they dance at London Meat Co., they have to do regular choreography for these scenes. But I hope this movie is a rare treasure with us.
