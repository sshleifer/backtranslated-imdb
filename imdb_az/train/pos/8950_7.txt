For those of you who do not know Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his next "little" movies in his career. Kim Novak is a magician, but this is not a big movie compared to one of his other paintings, but it's not bad and it's a decent time. <br /> <br /> In New York, and for some unexplained reasons, she decides to write down a poor Jimmy to be in love with her. Over time, the cold and independent Mrs. Novak begins to fall in love with Stewart - and, of course, in the witch's rule, it's a certain NO, NO! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its sensitivity to witches. They are neither voluntary nor powerful. Most of the magic is quite limited and meaningless (using Jack Lemmon's power to extinguish street lights). And, very surprisingly, the witches can find people listening to hairdressing and crappy jazz. Given the idea I'm thinking about jazz, it's really sad to be a cadet in the world of this movie! <br /> <br /> Although the movie is romantic and gentle comedy, it's not something I will not hurry to watch. The player is pretty good, but the script does not offer enough money to make this extraordinary movie - in fact, I shot the movie 6 - really close.
