When I was a teenager for the first time, I read the book, then I saw the movie one night. I checked the IMDb a year ago and found the current copy. <br /> <br /> <strong> I've found a site that offers war movies, and I am very happy to have a copy I made, and I sat down and could confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film really comes from reading a copy of the book and then watching the movie. The book is no longer written, I watched a copy through E-bay, Author Alan White was a commando / parachutist involved in secret confidentiality operations during the Second World War, and that was his first book. Written by a person who knows, and I believe that this book and movie is authentic. Due to the nature of the film's end, it's not as good as a movie, I just did not give a movie. There are several lines of land that differ from the book, and this is strange as it is about the war, not by the large-scale nature of the war. The film has shown this very beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a copy of the book, <br /> <br /> If you can watch the book and the movie, she definitely deserves it, and just wish for more read and see, and better, one of the best fighting movies ever!
