I'm grateful to Cesar Montanoya and his crew once to revive the concept of Visayan. "Panagoy" hopes that in the present (more than Tagalog) it is ambitious. Polish and lifestyle details are clearly reminiscent of this region of the Philippines. Terrible: The dark and stilted player of the American antagonist. The other item, which had not been evaluated, was not the true truth in the same "suit" suit, and most importantly, the bright red carpet he thought he would pass to passengers in the 1930s. Without these tiny but bright details, Panaghoy pulled my rating from at least 10 to 9 - daghang salamat, Mano Cesar! Additionally: This film burns Peque Gallaga's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which provides a distinctive look of Visayets during the Second World War. Alos, cinematography Spilberqin has some parts back to Color Purple, and the story reminds "Noli Me Tangere".
