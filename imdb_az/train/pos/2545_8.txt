The Invisible Ray is an excellent demonstration of Boris Carloff and Bela Lugosi's acting talents. Carloff is fraught with a flawless job as a visible scientist and coincident scientist before his scientific advances with others, even with his wife. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, who is passionate about his work, still has the time to be in a good position with everyone, but still no real, invisible, close friends. It's one of a few good things to do and plays very well. But it is difficult to hear the elegance, and he believes it is French. <br /> <br /> The film's biggest problem was based on the notion of "old science", but at the same time unnecessary science also worked well. As ideas and theories are completely ironic, when the movie is ready, they are "relevant" today. And they will come forward and will always be. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie perfect for watching again and again. Maybe I saw this weekend 5 times and sat down fifteen times more easily. Imagine and science is fun. I highly recommend this.
