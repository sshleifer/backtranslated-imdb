I'm working in a library and planning to love this movie five years ago. Well, I love Parker Posey (he's a beautiful actress) and Omar Townsend was really cute as his lover (he could not move, but who cares) but the movie was bad. It was nothing funny or sweet. Posey filmed with energy. However, he learned the Dewey Decimal system, and then gave shelves a ton of tonal tones to the music car. ??? Come on! Also, there was a problem I was looking at in a bag, glasses, humor, when I became a full-fledged librarian in the last hairstyle - can we ask for this stereotype? Looking at Posey and Townsend, but about it. Television series was better.
