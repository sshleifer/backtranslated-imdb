My brother brought this movie home from the rent store and I was expecting it to be such a pit. I think that the title was specifically for me. I can not remember the beginning of a movie with such little expectations and we have completely won. I watched two films before allowing my brother to return to the store. One movie is that it's too small to talk with me. I'm completely close to Ruby's situation because he is trying to build himself up in life. The bad thing about this movie is that it's so fast it's over. I could watch for hours. Another disadvantage is that Ashley Judd has been dissatisfied with everything he has done since. It's so beautiful in this movie. This movie is easily accessible at the best ten times of all time.
