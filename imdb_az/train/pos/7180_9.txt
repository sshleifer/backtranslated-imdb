Wavy, strange, magical and cheerful! It is not possible to laugh at watching this movie. Darren Stein presents his 1980s family movie camera in South California. This is an entertaining film director and his motivation and an interesting look at the ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a powerful word, but do not we watch films manipulating in any way or in any other way? <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, boys in the movies seemed to be without shirt when possible. Later, Darren talks about her homosexuality, and you can see her at the earliest ages of the flamboyant (great hints). Maybe it was just Southern California weather, who knows? </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> In the book "Put the Camera on Me", 80's Trade has an untouched appearance. You will remember hair, music and fashion. It was a pleasure to walk to the memory tape because I was just at the same age as Mr. Stein. <br /> <br /> Over time, the movies are dealing with dark topics. Child abuse, Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction. No childhood is completely careless, and Stein deals with these issues, at least it is interesting and beautiful to say. <br /> <br /> See at your earliest convenience!
