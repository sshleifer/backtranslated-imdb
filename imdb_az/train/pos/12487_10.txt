Dark Remains is a straightforward and simple home business. The film is full of creepy visions and the most exciting horror veteran will be able to straighten out from the flat seat. Particularly staircase scenery, these guys are good. Despite the fact that they do not work on a large budget, everything is fine, but the actors are coming. Dark Remains has one of the last comments that can have a negative impact on some commentators, but you're thinking of it. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are in the same place as a sad couple who live and rebuild, but some side-by-side drawings like Sheriff did not please me. Not all of them are important. I give Dark Remains the perfect ten ratings for any latest studio dream story / Japanese remake more than ten times scary.
