I really enjoyed this episode. When I watched the flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow, and Aquamania (though it was all in the water), I expanded my eyes. I'm looking forward to seeing many of the founders of the Justice League losing Lex Luthor. This theme is a bit out of the ordinary, but the live action of the Justice League show will be a reason for me to close everything I've done in the week to watch an episode. This is the excitement I have watched on this episode. Please note that this episode took a little longer, a two-hour special event, because I felt that one hour of the Justice League was not enough. Now I'm giving birth to you (if I've already put it on my head), Smallville is still cool. The show lost its touch when it turned to Lana. But I am sure that the writers will only fall into that pit hole. Enjoy this episode: Who knows when a good person comes out? Repeat this Thursday, February 22, if you miss the first release.
