I loved it! Fred MacMurray is a very sensitive saxophone player, who is as beautiful as Skid Johnson but is always in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), but at the same time a very modest, proud. Maggie meets Panama after completing a boat with Anthony Quinn after leaving a boat. Toni threw himself in his nose after spitting on his nose, thinking of an empty woman because she threw her hat into the public. The big darkness and Maggie stuck in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie always has it for her when she needs her. He invites you to go to New York (watching and learning the film well). While playing the saxophone, he has beautiful scenes in his hands. I strongly recommend it.
