This is better known as John Holmes, Mr. Curtis Estesin's ultra-captivating porn star and second film based on his life. Boogie Nights is also based on rough life. Maybe one day someone will shoot a movie in the life of Tommy Byron. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is described in a very good way. There are many Law and Order episodes from Wonderland that are more folded and turn-around, and the director can never get any kind of criminal gusto. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly dependent on Holmes (and no prosthesis this time, unlike Boogie Nights) and he is looking better than Reverend Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not represent a single individual between sand. Critics who are racist, unprotected, or have a relationship with their spouse can not get a lot of character. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film, Eric Bogosian, calls Paris Hilton to "lose". <br /> <br /> Everyone who is interested in the most cunning side of the porn business in the 1980s or the real crime should not miss it.
