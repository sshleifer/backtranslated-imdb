Fascist teacher Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who is lensed by expert photographer Dean Cundy, as well as at a height of 10 meters) is planning to open her top absolute square. Random Rock Randell (PJ Soles, PJ Soles, which illuminates the screen) is a hot one who is an obsessive fan of the RAMONES punk band. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, the great rimmed sunglasses and nerdy roles can not hide his beautiful beauty) Combines forces with the RGG to break the probable crisis of the hopelessly killed rock'n'roll of the hopeless mission. /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has succeeded in anything like Tom Roberts, but plays an exciting role as losing. Kate is strange about Tom. It is only possible to remove his head from the sand and see it. Clint Howard postpones the film (honestly you can cast this movie out of the Shales) Eaglebauer is like a "supplier" who can do almost anything. His office is in the boy's toilet! <br /> <br /> <strong> RAMON </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Someone only says, "Let's have a life of 1Â½ hours." The film is really anarchy ... If they love RAMONs with love, it's heartily (even if they are horrible actors, they have the opportunity to win a new audience with this movie). <br /> <br /> Completes the entire film. Riff and his classmates overturn secondary school and start a massive party. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! If it is not conventional in any way, this movie will only make a confusion. The movie, accompanied by a great rock soundtrack of the best songs of RAMONES, lets the viewer overlook the headlines and take on the life of a person when people spend a good time. I think that was the days.
