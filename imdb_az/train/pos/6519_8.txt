This movie has great stars in previous years: Ingor Stevens has never been so beautiful; Yul Brynner was a numerous convincing Jean LaFitte, contradicted his piracy and wished to be impartial with the United States. Charlton Heston did a pretty good job like Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a little stilted. It is a really good flick of our students to learn a part of our history, and it shows that happy ends come together and not entertain lovers - sometimes they will have a better understanding of how long they will succeed, finding partners in a floating and similar background. Every year I have looked at least twice a year; and although I'm not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
