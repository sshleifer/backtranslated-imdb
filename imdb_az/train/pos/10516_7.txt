"Emma was a product that was first called by the Great Jane Austen Cycle in the mid-90s and was recently featured on the British television, undoubtedly started with" Pride and Prejudice "two years before the writer's interests created by the Second Greater Jane Austen Cycle. Currently, Austen biopic "Jane's" at cinemas, and ITV has released three television films based on recent Austen novels. These include the Northanger Abbey, one of the six major novels that have not been shot before, so the cycle should be okay. Certainly, there will be more in the near future. (By the way, his beloved "Love and Freindness" (sic), short novella "Lady Susan" and somewhere, together with his two unfinished pieces "The Watsons" and "Sanditon" /> The main character is Regence, a young lady from the aristocratic family in the UK, Emma Woodhoused (Some viewers believe that Victoria died before the Queen-England Queen Victoria was born.) Emma, ​​in terms of finance, is more than Austen's heroin, Elizabeth Bennett and Fanny Price Her husband, Harriet, believes that Harriet's vision of a respected religious figure, Mr. Elton, is a good idea and does not have to find a wealthy husband, but his main interest is to find a husband for his friends. Disaster is wrong, but Elton does not care about Harriet, but Emma loves herself. is a great miracle for a friend who has a relationship with a non-married partner (good reason). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ Em> </ em> </ em> </ p> <p> When Emma always marries himself without love and finds a partner, fine, Mr Knightley thinks this will be a really good marriage. Nevertheless, there may be something very passionate (like Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy). Knightley, from Emma (aged 21, 37 years) is older than sixteen years old, resembles a father-figure that is related to marriage, more than his lover. In fact, it is more commonly seen as his father's father, more than a father-figure of his true father, more difficult and logical than the old hypochondrium. Knightley, who involves her for her lack of behavior, when Emma is rude to her intolerant mixed and elegant friend Miss Bates. (The surname was probably intended to show his gentlemen's character - the 19th-century masters liked to consider themselves the modern equivalent of medieval princes with the codes of lines for themselves). Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam play a very good role, but this is not really a big screen romance. <br /> <br /> I like the other symbols of Harry, Juliet Stephen's legendary Mrs. Elton and Toni Collette. I know that the novel Harriet was a nais young teenager, though, here's more of a character played by Collette's "Muriel's Wedding" - Twentysomething a little heavier weight, drowning the chances of finding a man. Nevertheless, I felt that this characterism worked well in the context of the film and did not deprive Austen themes. <br /> <br /> "Emma is one of Austen's more luminous works, Mansfield Park" or even "Proud and Prejudice", and it's on display. besides the ugly ones who are very short, what we see is the "poor" people, Mrs Bates and Daughter, and today they live in a beautiful flower bed, changing their hand to change £ 500,000, sure that their poverty is relative, not necessarily. In the Emma world, poverty is defined as not having your own home, which is, of course, not a comprehensive description of the life of the 19th century, but no one claimed Austen as the Regency equivalent of the zinc realist in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this film as "Sense and Sensitivity" in 1994 or the latest "Pride" yəcəyəm. and advance to the situation, despite being implicated in the middle a little bit, but I have a strong start and a strong finish, even though, according to the adaptation of Austen very unpleasant. 7/10
