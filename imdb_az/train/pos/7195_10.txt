I liked this outgoing series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even hard, picture quality is not good, but OK. In this series, the sword is a bit worse, but it's not terrible. They just have to apply a little more. As I said, the story is great! You are sitting there and waiting to find out who is Don Del Oro! The theme music is excellent! The Fightin Legion is the same guy who serves music for the Zorro Walt Disney version, which serves music. Suits and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and legionnaires! I like this series very much. Get it! <br /> <br /> I love playing Reed Had Zorro! She's funny, smart, and brave! Mark: 6.
