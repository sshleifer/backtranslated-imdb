I am not tired to say that this is one of the best political heroes. The story is in a predicament, but it's about killing Kennedy. A true and honest broker (who played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by a single man, Daslow (= Oswald), and although they wanted to close the case with a group of other officials. The scenario is tight and fast, and keeps the tension up to the end. The Milgram part of the organizational authority is somewhat out of place (although somewhat uninteresting). The last sequence - Icarus explains who it really is - is shot in partial slow motion and is the strongest sequence I've ever seen in a film intensified by Morricone soundtrack.
