This cartoon is a masterpiece! Story, music, animation and story in all the noteworthy places. I saw my wife again for the second time, and I got more ideas from her. We have invited a few friends to see the Spirit with us and really enjoyed it. When they asked them to come to see them, they realized that they thought they were a movie about their horses but later realized that it was more. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lilac Creek, whom Nathan Chasing Horse recalls, with Smiles The Wolves is a lot of dances. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit for the third time and wanted to see it again. The spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors. They are "Spirit" because they are realistic, disharmony and non-stereotypical, unlike the "Road to El Dorado" film, which is a common individual, because it describes American Indians' image in a disrespectful and stereotypical way to American Indians. But Dreamworks has saved me by making a beautiful movie that I think is acceptable to my Spirit! Hopefully, they continue to prepare more animated films like the Spirit, and I would like to see the Spirit's continuity or spinoffs without respect, dishonesty, and stereotyping of the poor of America. <br /> <br /> Come and see the Spirit to do this is an open idea to make and pay: Cimarron's bear.
