As seen by Martin Scorcese, the great, full and passionate summary of American cinema. I have to say that there is never an exciting moment in the 4 hours of operation. Many genres, episodes, and directors are examined, more controversial in terms of cinephile rather than contemporary directors. For everyone, even American movies or movies are generally of interest. A masterpiece and the best of the BFI series of the Century Series series. <br /> <br />
