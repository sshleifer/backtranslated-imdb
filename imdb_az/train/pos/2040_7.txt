CREEP is a serious horror movie that was created in real time by people who want nothing more than just showing them to attack an underground platform just 85 minutes by a mutant. And only. There is nothing, nothing. Director Christopher Smith, the drama, of course, as far as possible after being locked out, giving away some of the reasons for being on the subway. He leaves the shadows that the titular Creep is deliberately uncertain (the illicit experiences of the sixties) and works very little mystery. Unfortunately, he is pushing himself to the end (which is also pointed at) by jumping from a bending end to where there is more genetic malformation. Yes, you heard me right - I wanted a twisted clich√©! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is better than a terrorist woman, and the rest is good.
