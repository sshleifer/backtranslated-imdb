This movie is finally being run on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this movie many times, and I realize Italy once again when it's experiencing a particular dictatorship (or the US) in these days (2003). I am glad that you are proud of performing in this film, featured by Mastroianni; <br /> <br /> When returning to the movie: As many people say, the actor is good, but sound background is good, but in this world, Sophia Lorens struggles to be strong and known as a human being. it's amazing. Unfortunately, if you do not understand Italy, I should not think that something has been lost, but I can assure you that it is really possible to distort the truth in Hitler's ever-present radio chronology of Rome's visit <br /> <br /> A masterpiece! <br /> <br />
