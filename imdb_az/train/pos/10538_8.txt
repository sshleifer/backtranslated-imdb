I'm working in a movie shop and, therefore, always has a great view of the movie. I decided to check anything as I sat in our Canadian section, and I was trying to support the film industry of our country. I'm a surprise. In the film, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller present a lot of fun and a very entertaining story that comes to our relationship. The combination of these two characters is consistent comedy and some funny exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have a cable!"). If you leave it within a half an hour, what can I say without hesitation that it is worth the fight?
