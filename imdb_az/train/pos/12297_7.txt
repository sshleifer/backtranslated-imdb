Anna Christie (1931) In her turn, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, a year later, was shot in Germany with a new toy, only highlighted and English version (both American MGM production).

Here's a woman who wants her love without losing her independence, but it's like a strange old fashion anyway. There are some missing scenes - the Coney Island section is shortened and not good - but in general, this is the direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques-Feyder (Belgian-French), simply repeats what has just been done.

From a previous movie - some storm, but Marie Dressler (English version) has a scene as a short scene, with her friend traveling on a canal over a canal. But they are just silhouettes and when we look at the next scene, we see the parts of German actors. <br /> <br /> Of course, old immigration, fraudulent fathers, girls returning to prostitution and problems are obvious. finding genuine love - especially with strong European trends (Garbo, accordingly, plays a Swedish young woman).
