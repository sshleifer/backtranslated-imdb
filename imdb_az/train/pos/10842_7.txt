Instead, I leased it. When the guy in the video store described my Hardcore Logos, he was called Still Crazy. So I rented it. Like? Yes, yes, Crazy is still a punk band, but focuses on the classic rock band, but that's okay. Still Crazy describes a rock band Strange Fruit, scattered on the peak of its popularity at a major rock festival in the '70s. Twenty years later, all members of the band fought for life and will give a concert on the twentieth anniversary of the festival. They accepted the proposal and decided to reform permanently on the journey to Europe. Some comic hijinks and all the characters pass through subtle changes. Looking at this movie, you feel like a documentary viewer from a participant very carefully. This is not bad either.
