A great family movie ... gives you a lot to think ... There is nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The scenario is very large - so ... real ... such things can be in everyone's life. And do not forget about acting - it's just awesome! Just look at Frankie and you'll know what you're thinking ... This picture is really can't-miss!
