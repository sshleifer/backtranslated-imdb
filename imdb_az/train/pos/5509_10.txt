I will review all the films, because I think how to think and be watched. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> While talking about the movie, watching one and two parts behind each other, I'll be together. <br /> <br /> Can Anderson, Steven Soderbergh and Benicio Del Toro. br> <br /> This movie is a refreshing, brave, strange and real movie. And he listens to a new style of the movie. No Faux drama. No bouncing sound track. Faux is not documentary style. Just clean the pictures and try to drive them to facts. I read John Anderson's book, "Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life" and recently completed Fidel's Auto Biography, and I had the opportunity to properly moan this movie. But I must say that John Anderson is a complete, post-traumatic, and beautiful biography that gives this movie a proper backbone. Anderson became a consultant on this movie (or two of these movies). What makes this movie a real thing is pure. It is even more important not to swing music or slow moving photography to increase drama; There is no fake documentary film camera. Just square shots and straight shooting style. The type of camera you are using is felt in the woods. For this, Benicio Del Toro should not be given a full prize, and at one time he never doubted the film as Che. He has done a wonderful job, and I will never respect him for that. Some people are involved in filming only part of his life, but not all. But I think it's one of the really good aspects of this movie: everything does not work. It does not work to "tell the story." A person's life is very convenient for a 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32-hour trial. This is one of the delicacies of this film, it is resisting humiliation and intends to direct us to the Force, Opposition, and For Transition to the CHE. Batista in Bolivia, Che's U.N. Outbreaks and Gorilla preparations During the fight, 3 slots are highlighted. "Motorcycle Diaries" already told his young man and, instead, he welcomed S. Soderberger to draw attention to other aspects. I'm referring to John Anderson's book, and the film remains true. Only weak contact Matt Damon tattoos (not executed). In a film full of live performances by a Bolivian American (Matt Damon), a snap stretches - it is good, but after so careful casting, this is a great place. Small and completely forgiven. <br /> <br /> This movie is almost a straightforward video. <br /> <br /> Put this movie on my list. The truth is that Benicio Del Toro gives you the rest of the cast and gives you the incredible job. <br /> <br /> It is still necessary to keep this story quiet about how cold Cuban ethics will never allow Cuban revolutionary Cuban to turn into possible things. <br /> <br /> You need to see this movie and John Anderson "Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life" does not go beyond the implications of the right propaganda that violates this topic.We have a global mindset about the expansion of international / political chess movements of the 40s, 50s and 60s, Let's start with understanding the early effects that helped.
