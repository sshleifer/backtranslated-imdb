One of the low-budget movies from Germany! Is this the dark side of the new age? If you believe it's esoteric, do not follow this movie! it removes all positive fantasies. this film shows the world of extremism and terrorism beyond the peace facade of the search for a spiritual soul. I hope that soon will be 35 mm copies! Andreas Marschall's first film is the beginning of a new field, he shoots a few euros! waiting for the second shot!
