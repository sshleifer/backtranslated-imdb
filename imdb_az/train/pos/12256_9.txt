Kate Beckinsale is an excellent Manipulative and yet irresistibly attractive Emma in this television adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read this novel, I wondered if the protagonist really deserves to be regarded as a hero of the story: honestly, he was so afraid that he was justified and did not want someone to be loved seriously. But Kate Beckinsale's interpretation makes her feel even more confident about Emma: she is fully described in all manner of betrayal and generosity and can not help but helps her (not love). despite their less-loving qualities. Kate Beckinsale is a key, but it's just how nice this TV series is; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Cercill, who fully characterizes this character's personal magnetism (due to the fact that Eman McGregor did not work well with Emma's screen adaptation in 1996) Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams their roles. This production is generally a great success and many times looking at each other with pleasure.
