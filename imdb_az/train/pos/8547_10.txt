Many people hate this movie, but I blamed them for two truths - 1 - wanting to be as big as the first pair of American Pie films. <br /> <br /> Let me also note that this is very important to me. <br /> <br /> I was the best of all six of my friends and I love Dwight. The area can be estimated, I'll say it, but then what is not a teenage comedy? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds, etc. They are incredibly predictable but still funny fun! I'm telling you to watch it, I love it, I find it cheerful. <br /> After Naked Milani and after watching one of these, just talking about all American Pie films, Stiflers. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Enjoy. Love. xD
