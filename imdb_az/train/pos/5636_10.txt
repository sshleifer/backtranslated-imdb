In "Brave New Girl," Holly comes from a small city in Texas, singing "Texas's Yellow Rose" at a local competition and admitting to a prestigious art college in Philadelphia. From there, the film turns into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I liked this movie. It was a great performance and movement and characters full of action at a very good speed. Acting was certainly nice. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were both prominent as Nick Roth. The camera work was really good, and I'm very happy with it (it can be done later). Kudos, the director and all others involved in this production. Most of the film archives are silver.
