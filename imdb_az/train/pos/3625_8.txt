Redford is the best picture on this baseball since we are naturally on our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths display a great story and illuminate it with a fairly realistic cast to draw you along. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The drift, Australian actress Rachel Griffiths, a native of West Texas, plays better than many Texans I know well; and Dennis Quaid was perfect? earning wannabe, gonnabe and modesty with more psychological luggage as the average follower of the audience. This is true. The chemistry screen works. If you want baseball cardiac heat, I'll love this movie. There were items in America and apple dresses. My explosion was "la mode". <br /> And hey: Buy CD! Music stones and stories in a magnificent way! <br /> <br /> Critics: I gave baseball to someone else. It is necessary to clarify the stories synchronizing words and music. But Quaid has something that teaches us everything that character and heart. St Rita and her daughters were a beautiful decoration, but they never really found their place to open and close their place in the story. It's a little long. The last analysis is worth every minute. 8 / 10. <br />
