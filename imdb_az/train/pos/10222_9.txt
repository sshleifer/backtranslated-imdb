Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte's team play an unpleasant duo to give a series of exciting performances and titles at Angel Levine. <br /> Zero married Ida Kaminski and two of them belonged to a special class of old Jewish poor in New York. Mostel is proud to be tailor and his trade, but his back and arthritis have hindered him from working. Kaminsky is mainly bedridden. It has reduced the appeal for welfare. As desperate as Jimmy Stewart, he is begging God for help. <br /> <br /> If he had anybody like Henry Travers now, he might have worked differently, but Stewart had difficulty accepting Traversi. But Travers had something to do with him, for over 100 years, he was far from the deadly board and lost all contact with the things on the ground. <br /> <br /> Belafonte did not accept that she did not accept the resignation, so she sent something different to Mostel. Harry Belafonte, who recently died, said that at least some basic training for angels should be given. there are still many issues. She is also Gloria Foster, a wife who does not know the past, hit a car at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> There was a farewell ceremony for Polish and Jewish people. Ida Kaminski, the best actress in the Main Street store, a few years ago, plays a great Jewish doctor from the Irish actor Milo O'Shea. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised to hear and hear that I have a part of the true physician, remembering the verdict of the Sanhedrin. <br /> <br /> Angel Levine raises a number of interesting and troubling questions about faith and race in this society. Created by a magnificent cast and, of course, by famous writer Bernard Malamud.
