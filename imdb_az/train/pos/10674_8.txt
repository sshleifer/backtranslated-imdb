I do not agree with one of the reviewers who compared this movie to American International Pictures. Basil Deardon, post war England (but without the sentimentality of the "Blackboard Jungle") is directed by a brutal realistic film with an honest attempt to describe the growth of the younger crime. Cinematography really was as perfect as losing the horror and isolation of a large residential complex. The property seemed to be an old prison. Stanley Baker was excellent as a reassigned detective detective for "emergency, emergency - cursed - five icy lollies" - a juvenile division! He is the gate of many jokes. David McCallum has shown that fifty years are one of Britain's youngest talents. (Played a very different role in "Hell Drivers" in another Stanley Baker movie). Johnny and his inspirational fanatics were very scary. Ann Heywood was as good as Katie Katie. <br /> <br /> Detective Jack Truman investigates a series of allegations of accusations by someone whom he calls "Firefly." Finding a proof that can lead to progress, she is assigned to the Juvenile Department - she is very surprised to find that she does not have a proper police job. <br /> <br /> 6-year-old Murphy twins are making a deception at local lolly stores. <br /> <br /> Brothers, charismatic Johnny, and their sibling Cathie while taking home the twins. He can turn the young children into gangsters, the life of terrible dwellings. When he is busy with his family, the fires see a strong relationship between Johnny and a dreadful Chinese young man working for laundry. The local priest (Peter Cushing in an unusual role, far from Hammer's horror), Johnny saved some of the burning building when it was small, and explained a greeting to a hero. She wanted to regain her sense of importance and to be useful and illuminating the fires. The schoolteacher was very realistic and felt the fear of watching children - the teacher missed (only about his own safety) and locked him in the room with the hero! <br /> <br /> After this war, I thought it was a really great movie that was trying to show some of the UK's social problems. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
