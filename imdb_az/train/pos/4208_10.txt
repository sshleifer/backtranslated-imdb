Every now and then, it turned out that this movie was not heard by anybody and was spent in a very short space of time with very little money and resources but that everyone was surprised and surprised something great. It's happening on 50 in many movies, and many people have never heard of it. There are some unknown big surprising little jewels that really need to win over 50. "Panic in the Streets" is a film that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Some films are really movies that are not dependent on the time of the genre and are made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> How surprised I was until I liked this movie. It was a really good and good movie. Like all 'old' films, it tries to get started so slowly, but you're into the story and the character you're really looking for in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film contains a really great story, but the movie does not start even though spying. With a touch of film-noir this typical criminal triller begins. But it's not really a movie by the "Pick Up in South Saki" numbers, so it soon starts to take its direction. <br /> <br /> Even though this movie is fascinating, it's really up to date to watch. <br /> <br /> I really liked the character of this movie. None of them are really good guys and they are all weak and defective. Really humanistic. In particular, Thelma Ritter has a great performance. He was even nominated for Oscars. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the biggest woman I ever saw was a role. <br /> Even in spite of the obviously low budget, this is simply a big, original, tiny little movie <br /> <br /> 10/10
