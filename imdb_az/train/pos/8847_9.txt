When I watch a movie and do not look at my watch or watch at a time, it's going to be pretty good when it's going to last, and hoping the final scene is not the end of the movie. I'm not a movie-maker and movie theater dissect. If I watch movies and they are interested in me, they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed movies have killed me (British Patient, Love Shakespeare, Kefaret, Crash.) This movie was of interest to me and Hoffman was interested in Tomei's apartment after leaving when he dropped out of the country, a little Kane was thrown out of the country, but I saw that I forgave the cause, not by Orson, but by respect.
