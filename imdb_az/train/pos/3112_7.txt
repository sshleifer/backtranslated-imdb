Before watching the theater, I watched Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy. I was waiting for it since I started filming. <br /> <br /> Small spoiler below <br /> <br /> Generally, it was good, but not the first two sustainability. Identity and Supremacy also acted in a beautiful way among introspective drama with the movements of adrenaline speed. This movie was sometimes confused. Decrease of the solution process was minimal. Camera: When talking frantically, Greengrass presented a trademark and was very annoyed to me. I know that his message board is talking about a heartbeat, but this is not relevant. All the martial art education performed by the actors was completely wasted. This ridiculous camera, the filmmaking and sliding camera, destroyed most of the battles in the film. Inexpensive, student director is a filmmaker to feel the film is not. I was expecting these methods to be used in some of the horrors of secondary school children, but this is not a classy, ​​mature, action series. We've come too far too far. Do not frame some frames. Get some exciting shots. <br /> <br /> Story: This story was a mix that started very long ago. They go to you with new titles and faces. It gave me the feeling you gave me the night when you went into a movie and you know you missed some important information. Feeling of time or feeling due to feelings. But after the capture, the story is very good. Besides Bourne, they are good because they have the potential. HAMIN, I did not take care of all the extremely Supremacy scene (Landy / Bourne phone) in the middle of the Ultimatum thing. Basically the movie is a half prequel. <br /> <br /> Change / Symbols: The star of the movie is moving. Certainly, there are only two works left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. It was a kind of thing for me to join them. I think they want to give someone some protection and protection. Even though I do not run away from anything, why not say they are not together. The other conspirators in the film were quite calm. It felt like those who did not want to leave open parts such as Gilroy / Greengrass. Apparently, but disappointment. Seriously, in the personality with Clev Owen, Damon and Marton Csokas in Supermanism. These scenes were extraordinary. These assassinations are uninteresting as Castel (first person Bourne's personal battles). Generally, casting has diminished as the series continues. Clive Owen was practically the next one. This is the measure of power for the first cast. Secondly, they are mainly trading Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... Not exactly equal. Brian Cox and Franka Potente will be named later for 3 actors. There is nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glen, or Albert Finney, but we are not the first names that do not think so. <br /> <br /> After several stagnations, the player was alive. <br /> <br /> Generally, it was successful. It was difficult, but I felt like they wanted to buy a series. <br /> <br /> Former Secretary General of the United States George Glenn, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not see why he left Bourne. That was my understanding. They accurately refer to the beginning of the array with their silhouette moving rings. I thought it would happen. Full circle termination type. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > what they will do. "The last scene was great, referring to the first suicide he had killed." Why would he do that? If he was angry enough to take revenge now, after sending his secret file, Pamela Landy ' do not hit you. be logical.)
