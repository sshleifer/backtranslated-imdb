I was able to watch the Kill Outfit written and directed only on the Brian De Palma.the DVD, as well as the "R" rating version and the unrated version. version, I could not be sure of the difference. But I guess this version.i can call this type of soft.who can call this type of porn.if but this is a happy expression of a lot of graphic graphic women's nakedness. Something can offend you, I'll give you the "R" version. This is a version that does not give me the digress.Any comment. This murder is a mystery / psychological horror / stagnation movie. very few acts of violence and blood killings are quite graphic. If the blood does not actually see itself, 70 is a reminder of the slasher's appearance. This is the sense of the budget, to bring the scene to a halt, to eliminate the severity of the action. The vast majority of the violence, or possibly the potential for it. The film is very good. We can say that each scene has a very rare moment in comparison with today's films. Anyway, I was a good actor, especially Angie Dickinson, and Micheal Cane is a well-understood performance in the role of a well-functioning film in this case.the film. People can foresee that. Only one complaint (and more of an observation), I thought the character played by Nancy Allen could have fleshed more, especially given that the screen was a fair amount. it does not go away from the quality of the film, and has a strong morale for this film, which is even more relevant today. I really liked the music score prepared by Pino Dinaggioi, and I felt the original Psycho.to very much like my music, and this music really thought it was brilliant. For me, The Kill (1980) 10/10
