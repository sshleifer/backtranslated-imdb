Need to see a movie for everyone who goes to camp or anyone else wants it. This film reflects the absolute essence of the summer camp. It is compassionate to want to watch more about characters after starting to play the funny credits. You did not see this movie ... what are you doing? Get rid of you and manage your video store. Have a great summer :)
