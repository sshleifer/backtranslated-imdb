Now ambitious and overrated Apocalypse Now I did not like it. Perhaps my favorite Vietnam War movie Deer Hunter. The deer hunter was directed to a part of the war, and then directed his life before the war. This movie is mostly Deer Hunter 2. The scenario is very empty compared to Deer Hunter. The story has not been developed until the point where the audience, like Deerhunter, really understands and feels. Flashbacks in Vietnam do not grab or attract as those in Deerhunter. <br /> <br /> However, I can only give this movie from 10 to 7. DeNiro and Harris are truly incredible actors. They completely sank their characters and voiced the great torment of two old friends who lost their best friend Bobby in battle. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Harris's character, half-dead alcohol, will hide his guilt in Bobby's. <br /> <br /> I love the player I support. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. Undoubtedly, the city can not handle Vietnamese vets very well. Like many small towns, everyone is paying attention to tranquility, modesty and work. But Harris's character can not be anything. It is interesting how the warfare will affect people. When some people come back quickly, others do not really get better.
