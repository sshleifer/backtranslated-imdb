This film does a great job of describing an ALS disease (Lou Gehrig's Disease). The subject is compassionate and humorous. Helena Bonham Carter, as a man with ALS, I think he was just a toy. A perfect actor, Kenneth Branag, lives with expectations as a craftsman who hides and hides Helen's character as part of a "public service", an alternate prison term. Watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treatment from start to finish. It's not a fairy tale, it does not limit the incredible performances. Two of them are deeply cared for.
