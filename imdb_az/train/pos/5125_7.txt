One day I was expecting Texas to be a hot beer one day, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering the "Saturday Night Fool," I did not want to see anything again in some southern Texas barn ... and I did not do it. John Revolta was as good as jealousy, Scott Glenn was as good as a thuggie ex-con, and Debra Winger was always a delight. * I love this woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this is a boy who can not stand the country's music]. A fun movie all the way.
