<br /> Lars von Trier's Europa is a worthy repertoire of the Third Man. About an American who came to the US after World War II and found himself in a state of danger. Jean-Marc Barr Leopold Kessler, a German-Americans who refused to join the US Army during the War, came to Frankfort when he was working as his caretaker head of a car over the Zentropa Railroad. Unknowingly, the war is still under way with an underground terrorist group called "Kurtadalar" targeting American allies in secret. Leopold is strong against taking any side, but was shot and deceived by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the femme fatale owner of the railway company. His father was a speaker sympathizer but was pardoned by the Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he could help re-launch the German transport system. Colonel Leopold strengthens or strengthens Leopold to become a spy after some time (or choosing to think about it and without luck) to see the refugees can attack trains. Soon, Leopold's mysterious and mysterious way to both sides of the conflict is compressed by an adventure that everyone and everything else is not. Finally, finally, he is aggravated by feverishness and fever, and Leopold's control over everything else (his girlfriend, terrorists, colonels, vigilant passengers, surprising uncle, and even the railway company's officials who have come to investigate the business ethics). It is impossible for the film to be extremely unexpected. <br /> <br /> The film is stunning, always with a lot of snow falling in the winter. A black and white shooting shot in a random color. Behind the back screens showing the images reflecting the background images. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is my personal favorite movie now.
