Spacecamp is just one of the children's favorite movies, and mom and dad can also be entertaining. I grew up in the 80's and enjoyed this movie, this is a plot and all actors. I recently bought the movie on DVD, so when I have kids, I will be able to make this movie very entertaining. Field entertainment, a group of kids, they start an unexpected journey, when they are put into space by a forced robot. They were primarily immoral, but when they realized they realized they did not have enough oxygen to submerge a single panic. Having accumulated enough oxygen from the cosmic station, they returned to the ground as better friends and a new respect for life.
