Time did not do this movie. After discussing Jeffrey Konvitz's best seller, this movie is simply a basic version of typical spookfest. Terrifying faces (plus this craze) are touched as a shocking horror film for people who do not care about the genre. There is an extraordinary tattoo on small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, etc.), but one thing tells me that producers wanted such a precious cast, that you are not the Medium Low movie (70s manufacturers of disaster films had a similar idea). I liked to see critical faces, but the story is ridiculous, and despite the high class of the film, it runs on the average '70s' (though not entirely bad). Perhaps this is a strange movie, especially for those who love strange things. As usual, Albert Whitlock's work is outstanding. In general, it's pretty fun.
