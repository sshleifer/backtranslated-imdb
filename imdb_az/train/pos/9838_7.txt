Those born again are part of the Season. The reincarnation bit, in my opinion, is cool. I'm watching more, I love it, but it's very good for me. Although not memorable, I always remember him as a reincarnation episode. Anyway, now I'll say good and bad about this episode <br /> Good: Oragami. Yes Yes! <br /> <br /> The fish tank was beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is thrown out of a window. Very sweet. x] <br /> Wrong: Marry your best friend's wife! O_O <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > Conclusion: Okay episode is not very memorable. 7/10
