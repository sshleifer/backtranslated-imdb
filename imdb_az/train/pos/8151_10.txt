I saw audiences in the loyal film theater where they are usually white, educated, and urban. The demonstration I attended was a leak of African-Americans and made a difference between viewers - a good public opinion on the status of racial relations was given among these groups. Basically, white people laughed at the funny bits of laughter - and there is plenty! - The Gypsies were also very silent, because many were "darkened" because they could not laugh themselves before the mules. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I look at this line of rap culture and its ego / trappings / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophy in Asia (and therefore not belonging to any group). It is cast-iron and becomes a symbol of the great work. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best lying documents, including the "Powerful Wind."
