The dolph lundgren car is entertaining die hard throwing flick, which goes to win any prize and gives it a lot of the goods you want to see in a dolph lundgren movie, not very original. our man is an old soldier when dolph, a stern inner city school teacher and now taken by terrorists to rescue his day. The script does not like to win any Oscars and its fair share is eplosive. dolph lundgren gives a good performance, but it is more lively in action scenes, and the rest is not the best player, but it's good. Flick an all-encompassing fun action, but I've seen youv a million times before.
