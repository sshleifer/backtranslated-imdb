And I will tell you: If anyone decides to make this movie fit for television, it is a bad idea. THE USE OF EVERY COMPLIANCE AND CLOSED! How can you do it, ask? Yes, they do not do it well, they are not sure. In any case, Cheech and Chong are said to have diamonds instead of the marijuana they own! Still, the characters are bumping the marijuana smoke that goes on without any explanation!
