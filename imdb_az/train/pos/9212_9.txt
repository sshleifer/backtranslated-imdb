Yesterday I went alone with movies because in Mexico, most of the films from other countries are part of the "alternative cameras" (alternative camera). But after seeing this movie, I realized that not all foreign films were an alternative. Afortunately, this is a good example. But I'm very pleased with this movie ... at the end I was happy ... this movie is a little spoiled these days. And the main lesson for me is the end of the day ... the main force behind our love. It's a good choice to see a good movie in Spanish ... and you need to talk about good music .. especially the main song of the movie .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... Excellent song! !!
