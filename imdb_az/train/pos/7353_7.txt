This film could be one of Bollywood's best-selling films. In 1994, the hero of this film was all good performances, music and direction. When I was filming, I recall that I was in Godabad and in March, at the Holi time, played at the highest number of People's "OOE But" songs. Someone who wants to watch somebody like Marilyn Monroe need to see this movie on hot and drools. Thumbs up Govinda.How you know a lot of this film is shot in the south of India and Sholay can be one of the few but then block the screen by multiplying the Silver Screen. Movies like this Indian comedy could never have been dead.
