Yes, Shakespeare would really be proud. Laurence Fishburne is not good, but of course not bad. On the other hand, Kenneth Brannagh was brilliant. His mode was as good as talking to the audience. Very nice job. <br /> <br /> At times, more drama was expected, more likely to be expected. <br /> <br /> The killing of a cassion, for example, was a little complicated from a very distant place, and the audience bent over to make it felt all. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His nakedness made Rodergy unusual; <br /> If you have not seen Othellou in advance, do so. If you do not read Othello, see that. If you have not heard Othello, look at it. On the other hand, do it yourself by reading it, then go out and hear it.
