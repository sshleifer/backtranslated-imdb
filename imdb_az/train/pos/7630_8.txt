Career, Kurt Russell, who started REAL Elvis at the World Labor Fair, was probably not beaten by King and Shock Source Carpenter in this biopic. There are times when you feel like you're watching Elvis until something is back to reality ... Perhaps the Don Johnson memories of Elvis and Beauty Queen? All speeches here are perfect: Hubley, Prisilla, Col. Pat Hingle, and even Shelley Winters are nervous toward the display of Momma Presley and bring the hysteria level. <br /> <br /> Kurt's Bing is playing here. There is a beautiful performance from Elvis's father, Vernon and Elvis's friend Robert Gray, a friend and guardian of the Red West. <br /> <br /> Black N roll is a must have for fans.
