I've seen all of Miyazaki movies, and all are beautiful and attractive. But it remains above the fortress. This movie was absolutely amazing to me! <br /> <br /> I've been in love with Pazu and Sheetas and their sweet, courageous friendship. What happened to me for the movie. Of course, the animation is also outstanding, and the music perfectly captures the feelings in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (in English), but this movie has bright moments: subs. The English Duke is good (mostly), simply comparable to the original language version. The sounds are better, dialogue, everything. So I would like to see (and hear) the movie as it was before.
