I love Tudor Cirila and maybe I liked the movie so much. Two days before the premiere of the movie, I went to see his concert. I saw the movie "zmeu" before the movie and I thought that I figured it all out ... it was a mistake: a good movie instead of a great help! i film FELT. it was funny .. it was funny .. but most of all describes this LOVE .. I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack .. not so :) I'm not a movie critic .. I'm describing him in more words .. Thanks to Tudor Giurgiu thank you, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and TUDOR CHIRILA for that. Encore! :)
