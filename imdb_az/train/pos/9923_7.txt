I read some mixed reviews, and many others dropped out the film. I was initially interested in this project, because it was directed by Tony Scott and I was very interested in his work after I had such an impact on On Fire. Before I begin to review, I say it first ... it's good to see that this movie is boring and unusual, but writers and Scott chose a different approach. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not boring, Most Hollywood movies will ensure that people know "what's right" and "true" fields, in most cases the movie accepts the audience and creates more profits. This apartment was one of the more interesting I've seen for a while. For reference only I have recently watched 'The Weather Man' and 'War of the Lord', and I will say that these films are very good and I'm very glad of them, and the schemes in these films are very boring. They do not give any chance and are fairly predictable after watching American films fairly. Domino's area is also interesting, and you think that "Oh, they are now bent." And I feel it's missing in many recent films. In my opinion, it's a lot of depth and gives you plenty of questions while watching it. In general, this is something that interests me in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt the characters were right. Knightley did a wonderful job to describe a beautiful woman, but she was inside and wanted her to look like her. <br /> <br /> Choco was also convinced that Spain's unusual use, Domino's lack of love, reactions, but Rourke's character was the most interesting to me, but my It was the most interesting thing for me, but it is still true to me. He seemed to be an ordinary man, trying to end. Hopefully, the filmmakers tried to do it, so that's what I came up with. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe it's very 'satisfying' the hearts, 'he said. Story. Bentley was not the only people who could not afford to buy it, but it was real people who were real problems, and that means achieving that goal. You could communicate with them because this child's illness was a problem without any other solution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Experts: These characters must show the real people who are less successful in dealing with this problem, as they can appear as dangerous as they can only by the gang. I liked this part too. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 children: <br /> <br /> They, in contrast to the comic reality, provided a very serious film. . 90210 of Walken's unusual phrases have permanent references. <br /> <br /> Film shooting is just more profitable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... cinematography. It seems that this movie has lost a lot of potential fans. But I thought it was a genius, and in my opinion, the use of the camera to make the situation in mood was very effective. I thought it was a right way, but it always managed to improve as something else. I also welcome a number of realistic chances with this film and congratulate Scott Conti, the director, cinematographer and director of the photographer. They did not just walk away from their presentation, but went further. The use of extremely light and very dark colors also provides a "look" of the film with a bad and strange look that accurately describes the lives of the people, their entire hunters and their lives, as everyone else is like peach or 'clean'. You see, at least during the stress or conflict, there were at least a few camera tricks. This shows that Scott and his crew were trying to achieve something in this way, and they simply did not do it for this heck. I understand that most people who have watched this movie do not expect it, and that many of them have been linked to this movie, but I think Scott is taking this approach. Hollywood films have been advanced and gently developed. Most of them are drawn in the same way as the same curve and turn. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <strong> I'm so glad I did this movie, and I'm glad I did that for it. I would recommend it to everyone, but I am sure that it will be shot in just a few turns. Most of those who refuse to go beyond the MTV site will not appreciate this movie, but I have to agree with a poster when I say that many people think. All this is Scott and co. he threw some chances and tried to present something different and unique. And, in my opinion, he was very successful.
