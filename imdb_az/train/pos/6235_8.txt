This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies or at least one favorite. Most A-R films dance great but are romantic romantic stories. <br /> <br /> This movie is not only a great dance, but also a joyful symbol and many good songs. Music is the main topic here, and it is good, adding a tap solo by Rogers. She was not just a super dancer but a very beautiful woman and had a lot of numbers. Watching TV on the Ozzie & Harriet TV in the 1950s was a real TV watching on television, dancing with Fred and they are always a fun couple to watch on the dance floor. For the first time, such a young man saw Harry Hilliard. It is no surprise that Ã–zzie fell for this beauty. Although in the early 30's, she had a hairstyle, but I knew her voice immediately. There are also quick images from Betty Grable and Lucille Ball in this movie, but I have to admit that I have not yet reached the ball. <br /> <br /> Astaire was entertaining to watch the first three parts of the film, except chewing gum, and Randolph Scott - even better, strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
