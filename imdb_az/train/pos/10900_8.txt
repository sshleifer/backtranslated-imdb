When I missed the opportunity in 2004, this was a documentary document for me, so I will follow up again. I'm really sincerely interested in the main character of the film, because it's true that my skin problem is softer than the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This is a sad, sometimes entertaining and very emotional document about a child with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks as a child (due to vocal muscle wasting) and has not been admitted, but he was 36 years old. The most intriguing moments are his horrible situation, and they move away from their bands. Jonny had a very humorous sense of humor, even when he showed his funeral in a coffin, narrated from the grave. She speaks with her mother, her elderly brother, Edna Kennedy and the famous model, Jonny's supporter, Nell McAndrew. BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best New Director (Actually) and nominated for Best Sound (Actual) and Flaherty Documentary Award. In 2004, it was number 10 in "100 Great TV" in 2004.
