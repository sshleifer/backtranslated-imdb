The withdrawal of two film seized by the government; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Veer Zara is a love story of a person who gives everything to someone, though Deewaar focuses on the main subject. Many indigenous Indians in India have declined for decades in Pakistan's prisons. time or sympathy and the other side. I'm convinced that some Pakistani prisoners are in India, but let's pay attention to the film. Players are full. Some are Rakhubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, and others. Some actors like the scene. Amitabh Bachchan, who played a big role, made a good move. The Housekeeper had done a good job. Amrita Rao did not do anything more than a few giggles and few songs. The role of Sanjay Dutt is not very long, but is the strongest. He was here really good and his information was also effective. If you compare it with LOC, which is nothing more than a day-to-day story with a story in all directions, Deewaar is a good film that keeps a good pace and brings justice to all actors. 7.5 / 10
