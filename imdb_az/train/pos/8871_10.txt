This was a great movie with many of the liars. He was dealing with Rascism and class issues. However, there was a message to know yourself and take responsibility for yourself. This movie was so deep that you gave this message and you can only handle the destiny. Also, knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way to get involved in society. Others do not have to think about you. I believe that this movie was a great job to show it. The actors I thought were delighted with every character. I really believe in how deep this film is. At a glance, you will not see how deep the film is, but you can further explore the meaning of the film above.
