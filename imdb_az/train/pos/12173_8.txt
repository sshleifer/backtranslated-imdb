First, quickly 'shut'! Those who say that this movie is wrong. You can not go to any movie waiting for 'Citizen Kane' hope. This was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only mistake in this film is that I do not think there is enough chemestry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They lived more. In addition, the movie is entertaining. Selma Blair needs to eat something. It disturbs me. But it still looks amazing. So yes, I suggest that this movie be fun for a date or a Saturday afternoon. IRFS: ** from 1/2 ****
