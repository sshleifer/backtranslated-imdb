Comment? Should I have a comment? We talk about all periods, all seasons and all generations. This is the only type of movies I have been watching for yet. It's kind of magic, like in other Disney movies. All the symbols are in a "live" and "real" way, so it is easy to understand, but you do not understand the language (I did not understand when watching the first movie because I was six). Perhaps my English is not very good, but I have learned something that I know more about such films, and this is a bigger measure of such films. But there is a great shame. It is not possible to watch this or that Disney movie in my country! No copyright, so our children are able to enjoy and learn from such films. So, do we ever have this movie "Once you slept" or ...?
