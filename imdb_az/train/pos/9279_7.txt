Jafar Panahi's comedy drama describes some women who want to join a Tehran sporting ground that prohibits "Ofsite" women. The official reason: very bad words and players show their legs. Of course, this is sexism. Thus, the majority of the film is a mild comic relief because women are trying to ask serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium, and a woman has her own scheme to challenge even men. <br /> <As I understand, all of Jafar Panah's films (including those) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy to overthrow CIA's prime minister in 1953 and subsequent support by the pitiful Shah gives Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use a narrow interpretation of the Koran to create a chauvinistic society, and George Bush's policy against Iran. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a pretext to move his cowboy and toughen his censorship. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a clean view of the people who come up with a way to challenge the system. Great movie, not worth seeing. Given that Jafar Panahi's films are forbidden, I'm surprised at how they can do it.
