I do not know what to expect while watching the movie, except for a slightly surrealistic mainstream movie that a man would not order a Russian bride over the internet. There was Nicole Kidman. <br /> <br /> Nicole and Chaplin worked well in the film, filming, filming, movies, movies, movies, movies, movies, movies, movies, movies, movies. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film is about real people who are in an unusual situation. This is a scene similar to some big office offices in the film and it creates a tension element without Hollywood. It's less about heroic and sensitive relationships. Brit-filming is the best way ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
