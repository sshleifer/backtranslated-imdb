I thought this movie was better than credit for most movie critics. Despite the complex parts of the site, it does not have a big impact on the concept of the film. If you are not open to more liberal political ideas, this is probably not a movie for you. I thought all the actors in the film were outstanding. Each character has funny moments and the audience at Tribeca Film Festival laughs at everything. I thought that my satire was above a certain area, but it was deliberate. Although John Cusack is certain in the future, it really helps to see this day.
