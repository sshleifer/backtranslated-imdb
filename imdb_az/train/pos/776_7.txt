I believe that the idea of ​​the plot is, first of all, perfect for exploring the emotional experiences of a person in the Romanian society of such relationships (incest and lesbianism), as in one statement. <br /> <br /> So, in order to start from the second aspect ... to make it short, it was invisible ... <br /> <br /> Like first. As I said, it has more potential ... I think that such relationships are more tense ... more tension ... and potential tension has not passed ... <br /> <br /> I think , the soundtrack could have been more than a few songs in the background and theme (not only beautiful, but insufficient and always in the right moments) ... yes ... a better soundtrack .. <br /> <br /> Actors ... I think they are somewhere between 7 and 8/10 ... not sensational enough in key moments ... <br /> <br /> total 7/10 ... mainly for the story
