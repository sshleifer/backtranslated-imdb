The first job of Fatih Akins, "Im Juli", was quite good, he created a really nice Italian family epos. Her German film is, unfortunately, a bad precondition, causing us to produce more than rarely average films;). But this movie then gives a lot of good moments. Solino is about an Italian immigrant who came to the Ruhr region in the '60s. The immigrant and his family then started the first Pizza restaurant in the area. Heroes are perfectly designed. Especially Gigi, the main actor. Every second, you experience every feeling. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not that good. Yes, you just do not believe in its role. But the character is considered good and perfectly suited for this script. I have an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the "Godfather" style. Many people will probably hate this movie and will say boringly. Too tension? - Yes, but a treacherous movie. 10 to 9 o'clock.
