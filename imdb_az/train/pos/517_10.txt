Pressburger and Powell's biggest film. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot, who fled his death, but when he sees that AWOL is paradise and sends an angel to investigate, he is given a second chance in his life. Young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all creatures killed on the move, are wrong when they come to paradise for eternal life. Roger Livesey, in a profound way under admirable actor, and Kim Hunter's love interests (later, of course, the Ape Planet Zira). By the way, Steven Spielberg left the actress playing as an elderly spouse (Kathleen Byron), as an individual who spoke sensibly to his kinematics at Saving Private Ryan after half a century.
