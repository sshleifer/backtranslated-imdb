This movie was great and I would like to get it. The boy goes with his father to catch a young eagle. the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until he is old enough to be sacrificed for plants. the kid kills the eagle and escapes from the gens. The eagle feeds it by holding a duck inside a small lake. Later, a son of a son claims that he hits a dress because the arrows are very close. They only determine who the gay is until they check the thickness of red lines. But this was surprising, because the other boys also betrayed him and eventually took him to the abyss, but when you think of falling in love for the eagle he turns it into a golden garden. he recalled who was the necklace. Let me know if someone knows you can buy this movie. I have not seen it for more than 30 years, but still remember part of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
