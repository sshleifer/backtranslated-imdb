It's one of the Movie / Pilot, if you knew BattleStar Galactica, but not needed. This is far more distant in the future, making the story more convincing than the BSG. It's so deep that it's pretty cool because it's not released from the theater. Potential could not be better selected in such experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is superior to a father who will do something to reunite with his daughter but he is not the real one or whatever she does and will do whatever she can. Paula Malcomson from Deadwood's fame is also terrifying as her husband. Are not you absolutely sure of his motives, whether love or money or both, but that makes the pilot even more interesting. I see a star starring in the production of Zoe, a relative unknown Alessandra Torresani and his performance. Esai Morales desires to see someone he loves again, and how wrong he is, even though we consider that he wants more than his moral counterparts. I did not think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but I was thrilled to see the pilot's only BSG stage. At this stage, it is great to see a person as impressed and impressed by the various types of Robots that start to live. I can only understand how they have gained humanoid-type robots so they can continue stories. This is almost a perfect pilot and I hope they can tell a fantastic story. Visual effects are even better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you have not been involved in the BSG, at least try this and I will bet you to be a fan and you may want to see how the BSG story is.
