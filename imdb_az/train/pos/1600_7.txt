This is not a bad movie. Naked is not funny, but interesting and funny thing. There are several fun moments. Cher gives good performance in a role that reflects himself in real life. Only his performance is worth the clock. <br /> <br /> If this film came out today, it would not be a candidate, but it was in line with the standards of the 80s.
