DANIEL DAY-LEWIS plays Christy Brown, a growing brain-philosopher, but has succeeded in making her a successful artist and writer, making her a productive life. <br /> <br /> Although the film is hard to look at, and even look. I'm happy that when I watched the movie in the theater, I had the capability to capture every word that was not possible. <br /> <br /> I think it's a brave business dealing with a difficult issue, and I would like to see more than once that it's a kind of movie. <br /> Nevertheless, my focus is on the story-making device, a flashback that we have today, to see Christy's youth aglow with his successes before seeing the struggles of communication with the surrounding people. <br /> <br /> DANIEL DAY-LEWIS, of course, is remarkable as a tough guy who is in love with a therapist (Fiona Shaw), whose heartbreak will be broken when his love does not meet. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis, when he is unable to succeed his father, they are fighting for. Daytime-Lewis completes his activities as a warm-hearted mother and shares with her many painful moments. <br /> <br /> The rich details of a family come together in most unusual situations, each frame of the film. Both Fricker won Day-Lewis Oscar, but HUGH O'CONOR and Ray Mcanally are also excellent. <br /> <br /> Elkhan Bernstein's music is an added plus factor. Well, but not necessarily a movie for everyone.
