Steve Carell took care of the "The Daily Show", and later on depicting a slightly different straightforward role in various supporting roles. Carell found a clever and exciting script that puts capital in a powerful way in a powerful way. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives quietly, alone in life. Andy is a little surprising, but on the contrary is a kind of good man. One night, when Andy accidentally communicated with his colleagues, he accidentally showed that he was a virgin. Her colleagues talk about the situation with Andy at the beginning of David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen). But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for a worthy person as Andy is committed to helping her to end her sister-in-law. Thus, Andy is about to reach adulthood. Andy is a guilty innocent and most of the humor depends on the circumstances he finds himself in the film. Part of humor is a lot of things, but most are just a clever comedy. Additionally, Andy, for the first time in his life, developed some romantic relationships and friendships, and touched on some parts of the film. I do not try to portray the movie as a love story or drama; There is a rolling of comedy in these places. Still, every good comedy I've seen is in a heart enough to care for the characters. A good comparison can be 'Toy Crashers' from this beginning of the summer. There is a humor similar to the Virgin, but in some jokes, perhaps even more strange. Especially I liked the end of the movie, I thought it was a great way to end the tire. Without reminding me, he reminded me of "something about Mary." Very light and entertaining; When we finish a comedy, we have to feel laughing and laughing. I would highly recommend it.
