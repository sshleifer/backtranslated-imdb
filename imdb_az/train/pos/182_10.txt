If you are a beginner in the Gundam world, this is a good place to start. If you're burning on Star Wars or Star Trek, it's a fascinating, really cool series that can force you to get in here. It can be expected, not a giant robot story of the world that saved a simple guy. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 keeps Al Jazeera's story alive, a young, naive child. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 is in the "good" and "bad" neutral cosmic colony. He fights on Mobile Costumes and wars his friends. Al, during this series, is friendly with the "enemy" soldier Bernie Wiseman. In the end, Little Al learns some lessons about the reality of war and the necessary suffering and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I like the cool mecha designs featuring this series series, stunning stories and amazing characters. I recommend this series to anyone who loves real SF anime or those who think that the lines are just ridiculous or sexy fun.
