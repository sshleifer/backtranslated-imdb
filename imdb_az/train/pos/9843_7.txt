* Spoilers can * * Spoiler can contain * <br /> In the age of Shrek (film) and Pixar (studio), this is a more traditional animated movie. Normally, something that can not be seen somewhere (a person will not try to rescue his baby and return to his father). They start out as enemies and end up as the best friend. This sound is like a Disney movie, it is only made through the Fox of the 20th century. Film shooting was one of the best I've ever seen, but the film does not live up to the trailer set. The problem is that the creators of the film do not compose the idea of ​​the film's target audience. Yes, only adults in the film will understand, but there are some jokes that are directed to children mostly. Parents will benefit from a 90-minute situation. directing their children to something else. Backgrounds are excellent and sound good, but this is not a nice movie. Kids will love this movie, adults just like it.
