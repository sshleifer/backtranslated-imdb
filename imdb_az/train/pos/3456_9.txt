There is no absolute murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows that Kenninq Franklin, the other half of the writing team for detective stories, does not know. He kills Jim Ferris, a partner with solo plans. Columbo begins to take pictures and asks Mr Franklin everything. And again returns to a question.Columbo: The Crimes by the Book (1971) is run by young Steven Spilberg, ahead of fame days. Steven Bochco wrote it. Columbo is a fantastic character with its shabby appearance. It is difficult to believe that this person can solve any kind of mischief. But he can. Everyone and every one! Peter Falk is the only and only person in the world who describes this character. No remakes, please.This part is a good example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays killer and plays the victim of Martin Milner.Rosemary Forsyth plays the victim's wife, Joanna Ferris. There is something loved by Columbo and his scenes. She does omelet and everything. Barkara plays Colby Lilly La Sanka. When he killed a murder as he did here, he faced a really tragic fate. Since childhood I've been a fan of Columbo and I still enjoy watching them. For many years Columbo has not shown stories, but now he's back.
