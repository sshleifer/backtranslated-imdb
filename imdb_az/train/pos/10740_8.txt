Written by French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and published by Robert De Niro and Firefighter Jason Hanlon, this is a striking and heartwarming story of how the New Yorker's best darkest day was. I first saw my 12 year old younger brother and still touched me at that time. 9/11 knew how effectively the 9/11 was. We learn how the heroes are, what everyday life is and how many people save themselves and how they build their lives in a situation where they save their lives. These courageous men put their lives on the line, and those who watch it add to my admiration. If you can watch it, it's the best document I've ever seen.
