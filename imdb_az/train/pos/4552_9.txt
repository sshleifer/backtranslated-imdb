In my Left Foot, Daniel Day Lewis gives us one of the best performances by an actor. Kristi Braun is brilliant as a cerebral cascade of waterfowl writers who learns to write and paint with his left foot. Brenda Fricker, who plays a good Oscar and loving mother for her. Hugh O'Conner, younger as Christy Brown and Ray McAnally as the father. Waiting for prominent performances.
