I liked the Long Way Round and did not know the race to Dakar until I saw my local supermarket shelves. I bought it and after a while I decided to make the first episode "hmm this will be good". Charlie Boorman was as big as other crew members. Great to meet Evanla again. She was not content with it, but she did not bother me. Because there is no word in the package. BBFC has much to do with the minds of those who deny the classification certificate. <br /> <br /> <strong>
