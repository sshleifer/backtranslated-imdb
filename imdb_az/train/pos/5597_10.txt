"Le Locataire" has definitely become one of the most terrifying films in the world. Polansky, like Trekkovski, is a sad file writer living in Paris, responds to an apartment, tried to commit suicide by leaping from the previous apartment window. Trelkovski is forced to visit her at the hospital and faces Stella (Isabelle Adjani) there .Trelkovsky immediately moves when her previous tenant died, and first of all she found a beautiful apartment. She is soon replaced by waves of paranoia, though her neighbors are increasingly suspicious of trying to drive Trekkovskini, who soon recalls the previous tenant's suicide. This movie is great. Polansky's real fears and paranoia atmosphere. In a hole in Trekkovsk√≠'s wall, to find the previous tenant's teeth, the brightest moments like the classic scene or the bathroom to find the walls covered with imaginary hieroglyphics of fire. Photography by Sven Nykvist is really great. "Tenants" may be difficult to follow a negligence gem.It is worth more than that effort.
