<br /> <br /> This movie brings back many of the old memory of classic cinema where actors do not have to take their clothes to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think the main purpose of this film is to make sure that the beautiful chemistry movie is made between Martyr and Amrita. <br /> <br /> I have had a lot of comments about the film being sick and very boring. In response, I think that I have a certain level of analysis, but I believe that this is a Barclay film, which is significantly lower than MPC, HAHK, HSSH and MPCDH. It was almost unbearable to watch HSSH in some places. <br /> <br /> But in the film, when it comes to syndicated moments, smiling, the last couple were hoping for the best, not hoping for something bad. <br /> <br /> Another key point is the performances of the witness and the Amrita. Both acted very well in the film, especially when the witness was a good actor. Amrita just looks stunning and should be taken seriously as a future star. <br /> <br /> Although I love the film as a whole, I feel it's too long. Some of the mediums could have been worked out and perhaps even more impressed. And I think that despite the fact that the music is appropriate for the movie, the situation is a little old fashioned and the film could benefit if it had a more modern soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In general, I have advised you to film this romantic look and to a dramatic summit (I will not go).
