Especially when it comes to many science fiction films (1973), this is a spectacular vision of a future that everything goes wrong. Many people and nothing works. The only people who can live comfortably are rich. In 2022, I was assigned to New York (which I think) and reminds me of the worst vision for Calcutta. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Charlton Hesto operates after seeing Orson Welles in the "Satan Tissue". He was able to describe a series of heroic and semi-heroic (perhaps). Here, he is just split between a little corruption (a rare nutritional rare from the richest) and a police officer who is totally corrupt. <br /> <br /> The film looks like it's all overnight, and the sweat drops to everyone except one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. <br /> <br /> Great scenes with Eduard G. Robinson: Although I have never seen so far, I knew that the popular anthem would not be discovered, but the end was definitely forwarded. <br /> <br /> Where the truth is found (heavy workmanship from older Jews). <br /> <br /> Gritty, pre-Star Wars dystopian science fiction.
