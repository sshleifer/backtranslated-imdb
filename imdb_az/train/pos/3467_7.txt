I'm still interested in why you're watching this movie. Undoubtedly, before seeing this movie, I did not know practically anything about beatles. I did not know all their names! <br /> <br /> I knew they were a ton of fans, some albums, some claimed to be the greatest, fell, Yoho Yoko married Ono and John was killed. <br /> <br /> Besides, the VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV. Nevertheless, I decided not to wait too much for some reasons. Surprisingly, I really liked it! The dialogue was written because of the minimal emphasis and very well developed. This is very important, because John and Paul have a lot of conversations, but despite all this, they are more likely to go abroad to explore and follow you. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn generally perform well. <br /> <br /> The latter was also very clever. I'm thrilled to know how the movie will make the SNL performance thin and later slap it on top and celebrate it better. My favorite moment is probably a tile roof scene. <br /> <br /> Generally, I would recommend this movie to everyone. Six years after the exit, Paul is a very good way to inquire about what happens when he leaves John alone. Perhaps the main reason for my view is that I must resolve the pride of those who have been defeated and what happens after their separation.
