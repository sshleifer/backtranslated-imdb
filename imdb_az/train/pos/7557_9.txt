Sex Bender Limeriki: <br /> <br /> Is a man or a woman? <strong> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> In one of the UFOs . <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great season 1 episode. I love this story because the story is kind of really uncertain about what will happen next. Completely original. The teaser is very entertaining with the eyes and disco lights. I really think the genderbender is the heshe I need to learn on my head. I like the atmosphere in Kindred's small village, and in the middle of the night, Mulder and Scully scream. She is very excited. In fact, this is one of my favorite Season 1 episodes. I think that in the end of what I love so much about it, how foreigners will abandon their crop circles. Many people think this is an out-of-date episode of non-mythological, such as "unnatural" or "space," but I think it is easily related to mythology. Perhaps the young bender was just like an alien fisherman and may seem like everyone else. Huh? Anyway, I'll give the episode 10 to 9.
