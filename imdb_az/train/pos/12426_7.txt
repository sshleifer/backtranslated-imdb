David Duchovney creates a role to repeat a part of the troubled talent in Californication. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts with a good speed and ends you. Timothy Hutton plays a beautiful villain and Angelina Jolie pouts. The story of a dishwasher is well written in finding a way to a world of crime. A head cocktail blend for drug addiction and desire for hearty Jolie. Unfortunately, the story to the end is a bit weaker, and the relationship between the cunning and the FBI is dark and fled just as it was created to develop the final scene. But on the one hand, it's a worthwhile movie.
