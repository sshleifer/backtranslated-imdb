I've been interested in this movie for some time, partly because it's a very high score on the IMDb - with a score of over 300 on average, giving you the highest possible rating for any accessible silent movie! How have I never heard of this movie before this site? Yes, you can not always rely on ratings. This is actually a very nice movie that I'm renting a beautiful VHS transfer - principles, especially Harvard / Yale football game, which works perfectly well, like Brown, William Haines, and Cambridge's best workplace - but in 1926, it seemed like a jam. A busy, personal, charismatic man goes to school and begins to be a caring, selfless friend in the process; In 1926, I was very skeptical of the fact that people were really interested in the last few reels, the predictive factor is high. Still, it is very good and deserves to be remembered if the heavens are not praised. Perhaps the majority of the previous 350 voters are Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> Now 600 were selected and the score actually rose to 9.2! Seriously, nation, there is a vote - I beg everyone to tell me that it is a better movie than Metropolis or General!
