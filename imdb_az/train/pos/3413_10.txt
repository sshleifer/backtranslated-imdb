It just came out and did not believe it was an incredible documentary. You rarely come out of a movie theater in such fear and surprise. Recently, films have provoked the excitement of something truly rare and rarely occured. Amores Perros gave it to me when I went out for the first time, and this movie is now for me. I did not know anything about it, and that was a surprise. If you hear the concept, you may feel that this is one of those touching movies that we're trying to make sure we're not sure what a great story is and what is covered by top music. Fortunetly this is not a movie. People tell the story! This is a good job of capturing every moment of their moment when they enter the world and feel every second part of them. There is much more to climb, which ensures that everything is intense. It is a great document showing the void, showing the rise and intensity of the mountain in an interesting way, but this is a story of more people. I have seen today, but I will go and say that it's one of the best documents I've ever seen.
