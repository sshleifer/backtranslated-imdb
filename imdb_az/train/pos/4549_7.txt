"My Left Foot" is a very beautiful film that learns how to cope with cerebral palsy Christy Brown and his body with his left foot. Daniel Day-Lewis won the first Oscars as the best actor for this movie, and I'm still not worthy of being worthy of it, but it is still remarkable. Day-Lewis, Brownu gives a realistic and sometimes humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, won the Oscar for a convincing and influential role as Braun's mother. The problem with this film is sometimes a bit real. Braun should be helpless and help one, and with his left legs it may be difficult to watch the movie. This often causes a negative feeling that may turn some viewers away for a while. However, if you look it out, you'll see hope and inspiration for those who want to eliminate obstacles and other challenges. Those who do not have our cripples and who still think that we have problems are inspired by this film. If, however, we can overcome the difficulties we face in a worse situation, we can do the same. Yes, sometimes nice, but hard to watch. <br /> <br /> It may be for everyone but not bad at all.
