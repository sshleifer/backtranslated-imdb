I saw Iphigenia, who was interested in me and my name. My name is Eugenia, so I thought OK, let's see what it is. I'm so glad I stayed in the canal. What a beautiful, beautiful story. Drama, sadness, some had to move at the top level but had not had a good time. I'm watching it and saddening me for all the film industry to see and pass through these beautiful little stones. Give Iphigenia a try and I hope she will be happy as I did. I even earned my children (27, 25, 20, and 17). But it starts slowly, but it builds drama and you're going to fall into the story. Watching this beautiful movie wanted to get me to the Greek tragedy and the path.
