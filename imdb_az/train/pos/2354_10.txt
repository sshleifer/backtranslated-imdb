This show was such a fresh, innovative and original show because it was such a treat. It gives me a straightforward look that I have never watched. Since the first episode was released I easily joined all the characters (usually because I hate the few characters). Unfortunately, this show will not be the third season as it should be one of the best shows I have ever seen and do not overwhelm my feelings for the show. What can ABC do to replace this show because nothing can replace the Daisies Pushing? This is the best show on television. <br /> <br /> I came to Kristin Chenoweth and stayed for the whole show.
