Whispering drummer Keith Moon was called his father Arthur. In this film, I found a lot of similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon. Liza Minelli has done a great deal of work on this occasion, and Dudley Moore opened her cheek on all sides. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole the whole scene. It was a very different film that allows viewers to see a part of another life. We often try to re-capture this movie again. God rest in Dudley Moore; It was a pleasant movie. Lots of rich and snobby / rich people to touch and touch your fingers. The intense friendship between Moore and Sir John is very satisfying.
