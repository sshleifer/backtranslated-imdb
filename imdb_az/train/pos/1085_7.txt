This film was a fun comedy that was based on the Murphy Law and its structure. It is no doubt that if a film is made today, the family will be inadequate. After "simple" forty years, we will be a typical family of times. Of course, the grant perfectly blends comedy and dramatic elements and is emphasized by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans are fun for a ninety-minute entertainment, 7/10.
