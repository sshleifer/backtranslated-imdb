What is the best open adventure film of all time in the war, the four urban children face the rage of nature, the story of survival. <br /> <br /> John Boorman chose not to use actors to describe secondary characters, but to use indigenous peoples. These local films are filmed with an incomparable characteristic of film history. No central casting actor could be close to the signs, voices, or actions of these people. I do not remember a movie where the secondary characters are very realistic and colorful. <br /> <br /> It's a strange realism that makes this movie so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The film also has another strength. Nature can be united. These conditions are essential for the existence of the American South. Very few places in the United States are as severe as the country. <br /> <br /> In a film adapted to Darwin's vividness, the movie links people to the fact that they are not part of nature, and that they do not differ from it. <br /> <br /> "Salvation" is often the product of his time; the Americans, who are different today, have expressed their concern about the deserted wilderness. The film's spectacular decoration, along with the absence of birds, frogs, whistles, noise, and no civilization, all deliver an ecological message. The film has another strength. <br /> <br /> At a fun level, gradually increases as the tension grows rapidly. Half of the film is not so, but the tension is too high, and it never gives up until the last loan is deleted. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is high. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography is very good. Dialogue is interesting. And the player is in control. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is a perfect cast and beautiful job. And John Voight must be nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the movie, this is a music I love. <br /> <br /> In general, "Salvation" will appeal to those who love the obvious adventure. For those who do not know, strange characters, moving and style tension are enough reasons to watch this movie, one of the best in the film.
