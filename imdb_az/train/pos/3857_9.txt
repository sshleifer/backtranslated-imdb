Paul Verhoeven's "Basic Instinct" hitting the thirst is a surprising and shocking neo-noir tension. Verhoeven has been known to shoot some sleazy trash in his native Dutch as well as in America, and this is one of the reasons. The fourth Adam follows a strange story of Gerard Reven (played by Jeroen Krabbé); a talk about stories written by a gay, alcoholic and little mad writer who went to Vlissingen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven, this Plays the truth many times in the film, and this ensures that you know exactly where you are. Most of the events in the Fourth Man could have been as visible, but it could easily be interpreted as something else, and it is a growing thing that presents the viewers beyond the seating area and presents the film as a work. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker who thinks he needs to be killed, and this is one of the things I love about the best. This movie has a very shocking scene that caused me to get sick after a few hours (and it does not happen too often!). I do not want to spoil it because I need a surprising element to work ... but when you see the movie you will see what I mean (check that you have the unstoppable version!). There are a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than I have mentioned, but still beautiful; <br /> <br /> A man moving in the fourth person is not something to write his house, but it is therefore strong. Jeroen Krabbé keeps the attention of the audience and sees it as a drunken writer. Like the femme fatale in the center of this tale, the most influential is Renée Soutendijk. His performance was followed by Sharon Stoun nine years later with Basic Instinct, but the original fatale did it well. Paul Verhoevé's direction focuses his attention on many ideas that help him to create the story. Verhoeven has gone to bring some garbage, but he has a clear skill and is a shame that he does not want to use it better. It's the best of all Verhoeven movies I've ever seen, and it's hard to meet; Trust me, it is worth the effort.
