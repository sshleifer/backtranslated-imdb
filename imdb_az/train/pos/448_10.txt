In my opinion, this movie is absolutely wonderful. And I'm not just about breathtaking scenery. This is about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to get away from their happy home life. In the end, four women lease their general location, and, above all, different identities and leases. In beautiful magic locations, they think that they are peaceable and interesting, and that peace comes from inner thoughts and resolutions. I also see something good for the relationships that have developed from benevolence and understanding. The player is happy to follow himself. Especially love Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker) characters.
