The director romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as incredible as it is, but thanks to Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both terrific) stars, there are moments of pleasure. He has a widow who can not move, she is an illiterate and secret inventor - probably you can guess the rest. The adaptation of Pat Barker's "Union Street" (a better title!) Is very intense and the film's fixing is a mess, but still pleasant; blue color blue fantasy. Although the heroes are intentionally slightly colorless, the results are diminished to an exciting degree, and they do not respond to serious issues (even illiteracy angles are just a trick to the story of love) and there is no real fireworks. The finale is a clean tulpus and the kissis will find it difficult to swallow - though the two characters are worthy of a happy ending, the picture really does not fit in any other way. From ****
