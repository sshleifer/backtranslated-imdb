Perhaps, on the contrary, he plays with Donald Sutherland and performs well with empathy because of Stephen Rea's excellent performance. What were the two parts playing? above all? The film Rostov has done more than just a sick account of the butcher's history. The actors, especially Max Von Sydow, supported the parts really well. Good leadership. The picture was very good. <br /> <br /> Although the film has caused several aberrations in Hungary, we can certainly forget this little triviality, given the depth of storytelling and interpretation. <br /> <br /> Once the HBO released a trumpet for a television movie. Especially if you want to analyze your character and forget some morbid scenes, what is suggested? Do not hurry to add, it is never inflated.
