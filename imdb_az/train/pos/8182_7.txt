Director Brian Yuzna has an unequal career in the horror genre, which creates masterpieces such as "Living Deadly Returns" or "Re-Animator Bride," as well as "Faust: Love Curse" or "Medieval Generation" <br /> <br /> Stuart Gordon's films have been very beautiful. <br /> <br /> The Dentist is one of his few work, but low profile has its benefits. one of the most successful dentist Dr. Alan Feinston (story played by Corbin Bernsen), who discovered that his perfect wife, Linda Hoffman, was a perfect partner when she realized that her perfect life was a relationship. This event disturbed his mind and instigated the killing of the murderer because he had revenge on the world because he was "bad" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One day, we are witnessing how a professional profession will go psychologically. <br /> <br /> Yuzna is able to earn accurate cash, but a good dose that helps the film adds dark humor. <br /> <br /> Most of the success of the organization is in Bern's speech like Feinstone. It can also create a sense of self-worth and hatred and another characteristic that helps its delicate humor film. The rest of the rash is not good, and I think that their underwear is worse than the need for the film. As a detective trying to catch Feinstone, Ken Foree is a remarkable exception. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> O it is good to see that it usually does not coincide with it, and I can say that this is an episode of the film. There is nothing more than expected, a little more, and more. <br /> <br /> I would say that it is one of the best, though not least among the most famous films in the world. No doubt, his masterpieces are not classic material, but an entertaining film will not be tiring or boring. It's a simple film in the low budget, but why do I think I'm silent. 7/10
