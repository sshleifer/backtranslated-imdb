<br /> <br /> Matsis crosses a bridge's bridge by a woman in Riga just one night ride. Pass without a word. The only leap in the water, then crying for help causes it to move. <br /> <br /> This film marks its efforts to learn more about women. In one of the local sticks, he finds a pocket book. She feels more about her life. His "appearance" changes as the change is changing. He has to correct that thing. <br /> <br /> Together with his wife, Alexander, in a beautifully lithed conversation with the "old lover of misery," they also raise themselves against guilty accusers. <br /> <br /> Long life, dogs sounds to emphasize guilt. Footprints. Beautiful film noir with a beautiful twist. A good Indie ended up.
