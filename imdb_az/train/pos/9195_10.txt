I often do not give a movie or show, but this show touched a nerve in another show. At mysoju.com, I found all the series and thought it looked interesting, and I looked at it when I looked at it. I was not disappointed with what I was seeing; I transferred. The story remains on the bidding side as the main scene moves us through scenes. Sumerian Ivoa, played by Koyuki thoughtfully, shows the nature of man as he wishes to avoid difficulties. Nobody really wants to put a soul in front of a prospective spouse. Instead, instead of replacing a person like a cute animal, Matsumoto Jun. It's like any living thing that pet is thinking of a pet. Difference; He can say the same way in the same way because not everyone is a dog, but a dog. When treated as an animal, it reacts to the situations in which the dog can react. She takes time with her new lover, Momo gets jealous. When he realized that sexual tension was just beginning to rise between two of the pets, Momo had a dance. The way of thinking changes slowly, and we begin to look at our own thoughts. When we look at a three-dimensional character, when Matsumoto sees us as a master, not as a man, but as a human being, when we look at it, we begin with a very dim dimension. I think this story should be followed to develop this character. Now Matsumoto plays Momo with such sensitivity. He does not want to think about the future, and how will his relationship be changed, but like Momo (whose name would give him a new puppy)? we also know that this will not continue. Follow this show with an open mind, worth it.
