Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The last battle between Islam and the empire. When the Second Death Later comes to an end, he is condemned to the Rebel Union. Now a Jedi fan has turned from Tatooine to Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, and now turns out to be Luke's twin sister! Lando Calrissian, when attacking the Death Star, admits the attack on the Shield generator in Endor's Forest. They know that the most difficult trap was built for them and that the Emperor Palpatine himself personally controls the construction of the Second Death Star. <br /> <br /> Jedi's return is the most original trilogy for me. Moved by John Williams, has drama, romance, great wars, fantastic actors, incredible fighting scenes and contemporary music. Mark Hamill is now a quiet, relaxing Jedi set to keep the naive farm-rich and in-place galaxy gone, completely entered a Jedi engagement. Leia is still cool in this movie, as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie, while James Earl Jones is still the biggest gang of the movie: Plays the role of T: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain, like wrapped and brutal merciless Imperial Palpatine. The action segments of this film are breathtakingly beautiful and sword battles are serious and odd. John Williams' account is still cool and enhances the film at several levels. <br /> <br /> Signature, Constant DVD Collector
