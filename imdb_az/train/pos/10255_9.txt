This film is the first and best of all six awesome Guinea Pig Films. At the same time, knowing that the film is fake, it looks realistic and non-realistic. The story is about a woman who has been captured and tortured in many different ways. At the start of the story, a man receives a letter without a return address and includes a video of a ghost showing a torture. Men who hold it are broken by the man's limitations before they die. Some scenes are shocked by the scene of the eyeball, and others do not shock as a girl who threw 100 punches for seeing fists in nearly every movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
