There is not much in this movie, but many meanings. The woman thought she would do her best in her life, but this was not true, and she found herself acquainted with this person who was conducting some research for her next job. Indeed, there should be more types of such films, not as old as "old" (I'm 13 years old), but still the film's opinion and authority. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the main point: <br /> <br /> I admit that I was thinking of watching another movie, but after reading all the analyzes, If I knew, I decided to do it. Since I have very good points in the film, I advise everyone to watch this movie and it's a really good end.
