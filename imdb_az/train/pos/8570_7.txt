Immediately I realized that this movie was not really based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, the son of Pongo and Perdita now had a good idea of ​​having their own puppies. The most bizarre Dalmatian was, of course, a little snowball, which was completely spotless until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to be honest, I did not think Cruella de Vil thought he had changed the way he was. In fact, I would often think of friendship, but now she quickly turned her into "self" and declared her Cruella a little bit worried about Chloe Dalmatians. <br /> In fact, the scene with Chloe and Kevin's puppies, watching Trampoo, was better than I expected. I love the parrot playing as a dog, and it was incredible that dogs learned many tricks for this movie. Of course, I was convinced that the Dalmatians were rescued, but I would like to know what happens to Cruella after losing all her property. Finally, the snowballs had stains until the end of the film.
