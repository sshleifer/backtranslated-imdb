Okay, I saw this movie as a kid and really liked it. My parents have never taken the movie for me, but now I'm going and now I'm buying it. I'm an adult for an animated movie of 2000. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > There was character development! It's easy to classify the characters in this movie (eg, Charlie is an egoist style, itchy, but Charlie believes Carface is obviously ruthless wild). I liked King Gator's songs too. I always loved high, bored, bright guys. This song could have been casual, but it was so fun. Finally, the animation details were beautiful. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there is a man who goes to heaven. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is actually very boring. He abandoned a place in Paradise and then returned to the end. I remember some lines of some songs like "... you can not hold a good dog", "... eternal music" and "I like to be dead" Do not remember the majority of any of them. Songs were not courageous, they were not honest. Whippet Angel: O Frustrating and NECK! HEAVY! <br /> <br /> HUNGARIANS WILL NOT BEGIN: A few scary stories (depending on the viewer) are shown in Hell pictures. Carface is extremely dangerous. Beer is also meant, but it's not actually a DUBBED beer. Gambling is a key element of the film. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Tremulous children's animations are always my favorite people. These producers and writers are no longer afraid to scare their children a little later and have been created some time later. At present it is likely to be rated by PG. Children under the age of 8 (or easily disturbing their children) should not follow it. Besides, I give it 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Happy look!
