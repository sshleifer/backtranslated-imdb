When I saw this movie only 80 minutes, I thought we had a problem. A great W. Somerset Maugham novel is a kneading up of a film that looks like a disaster that occurs about an hour and a half later. <br /> <br /> Some of the films show that Leslie Hovard has a lot of poems. a player with a patterned noodle and it was, but I do not consider Philip Carey to be a more suitable person to play, because it's Carey's. <br /> <br /> Respect is playing well, that is to shake it and overtake your head, then finally pull it out and give it a breeze. <br /> <br /> Ah, and then whom Bette Carey's obsessed and around her surrounding him. I did not know what Mildred was doing on earth and that the film was left to this detail. But as Davis plays, he's becoming the most exciting story, and if he is not bad and hard, at least at least the most dynamic person is on the screen at any given time. Davis's performance here is about 20 years after Brando's "Stella, this little known Tennesee Williams, and it's not hard to see why Davis is in a terrible spot, and he does not care about the audience and does not seem to be ugly and unglamorous. Carey is shocked when she is delayed in the film, though her appearance is shocking to find her death or an ill-defined disease (though she is very cautious about hiding a STD), of course, this movie will help scream before the Production Code comes into force <br /> <br /> Yes, most of the novel and some of the most interesting parts of the novel are in the cutting room, and the story is not really about Carey and Mildred, but I understand it's the most exciting and most gruesome part of the Maugham novel , but the title of the novel and the reader is still a part of it, so it's a smart decision. <br /> <br /> A part of the film prepared by the film adapted the novel as they themselves did. <br /> Level: B +
