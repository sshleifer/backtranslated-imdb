"Stanley and Iris" show the triumph of the human soul. For Stanley, this is a struggle to be competent and to realize its potential. It's time to find the courage to love again after Iris becomes widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda started and stood before they had the skill and courage to fully trust each other. In this sense, it gives a good idea of ​​the fact that life is often there and thus is safe. Unlike some other reviewers, I've found the characters shown to fit every one of them. The castle is also carefully selected and adds a character depth that gives meaning to the keywords that support the main characters. All in all a beautiful movie. The best thing to do is hope.
