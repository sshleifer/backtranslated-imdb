Here's the story of revenge, which is a sad, sad and ridiculous act of Denzel Washington. He has three personalities here: a low and low frontier, now a drunken old tenant, a man who is a kind of father who later loves a little girl, and then a disappointing manicure seeking revenge and revenge. <br /> <br /> Washington has been involved in a bodyguard for a small American girl living in Mexico, where children are abducted (at least according to the film) in Washington. The actress of the day, Dakota Fanning, who joined the boy. When kidnapped in front of a fan, Washington is responsible for men and does not help anyone. Caution: This movie is not for screaming. <br /> <br /> This is a sleek and stylish movie structure that is good and bad. I liked it, but some people are so excited about their taste as camera work can give you headache. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that, for several days now, there is a low role role and some other fine actors. <br /> <br /> The film looks like all of us, but it works.
