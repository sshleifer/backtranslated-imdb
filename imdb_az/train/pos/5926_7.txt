Sleepwalkers are vital creatures to save life from humans ... but they can only use girls (why not). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one of those who want to feed Mary McAfee (Alice Krige). He goes after the unpleasant Tanya (Maden Amik). <br /> <br /> On the one hand this is a great fear film. Fast paced, plentiful blood and gore and a beautiful, twisted sense of humor. There are many joke references for horror enthusiasts (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Also perfect as Krause (who thinks he can move after returning to Blue Lagoon). Like Kirge and Amick. But I found this movie uplifting. <br /> <br /> This movie was screened by Stephen King and it was very striking. Sleepless people are never fully explained. Where are they? Why are they called? Why should I eat his son's mother? Why do cats hate them and kill them? After all, what is their authority (at one point Krause is destroying a car and changing colors and styles!)? Why should they feed the power of the nations? Why Be Just a Virgin? Why does her son have sex with his mother? None of them explains the story by telling the story. This is really bad, because these questions are wrong, this is a wonderful film of fear. There are also perfect makeup and special effects. <br /> <br /> Fast, strange, and very entertaining. Only if the script is better. There was also a very clear sex scene between Krause and Krige (almost) to get the R rating. I can only give it 7.
