Ringo Lamdan is an unusual movie and has never been a strange one. The fantasy kung-fu blend with a more realistic image of the sword and spear in objects, especially in the first 10 minutes, is surprising. The horse rider is cut twice, the waist and the legs are horse. Several horses have been chopped down. This is a very unexpected event. The story is simple, Fong and his brothers Shaolin were captured by a general-lieutenant general and kept in the Red Lotus temple and later appeared as a temple after the torture chamber. The general is in a situation similar to Kurtz in Apocalypse. Now he struggles with philosophy and draws a horrifying picture with human blood. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and is pushing. Blood everywhere. The event has been completed very well and is often more intense than HK movement scenes. Sometimes the film causes absurdities or influences, but it's not bad enough to destroy the film. <br /> <br /> Find it, it's one of the best HK kung fu movies since the early 90's. Remember, it's not just child-friendly.
