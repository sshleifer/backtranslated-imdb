I thought Hugh O'Conor was as stunning as a young Kristian Braun, and I really had the right to become more recognizable for his role. I did not believe how they played. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was very bright. My favorite scene is playing football with boys and Christy uses his head to stop the sleeves and then the penalty begins! Incredible speeches by two Christys (and others).
