Dig! Although Metallica does not like to see some kind of monster, I tell everyone that this is a spinal crane documentary about one of the world's largest bands. It's fun and interesting. Come digging next to the same lines! A film about "Dandy Warhol" and "Brian Jonestown Massacre" is a two-portland band, where a music scene begins in the home town for one of the biggest and one of the bands to turn into. From the beginning, two bands only draw in opposite directions against their ability to decide whether they are good or bad. I've been filming for over seven years and seeing the fame rise to create the meteoric fame of the madness (thanks to this vodafon advertisement) and Jonestown to the wannabes from the stage-makers. As bandits become more frustrated, friendships increase the intensity of tension and turn into arguments, even scene fights at several points. All of this can be either half-tragic or semi-tragic and may be believed or mistaken. I first said that, despite the group's interests, you can watch Metallica. Dig! on the other hand, it's a little different or more comfortable and it's easier to watch if you have an interest in both groups. It is still a promise not to be in a band rather than a good film and career path. Dig! The rocks and the role are terrifying in the coat tail, and it is a fine example of traps and pleasures that want or want to be famous.
