There are movies and movies. Films are kinematics rather than candy, films are more, films are genuine works of art. Fraulein Doctor, of course, is well placed in the last. Like most people, I'm sorry for the battle scenes, but I think the character of the central character is the best quality of the film. Fraulein, who, despite all his efforts, is being treated by Germany's supreme commander in a very severe way, while doing his best to serve his country as a true daughter of Germany. One of the most dangerous and most dangerous images of life is the event that the doctor has conveyed to a Mercedes Benz team in the car, alone, ruin and hiccups on the rear seat. The only emotional pain presented by Richard Burton from the Cold Spy is approaching. Fraulein Doctor is a deeper film about a single image. I want her producers not to let go to the DVD that those who have never experienced can do it, and those who see it can use this exclusive movie again (again and again).
