Only for anyone who likes the "Beauty & The Beast" beauty animated version of "Disney Productions" or even Jean Cocteau's surreal tale in 1975 for the French (but Polish director) version. The plot belongs to the French family of fading aristocracy who married a well to a British family. The main thing is to keep the baby's old curse in the family. The film also includes many flashback sequences (potentially) describing the curse of this family. Until the very last moment of opening credits, there is a nearly non-stop erotic entertainment building with many open and graphic sexual content (hence the movie's X rating in the US is not now unrated, at the first start). The film of some of the most respected thinkers in the ruling class will probably turn Bunel's flights into a similar area. If you have a really strange taste and will not be offended by the "taboo" material, this film can only get itching.
