Michael Bowen plays an innocent young boy working on a thousand-kilometer cars to visit his millionaire father (creepy Ray Wise), a fictional, wandering lantern, and wandered through the dangerous line of daring, attractive and attractive children (lying Clare Wren), so no longer unemployed creates anxiety for his family. No attractive and rectangular VHS and cable television - this is a charming, stylish and exciting drama I've seen for the first time. It is written in a beautiful way, intelligently moves and focuses intensely on a script that ensures your nails are crushed. I do not believe in the fact that you do not really like seeing reviewers. It is a classic that is evident in the open.
