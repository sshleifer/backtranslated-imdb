In the fall of 1979, the US television movie "Beatles's birth" was actually the best film describing the fairy tale of four children from Fenerbahce, the music industry and the world. As the old Beatle Pete says in Best view. It's good to quit, but it's like Paul McCartney, like John Lennon and Rod Culbertson, by Step Mackenna. A legend of the Film, Rock, and Roll era, developed by Mr. Dick Clark. A year ago, in 1978, he produced another television movie, which played a leading role in another legend of Kurt Rusell. "ELVIS". He directed an unusual film called "John Carpenter" and directed other successful films like this; "Halloween", "Escape from New York" and "The Thing". The same can be said for the director of "Beatles Birth", Mr. Richard Marquand Director. She continued to manage other theater blockbusters, such as "Jedi Star Wars Returns", "Eye of the Needle" and "Oil Edge". The only film that I know about Fab Four is the Back Beat, which has the freedom of theater in 1994. But the critics did not have any interest in it, nor did the public, because there was not a long life in the theater life. It's a very striking and straightforward film that proves the success of Beatles, the origin of the legend and the success of their success when they came out at the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 when they came to the marriage.
