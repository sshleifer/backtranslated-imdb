I found this movie cheerful. The strangers in other popular films of that era were the funniest I've ever seen in this kind of movie. Try it out. <br /> <br /> When you see movies that are spoofing this movie, you'll get humor too. <br /> <br /> I (and those watching with me) felt the funniest part of the movie (this is not a spoiler, because I'm not telling you what's going to happen) was a scene with the "amazing thing" from the MIB. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> When you first discovered the device and did not know what it was ... then you will understand later in the movie ... when you go there. I could not find a copy on the DVD because I could get a copy.
