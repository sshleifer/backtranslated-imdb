When I hear that this movie went out before the Halloween night, I am very excited. When I knew that there was a book written in 1978, I had to read before seeing the movie. I'm sure the film will be very different to me if I do not read books. The writers, of course, have done a good job to stay faithful to the main area of ​​the book, with little differences. In my opinion, the most disappointing thing about the movie was Boyle, who played the role of Colle. I'm not a great fan of Boyle, and always tries to use it, regardless of the mood in the film. lips and dark eye makeup look even more sexy. Indeed, I think the film is taken to the true heartbreak of the house. My favorite subpotto was the Sheehan family (a very bizarre bout, when his son was killed in Iraq and in today's events Casey Sheehan, whose mother goes to a great Iraqi horror). In the book, it is clear that the war was not Iraq, but rather Vietnam, and when I opened the video on the house's helicopter, I was really scattered. In general, I was amazed at the film, so the book was very good.
