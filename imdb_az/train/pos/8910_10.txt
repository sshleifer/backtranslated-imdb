Most of the Atomic Age monster films I have seen on television are included in some of them, some of them were scared during the day. Films such as INVADERS from MARS, when it comes to the things that occupy Homeworld, made "a little grill" for children not only safe; BLOB reiterated this fact. I remember that dark nights were lying on the ground in the evening, when body mice and Martian occupants and Blobs were put into a non-suspicious society. At the beginning of the 1980's, a local science museum (Richmond, Virginia) had a classic broadcast of a Atomic period every week. They were 16mm and most of them were black and white (and the projector was noisy) and BLOB's "colorful" patterns were pale-pink. I was dragged to my mother and I liked it. There, in the science museum, I really enjoyed BLOB. The cinematographer's intention was to earn money, but it was the sincerity of the filmmakers' talent (players), which made me fall in love with this movie. Corny? Your bet. Without cheese? Do not buy any cheesier. But man, what a movie!
