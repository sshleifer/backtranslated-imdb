John Waters is one of the best, considering that most of the movies that are going on today are a lot of their previous work, reducing their density-like hostility and true conscience. Of course, there are nudity and sexual references, at least one fashionable thing, which can not be considered as bad or disgusting. Due to some of the great casting choices, this film has really brought about the art of modern art and the subjective nature of the modern artist. Funny and somewhat refined (this is possible for Waters) is one of those films I will watch on a rainy day.
