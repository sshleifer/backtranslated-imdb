**** Includes spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of fears for many years now. In my opinion, when I see all the adults, something else will surprise me. I have never seen this movie before. And it was a cure that was off the beaten path ... it was not just the water bottle. Here, in the 1940s, there was a fear movie that many dare to try differently. The beautiful girl is fearless for a change and saves men, including the one who loves the monster! This is for a twist. This girl was in contrast to most of the movies at that time, she did not scream in her shadow, and did not run out on any leaf without feeling afraid. This time he was not afraid to live alone in a hut far from the rest of the villagers. As it is said, not just a place, but a wet mud. Naturally, even in the open air, it takes moisture on the mud grass ... like Ripley's regular 1940s version. No snake, gator, or terrible strangler was worried about this. Books in early feminists should contain this unseemly work. <br /> <br /> If I'm like you, you're just afraid of the classic B / V movies in the wonderful atmosphere of the 1930s, 40s. Be sure to wear your iron turtle neck to protect it.
