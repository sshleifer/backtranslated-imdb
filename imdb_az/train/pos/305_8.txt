Screwball comedy about romantic discrepancies in New York City. Peter Bogdanovic is obviously in love with all the women in his picture - he treats them with respect - still Audrey Hepburn (naturally) puts his shoulder on others, because he is probably the prince Bogdanovich, who is perhaps the most famous in the film 30 years ago. She loves lovers, she is well-boiled / soft boiled in the sheets between Gazzara and allows her to shine along the room. The love relationships in the movie are fast and fun, though John Ritter's television-tapered clutziness has dropped. Exciting to watch all of Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten, and earthy, outlook Patti Hansen. But he is really Hepburn's lover, and he's totally illuminated. From ****
