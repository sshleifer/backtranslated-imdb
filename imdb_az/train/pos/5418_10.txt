Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen is the 19th century soldier in India. It is to save the territory of a deadly kult with the help of a water boy (Sam Jaffe). Chemistry amongst actors helps transform one of the most entertaining films of this time. Sam Jaffe is exceptionally exceptionally exemplary by anyone who has been mistreated by anyone and does not want to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Rudyard based on Kipling's poem. Everyone who loves this movie needs to see it.
