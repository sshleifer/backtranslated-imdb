Wes Craven created the most successful killer-thriller films of all time. After watching movies, you can find new fears. <br /> <br /> In this film, Lisa is exposed to terror by her comrade friend. He has to kill and if he does not, Jack will kill his father. <br /> <br /> Lisa is in great confusion, because she will kill everything he chooses. <br /> <br /> Acting was unrealistic. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy performed incredibly well. Emotions are the right choice. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is a "Scream" reminiscent, but it's better than bringing together the "Screams" album. <br /> <br /> And what can I say - it is still the best killer-triller movie in the 21st century ...
