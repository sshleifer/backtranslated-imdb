Budget constraints, time limits, scripts, and cutting after cutting, cutting, cutting ... This group is a good group of young directors; it is intelligent in script - yes, allegorical - is intelligent with zero dollar influences, relying on actors, friends, and others for time, knowledge, time, knowledge, places; and get a first feature of 1-in-1000 thing. These guys are filming. Those who are good. Look at the shorts collection "Heartland Fear" and see the development. And I can say that working with them is the most fun thing to do in your business. I'm talking about harsh and insulting criticisms from this film, if a spokesman for a movie heard a word of the word, thought of a thought or concept, or if everything seemed to be the same, and seemed to be fierce enough to please somebody. What a horrible thought that should be intended for an audience. Let us give you the "Blank Acre". Just because you are in the genre of fear / tension for supernatural foundation, just do not care about your expectation. This is not a drama with deep respect for a message that does not attack a visual center of your brain, but rather attracts one's empathetic imagination to survive the pain of the mind and soul. brand ridgway, Curtis, "Blank Acre"
