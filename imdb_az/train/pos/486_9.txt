"Luzin Defense" is a time-lapse movie. it's a dark, intense film and has kept my focus all the time. John Turturro, a tender, eccentric chess grandmaster, is entirely stunning and Emily Watson is a magic as a subtle but disobedient daughter of a very respected Russian family. Chemistry between Watson and Turturro becomes clear after symbolizing the story. Generally, this movie is one of the best in the life of a chess master, and Turturro and Watson add to the movie no basic, non-stick feel. Many will come out of the thought of theater and feel the slightest feeling of this brilliant appearance, which is the least likely to happen in love stories.
