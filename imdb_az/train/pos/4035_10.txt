In a word ... it's incredible. <br /> <br /> I do not really want to see Pan-to-Do at the start, because this would be a crying crap on the unit and I thought it would give prejudices against India and Pakistan. I was totally wrong. Pinjar is a heart-stained, emotional and intelligent film that has no visible defects. I stopped watching her. For a long time, it remained in my mind. themes, pain, loss, feeling - were all real. <br /> <br /> This is truly a work that is rarely seen in Bollywood today. There is no prejudice or prejudice, and division is a human story. No country here is depicted as good or bad. There are bad Hinds, bad pagans and good Indian and Pakists. Cinematography is perfect and music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to the owner of the Gulzar) and scary. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the move just took my breath away. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in an intellectual and really beautiful movie ... do not look at anything else. This film gives them all. I advise all my heart. AMAZING can not describe how excellent this is.
