The film was mostly interested in me because Dianne Keaton was my favorite actress. I do not agree with some tasks that the land has not been proven. After that, I had no problem (maybe some people had more appetite the previous night). The film was very sad and touched. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a wonderful new talent (very nice) and Tom Everett Scott works well with his own part. The relationship between mother and daughter could have been a bit real, but there was no behavior in the film. It's tragically sad, but it's clear. New Year's Day beat other shows
