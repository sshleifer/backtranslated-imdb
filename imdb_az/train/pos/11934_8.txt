At first you may think of another Disney movie, but it's a baby movie. But you can not help while watching, but you can enjoy it. All ages will love this film. When I was 10 years old, I saw this movie for the first time and I still love it after 8 years! Danny Glover is superior and can not play a better part. Christopher Lloyd is cheerful and partly perfect. Tony Danza believes in Mel Clark. You can not help, but enjoy this movie! I'll give 10/10!
