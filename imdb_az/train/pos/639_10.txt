This is a good family show, a great actor. This delayed reality show's prince is a wonderful break. And now there's nothing else on TV that's because Joan Arcadia is similar to that of a teenager. In any case, Jeremy Sumpter's main character (Pete Young) gives a charming likability and naivet√© that is very sweet and cuddly, because the Clubhouse deserves a look. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms, beat the rest of the main cast members and each have their own roles. I love Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister Betsy; she is completely pill, but still hates her mother and her brother, even though she hates to show her. It can actually take a few episodes to find your feet, but Clubhouse is one of the best demonstrations to easily come in at a good time, so check out people - you'll love it!
