Oh, what a fun thing to do here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has an opportunity to feature a comedy director (see Fast Times at Ridgemont Hill, Whom he speaks), but he spoke to actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton, Johnny's role easily breezes with the best screen performance. Joe Piscopo is a great thing to do, like Danny Vermin, in a fitting manner, how much shameful managers could not get on this subject. I even played Richard Dimitri Moronie and remembered the unique word of the character. <br /> <br /> I do not think most of the character's name is an accident that MORON wrote. <br /> <br /> Good lines are sprinkled with Peter Boyle, Griffith Dunne. Good lines of Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner. <br /> <br /> Actors with smaller roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale also draw a good line.
