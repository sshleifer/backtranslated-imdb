Eleanor Powell plays the most delicate parts of these areas, as well as in most of the movies. For some reason - oh is disclosed! - Cuban was chosen to transport a magnet mini. Good guys and bad guys are competing for me and who is in a state of shock. However, as always, Powell dances are superior and worthy of value. And this is a Lahr, playing the Coward lion, talking about the warm memories of Technicolor in 1939. The benefit of a fringe is that he announces a young Frank, he with this beautiful voice and skinny weakness, he then left to the clever man persona. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time demonstrating his virtuosity. Watch out for a unique duo especially with Dorsey's trumpet man, Ziggy Elman. Perhaps in ignorance I say "rare", but in the film or notes there is no such drum / trump sequence. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's weak personality is relatively limited. Powell is still the most beautiful film dancer.
