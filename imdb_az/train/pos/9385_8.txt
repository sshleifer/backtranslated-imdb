Red Rock West is a good example of the film's practical budgeting. All you need is a smart script, good actors and atmospheric loads. <br /> <br /> Niki Caucasian has been wounded in Lebanon and gets down to the $ 5 last week after refusing to work in a petrol station because of her bad knee. <br /> <br /> He is also involved in Red Rock and is mistaken by a bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, the most dangerous but still bad) for a Texas soldier. <br /> <br /> It looks like theft. Just to get there, check it out. He offers double to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to get out of the city with free money and become sparring lovers. However, some difficulties and failures lead him back and forth in and out of the Red Rock. Finally, it has come together with Dallan's Lyle (low and almost sympathetic Dennis Hopper), a REAL physician from Texas, suggests helping her knowingly complicating the plan. RRW has never released a major release, so most viewers have found it on video or cable television shows. It would seem like a TV movie, but it's bigger than I see in such a way. <br /> <br /> The small, slow-moving direction, the moody account and the imaginary desert wind were prepared for a big movie in all theaters, but these days the best way to watch a DVD on a large HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only vulnerable part of the film is that Lara Flynn Boyle's dreadful dyke-ish hairdo is boring femme fatale. Of course, I'm not going to fall for it, but if Nicole's character falls to the rebellious lesbians, you'll accept it.
