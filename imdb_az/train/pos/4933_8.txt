Update 'lost' gem! Effective dialogue is a great way to create effective characters and attract enough to care for them. Douglas and Widmark symbols are real heroes. Palance is his ordinary state. Widmark chasing a fictional battlefield, chasing less than 60 seconds of car tracking 'logical' ends, and a chase that slams the hottest follow-ups of modern Hollywood. You know how to predict, but the tension and interest continue. The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see. The film feels slightly slower, but stay tuned for the perfect results.
