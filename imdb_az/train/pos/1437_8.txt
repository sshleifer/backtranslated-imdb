We often see films about unwanted things happening in politics, but I still recommend City Square. Al Pacino plays as the mayor of New York City, who is involved in kidnapping a boy. But it turned out that nothing really could affect it. In this film, heroes are as strange as we expect from everyone involved in the political scandal. No matter how much you trust a politician, you may have doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not say a similar example of something in this movie, but it's not a point. If you have the idealistic impressions of the above, this movie will reduce such ideas. Surely, I encourage you to see. He also plays the leading roles of John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
