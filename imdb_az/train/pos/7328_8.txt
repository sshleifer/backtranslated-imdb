I liked this movie very much. I did not hire a very bad thing to spend one evening. A particularly satisfying experience has emerged. Some scenes were cheerful and were not meant to be just a stupid slapstick comedy, but managed to be in a movie with meaning and morality values. Manages both numbers. The results are good, but he has shot the film, especially the star. I did not see any of these actors before, but they were very pleasant and when I said so much, I was thinking about what I was up to. The scenario is smart and attractive and has a fresh feeling. I think you're upset about watching it.
