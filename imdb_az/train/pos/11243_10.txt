For the first time I saw Breaking Glass when it was released in the UK in 1980. Later, I liked it and in August 2005 we held it at a Canadian station. It's part of my regrets that I can not find a shop in the sound or DVD ... If anyone wants to light a bit or order it from a very valuable internet company. When returning to the movie, when the music was tested, Hazel / Kate said to the British in the 80's ... Indeed, one of the same reasons, Thatcher and What happened to the country at that time, please do not worry, if you do not have the chance to watch this movie!
