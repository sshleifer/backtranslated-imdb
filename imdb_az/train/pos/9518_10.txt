A beautiful illustration of one of the worst aspects of that era. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was something like that, as if someone was tired of his job (I thought he did not have a choice) but he wanted a normal life for his family. This is the best way to handle it. I do not want to spoil the plot - but if you are a person who wants more than a movie, you should see this movie. (Though violence).
