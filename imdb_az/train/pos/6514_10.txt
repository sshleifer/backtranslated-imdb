I thought the guys in the show were doing a very good job. Especially enjoyed the performance of Emma's character. Beautiful works! The hairs were pretty good for low budget impressions. I enjoyed watching the movie and not having to look every 5 minutes. Along with the dance of the fairy, I was glad to be burned. Children's spirits were also good. The other good moments of the film are moving along with it. There were not too slow scenes. The potential for adolescence was also convincing, and it helped keep the show entertaining. All the movie will be watched on a pleasant night.
