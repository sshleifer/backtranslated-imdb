I ran into a local video store during the sale of the film's annual sidewalks. When I was watching thousands of videos hoping to find some cartoons for sale, I met this movie. I read the back of the movie and found out that it was God's hand in my work to get this movie. You see, there are three relative groups living with my family (and will soon be accepted). Immediately, my children were in contact with three children in the movie. The film helped them understand their situation better. For the first time, my brother decided to open up to me the oldest (7 years old / female) history and trauma. He fights against the issue of trust. This is the first time I saw her weeping. After watching the movie, I asked what was meant for the adoption of a child. He replied, "It means to be happy." We need to look after families who encourage children and plan to marry. Certainly, we have opened lines of communication with us.
