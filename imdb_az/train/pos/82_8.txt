Fortunately for us, Real McCoy fans (all Baby Boomers, growing up in the 50s and 60s) emerged when adult actors / actresses came for a reunion show in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly afterwards. It was quite unpleasant to meet again with Luka, Sugar Babe, and Pepino, which was equally mysterious about no mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman. This is my understanding that Little Luke died in 1999, but I'm not sure how. There is no information on Hassie on the Internet, and I can find it. They could not see much interest. Contents: Contents: Contents: Table of Contents: The Allies or the Lydia family (even if they are still alive): 1) asked to stay out of the discussions and therefore desires either; or 2) TNN either Michael or Lydia (none of us) could not find a trace, they did not appear. Therefore, it would be safer to talk about leaving them out of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Walter Brennan's retrospective was a wonderful job. They did not put any bones on it ... The show was such a successful father. I remember my father imitating my father's gimp walk, and my parents laugh (I'm sure more than a million children have returned). A little worrying about me was Richard Crenna's tendency to dominate the debate ... sometimes he did not turn Toni and Kathleen into a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez was able to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak or talk too much during the Reunion show. Unfortunately, I have heard all three of them. In general, the show in Reyny was very pleasant to me. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
