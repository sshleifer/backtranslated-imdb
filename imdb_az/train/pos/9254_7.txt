No movies with Dennis Tea House, gary busey, erica eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner are rated here under 5. It's easy for Ms.Eleniak, who is looking for a poor human version of films such as the 16-block or late Night Race outside captives brought here. Tom Berenger plays another complicated role, the shadow-type military type and William Mcnamara plays outdoors. Eleniak is a fun movie that should have been and should have run out and all the actors above have a good income, which ensures that the film rolls. This is not really a family movie, because there is a rare nuclear scene with some blasphemy and eleniak, but this is better than this time around other ghosts.
