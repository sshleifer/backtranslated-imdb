Fever Pitch has many of the clich√©s we have come to identify with the Hollywood romantic comedies: the relationship between a few common people, the hidden mystery, the inevitable breakthrough, and the very public? Well, I will not go, but you take the picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Writer writer Lowell Ganz won by Nick Hornby and adapted from a novel by Babaloo Mandel, Ben was a Boston Red Sox fan of his lifetime, Uncle, when he was seven years old, and he was an amazement at this point, damaging his life with women. I'm not just a fan, it's not "fanatic" who travels every winter for the Red Sox Spring Training games in Fort Meyers, Florida and never misses a home game during the "normal" season. His family does not consist of parents or brothers, but the team and his bedroom that participates in every game are not a place to sleep, not a Red Sox museum. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) is threatened by the likelihood of growing up, but Ben is not ready to do so. She was more involved in the Yankee series than going to Baltimore to meet her parents or to go to Paris with her and to miss the Anaheim series. In order to think about his relationship, his failure, and his priorities, one-dimensional doctor Phil wannabe asks him: "You love Red Sox, but did they love you again?" The main purpose of Fever Pitch is that some things are more important than baseball (to quench the thought), and you can not know it's nothing. Of course, Boston Red Sox is a group that breaks the hearts of fans who want to die the most, but this is the Bambino curse of 2004, and when the Red Sox goes to a new level, I can do the same. Both leading speeches are very good, but the Farrelly Brothers even manage quite a total gag. Although Fever Pitch is mistaken for an art movie, this is a joy I have to fall as one of my guilty pleasures. Go to Blue Jaysa!
