California, a movie about missing ideals. Travel on the darkest road. Unreliable Way. Assassination is about a couple who set out to find a better life in California. Adam (David Duchovny is the best actor ever to date) wants to write a book about the famous murders in America and his daughter - a photographer - will take pictures. So, they did not know what to expect on the road, and they drew a mark of popular murders. They decided to find several couples to share their travel costs and put an ad. However, couples who respond are not just a few pairs. This is one of the most bizarre pairs. The girl is a pure, fragile creature who fancies many things and loves cactus. Man is the opposite. Tough cruel killer. We learn in the early hours of the film and we continue on our trip to California (as usual, not symbolizing the word murderer, but by betraying the word murderer), betraying, killing and finally defeating. All potentials, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes are really good speeches, and we must take into account that this film was shot, but one of them was a star. Photography is striking with the darkness surrounding most of the movie, and the music is in harmony with the film's dark character. All this is a really good movie. Do not miss it. You will think again before you bring a stranger to your car to share it!
