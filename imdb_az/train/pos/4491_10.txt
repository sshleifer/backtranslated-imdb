I love this movie "Spring and Port Wine". I was born in Leigh, about 7 miles from Bolton. I moved to Bolton in 1965. My job is through Little Lever everyday through Farnworth, and sometimes by bike, but then letting the car down, the car brings back almost all the memories of the broken working class neighbors, but they are always able to help. Fred Dibnah was in my bedroom round at Bromwich St's Corner. If you see that you did not see the movie first, if you compare it to a soap like Coronation St, I agree that it's a good soap but then 'Kitchen Sink Drama!' It was said. Watch this movie for a talented actor, who has become a frequently-featured home-studded TV player, watching the film of the main local people and the good character of people being happy and happy!
