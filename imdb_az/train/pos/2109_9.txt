I have seen this a few times, but it's part of a romantic comedy. Well, a romantic comedy and maybe a little dated. However, it is very inviolable, as is the case with office politics, adultery and loneliness. You know that you know exactly what you are leading, but there is an element of unpredictability that protects your interests, and everything is not as expected. But there is enough reason and charm to touch the hardest of movies. If you meet a person who does not love this movie, consider seriously how well you know them.
