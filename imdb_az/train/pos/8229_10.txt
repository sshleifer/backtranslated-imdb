It's a slowly moving movie, slowly building a story of an old stripper, which begins with a complete stranger in a new family life. The audience is slowly feeling that something is wrong here ... <br /> <br /> Although it's a bit of a bit of a taste in the end, I liked this movie very much. It's smart, well-paced, and very good. Both Filipp Toretton and Emmanuelle Seigner go deep into their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son is too touched by the "pierrot". <br /> <br /> It looks like someone's tension. <br /> <br /> You can feel inadequate several times with a few scenes, though a very unusual film throughout the film, a very special atmosphere. <br /> I'll give it a 8/10!
