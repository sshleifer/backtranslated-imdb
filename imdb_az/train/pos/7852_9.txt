Ladislas Starewicz, who is interested in insects and movies, has a short film about a love triangle between Beethle, an artistic grasshopper and Mrs. Beetle. A very simple story of an adulterous couple, both of whom want to stimulate marriages, resembles a brief translation of the time or the like. The Starewicz twist on the story is to use the size of the wedge with the wires to fix the feet with the square frame animation. The story builds Mr. Beetle knowing a brave grasshoppers, as if captured by a drunken nightclub club. When Mr. Beetle finds his wife in the arms of his artistic friend, he is followed by anger, but ultimately forgives him and takes him out to see the film. However, Mrs. Beetle learns about her husband's curses as the film she watches, the Beetle and her jerk together with the jealous locust. Mrs. Beetle picked up Mr Beetle with an umbrella, and Mr Beetle jumped to the screen and ended up in the prison after the projector they both shot. Insects are placed in humanized situations like a home or a nightclub, and have human characteristics of jealousy, anger, lust, and revenge. Insects carry bags, driving vehicles, and even wear their shoes. However, they still silence their antennas and open and close their mandibles as real insects. The novelty of the story does not go even after being watched more than once, but as the fluid moves, the film moves slowly. The action is a complicated detail, but the speed and speed of the shooting process are lost in the process of faster speed. Despite its speed, the movie is a beautiful example of Starewicz's early puppet and is highly recommended.
