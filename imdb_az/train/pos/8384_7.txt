I was reading somewhere (enough to consider) that this is anime-coded mecha anime and I think I'm in the right line. For the first time, I was watching this movie when I was a young man, and I was dying to see him again, and finally, all my memories back in time. I do not think it will be very serious - it is a bit part of the 1980s' 80s TV movie entertainment (though this point is not highlighted, it's set in the background of a pretty dark future)). The dialogue I was most admired about this film did not correspond to the dialogue - cliches, no predictable lines - absolutely good entertainment! Maybe the time did not do this little movie, but still I can be grateful for it. Nothing is perfect but fun and does not want to be anything else. Nerds and comic-shop-kids worry about technical issues - who cares? Look for yourself and make your own decision. The opinions of others do not belong to anyone.
