Okay, I am an admirer of the Nightmare series, and everyone says the worst is here! But this is not it! Did you see Freddy's Revenge? WTF! This was the worst! Now this movie is quite worthy and looks like Freddy's story, and he's a daughter and so on. There was cool and so on. And then it's 3-D! I was very excited, and I realized that when I dialed it into the DVD box, it was immediately rolled into the 3-D sequence. <br /> <br /> Lisa Zanes's hand, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than one), Lezlie Dean knife, Baseball Bat and Lisa Zane, Doc's hands, were 3-D as Freddy's head exploded. <br /> <<br /> <br /> I really liked this movie because it was 3-D, but the whole film was 3-D, not just in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> TEN is 15 minutes on the road !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
