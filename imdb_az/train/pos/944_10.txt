You can stage a version of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" with strawberry puppets, and I will probably be watching. As a child I have been one of my favorite stories. Maybe it is everyone who thinks it's all right, so nobody invites me, but for some reason, never miss the opportunity to watch one of those unreasonable classics fitted to many screenshots <br /> <br /> This version really comes to the fore, molds are as gravitas as they lead to their role. <br /> <br /> What we've heard in the past is getting a new intensity, and each character is more realistic and convincing in the hands of this beautiful ensemble. <br /> <br /> Emmy in 1985 for this role of George C. Scott. His eternal loan is not a dream of Scrooge's role described, but in my opinion, it is a fresh definition of one of his best performances. He did not intentionally try a British accent, but rather conveyed the lines of the famous gravel. His Scrooge is not simply a strange old man (he is often described), but he is a person who is angry over the world. When each of the three souls are visited, we understand how this anger fades, grows, and eventually drowsers the soul. Is obliged to review their lives, we see it as an alternative to, and then re-softening unrepentant saints we see the reaction. In a great dramatic scene, when he knelt in his grave and weeps, he wants mercy as he tries to convince the repentance of his repentance and the third spirit and desire to change his life, we are totally broken, knees and figuratively. Scott made Scrooge a totally convincing and painful man. <br /> <br /> An actor supporting the Scottish performance makes a significant contribution to the dark beauty of this version. Scrooge's nephew Fred Holywell is an excellent example of this. It is often described as an unpleasant venue, where it is played by Roger Rees, with a sensual intensity that is missing from the previous illustrations. When asked by Scrooge, "I do not want anything from you, I do not want anything from you, why can not we be friends?" He says not only the disappointment in the face, but also the relative residence of Scrooge himself. It is a moving performance and one of the most dramatic scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> The performance of English actor Frank Finlay, by Scrooge's late partner, Jacob Marley, is even better. Bu nağılın əksər versiyalarında, Marley ilə səhnə bir ölü adam təsəvvürlə təsvir etmək çətindir, çünki, sadəcə, çünki filmdə bir aşağı nöqtə bir az olmaq üçün çalışır və nəticələr adətən yalnız düz (ooooh, bax, qorxunc ghost ....... deyil In this version, perhaps the most daring scene of the whole film. At the entrance of Marlea, the locks of Scrooge's door are open from their own home, and the sound of chains in the house is as charming as the sound of the chains. But Finlay's Marley is not an ethereal soul. He is also a spirit of aggression and anxious inspiration. Marley may be a ghost, but she still regrets a life spent on her anger and wealth, and her despair, which she realizes that her sins are worthless, is still very human. As it is illustrated by Finlay, we have no problem believing that this bare Scrooge will shake it with the nightmare appearance. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> </ strong> <br /> <strong> This story was the first time we lived. Edward Woodward (Do you remember him from Equalizer?), Is both fun and dangerous, as the Spirit of the Christmas Eve. Məşhur xəttini təqdim edərkən "o cənnətin nəzərində, bu kasıb insanın uşağı kimi milyonlarla yaşamaq daha az dəyərlidir və daha az sığınacaqsınız" deyə o, artıq bir şən Santa Claus surrogate deyil, lakin bir cəzbedici mələk <br /> <br /> <br / <poverty <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Her face shows her tidy courage and sometimes fatigue in the face of unbearable circumstances. Later on, Scrooge's scene on the scene by Milad Ghost, to come to the Cratchit family after the death of Tiny Tim, Warner's performance, in a word, is going to take you to tears.
