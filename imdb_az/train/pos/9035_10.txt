It was perfect in this movie. As an amateur rocket player, I found a few mistakes. As a human being, he touched my heart and soul. You would think that they were the real characters to watch the actors. Laura Dern, a favorite actress, did not leave anything in her performance. Young actors playing Rocket Boys showed more talent than the young Homer. Homer's father inspired her for a real relationship of love / hatred between a father and son. If you do not get a nail in your throat, or when the first successful rocket comes out, or if your father or son tears it, check your pulse (dead).
