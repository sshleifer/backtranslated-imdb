Because of me and my brother renting this movie, we were in a difficult situation to be in the shade of something. But the movie has been overcrowded very slowly. <br /> <br /> It is more than just a representative of a century. The characters in it have very realistic images, and most actors do incredible things. Different stories are cooked in one place with a true look, giving it a unique touch. <br /> <br /> As I explained it, I really felt that I was telling about events happening with heroes. <br /> <br /> And I would like to clarify Julia Stiles in the description of Katie's infinite number. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone.
