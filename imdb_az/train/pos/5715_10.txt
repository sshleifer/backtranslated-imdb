Karen enters the Japanese home as a nurse, replacing Emma, ​​who is a strange woman lying in the daytime and sleeping at night. Karen goes upstairs after hearing the sounds while facing a scary ghost. <br /> <br /> This is very scary! Scenes are shocking and scary! The characters are good. The settings are creepy. I love the whole area! The last was shocking! I stood at a scene where a little boy was raised to the man who found his brother above and shocked. The most terrifying movie I've ever seen. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend this to fans of fear. 10/10 and 5 stars!
