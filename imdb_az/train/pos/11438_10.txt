Ralph and Mumford are not wrong in their lands, but they have been unaware of Sinanomess Botch's paws. Once upon a time, their story, the faces they face, and the struggle to determine them correctly. <br /> <br /> The animation process, similar to the South Park style, is three-dimensional and very smooth, with an amazingly exciting soundtrack and beautiful sound that works best on the job. If I did not know that this animation is a style, my mom is a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie on Dolby Surround or THX, CAUTION! If you do, you will not miss a thing, but if you do, it will be a lot more experience!
