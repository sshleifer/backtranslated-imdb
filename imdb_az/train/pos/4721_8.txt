The sad story of the discharged B-17 pilot. Brady was shot in the occupied area. Local farmers offered him kindness and sacrifice his own life. I have never heard of this movie and pushed me for two hours. After the movie is over I rejoice that I have taken my time. At the start of the film, a whole story was given to explain Brady's face.
