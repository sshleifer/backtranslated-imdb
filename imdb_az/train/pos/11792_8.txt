I'll go out on the one hand and actually defend the Gray Shadows as a good episode of a film-show episode involving William Thomas Ricker, the commander of a deadly deadly disease, of life and death. The scenes from the Flashback series have been performed very well, as was the case with relaxing romantic episodes like Riker "11001001", "Angel One" and "Long Ladder". The tragic moments, such as the death of Ta≈üan in the "Scarcely Deceit", and the elements of the "Shor Castle", "Conspiracy" and the "Horrors skin" were recorded. Ricker also showed courage by saying some joked jokes, such as "A father ended up with a 3-day intensive pain, over a year after a snake, the snake was destroyed". This episode emphasized Will Ricker's psychological experience in extreme violence. And YES, in my opinion, is a strong episode in announcing the "Black Shadows" because my grape was covered with sweat during the original ventilation, and Riker was surprised to see that he was alive and living, and other great, galactic, adventures ... Of course, in the years to come, I had just formulated the episode's only opinion ... but the prize goes for the "best episode of television history", so this episode should be highly appreciated.
