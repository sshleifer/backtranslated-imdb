This is a movie that wants to see it again. Especially, after finishing, I liked it. <br /> <br /> For the first time, if the laws are not blown up for the first time, she is suspected to be back again. <br /> <br /> The story could have been more psychological, but I understand that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some people have complained to Hanke as a gangster. I believe that this is not justified. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, although he was released a few days ago, in 2002, I saw it on DVD for the first time yesterday.
