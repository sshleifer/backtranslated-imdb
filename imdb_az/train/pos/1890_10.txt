This is one of the movies I have seen many times, so I can give most of them. Some lines in this movie are invincible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Time. You've been laughing all the time since Arthur Susan ended up with Father Moose. I watch and watch the miracle with the plants. It dropped as I imagined. <br /> Last Sir John Gielgood was a nice addition on this subject. His behavior, as well as his linen and Arturu, was equally fun. It's always a funny moment when you tell her that she or her is a little spoiled when she puts her head in compassion. I'm always going to "Go To Bath" listening and watching lines every time I laugh.
