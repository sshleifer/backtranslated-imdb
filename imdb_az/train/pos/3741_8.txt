The war drama that took place in Louisiana in 1971. They are mainly trained and then follow a group of Americans through Tigerland. These two men, Colin Farrell and Paxton (Matthew Davis), are dealing with how they meet, be friends and become a leader of a corpus team (Clifton Collins Jr.) and an endless psycho (Shea Wingham). br> <br /> Joel Schumacher is an amazing nonprofit film directed by. Most of the film uses a handheld camera and uses digital video for battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covers Irish blends and adopts a pretty convincing Southern accent. It works very well - the movie looks weird (as needed) and worries. His performance is only superior - a very talented young man. Davis is, unfortunately, not good. Long, muscular, very beautiful and very soft. <br /> <br /> The rest of the Caucasus is just great. <br /> <br /> This film was dropped off from her studio. There were no stars here, familar stories and "another war movie". Just played for a week in Boston! <br /> <br /> Of course, Farrell and Davis have a long nud scene.
