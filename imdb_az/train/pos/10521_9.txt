Yes, I think I am emotionally attached to this movie, because for the first time I've been looking at the cinema for the first time 10 times ... or I'm afraid to deal with it! But for a few years (and many movies) later watching it - it's a well-prepared little thing! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow with more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is perfectly Mr. Knightley. <<< sigh >>> Sophie Thompson's Ms. Bates is the most beautiful (conscience, napkin, pardon!) virtuoso action, and the rest of it has no frustration - Toni Colette brings Harriet many Muriel and Evan McGregor is convincing - Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are perfect "impossible" couples! Of course, sets and suits and beautiful sounds, motivating, almost as hobbiton, the atmosphere of the film is a visual overload, despite cinematography and art decoration. Very nice, but a bit of a belt tension has reached a better feeling. But the good thing is that the film does not take it very seriously, there is something very entertaining - and sometimes a pretty cool arrangement - not to sink it with the old England regime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Regretfully, I'm sorry that the final bidding scenario lasted for a couple of hours for a couple of hours (exactly what I would think) and would be more appropriate for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Gosh, I just saw Jeremy Northam, I understand (by reading his imdb lists), I know it's at least in three films - he's got a lot more for him as an actor become gentleman english heartthrob! Hmm, imagine that I have to visit my video store ... <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. My favorite Jane Austen adaptation - though perhaps Ang Lee's Sense and Sensitivity, is a better movie, this is closest to my heart - I've seen it many times more! <br /> <br /> If you were able to track it and if you did not spend much of its small deficiency <br /> <br />
