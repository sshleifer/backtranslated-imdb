Although this movie is somewhat sanitary (as people are not talking about sex), this is a very useful short film to show the girls ready to know what to expect during the menstrual period. It is not surprising that this was paid by Kotex, though the Disney movie can surprise many as it has created numerous educational films in the 1960s. But I'm a good film, but I think the filmmaker misses the true opportunity. If you used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney network, it would be great for a beautiful female narrator and relatively mild visuals! I know that this old Walt's would have had a heart attack, but that would be a great movie! By the way, although the movie is considered contrary to sex, it usually explains menstruation. <br /> <br /> Now, if I can only figure out a cartoon about menstruation, it's not a matter of some details (especially sexual intercourse).
