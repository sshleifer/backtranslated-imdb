Ah, 1970s. It's time to be a swinger once. It's a good time to be a swinger today to be honest, but then I feel more brave. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno presents a pretty good soft core film. In fact, like today, some actors are famous hardcore players. <br /> <br /> From today on, these people were good actors, and these films were a trick and character development. <br /> <br /> This is a swinger movie much more than you expect. Two couples with open relationships again burn out their livelihood from one of the women who came to visit. <br /> <br /> Of course, a different story when MILF is Jennifer Welles. Those who are over 40 years old did not seem delicious, like Mrs Welles. Reverend Welles is worthy of the merit to see him look in the mirror like Aphrodite. He is not the "mother of stiffs." <br /> <br /> I also won Chris Jordan Anna. Jordan looks like Elaine Joyce and sounds so much that I could have her twin "twin" twin or even Elaine himself. Unlike the soft-core porno of the 1990s, the 70's gentle video kept the ghost movie (the soft-core of the 2000s, music and canned backgrounds of the 2000s) and here is fully operational. <br /> <br /> For those who love the production of Kveden's "Deux Femmes En Or", you will like it. Only a classic movie on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 per month can spend.
