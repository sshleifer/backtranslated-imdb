As a Pokemon fan, I liked this movie very much. The new legendary Pokemon (like every movie) introduces and enhances the depth of relationships between symbols. But I do not expect Pokemon fans to like it (MOST is adults). Some lines were sharp, but the film's dubbing could be somewhat inevitable. The animation was beautiful, though there were a few invisible ones. Though it's a kind of hate, I think films have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains, and I guarantee that this is not all. I tell everyone who does not love him, but fans of Pok√©mon will like it.
