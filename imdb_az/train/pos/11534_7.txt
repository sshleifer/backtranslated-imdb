Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / cold released in the UK since 1990 in the "New World Video" label. <br /> <br /> This is a desert-based horror movie about a group of young friends. The explosion within a week, only a scary black truck will be killed by an unknown force by the unknown driver! There are some creepy scenes in this movie, and some of you are here and there, but you have to say that the player is so naked with low budget standards! But the movie was strangely addictive, and I loved it and never fell asleep or I did not close it, it's always a good sign! I gave a film of about 6/10, but when I steamed along the road I saw that there was a good moment of darkness and confusion, there were some good nudity and a lot of blond blonde women! I'll give it 7/10.
