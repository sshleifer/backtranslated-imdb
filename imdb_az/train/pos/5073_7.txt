What can you expect from this document-drama, Richard Attenburg, who was shot in the 1930s and carefully measured, literally written, beautifully painted, solidly painted, called Gandhi? A strange picture of the Canoeing Space and its culture ("Black Robe"), reflecting the culture of the American (or, more precisely, the adoption of Canada, the First Nations), about 1934). This idyllic portrait creates a drama on her subject: Archie "Gray Owl" became a hunter and son of an Ojibway band of shots, trees raised in Hastings (England) by ladies reminiscent of the "red Indian" tales of Belaney, a child going to Canada. <br /> <br /> <strong > One of his spouses (more intelligent than most of his account) became famous as a writer and early defender of the northern northern part of the country, the basis of which was Attenburon's tale. Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (like Gray Owl's wife, Pony) are engaged in chemistry and are very touching, even though they are not firearms. A good movie, when you need a material crowd for a while.
