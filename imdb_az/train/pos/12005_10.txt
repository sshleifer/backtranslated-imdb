This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. LDS is a great way to see this movie because you can feel more about Joseph's life. The film is a beautiful and life-changing movie that can be loved and appreciated by everyone, though not with highly acclaimed actors. I watched this film together with my family and can testify that we all have a heart attack. This film gives people the chance to understand how difficult the Prophet's life is and how difficult it has encountered. After seeing this movie, there was no dry eye in the whole room. Everyone touches what he sees and I am not the same as I have seen. I love this movie for everyone.
