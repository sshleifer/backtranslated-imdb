And again, we have to admit that we all worship the Italian cherub and that it is definitely the most unique sub-genre. Emilio Miragli's "Red Queen Kills Seven Times" is an absolutely magnificent generosity of original plot, stylish production values, magic music, excellent player abilities and inventive heroism. A gilo (released in 1972), a golden year, belonging to the first five of every fan of the Italian cinema. This story does not only present your average black gloves and sexually assassin killer, but it blends the good old motives of the revenge on the "Red Qabala" macabre myth. At a young age, his father Permanent Wives Kitty and Evelyn talk about a woman who died on April 6th, at least 100 years ago, of seven men who were killed by the imminent final sacrifice of his brother. Fourteen years later, when Kitty began the crazy killing, a prominent model became a successful choreographer of the agency (even sharing his bed with a general manager). Sister Evelyn would be obviously guilty, but recently he moved to states ... Or is he? Complex, yet compelling and attractive red biscuits take a few minutes and the Red Queen character is definitely the most interesting killer in the history of giallo. His face can never be seen, but he is wearing a red blood suit and the most terrifying laugh when creating a new victim. It's not exactly fine as the victims are stabbed with a barbarian dagger, drifting behind the car, and even touching the fences! The latter is one of the biggest (most terrible) acts I have ever seen! Maybe you can ask for more? Some sweet and delightful nudity, maybe? Spectacular female actresses, most of them covered by Barbara Bouchet and young Sybil Danning. Emilio Miraglia is not the most famous designer because she just did it, and in the same way, "Evelyn Night came out of the graveyard," but we should not forget about her influence and importance.
