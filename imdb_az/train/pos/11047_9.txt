I waited for a few years after this film was finally released in the UK, but at last I was very happy to see it. There are many great things to do with the movie. It's not a lot of fear in the form of fear, but all the people in this film are all set to fine work. This is a constantly solid and powerful comedy, a strong solid reinforcement of the film with a Lovecraftian part of a beautiful sorta. Add surreal nightmare footage and sometimes victorious gore doses and films to win. I have my favorite species, supernatural and splattery. Marcus's heroes, the transsexual angry body structure, and Daisy, the delusional lover / toys are really freakish and sometimes embarrassed and farther away from everything else, often with Freudian overtones in everything. Hollywood is one of the most spectacular recent films of shocking or even worse than anything it can produce. My only wish was that the tone of the end would be darker, but it still works, so I really do all this for serious horrors.
