Except for an unusual scene, this cheerful fairy fantasy is the entertaining and neat undercover of a brave keen mind that attracts a fairy epic to a strongly moving audience, as well as to an audience. Apart from the scenes of Robert DeNiro and not synchronized with the rest of the movie, this dear romantic fairy well is a great story and strong magic and serious adventure scenes and lightweight spiritual humor is well-realized. The modern presentation of this magic and love is appealing in the refined tradition of PRINCESS BRIDE. Eighteen stars.
