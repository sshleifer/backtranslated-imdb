There must be a sub-genre called "Robert Mitchum West" in the West. Mitchum's brilliant, dreamy, usually worthless westerners, imported some of the most spectacular dark sketches of the movie, bringing the movie's noir identity and bringing a worldly fatigue that is more familiar to Sam Peckinpah films. "The man with the rifle" is the best. This is a simple, monochrome beauty filled with cold silhouettes and terrible eruptions, as Mitchum, led by Orson Welles, directed by Richard Wilson, came to challenge a town that was terrorized by a monopolist with a special army. Mitchum's refusal to speak fluently-murmured murders is a miracle that is expressive, physically active, with dark feelings among them.
