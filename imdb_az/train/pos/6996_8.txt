This movie was a really great flick about something that affects us. I know personally I run away this time. Fortunately, Will Smith jumped into the public issue of text messaging during driving. People, do not do this. One hour and forty-five minutes is not enough for this reason. Personally I would like to shoot my cellphone after the movie. I was glad that other people at the event saw the message and left their phones with their plates. I decided to disable all of my text messages on the phone and encourage others to do the same. If you are paying attention to your family, you may need to consider these important Citizen Service Announcements or kill seven people for text messaging during driving. Thank you for showing us the way.
