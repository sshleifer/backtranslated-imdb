This is the beginning of all! Of course, it's not the best friends, but it's a show pilot, let's not forget that this is not bad. We are introducing Central Perke to our era and our story. Even from this first episode, when Ross says, there is a sign of the Ross-Rachel relationship that will come in the next decade: "I want to marry again" and the Rachel storm with a wedding dress ... probably not when the writer Monica-Joey goes to his relationship, but when he looks back compatible. In this episode, Rachel Chandler is acquainted, as if both of them are not familiar with them, but in the subsequent episodes, the so-called 'flashbacks' contradict the two previous experiences. Nevertheless, the point is a great start to this great show. This episode may not be usual Friends as we are accustomed to, the castle is still a little inexperienced, but on the next few episodes we have seen why the show has come! Watch, an explosion of the first season!
