Okay, I will admit that the cast is really strange - some of it is for the field, but I still had a bit of anxiety, but Pierce Brosnan was playing this device (although that was a really good job). <br /> <br /> It was based on the true story of an Englishman who lived in the early 20th century with the Canadian Indians. Hindu claimed to be a mixed blood. In fact, he was so successful and well-thought that he came from everywhere to hear his lectures and conduct it on the desert trails - even in India there was no mixed blood and all its information was out of books or frauds! <br /> <br /> <strong> Cinema turns into a center and is what happens when betrayal is found. <br /> <br /> The player and the settings were great and I liked the movie very much (I stopped the blasphemy about Brosnan). Bond film is not romantic - it's pretty cerebral - maybe the only really good movie about a beautiful person.
