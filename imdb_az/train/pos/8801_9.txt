This movie is the biggest film I've ever seen in 2002, but I'm the core of the movies. Rich and it is a nice artistic move from these 11 short films. <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y, but it's a kind (11 times) personal visit. Chahine: She does not know "she can swallow pride" and believes this is a good moral punishment ... This is really the weakest part of the film, but it proves the truth of the whole piece. Strangely enough, it comes from Mexico's conceptual-art movie ... I'm not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu is saying yet. The other 9 are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S.Makhmalbaf, ...) or perfect (C.Lelouch) and forced me to smile, or cry, or even amaze me. I still do not know, despite the fact that S. Imamura's testament to the Sept. 11 catastrophic catastrophe, is so beautiful that the final location is deeply 'done'.
