Once you've gotten out of paradise, you have to choose a jaw ... somewhere ... to combine this with something, and you'll see that half the bad, though it was released the same year. The site is interesting and interesting and pacing is fast, it covers many occasions and thus often jumps to one another after one line or two. This is actually the place where it is different. The performances are perfect. Both Neill and Streep are flawless. It is great to hear Australia speaking in many Hollywood movies, even those who do not come to nature want to emphasize. Cinematography and editing are pretty good, but they really do not go beyond standard things. The story of this movie is complicated and the truth is that it makes it more cold. When I read a novel or did not hear what happened outside of this picture, I realized that it was very close to the truth. This is a medium-sized powerful language and has content that's bothering you. Sometimes, a drama in a large courtroom. I recommend this kind of support for any party. 7/10
