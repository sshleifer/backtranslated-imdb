DIG! funny, entertaining, entertaining, interesting, stylish, and very well done. Knowing that this has been done in a similar budget since 7 years, believes that such a story can be explained, in particular, with such a style and substance. <br /> <br /> Brian Johnestown Massisacre and The Dandy Warhols are a brilliant way to confront a good group for a year. a genius megalomaniacal singer, who is supported by various characters characterized by persistence and compromise ability and moderate success, sabotage his success by drug, alcohol and madness. If I did not know it was the images of real people, I believe it was an incredibly well written and creative scripted piece. The story is compelling, short and simply stunning.
