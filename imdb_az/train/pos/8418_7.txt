In 1928, the Russian emigrant director (William Powell) in Hollywood released his epic about the Russian Revolution and hired an old generals from the Tsarist regime (Emil Jannings) to play the lead role in the movie, and both were drama and drama. I remember the memory of women who shared a year ago (Evelyn Brent). <br /> <br /> I, like myself, have to be warmed up for "The Last Command" for all the advantages. The 'New York Dock' was a great movie, and 'Underworld' was a movie that I always wanted to see, but 'My Final Team' is a pretty heavy movie. Stage is appealing, but the treatment really carries out the script, with the exception of Hollywood, consisting of consistency, the bread of additives, and the trickery of a major movie production with the latest technology. <br /> <br /> Emil Jannings is a wonderful Russian genera, who is perhaps strikingly surprised by the strange and old old general, who is distinguished by the strange, awesome officers. <br /> <br /> The latter is great and deserves to be expected, but sometimes you have to be ready to be a little bored to go there.
