It is strange that this version of YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Crowe's scenario is much closer and fleshed than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker must first get a credit to think about the story, but if Crowe is a good thing about it, there is no doubt. Almost everything you know about VANILLA SKY you know. I mean more "fleshed out".
