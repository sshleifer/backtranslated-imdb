The German movie is called NEVERENDING STORY because this movie is a strange ground for the child's magic to become a hero of a movie. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie because it's thanks to a very powerful modern technology that puppets and CGI are used to create an incredibly real-world world - but the guy was primarily a job! Unfortunately, for many Westerners, this movie can either give up too quickly or wastage it because everything in the movie is so surprising. But give it a chance. <br /> <br /> In many cases, this is something I want to recommend. Give Miyazaki the adults following the Interview, because it is very similar and has the Yokai (Japanese mythical spirits) tones. Big Differences Between the two, the LIFE AND LIFE OF LIFE is more child friendly. I think that the Biggest Wave is meant as a child film in the United States, and most parents do not want to show it to younger children because it has a very violent, scary and some adult behavior. Who is the audience in the West? Older children and adults who evaluate non-Western subjects and foreign films. This is really a very narrow audience! <br /> <br /> Look for all the strange little tricks you are watching. In fact, we can watch the movie dozens of times, and each time you notice the different little things. I liked a few funny comments about the Gamera, but in addition to "KIDS: Do not try this at home", the person of Yaqai (really, maybe this scene should also contain this alert!) By the way, director Takashi Miike is a difficult task to show as a stylist, but none of his stories were "normal". Some movies are pretty disgusting and uncomfortable and I hate them (especially AUDIT and ICHI THE KILLER), some of them are magic and among the best films I have ever seen (HAPPINESS OF KATAKURIS). One thing I'm sure is that watching one of his films is difficult, there is no strong reaction or other way.
