In my opinion, VIVAH's best film of 2006 comes from a successful director throughout his career. I do not want romantic movies these days, because I see them as "old wine in a new glass" and therefore can be foreseen. But I was watching this movie three times ... and I believe it's a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH simple symbols are traditionally routed, engagement and marriage. The film is fun in all activities, since we can reflect on what we do (or we will do) when it comes to marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya performed a homework assignment and presented a very realistic story to a well-prepared highly-entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> In this movie, you will be interested in several successive interests. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first conversation between the witness and Amrita - when it comes to seeing - is a Shiite witness, without knowing exactly what 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' is a good talk. Amrita's loyal nature, limited eye contact, embarrassing features and soft answers to the questions of the Witness. <br /> <br /> Emritational breakdown of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when she is fed up with the party of the Witness belongs to all the ways of Amrita Rao. The actress describes Poonam's role with such love that you can not imagine it for someone else. <br /> <br /> It looks beautiful throughout the film and looks at a traditional girl who is innocent and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Witness Kapur also performs very well. He presents a future promising performance and shows that Salman Khan is not so little when he works in a Sooraj R. Barjata movie. In fact, the Witness and Amrita are pairing on a cute screen without the shadow of doubt. Other Characters - Alok Nath (Perfect), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very Good). <br /> <br /> In general, what VIVAH is saying is a beautiful and real story of two families. The film focuses on top notch appearances, great storytelling and great music, as well as the gorgeous Sooraj R. Barjatya. Need to see!
