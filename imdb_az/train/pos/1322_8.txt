Great movie. Even though true life could not stand, Yasak Lies was an attractive portrait of an artist in his element. <br /> <br /> Forbidden Love, Norma's author, appears to be fraudulent in the press, but this move actually gives the opportunity. <br /> <br /> However, the progress and returns of the documentary filmmaker is unbelievable. What a sick woman! I liked this movie. I have not read the book, but just heard good reviews and went to see it in the dull rainy day. Traveling on this film is smart, exciting, and completely subtle.
