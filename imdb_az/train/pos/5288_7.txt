This entertaining Bugs Bunny cartoon still sees unnamed Marvin Martian and his sidekick K-9 green dog back. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of trying to destroy Earth Marvin, the earth's mission is to capture a place on Mars and take it to Mars. Of course, selected live bugs Bunny. Initially, Bugs thinks Marvin and K-9 are cunning or treating, but Marvin can be right when the bug's hive pierces it with a bulky gun. Bugs is trying to get the way out of the situation in several ways, including persuading K-9 to assume that Marvine is planning a charge. Finally, it is used by removing the bazooka with an Acme weld jacket. It works as an ad for a stunning Acme product and has to use its ideas to release the bug's K-9, the tables are swiftly turned and the two laughing marsians are drifting and bugs are back to work <br /> <br /> The rest of the story compared to a little weaker, although it really did. The voice of Marvin has changed slightly here, and it seems embarrassing when he gets angry, but it did not take less for me or an animated film.
