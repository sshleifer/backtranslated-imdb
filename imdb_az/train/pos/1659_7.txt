One of the first female artists, Artemisia, tells the truth about the story of a young Italian woman and the painful backdrop of the vicissitudes she faces. The movie has beautiful suits and kits and a good player and player. However, it is intoxicated to try to describe the esotericity of the art and its timing, and will not be depicted as if the artist's ambitions were painted on canvas and studied with men. A good movie for those who are interested in innovative film or periodicals.
