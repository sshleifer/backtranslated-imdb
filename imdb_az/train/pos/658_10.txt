It's not an easy movie to watch - it's more than three hours and half an hour. However, we look at human nature in an incredibly complex and compassionate way, in my goodness, one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is scary, keen and brutal. (If you want to raise something, see the Celine and Julie Go Boating magazines around Jacques Rivette at the same time). <br /> <br /> This shows that the end of the 1960s shows that the idealism of the end of the 1960s will not be different from the one who is trying to make changes. <br /> <br /> This is Alexander (performed by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronica (Fran√ßois Lebrune). However, Alexandre has been shown to be a chauvinist and jealous person. <br /> <br /> This film is an extremely frozen rock for the French revolutionary French Revolution. This movement was one of the most important moves in film history and, as we know, had a profound impact on cinema. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the main actors in the new wave, and was a rebel teenager starring Francois Truffaut (1959) at the casual Les Quatres Cent Coupes (1959). Director Jean Eustache is not known as the other directors of the new wave, but he should. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (John Cassavetes is different from similar films produced in the United States) and dialogue is a real-life conversation. The film is resonant with Eustache's personal experience. For example, Francoise was an old lover of Lebrun Eustache. In 1981, Eustache himself committed suicide and did a lot of real life with Marie. A monologue taken by Veronica gives anger and intolerance to the audience and breaks the cold objectivity of the rest of the film. This beautiful, personal and honest movie post remains one of the most open films of the surrounding human nature.
