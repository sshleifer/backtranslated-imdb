I really thought it was not that bad. Not a great artworks, Dermot M was a very strong performer. Patricia Arquette has often proved. He really played a very violent cello, and his lines were never forced. Moreover, he is a wonderful person. It's really sexy. Add to your talent and many things that are in it are more durable. While he does not reach the highest level, some of his projects always give it to all. In most cases, the actor's fault is not. Unfortunately, there were some strange films that did not resonate at the box office. Always with A-list actors, but not always "hit". However, any DVD has "every penny" for rent or purchase. See Wedding History, one of Debra Messing's best films. EVERY PENNY! ; ) (if you have not yet seen, then you will understand this price!)
