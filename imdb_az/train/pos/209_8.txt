Walter Matthau and George Burns work together well. The acne with Willy's amazing amnesia is a mixture of paradise. Willy's reunion in the apartment is a gem and the final scene is perfect. Walter Matthau gave a superb performance as a semi-retired comedian, combined with a general misinterpretation that made a great characteristic of the sound intonation and exaggerated dramatic features. George Burns is a legendary, and it is a memorable fact that nowhere else is better in this movie, a calm hole with dry answers. When you ask Al and his daughter about the Spanish guard, and look at the nearest reaction to the Alle reaction - it's priceless.
