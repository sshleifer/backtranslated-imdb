Here are some of the points that explain the story and symbols of the "Opening Night", so I will not. Myrtle Gordon, at the age of 17, remembers how easy it was for him to think that he was a wonderful confirmation of his life. youth and energy and know the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering why her life is wondering, or even living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis, almost drowsing it. <br /> <br /> Almost but not much. In the eleventh hour he recognizes the power of his art and re-announces himself ("I am going to bury this scandal", actor Maurice says on stage). Myrtle's director prevented people from helping them when they were hopeless drunk for their first performance. <br /> <br /> Some critics are surprised that this triumph is not only temporarily suspended on Myrtle's downhill road. I believe that this really opens up a nightmare for opening up "night-time" - a flower for new opportunities for life and activity. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is perfect. The movie is great. Wherever you are, Mr. Cassavetes.
