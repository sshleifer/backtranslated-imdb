"Our Song" gives us the lives of three lovers - Lanisha, Maria and Joycein - the best beloved men in the summer. Adolescent Summer - even though Crown Heights, Brooklyn, did not know these particular landmarks and landscapes, it was the same for us all. Lazy postponement of pressure and school confusion. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Young body wears new silhouettes ... new they are signing up to the land ... a maze to adulthood. The young mind comes to himself, speaks for himself, who is who I am who it is who wants to be. This is always the case. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Jim McKay plays this movie in Brooklyn in the late 1990s. The opening title 'A Movie' appears in the list of everyone in the universe. It's a gesture, but we really know it until the end of the movie. [Closing names also have one of the most earning and gratifying credits to read.] Live recordings by Jan McLaughlin are worthy of particular note. McKay is a modest leader who knows who describes the story - it's his three graces, Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They are real things, their mutual relationships are real friendship and reality. This is not a music video shorthand about teenage life. <br /> <br /> There is something annoying towards people living in the Caucasus. and everyday life style. We are witnessing the contemporary math of teenage life - its problems are interpreted, calculated and summarized and solved. It shows great ideas throughout small scenes. Lana is hanging in safety with her father - it's the only way to spend time with her. We see the love that exists among them, but we see family and fate failures. In a closed scene, Lanisha defends her father for the mother, and we see how much she loves her and loves her in return. Later, the three friends shared their vision and dreams of darkness - we remember how crazy / funny guys are and what's more tragic, how realism is today's idealism. And in the end, when Maria is just walking down the street, she is also a short story. We see all the fears and doubts he has gained from courage. <br /> <br /> "Our Song is a great gift that really feels the deepest sense of nature that embraces the most modern era of friendship - one day can be lively and invigorating, closer, and later, it can turn alone and out. There is something terrible, but it's not just a way, is it?
