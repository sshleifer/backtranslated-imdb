I know that I love this movie, and for the most part, but the teeth have been mentioned for a while. And I found the angry hormones of all the men's staff a little annoying. They also have a miracle that did not start panting at the moons and wling. I also want to say that in general, the movie makes me cold. A very sterile atmosphere penetrating the film. Plus, impact effects, props, suits and, of course, Robbie is great (except the cartoon monster). If the robot was not in this movie, I do not think it would be as popular as it is. The second half of the film takes the steam after exploring the forgotten devices of Krell. When I see this movie repeatedly, Krell can save me from scratching me for whom or what I am. In addition to "The Island Earth," the Prohibited Planet is above average Sci-Fi films over time. Coloring also enhances its taste. Undoubtedly, it is a classic, deficiencies and all of it deserves.
