I really liked this version of Emma. Kate beckinsale was as spectacular as Emma and was as good as a strong brand. It was my complaint on my tree ... I do not believe that most people can be crying or that their daughter will be unhappy ... But even in the end she is a clever girl. As always, I like these Jane Austin films. the settings are so sensitive. I would like to visit 9 more to England and Ireland) selected actors for this movie are a good choice and all the other story lines encountered with the best of Emma! And I'm glad to see it.
