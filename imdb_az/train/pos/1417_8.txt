I saw this movie with my family and it was wonderful! This film is more than a documentary with long mono / circumcision and many pictures (not just cold facts) ... The full "power" of this film is one of the most impressive pictures. weather or Arctic. While watching this film, we can learn more than just studying the planet, so it shows that we are related to the circular flow of life. People who want to watch a movie with a movie should watch it, though this film is not just for "environmental fanatics". This film taught me that we only live on earth ... We live on earth, all plants and animals grow and die.
