For all cinematics that are now there, this movie can not be of a high rank in the list of things to do. But do you understand my point of view if you know something about plotting, deep truth and intentions of this movie? Certainly, the features of the film are the works of the author, and who can be expected to know what will happen next. But the film is biblically "accurate" and "scared" into what thinks the audience can be fair. I'm not a Christian for this movie, but for my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential of something similar to those mentioned here are quite afraid of thinking of one's actions and decisions. <br /> <br /> For the first time in a few years, many people can look beyond the fun, the fun and the movie budget to evaluate the depth of the film. This is a movie that you just have to see and feel with your heart and soul.
