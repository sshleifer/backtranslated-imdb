When I was just a kid, this movie was afraid of me. There are no moments, not Citizen Kane. The arm disassembly is good. If the plot is not characteristic, the trick is good - there may be something associated with the actor. Put some top names in the roles and then see what you've got. It was one of the shootings, was edited (somewhat) and spread over several months of movie. This is classic low budget intelligence and just worth it. I voted for nine other films of this genre and age.
