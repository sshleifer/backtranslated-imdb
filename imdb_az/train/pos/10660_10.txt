I found that this movie depends on gait. Miss Stanwyck started worrying that there was only a few minutes before he realized that the problem was. The outside area, the lock on the hot gas station lid, everything is forced to wait ... it comes here. At first you think about the little boy, but soon you do not start watching the tides you are breathing. Although I watched this movie first and prepared for the experiment, I found this movie really stressful. Now, though some sort of special rating has not been awarded, maybe there is a film that can be awarded a white wrapped prize?
