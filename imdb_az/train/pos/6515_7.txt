I did not do this for almost all bad comments, but I did it all the time. I liked the darkness that I liked. The only one who hates tooth ferry was the two red-haired brothers at the petrol station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but that was not a comedy. This movie was a little disruptive for me because it was unnecessary. The rest of the film should have been a horror or tension movie. Make-up was good and I saw worse movies after that. It was a simple story with an incredible player. This is not the most horrifying or strange movie, but after watching, I did not go back or come back. All images on DVD were good and I'll check them out.
