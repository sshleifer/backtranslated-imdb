One day, someone will compare Paul Naschi's "Wolfman's Anger" to the great Spanish-language surrealist films, "L'Age D'or" and Un Chien Andelou. Nashi's movie is a masterpiece of delirium from start to finish. <br /> <br /> They liked the possibility of Dali and Bunel and sipped their hearts without seeing each other. <br /> <br /> Despite filming, Adan moves towards B. A rumor about a "Professor Walterman" who was crushed by the Yeti Monster during an expedition to Tibet and did not differ from each other. understandable. One of his jealous colleagues, Dr. Wolfstein's crazy daughter, knows about her condition and shows her husband cheating on her. Walterman kidnapped, fell into a man, killed several people, collided with electricity, died, buried in the ground, did not stand on the ground. a castle full of circus puppets, calling on various electronic machines, chained with strong elixirs, chained, turned into a werewolves, with a Nazi booty boots, a woman in the evening dress runs her laughing, helping her doctor go out of the castle, circus with a battle ax ends his pride, eventually becomes a werewolf, and together with his betrayed spouse, he has to fight against the sacrifice of women victims. Nazi boots hit her with a bullet from the Luger pistol, die with her, and come out in the morning with a doctor who does not do anything fine. "Look, what a beautiful day!" <br /> <br /> "La furia del Hombre Lobo" is written by Paul Naski in a hurry. The original director Enrique Eguilez was dismissed and replaced by Jose Mar√≠a Zabalza. He could not work often (although his 14-year-old nephew had time to make some changes in the script) and Naski was not filming much. Zabalza has rallied for Nasin's previous films to cut off the action scenes of Wolfman Mark's part. Although the scenes were different from their suits, it was good enough to use twice, and Zabalza pushed the workout after refusing to leave the bed to finish the movie. Post production was a nightmare. Who knew who did the content, the money was exhausted, the masterpiece disappeared for some time, and then the pre-free scan for a film distributor came to the auditorium to find Zabalza in front of the theater. <br /> <br /> One of the few films is something. The castle includes castles, vaulted catacombs, chains, whips, and atavist memories about dark darkness. An admirer of such things will see if hypnosis does not make much sense due to the fact that the story is completely unstable. On a scene, it rains and the worm cries in the lightning; At the next stroke his bone is dry and full of moon per month. Then it was raining again. And yet it does not look like a gaffe. Like a sleep dream, where contradictions are possible, the contradictions are unique and continue to influence; First, the worm receives the power cord and the sound, and then the cable begins to work electrically. People say that they suffer from the low overall budget - the film would not have been filmed if it had more than one dime. It is a miracle to do nothing and not for what it can do, but what does it do. It's easy to laugh and make things easier. <br /> <br /> Paul Naski died last week at the age of 75. He was ill with pancreatic cancer. a year or more, worked on film projects until the very last days, but died with his family in Madrid, Spain with chemotherapy treatment. His rich, varied and surprising long-term career is inherited by a man who persistently stays in his artistic vision because of the world's major insecurity. And yet we all have an 11-year-old boy who will be surprised by his "Heroic anger." People who do not like the Euro Hero will find something to surprise even in just a few minutes at this point. You can find it free at Archive.Org and you can even buy it on a DVD for nickel. <br /> <br /> Naski was horrified to learn that many people, like me, had been classically accepted by this dingy, sick, demented little movie, not a clear masterpiece of Cinema Dementia. The problems they were facing during production, and then the confusion of a film, was probably a personal disappointment to Nashi's forgiveness. I do not dare to forgive him, but I will say: I would like to watch the "Hero of Anger" in the most religious, most cut and offensive full-screen public domain. <br /> <br /> This month in the world lost a great art. <br /> <br /> 9/10
