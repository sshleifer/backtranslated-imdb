I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! This humorous humor giggled me all the way, and Trey and Matt's overstepping reinforced the movie's comedy. <br /> <br /> I just took Baseketball on only one of the films that I would not get tired of on the DVD and in her. I'm very attentive and I think that this movie is a funny thing to me. <br /> <br /> So, in my opinion, Baseketball is like a brilliant movie that everyone should go, especially as you are young. I'm laughing for a long time. <br /> P. Does anyone think it's strange for me? LOL
