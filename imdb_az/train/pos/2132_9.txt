Casting is really a pleasant surprise and helps make a cut above the normal human-woman-controversy-all-time-but-wind of type Hollywood movie romantic / comedy love. <br /> I usually do not go to this type of movie and this tedious story, but it's refreshing, entertaining and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Make Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan another good and very nice pair. From the legend of Fatah Bressart to the legend, Yusuf Shieldrauta, the castle is superior. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most exciting characters he sees in his career. He takes the film and makes it a little different when it is a dramatic event. <br /> <br /> When a movie is a good mix of films, it usually succeeds. This is a great example. This film has romantic, comedy and drama, and good work has been done. I'll take it every single time once you get "You've Been Mailed". No comparison.
