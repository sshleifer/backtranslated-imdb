"LOVE APPEARED IN THE TOP", by Michel Deville, LE MOUTON ENRAGE, in the TOP, "With joy and fears primarily youth and charm flirting, like contrast and guilt touch." In 1971, at the New York Times, Vincent Canby, following the premiere of a film in 1974: "TOP LOVE, opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is a French comedy in 1973. The nineteenth issue of English comedies, to rise and rise and to think about their rise. "However, the significant difference we have mentioned is that TOP SAFE does not have a connection with the English classroom ... (January 27, 1975) <br /> <br /> By leaving the assessments up to single individuals, that time test did a fair job. After more than 30 years, we can say with certain certainty that films like DE MOUTON ENRAGE can hardly be found here, where decadence appears innocent. <br /> <br /> For Romy Schneider's supporters, this is not a career (not just 9 years before sudden death), but is particularly appealing to give her a notable performance (as in all its roles). TRIO is not INFERNAL, but "forcibly evading" and Romy's sweet paintings, with many years of sidewalks, are the most attractive manifestation of Shissi, but it is a movie that a brilliant actress has a fair play role. He plays Roberte, a woman who plays an object of lust for the storyline for Nicolas Mallet (Jean Louis Trintignant) playing. Undoubtedly, it receives financial benefits from damaged individuals. This movie boasts Romy's truly memorable and unique photos and is bestowed on one of its best scenes. Romin's sexual appeal is unforgettable here. <br /> <br /> Other powerful moments in the film are the development of a personal perception of its content. Unusually, the director is perfectly using contrast: conventions and so on. Enjoyment, innocence and sadness, true lust and instrumental work. Nicola reflects the characteristics of hate or dislike of viewers, can be charming or disgusting; yet features that should be taken seriously by the audience, more often say that all of us should accept it. Therefore, the main character of one is a unique, silent, wild, erotically unique world. There are two women representing the world in contrast to Nicola: Roberte Groult (Romy Schneider) and Marie-Paul (Jane Birkin). He manipulates them, loves them, and does not abstain from the desire of the body and the desire for money; But it distinguishes them. In spite of all the 'mature adolescents', though, he is emotionally like a small boy playing with a toy car at the table - a 'comic idea' of comics as well ... Of course <br /> <br / > Finally, there are very good performances, and LE MOUTON reduces the ENRAGE a bit. The mentioned Romy Schneider is not a brilliant job providing viewers with an unusual idea, but young Jane Birkin appears convincing in the role of young, inexperienced streetwalker Marie Paul, the right path of Jean Louis Trintignant Nicola. This feature-packed legend comes with great music by Camille Saint-Saens for a long time with a melody to your ears. Therefore, the advantages must be significant, except for the shortcomings of the film, such as the color of history, sometimes decorated, and sometimes clich√©s that are different from the audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> LE MOUTON ENRAGE is generally an open manifestation of manipulation in life. Like a moment in Romy's career, it's primarily viewed as an episode of eroticism, a sense of contravention, love and hatred, appreciation and hate, compared to orgasm and the first anaza ... But we, human beings, 'watchers', filmed on such contradictions enthusiasts?
