Everyone, my name could be strange, but nothing else! <br /> <br /> In any case, it was crazy before seeing such a thing! Of course, that's a good thing. It's a great movie, and it's definitely my favorite thing of all time to draw things apart! Chicken is like little, fish, King Kong and Runt, saying "The Twist Beauty of the Beast", the World of War Scenes and more. Walt Disney has not lost her touch. And how did they watch the movie and how they looked like home cinema. <br /> <br /> But some parts are incompatible. Like the real lion king, Timon and Pumbaa were not with Simba when they were scaring Scar? They are not in this movie! they were fighting the hyenas backstage. The reason why Pumbaa is not so convincing is that it was thrown away by other animals, as well as Timon, Timon, Timon. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is just a story, not Timon's story, but pumbaa just had flashbacks?
