I just watched the movie two days ago and was Paris's second favorite city in Europe, and I spent 18 months in the 80's very romantic. I was a little disappointed that most of these vignettes did not capture the city's "light" and beauty, if it was done in a genuine and artistic way. Good romance enough! We did not see any of the flowering boulevards ... It was not only a word but a figuratively very dark. Some areas have manipulated the look of the image and dropped it down to give it a "flat" (Marais series, a coffee shop assistant, two examples). Strong, good ones: Mime sequences, cemetery, Montmartre (although much to spend on the audience to understand), a little bit too much to appear between the "Cowboy" vigneti and Sacre Coeur, as it could be something like Orlando Bloom the player liked to see.
