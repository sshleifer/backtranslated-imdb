I liked this movie. As I'm just a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, he's almost in all German films. And he is not the main actor. <br /> <br /> The actions of a family seeking a "German dream" for Germany to Italy are perceived by Barnabi Metschurat, a cause for watching Julietta in 2001. The cheap labor coefficient in the steel and coal industry (this is my own and ironic ...). However, opening a restaurant ends, and the trip to this point is very poetic and at the same time funny and attractive. From this point of view, the story shows that the two brothers of this family are Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's desire to become a filmmaker is competing with his brother and his mother's decision to return to Italy. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film says that life is more (Gigi or Giancarlo). successful or fuller or more interesting. This is a striking idea that the identity of the two countries and the minds must be sought after. and this is a great film dealing with the tensions that have emerged as a result of immigration to any country, whether pain or sadness in both countries. Director Fatih Akinin's transfer from Turkey to Turkey in the 70s also provides a great deal of reliability and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake, especially the Metschurat and all the strange demonstrations, is really like a young boy playing a young Gigi. This child's activity can be a tough move that everyone can follow! Watch the big movie.
