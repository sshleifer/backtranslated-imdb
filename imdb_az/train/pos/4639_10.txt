A few weeks ago I bought this job and I love it! Modern, bright, but full of life's challenges. Questions and answers like Eytan Fox films. It's the best I have with Jossi & Jagger. These pictures are much more common than the bubbles inside us. No need to be Jewish or homosexual - I'm not, but the film goes to my first ten movies. At first it seems purely fun, but it thinks more. The relationship we live in is superficial, meaningful, deep, deadly, you name it. You do not know what's happening and you do not know where this story is starting when you first watch. It's worth seeing several times. Fox cinemas have great prize materials - a great music video and headline explanation, an interview with Lior Ashkenazy playing in the film, and Arabs with suspicion of the Israeli lifestyle.
