"Capitães de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 Revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it is. The story's fiction is of no great interest, but it does not spoil the film. Captain Salgueiro Maia's heroic acts are not superfluous, and a film for their deeds. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the April 25 Revolution. <br /> <br /> All actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played well. Lisbon seems always beautiful. Do not miss it! I liked this movie very much.
