<br /> <br /> From Los Angeles to May, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) welcomes a charming man who demands a businessman murder or a mercenary murderer whose father dies. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is a great tension that keeps viewers on the edge of the seats. Device is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth, but the Red Eye is better than those movies. Almost everything about the Red Eye is moderate, including postponement, motion, and direction. Most of the film is on an airplane, but the film does not slow down. The film speeds up rapidly and creates excitement with no slow and dull spots. Wes Craven is doing a really good job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on these excitements, he focuses on stories and characters. Filmmaking moments have a share, but this is not really about the movie. I also care about Wes Craven's other passengers and the smaller details that are important later on. The Red Eye really shows the ability to speak stories. <br /> <br /> The Red Eye works well with the young and talented castle. Rachel McAdams gives a very attractive performance and hates her character. You even hear it. Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and impressive performance like a villain. He is primarily charming, but then turns into a psychiatrist, especially effective. The actors supporting Brain Cox and Jayma Mays are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> The film is also very chic and it's a creepy vibe. The setting works well, because there is no clear fear of isolation and no escape. Generally, the film's tone is always creepy. The scenario is not as powerful as everything else. There are a few unrealistic moments that can trigger the viewer. Most of them did not bother me, but there were few people who shook my head. Also, ending disappears. It's not just a simple thing, and a different approach would be better. As the movie focuses on the characters, there's really no cries of moments, maybe a few jumps. If you are awaiting a horror film, you will be disappointed. In the end, Red Eye is an entertaining tension and is one of the best films in the summer. Rating 8/10
