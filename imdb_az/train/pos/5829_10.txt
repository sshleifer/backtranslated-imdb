This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts and is surely the best performance by Christine McIntyre's trio. She is good in some other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. His poem is not funny, in fact it is awesome, but cunning is built in such a way that reading does not increase charm, but humor. We are listening to McIntyre about three weeks of Spring, but it will never be old because we do not deny his voice and partly interact with Stooges antics. The use of operative soprano in the comedy, reminiscent of the role of Kitty Carlisle at Marx Brothers' "Opera Night", but the comedy comedy has never shown Carlisle's comedy ability, especially in Opera and McIntyre (more than any other speeches here). Stooges buffoonery, McIntyre's singing and a well-built area combines 5 5 out of 5.
