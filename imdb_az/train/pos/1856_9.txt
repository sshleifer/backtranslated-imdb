He was proud of being a great supporter at Glory, proving "Mediocre" mediocre actor Malcolm X "Malcolm", showing his love of Philadelphia, "He has a Game," he never he pulled us into a hurricane in the "Hurricane" and he gave us an effective broadcasting training on "Education Day" and now he has shown himself! Denzel Washington's "Antwone Fisher" is the most moving film of the year. This Tearjerker fishing story has nothing to do with the crisis of the Miami Yunus against the New York Patriots in the fourth quarter of the 2002 season. Unlike the Dolphin tragedy, 'Antwone Fisher' has emotionally delightful results. The film is based on a true story about a young marine officer who has a problem of anger management because of the child's failure as a parent. Denzel Antwone plays a sea psychologist who helps to protect his anger and encourages his natural mother. Derek's novelty, such as Antwone, is the best-ever-fascinated action I have ever seen before by an experienced actor. As I've seen in Washington's past speeches, I've seen detailed eccentrics in the operation of Luke. If you say Washington Luke-la la la Luke, I'm your father who works. Okay! Before I send my readers a remote galaxy, I'll go away from the Star Wars jokes. Talking to the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterpiece. But what can you expect from Master D's activities? Antwone Fisher is not written by anyone other than Antwone Fisher. The emotionally driven path he put on the scenario of his life story was 'fishermen' kingpiece. Dear Mr Hello. Washington's 'Antwone Fisher' also holds the right feed. ***** Excellent
