_Waterdance_ investigates various aspects of the life of artificial wounded. <br /> <br /> The experience of disability is a lightweight experience of fluorescent lights, which leads to sexuality, personality and depression. <br /> <br /> The variety of central characters highlights the complexity of the substance investigated - Joel, writer, Raymond, dark past black men and racist biker Bloss. At first, these people are not the only ones who are the nature of the injuries, they protect the spirit of competition. <br /> <br /> So, over time, sharing experience with good and bad experiences brings them together to support each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious indication of transformations is Joel, headphones and curtains that are removed from patients with sun glasses at the outset. <br /> <br /> When she comes to accept the changes she has made in her life, Joel abolishes these details and begins to engage in the struggle of the men she's sharing with her. <br /> <br /> The heading refers to this daily struggle to keep head over water; rejection of dance is to deny life. _Waterdance_ is a very moving and powerful movie and I will not hesitate to recommend it.
