I recently quoted IQ. Although the novel is not a romantic comedy, I think it's just a nice and sweet movie to watch. In my opinion, many films are deprived of honesty. When you watch a movie you know this feeling and you feel you're robbed because you've just gotten something out of the story and thrown it down like a filmmaker. The story between scholars is sweet and funny. How they were tackled and tried to help Tim Robbins' character become smart. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple, and when it came to love, it brought a good point, "nothing looks like it." <br /> <br /> 7/10
