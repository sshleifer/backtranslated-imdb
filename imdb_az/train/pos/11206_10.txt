I have not seen this movie! At least not entirely. To see all of these, I saw several haunting clips leaving me gagging. A sequence remains to my mind so far. A (very convincing) spacecraft brings the dark side of the moon to orbit. The pilot releases a flash device to capture its hidden surface. The moon is obvious. . . . there are a few seconds. Parallel lines, squares, maybe ... then the light falls and short glimse ... what ... went and spacecraft came back to Earth. Beautiful. I have seen other clips, but I would LOVE to win the full movie.
