Yes, I'm saying this is a great movie. A fantastic toy with a lot of actresses and actors, which is very well described and understood by anyone who understands me, is perfect lighting, chic black and white photography, a fit soundtrack, intelligent and compatible design and thrilling and working story. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. <br /> <br /> According to US President Barack Obama, all pride of Hollywood should be rested. There was nothing that the actress could do and he was always melodramatic. No heartwarming with this lady - I always thought it was a better actress than Bette Davis or Joan Crawford screenwriters, and this movie confirmed my mind. Always deliver hard and at the same time true feelings as nails. <br /> <br /> It is not fair to add that he has very good parts during his long career. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good for this movie. These desires, human desires that everyone can understand. In fact, no one's scenario appears in this movie, all the characters move impulsively, and everyone wants to be happy without harming anyone else. <br /> <br /> I liked what this film said about youth, about matrimony and necessity. compromise. The film that I associate with is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of Suspicion, but also creates the atmosphere of idealism and cartoonist Small Town America. Fritz Langin's Clash by Night, a more intense film in the night, is similar to the one that happened a year ago, in a similar way to Stanywck. And I can recommend it.
