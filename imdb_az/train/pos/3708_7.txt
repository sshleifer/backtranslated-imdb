When a writer deals with femme fatale in this adaptation of the Grisham novel, cat and mouse are fatal. Altman creates a downturn, Gothic atmosphere, but script is weak. An athlete said South was satisfied as Branak's lawyer and was as attractive as Davidtz's desires. Downey delights like a private detective. Duvall plays a small role that does not allow much to do with its strange nature. Hannah and Berenger struck a surprising cast. After an interesting structure, the movie bogs down and really does not promise the first, but Altman is always worth a look.
