I have been saying this for a long time since I've seen it, but I've seen it 5 or more times; a beautiful street inspired by music groups inspired by musical / comedy couples of new or pale stars. Kay Kyser's secrets would be a good example. <br /> <br /> Spike Jones's emergence is the best part of the show because she and her band are playing a lot of ringtones and part of the action, they support a wonderful job. Hugh O'Brien plays face, Buddy Hackett has proposed the party's rumor to Lou Costello, and that led Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it's a good movie, though, so it's important for Spike Jones and his group to date. I have not seen him since 20 years and I wish he could be released as I did not hear. Hopefully it's not missing
