Anna (Ursula Andress) official RN an old widow, Leonida Bottacin (Mario Piso), by her ex-boyfriend Benito Varotto (Duilio Del Prete), to recover her health after a heart attack. But Benito, in fact, hopes for Anna to lead a group of heirs and businessmen, including American entrepreneurs, Mr. Kitch (Jack Palance), with global motifs, reflecting the fact that he will actually come to Count. She has a delightful history of women and, as a treatment, is actually a little bit more "sensitive". The bad guys go out because Anna does not go and approach Count. The latter may be called heartbreaking, but maybe better predictable. <br /> <br /> But for the sake of cunning - this movie is totally erotic comedy, from beginning to end, and oh how good. There are many naked scenes, including those of Anna and Jole, one of the worst heroes played by Luciana Paluzzi. Both Ursula and Luciana are women of the continental old Bond focusing, and thus men follow the fantasies of viewers. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best scene is Anna's (slow) full strip and jump with a young man on the bed. Adone is an "other patient" (incredibly resistant) attempt to learn what the plot is about. But even at this point he is already two-sided (better) because he decided not to go. But with Benito, Anna and Jole, she has more than two timers with women in the past with long slippers, and the opponent's best erotic scene follows a controversial argument between her and Jole. This is a confrontation that Luciana faces only in black panties. Another nice thing is the Ursula swimmer, completely naked in the property's pool. Count is free as an attorney in the Ursula where he wishes, and he gains preference. Hey, in any way, I returned to the names of actresses in my drawings. The erotic scenes covering other women are followed by the funny bare wine cellars. "The Sensuous Nurse" is compact, 77 minutes, but it does not need to be - uninterruptedly enjoyable, start finishing. <br /> <br />
