When I was a little girl, I saw this movie. And I always enjoyed it. Undoubtedly, the graphics are a little cheese, compared to now, but in the 70's this was great. I just saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was beautiful. It was my Christmases with my family - how I remember - magic. Santa Claus was beautiful and I did not expect her to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / child and have a Spanish language, call them "Santa Claus". <br /> <br /> It's a different version than we used to date, but who's saying who is the one way? <br /> <br /> An entertaining movie to watch. Children teach good and bad. If you do not know what the English subtitled version is, or if it's an English language, only Spanish is good. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Feliz Navidad!
