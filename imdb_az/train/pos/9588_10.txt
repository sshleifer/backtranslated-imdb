When Paris was burning out, I totally dismissed it. I was not into Madonna's vogueing phenomenon. I thought it would be envy and foolish. How wrong is this movie about? After filming for ten years, I watched him and fled and took it. It took some time and fun and excitement back. Personally I knew all the symbols. 80 was spectacular and the film drew the essence of gay culture. What a terrible job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original login members were doing right now, but it was not possible to find them all. Let me know if you have any information from any member. <br /> <br /> I hope they are doing another documentary. I liked it
