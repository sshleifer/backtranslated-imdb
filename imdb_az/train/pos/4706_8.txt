Of course, it can not be classic, but it is full of classic lines. One of my few films is my friends, and always quoted, and in 15 years (maybe many times at Cinemax!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - understand how he can play it - but just how to play that poverty as well as with a fantastic player who knows. Looking for a movie to please you? This is only a lease with friends - it will further improve.
