Something about "Paulie" touched my heart as a little movie. It's a clever, funny but emotional movie. I'm late to be the admirer of this movie. Until May 2004, I did not see Paulie and ordered the Widescreen DVD on the eBay vendor. <br /> <br /> Special effects of Paulie's talking are superior. My son asked me if the bird knows so many words. Paulie is my favorite part of my film when Paulie is in Paulie's Cheech Marin (Ignacio), at Gena Rowlands (Ivy). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a beautiful role as a good-hearted man. <br /> <br /> You can not rent or buy this movie!
