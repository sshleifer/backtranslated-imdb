I have just watched this good-natured parody of the Living Dead Night, and I have to say that it is terrible and very fragile. This film includes all the antics and scenery shots included in the original cemetery, supposedly abandoned house, basement and front lawn. What I especially like about this movie is the comic use of bread, and it is respect for the hostile bread of all households. Sincerely, we know that toaster, pans and zip-locks made bread eleven times and now we have to turn to their help to defeat the intensive care unit. Apart from cheap heroism and noise, this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of the "Dead Night of the Dead", which is better than the death of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> How to look at the film, how the filmmakers and directors are using the original movie dialogue, and how to turn around the bread, especially in rebuilding the bread and avoiding the remains of being particularly dangerous. Another reason I love this movie is that it is bad for the bread, the bagels are bad, and even the bad things are bad, it shows a sad scene with a monster and a monotone. I think the actors are particularly humorous about making the viscose attack with bread slices (ie car scene). I think the latter should give a lot of appreciation to those around him. <br /> <br /> Even though it's so short, "Dawn of the Son of the dawn," "Return of Terror's Revenge," "Severe 2-D" has a severe parody, yet a great horror parody, college film artists something like: "Devil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh, Hellbound,. I recommend this movie to anyone who can enjoy the Night of Living Dead and who still respects movie directors. I would also like to recommend this movie to anyone who likes D-movies and horror parody, this is a nice little short horror film that is entertaining to watch and learn.
