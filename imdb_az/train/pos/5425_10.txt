This was not the Southern Soap Opera, which was slightly smaller, but the largest epic of Hollywood's greatest exit from 1939. I was open to Cary Grant, Viktor McLaglen (a Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. delivers superb comic performances. However, I want to note two other, less understood elements of this masterpiece. The magnificent final war sequence, the wonderful Sam Jaffe, climbs up awesomely to the summit of the temple, and it is simply great to blow up its accusation and to warn alert. He will never love me. Eduardo Ciannelli's Guru has another sub-element. This is not a Fu Manchu caricature, but historically informed ("Did you never hear Changruputra Maurya?", "Iskander defeated his troops in India"). Indeed, this is a mystical, bad nationalist, and parallels between a well-known figure in the 30s (A is not a German but a Hindu). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi tract? Not exactly. But still a great, funny, moving epic.
