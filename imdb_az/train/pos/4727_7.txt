I really liked this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. The attractive writing (some were "inside me" jokes, some of them took me - maybe acting on one another), excellent acting (especially John Cassini), great comets, an interesting and unique directorship. I leased Jeffrey Meek to rent it (it's been a strange thing that he missed, burned up, and I'll miss it!) He found the movie very entertaining. Before returning to Netflix, I'll really follow it again. Actors and actors will use this movie thoroughly. I wish the last thing to do, but something different (and more positive). The worst film was not accepted better, except for the "festival" market. I propose to anyone who loves this actor.
