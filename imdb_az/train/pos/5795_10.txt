This movie loves all my time! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie! I am always looking at the moon, looking at it! This is a film, although you really need to see that it's an MJ Fan, this movie, Captain EO, E.T. as writes. and Ghosts, a bit of history of film and music! This beautiful movie is out of the darkness of Michael! And: Smooth Criminal is the most beautiful, exciting and beautiful song I have ever heard in my life! Thank you to Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician, beautiful person to reach this planet, and always brings your sparkle to your eyes while listening to music! Please, if you do not know this movie, look and do not miss it, because it would be bad for you! For each movie lover,
