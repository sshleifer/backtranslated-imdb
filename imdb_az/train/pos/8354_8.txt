For the first time I saw this movie Cinemax on Friday after a dark series (after building a cable box as a keyboard) and interested me. Although it is a trivial aspect of the film, it is a good move. Depardieu & Dewaere's performances are very pleasant. Together there is a good chemistry and Miou-Miou gives a breathable pink fur look. violence, robbery, and casual sex, it can be politically correct at times (at least not in the United States). This film is a good film, regardless of the theme of a talented cast and talented directorship. Patrick was sorry to find Dewaere's suicide, and in the near future, I will check him with Depardieu & Miou - take off your Hankercief.
