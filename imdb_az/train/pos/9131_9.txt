"I just want to see you laugh at Purple Rain." This is a great movie. PG-13 should be re-evaluated. But in any case, the first film of the Prince and the greatest. Tracking sucked. But for a few years, I did not see what I can remember here. Kid loves his life and keeps his group together, winning over Apollonia (like the Revolution itself) and tension in his family. But the opposing team (like themselves) breaks their lives. Like Morris, he tries to play Apollonia from the child. Saturday night, Fire, Flashdance and 8 miles. Very Good. Rent, roses, and weep and buy it, buy it.
