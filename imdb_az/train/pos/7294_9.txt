After reading several comments, I had to add two sentences. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I've ever seen. I've had a chance to see it at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. This story was very complicated - especially in a short time. The story is directed at a young girl who suffered by her insulting father. Soon, she will be given the opportunity to "stop" a demon by playing Witchblade's Eric Etebari. After watching the show, I was surprised to see how a unique and distinctive character played. I never knew that he could do so well! His character was deeply complex and very convincing. The player was absolutely superb by him. The girl's condition was good and her father was worthy. There is also death overlooking the girl around her as she can escape the future. Effects and cinematography were totally mind-blowing. Does it have at least one hundred thousand budget? Such high quality looks rare. The opening was totally breathtaking compared with any great feature film. This does not mean it's not without its flaws - I thought I took a little bit to go and intro was a bit long. But it remained after watching in my head. There are so many shorts with this quality level.
