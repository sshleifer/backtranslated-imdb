Future things are a historical film. Along with Metropolis (1927), it is one of the first great science fiction glasses. This is one of the first resurrection films. Cinematographers state how the start of the Second World War will be completed within a year or even in a subtle manner in the real world. But then the film comes out of a reality that has emerged as a result of a war (replacing toxic gases only for nuclear weapons that did not exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> In the last half an hour, the groundbreaking use of models and mattresses has become an incredible science fiction genre stunt. It's a sad thing to know that in the future, Bilimkurgu will be set up with cheaply-made b-films, a stereotype that will not be broken by 2001: Space Odyssey after 30 years. In Hollywood, things would be very different if they were tackled with the quality of the effects. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some co-stars play a very good role in this film. Massey plays a role as a sophisticated (1970) civilian pilot who is trying to win over a devastated country's population, driven by a simple thoughtful war leader (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson). Finally, the story covers 100 years. But there is a big problem with this movie - it's not really a story of fuss. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in such an episodic film - a bit reminiscent of intolerance - in fact, but I felt that it could have been made of more material and the images in the last third part of the picture were really striking and worthy of the admission price. The plot does not exist, and the film ends as it is. interesting. <br /> <br /> Future things, every serious intelligence philosophy is at least a one-time film. However, unlike Metropolis, it does not have recurring ideas.
