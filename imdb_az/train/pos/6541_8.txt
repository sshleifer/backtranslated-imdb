As I grew up in the mid-40s, I was not close to one of the main demographic maps of Nancy Drew, but today I enjoyed the film's good impression; That is why I said that there were sixty silver-haired women who were sold from me. <br /> <br /> The theater just praised the old man, especially the movie, about 20 female workers (who said he had seen and loved the movie the previous evening). But the point: But there was nineteenth in front of me - one of them, and nineteen-year-old girls clasped each other, climbing pop and root and hot dogs and candies forward and jumped forward <br /> <br /> <br /> After the start of the film, they immediately fell to the ground to watch. <br /> <br /> And the final loans did not exist. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; It does not pay too high school places, is not sure enough of its tone, and its penny is a very long hair that is sometimes not characterized by a critical character. But the adaptation of the welding material is in fact a respectable, plot similar to each other and begins to exaggerate between extreme cheese and the sins of extreme modernism. Emma Roberts, the most delicate gesture in the film, is the Roberts movie, though it's the perfect time for Josh Flitter, and it's a beautiful way. Her Nancy Drew is the direct father of many Kristen Bell's Veronica Mars, and the film is a cold generation of Jodie Foster's early and complete "Candleshoe." <br /> <br /> Today's marketplace is so rare that it is a family movie that respects the intelligence of viewers. So everyone will not have the taste - but this is the best film for decades.
