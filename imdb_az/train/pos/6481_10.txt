When I was a kid I saw this series and loved the details I left and never forgot it. Finally, I got the DVD collection and how it was remembered. This is how a doco should be, impartial and actual. Film shooting is incredible and negotiations are fantastic. <br /> <br /> I just want Hollywood to watch this series and shoot some war movies. Note: Note. Sibling Group, Getting rid of the Ryan, letters from Iwo Jima, flags of our ancestors and trumpet fade
