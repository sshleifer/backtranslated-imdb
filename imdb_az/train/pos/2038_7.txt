This movie has overtaken my expectations. I thought and it would be trash that I did not expect too much. But I was pleasantly surprised. First, I did not look good at a leading girl and she really did not really care when she was alive or when she died. After a while, he grew up on me and became an unpleasant character. People are not the only ones to die for no reason. There are many stories that take a few seconds for the film, but many explain it. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. If you do not have confidence, it's only an hour and a half. You will live 80 years.
