Although a little young to me and to Mr. R., Timothy Dalton liked it very much, but I thought Zelah Clarke was very full and short. This version was very good and very good. When I saw the 4th version, Orson Welles was still very good at my lovely Mr. R, George Scott, and though they were a shake between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, they were a bit too much for the role. I recently saw Rebecca's brilliant television version of Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would like to see these two ladies Eyre. When we come to watch the Ciarin Hinds version, I think I'm Jane Eyred, but I'll never make a few minutes of Joan Fontaine's voice open. The first version I have ever seen. I always go back and read again.
