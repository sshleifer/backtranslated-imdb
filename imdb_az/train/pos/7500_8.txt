If you think the "Strange Al" Yankovic is fun, you will not be surprised by COMPLETE AL. Yankovic's more memorable videos (such as "A Surgeon" and "My Love Rocky Road") are not a rare mockumentary feature, but the parody's fame is probably linked to funny vignettes. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and creative enough that even non-fans will be disappointed. Die-hard fans will love not only for its contents, but also for early glances over Yankovic's nearly three decade career. Children of all ages, of course, love comic visuals.
