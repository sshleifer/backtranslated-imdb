.... 16 years later Tim Burton finally fools me! What happened to the old Burton, who wrote Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" as a research to prepare Batman to return in 1988-89? Burton did not explore his book with the appearance, nor did the cause of the film cause everything. WRONG! This movie is healing! This is not as good as the original and does not deal with the same topic as the original. If you want a good monkey movie you can watch the original. <br /> <br /> ***** stars
