As producer of this "dark", we have not seen 3 very important confessions in our recent loans. Several times after being filmed, films that could not be corrected and attracted the sides were seen. I'm sorry for the perfect filmmaking and crew. Certainly, some of the criticisms written here are tough for their credit to be coincidental. Our production values ​​were small and our "special effects" were really very special, but the plot was very powerful and cinematography by John McLeod was superior. We hope the reader enjoys the "Darkness" and the efforts made by those who work. Thanks, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
