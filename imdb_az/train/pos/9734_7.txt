Well, there is another romantic comedy, but this is the best I have seen for a long time, unlike all the other genres. <br /> <br /> I'll take it first. I wanted to watch this movie a bit because of Megan Fox and Simon Pegg. <br /> <br /> Firstly, if you watch a good movie, Sidney and Alison would be together in the movie or movie ... but you will not know how it is from the beginning to the end ... <br /> <br /> Ok, this movie is now just for Simon Pegg. I do not see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure it would be a very poor film if Peggin had not had a great performance. <br /> <br /> Simon Peggin's character, Sidney's courtesy, made me laugh very loudly that there are many great gags and jokes in this movie ... but I'm good at this movie. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really strong in this movie (I usually do not think of it more than average, but it's really good), then there's Jeff Bridges, there's a great role for Megan Fox playing Gillian Anderson and, of course, spoiled bitchy star Sophie Maes ... <br /> < br /> Generally, I do not generally agree with ratings on IMDb, and I'm totally agree with them at this time ... <br /> <br /> Go and see this movie is really light, positive and I strongly advise ... My rating 7 to 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
