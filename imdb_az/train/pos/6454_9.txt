I saw this movie in the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005, and I've seen them as my 3rd movie in 14 films I've seen there. Many of my ancestors were filming the origins of Sweden from the Norrland province of Sweden. And I've grown up in an area located in the northern forests of many countries, like many small towns that have adopted this movie. It's good to see more movies using the rural areas, like settings for the hot spell. It was a very good movie, and I believe it's a tough movie to draw with a very large ensemble, but its director, Kay Pollock, really drew it after nearly two decades of leadership. Like an actress, Helen Sjoholm was fantastic at the start of the movie, and I would expect it to be more on the big screen. This well-rounded belt was Michael Nyquist. I appreciate this movie very much and download it to 10 degrees at 9.0.
