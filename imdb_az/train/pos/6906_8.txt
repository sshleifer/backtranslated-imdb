I'm very pleased with this movie. It was funny, sweet, foolish, and entertaining. It was a great deal of pressure, and I was attracted by some critics because of the reasons I did not really understand. No, it was not a "Kadir Grape" or "Casablanca" or "Moonstruck" but a pleasant movie. <br /> <br /> Julia was playing a psychotic man behind her. Story is a little silly to be sure, but it's not drama, not a nation. The film was reviewed, apparently, looking at a good movie and then fled a night looking for a movie. I had not heard of grief before I saw him, and I saw that I was glad. As a result, I bought the VHS cassette on the stack and sold it several times.
