This film has a very good place, you do not have to wait for about a minute to go from a snowfall and there's more to the film's beginning. All of these are the paradoxes of traditional parabolic native-boy-good-extravagant and despair genre. Do not allow any of you to say that you are trying to make cheap laughs using obscenities - I am sure that there is plenty, but not entirely contexts. I liked this movie very much and paid only $ 2.99 on the DVD, so it was the best movie I've ever seen in terms of entertainment value.
