Richard Dix decided to retire, and Michael Duane replaced Ted Nichols as a young girl named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This pair only knew each other for two days and decided to marry Peace Judge (Judge) and rains after the judge announced that they did not return home and would not return home. next day. Like in the double house, some of them raise the car's head and take off the engine from the engine. After seeing this event, you see that the couple is surprising and aware of the existence of the story to reveal a very mysterious event surrounding Alice Barkley, and that very poor Ted Nichols understands plenty of trouble and marriage. Good mystery, but I miss Richard Dix. Enjoy.
