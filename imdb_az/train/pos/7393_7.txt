This film was impressive. My first experience with a foreign film was neither long nor too complicated. I liked the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of a mature boy's long life extended to his elderly father and brother was scared for the first time, but proved to be a very touching and realistic one. There were some delicate humor to shake or avoid the audience.
