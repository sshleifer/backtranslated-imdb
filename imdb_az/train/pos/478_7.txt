I was very surprised that no reviewer had ever commented on his mistake in the game of Luzi openly enough for his opponent. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a consultant chess expert, Lucci is shown to have won the game in a fugitive move. After reaching the victim of a queen from Luzin's combination between fast slits and lying board, in D1 his bar was bent in black on the c1 against the king on the corner at h1. Hence, if he was unlawful, R1-d8 could not play a mating act, but it did show that he was happy to enjoy the audience.
