Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are single-parent brothers. Jasbir grows up in a rich environment, but it is not enough to lead her to deny her life and eventually join a hippie movement that leads to drugs. On the other hand, Prashant (brother) grows in a less rich environment, but grows up to be an adult gentleman. The story strived to get rid of the enemy hippie environment to save Prashant's poor sister (of a period). This film stops the time test by commenting that the cults and hippie groups are a place to be considered indispensable and difficult to deal with. In this film, great music compositions that express different things in different situations and different people, and the director gives a great feeling.
