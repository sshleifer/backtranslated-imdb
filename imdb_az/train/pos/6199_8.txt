<br /> <br /> For a few years, I think that, like Hartley's public work and pursuit, most of the artistic works about real stories have been brought to extraordinary philosophical games. <br /> <br /> Even though fun, Fay Grim is another film that reflects the quality of an object by taking the step in Henry Fool's line of thought. Memories of the object at Henry Fool ... Fay Grim has the object's encrypted memories - they are stolen, fake, and trans-mutated, so no wacky thing - writing and filmmaking in modern times - less than one. What is Fay Grim is a philosophical sense. Perhaps the shock is now a clich√© and a boring tragedy (as pointed out in the opening scenes of the publishers office). <br /> <br /> Along with this, most of the best points in the film do not understand Henry's character and the importance of the memories. <br /> <br /> Henry is a delicate devil, first of all, as Simon is visiting a modern Faust and so on. We understand the nature of the tragic Henry's character and the quality of the story of Fatih Grim. Henry Fool know how to describe 'enough detail' through verbal flashbacks Henry Fool can not compare with a quality 'sense' of a character like one and I have about 10 minutes to think about someone who is going to go cold in this movie < But Henry Fool, my least favorite Hartley movie, realized that it was bad - ugly and infested - accurate Henry Fool confessions were bad ... it was just dirty or dirty, inevitably broken. <br /> <br /> Henry can not even be a good liar - this is perhaps the most disadvantageous tragedy in her ... Tolkien's works like Henry, like Gollum. <br /> <br /> This benefit does not meet Grim, though Henry's dialogue is good. What you can say is that all movie is set up as an encryption - a kind of molding of another field until it ends with another bad thing to add to Henry's confessions. It's an interesting twist, but I can not really digest it without seeing the first movie. Henry Henry would have been better than describing the main story of the first film - though this film is not really the first movie - perhaps not a random observer. <br /> Is part of the password? It's hard to say ... though the sex gimmicks are a bit disappointed. Cheese.
