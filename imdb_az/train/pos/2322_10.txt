This magical moment in life is the point of the child's innocence and the mixed storm in the era of adulthood. . . That's all about this movie. <br /> <br /> Danni (played in a beautiful way by Reese Witherspoon) is right in the moment when the movie started. She sits on Elvis, plays his notes and thinks about love. Her sister Maureen will soon enter the college, she does not have difficulty attracting boys, she is beautiful and, despite all this, understands everything. He suffered domestic damage after his father and only asked for a good boy to be swept from his feet. Danni, as the youngest youth, wants everyone else to be, because most teenagers think they are not good enough. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> Father The court that was recently murdered has moved to the old farm to help his mother and two younger siblings. He is responsible when it is necessary to have fun. Especially on a hot day goes to the pond, and only Danni jumps to find a dip. They shout and argue, and Dan is leaving. However, after one day, courts see each other when they are invited to visit Anna Danni's old friends (Danni's parents). Danni drove the Court to Danni. He has a tambourine and a crooked attitude, and he says what he says in his mind. <br /> <br /> The Court is 17 and Danni 14 and knows it, but they continue to draw closer to the days in the pool between the farmer working on the farm. If the court kisses one day, Dan is squeezed. Danni's father invites him to the court and makes it. but the Court is concerned with its "kind of dependence" on things. Silence is broken at a meeting with Maureen, who has not yet met the Court. A review between two and more. The pain and defeat on the face of Danni is beautiful in both life and pain. <br /> <br /> I will not say the rest of the film, but the film is more than a relationship between a boy and two sisters. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the film depicts the moments of life both beautiful and painful, and the relationship between two sisters who have been tested for love of a child with love, and both must be together and individually. Danni finally notes that the world is unfair, painful, and perhaps even less hopeful when it comes to film. Several films can really capture the miracle of childhood and the pain of adolescence. Ever since I watched this movie for the first time in my opinion. My Top 100 movie is in my list and worthy. I just wanted more movies than this, because if so. . . The Hollywood belief would be much better.
