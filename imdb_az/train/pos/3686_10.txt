Diane and I have seen this beautiful movie in Fremantle and both of us have recognized that the rest of the film is the head and shoulders. I say that the short, five-minute-minute segments that make up the film and every single part of this movie have a theme and, of course, this is a matter of love in many ways. > <br /> Outstandingly, the film took place in different Paris arronditions, giving each segment a special taste. On several occasions when I was in Paris, I was not well-informed enough to recognize the places, but I am convinced that Europeans, especially the French, easily recognized the place of the city. In any case, because the viewers are immediately out of the story, their location may result in city breakthroughs. <br /> <br /> The film's rapid movement and the viewer's failure to follow a scenario is one on the screen. The stories themselves are just as subtle and thoughtful and heartwarming as most of the media's life that keeps the beauty of life in a nearby bunch of bread to sell, not merely a graphic like Hollywood's nonsense. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone who is interested in you, and you will feel refreshed when you leave this magical little movie as a spa treat and leave my guess.
