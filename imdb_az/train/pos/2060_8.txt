This movie is not a typical horror film. There are some comedy humor and death scenes, which is funny. I liked the film personally because of the humor removed from the film. If you do not want to be scary and then paranoid, it is not a good scary movie. I really liked the hillbilly boy and LeCester's performance ... I really believed. I think I break my hair like a red-haired girl. In any case, the total cost of campus humor and an unusual horror experience.
