For beginners, I've always been an admirer of Batman animated films because the theme is universal, "everyone has an ego surviving". This is Batwoman's secret. Although the overall story is good, I'm disappointed that it does not really do much for franchising. <br /> <br /> During the film, trying to find out who the Batwoman identity is, unfortunately, you can easily see the disbursement of loans posted on this website (though you do not see it anymore). I was disappointed that the film did not last long. 75 minutes is a very short way to any movie. Batwoman's secret personality is also very early in the film, half the type, and then you know that good guys will always win, and the movie will become an anti-climate because you know that the new character known as Batwoman will end. br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure of the new animation style used in this movie. I love the right new symbols, but we are in a place where detailed details are sought. Some parts of the animation seem so unusual and tough that they are immediately attentive to attract attention to your storyline. I'm not like the bright atmosphere used in the majority of scenes, which loses Batman's dark and gothic feelings. Similarly, we can not learn more about the identity of a bat, so we can build a deeper compassionate feeling with Bruce Wayne. The fight with Bane had to be done better. Congratulations on a kid's fashion, a bad person, very easily, by working with a curse, opening, dropping, electricizing or acting against them. <br /> <br /> Come to this movie, despite the fall of a blood drop. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, a good entertaining flap and I come to everyone who follows Batman fans. There is a good story, universal appeal, and even the top-ranked player. I would like to know that they would make the story more permanent by keeping Batwoman more interested. Only you have to submit it and then turn it off after you finish it. I want someone else to finally understand the secret to a change. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, we need to resolve Batman's privacy and then fill it with details. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, more cartoons will come and indeed, the breach between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. He has chained him forever and even does not love him and I do not believe he is generous enough to fall in love with someone older than 20. I also want to see when I leave Tim Drake, because she is ill from the old man. In short, I want to see all the things that the characters bring to the places in Batman Beyond. Otherwise, this recurring formula will be faster than just what the story is about to do. <br /> <br />
