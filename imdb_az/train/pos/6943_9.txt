Traditional Western is a synonym for wide open areas, clarity morality, inevitable stories, a hero's ability to shape his own victory, and escape from the past. These qualities directly reflect the essence of the American origin, the self-forming Dream, the boundaries and the pusillation of the boundaries, so the genre is still talked about by opportunist politicians. Some of the noble exceptions (eg, Wellman, Hawks) were stronger than Western neuroses or real anxiety. Anthony Mann changed all of this forever, and this was one of the most violent, bright, and sophisticated genres of the genre. <br /> <br /> A Traditional Western-style hero has been able to find any striking, straightforward, and right-wing film that prevents overcoming barriers and restores harmony in the past; and often an ironic, devious person, a detective who reveals a strong acting hero. <br /> <br /> <strong> Mann's background was Noir, a genre film against extensive open space and optimism. Noir is accused of being unfaithful, directed to the abolition of an unstable hero whose morality is frustrated, a hero often trapped in his own internal labyrinth, a trap that is a passive sacrifice to his destiny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A nation living in the Caucasus has died, and Noir is often considered a psychological genre whose hero is traumatized by his head. This is what makes it even more worrying that the protagonist, Jimmy Stewart, Mann, and Hitchcock, has launched a major release of the tough movie. In many ways, it is a foolishness that nobody can cease to revenge when it is kind and sweet, properly representing and trying to restore the natural order. Ethan Edwards' SEARCHERS is a ruthless researcher who has no psychological basis for his worry - in contrast to most 'healthy' heroes, the father of her ancestors (symbolically killed), McAdam's father did not complete the process before being killed; is a lesser moral revenge that is followed by a striking protest against the growth of the body. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ font> <br /> <br /> about a hero or a villain, but a lifeless piece driven by the movement. 73 fans are closed, compressed, unobscured, framed, and appreciated while the glass window opens with a privileged pistol on the back of the window. Throughout the film, human power is downloaded to the most indispensable indicators - name change; Lin and the Dutch mim each other for throwing weapons at each other; guests lose their spiritual vitality and their practitioners are illiterate; armies should seek help from the Confederate borders to fight battles; a man deserves respect only for his name; another man emerges as a fright when leaving his fianc√©e to Indians; <br /> <br /> This film is not a scene of revenge, but a story of a gun; It removes the film from traditional expectations and creates a heartwarming, cheerful, modern feeling. <br /> <br /> Behold, we have been demanding revenge that if we follow another area with the weapon, we feel a bit embarrassed. <br /> <br /> The weapon is the emphasis, the strongest symbol of personality, the criticism of this personality, the discovery of meaningless rituals at the expense of the society and the order; rough capitalist longing; Deceiving Indian merchants who deceive the seller and the enemy; cowards; psychotic killers; The hero, who was killed before his return to his "real owner", was killed as he had been murdered. <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-size: - Wyatt Earp, Dodge City, Cavalry, Civil War, wide open Western - just shake them down - Earp has an overwhelming reputation, which has never been proven, but has never been proven - Dodge City is no safer than anywhere else; Cavalry is not neat (Custer has just lost Little Big Horn) and the bitter merchants of the War The open-minded western myth is a closed, inevitable, circular field that consumes heroes. <br /> <br /> The old silhouette of the driver, John Ford, is repeated, but the signals are moving forward, repetition and circularity, but for all deconstruction, The film looks alive in no way getting a little less western.Mann's strange method is that the cameras change the distance that is changing with an intense study, the hall doors and st Agecoaches intrudes into thriving cameras that appear vividly visible and live.
