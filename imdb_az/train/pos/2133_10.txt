<br /> <br /> I lost the number of times I saw this movie - probably I know all the dialogue back - I still have some time. <br /> <br /> Young Jimmy Stewart, founded in Hungary, is a "royal" skilled bachelor, who has become a secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent "Klara". The King is secretly a pen-friend of Klara and, together with Klara's King, speaks of the contents of the King's letters. Obviously, the King drowns in Clara, but can not disclose his feelings when competing with the "pen-friend". Is it mixed? You will not be good - this story has a sweet, almost sugary end - but we all know that we want the end. <br /> <br /> Note that other speakers are Frank Morgan's usual role, while the store's owner, Hugo Matuschek, Felix Bressart "Pirovitch," a friend of the King. Joseph Schildkraut, an arrogant "Vadas" who is a femininity - you have played very well, but you do not hate it anymore. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy is trying to please himself with a very rebellious rebellion. <br /> <br /> Recently, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have been re-created as "You Have Got Mail", not for me - I'm skeptical of the young audience. <br /> If the movie is related to the Christmas holidays in your area, put yourself a beautiful wine bottle of wine, enter a fire and have the Kleenex box.
