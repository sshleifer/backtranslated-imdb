I liked the movie. Soloists of the 70's thoroughly analyze the Italian small bourgeois society, how they broke all their ideals and how they came to a happy arrangement without worrying. For example, the elderly psychoanalyst, jealous of her son, does not want to remind her of a more radical youth. <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie for a long time, he wanted to buy the video a few times on the big screen and on the TV, but it seems to have disappeared in the market, even in Italian bookstores nobody knows about the movie. a great regret. <br /> <br /> A sex scene that everyone is talking about does not hurt the movie.
