* First, although many say that this series is the worst, I do not think it reflects the 21st century 's mentality ideally .They bring you the perfect opportunity to laugh and remind good youth. <br /> <br /> According to some movies, a few days ago, cinemas are the cornerstone of adolescence; <br /> <br /> If you are commenting on the amount of nakedness in this movie, you will see a good movie for a very good time, during a dream or something like that. Well ... let's be real ... does not reflect the thoughts of young children like the movie? what do you want to see? Smart books, romantic things? what would happen to the foolishness of these young people ... <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager, you have to see the movie even if you are a true grown man or woman, you still have a young mind, or you often think of teenagers or something like that. Thank you for reading!
