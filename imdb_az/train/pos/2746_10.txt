Think of leaving a cold night at a home remotely, and then bed. Do not lock the doors. Only the sound is the wind from the trees. Half an hour later, a light-weight car dips down the roadside. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What makes this picture so scary: a night home day and night ... night. Based on Truman Capote's best-selling book, the First Act presents a terrible story, as it is bestowed in the Cold Blood film, especially in the night and rainfall, based on B & W coverage, compared to the best Noir films of the 1940s. The products of these nightmare. But this is not a dream. The events really happened in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two men with deceitful leaders killed all the Kansas family and sought a non-existent cash. Director Richard Brooks used the actual locations of real-life events, even the farmhouse and its interior! <br /> <br /> Both leading actors are like two real-life murders. Robert Blake is as convincing as Perry Smith, who is looking to find the embedded treasure of Cortez, with something short and a bum legged. <br /> <br /> Scott Wilson is as good as an American smiling artist Dick Hickock. </ Span> <br /> <br /> Things remain there, so they come back to the US, steal cars, ride horses, and drags from place to place altogether. But it is the life of a single man, and the two wars will regret their actions as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The rain is falling, the rope is jammed, and everything we hear comes from a beating heart. The last twenty minutes of the film are saddened. <br /> <br /> Even the "Cold Blood" riveting stages with a little secular Central Act still reflect a real-life story that is still hypnotized almost half a century later. That is, these adjustments. I suppose that people living in Canada still unlock their doors ... at night?
