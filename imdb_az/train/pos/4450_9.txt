An old man in the mountains woke up one morning and lost his cat. He walks in the wood to bear witness to a crime, but does he lose consciousness or lose consciousness? Is he just aging? The film is great, because the viewer must be aware of what is happening. There is very little dialogue in this movie, but no words are needed, the whole movie speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> <strong> It was pretty, but the only thing I did not like was that the old man in his underwear was the appearance. She had a little closer to her dress, but it was also a very deep film.
