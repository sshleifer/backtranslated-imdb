When I watched the DVD for a third or fourth time, I ran away from La Maman et la putain. I also read the French script and the monastery of Alain Philippo with Jean Eustache. The latter ends with an annoying filmography, ten movies, fiction, docs, or something that is not possible to see or Mes Petites amoureuses and Le Père Noël ..., again. /> Here are some of the few things that make this moment: Poland Véronika's French speaks abundantly (maximum of maximum). Is there even such an emphasis? I think I can say that. Is the lack of colors, especially the one looking at the edge of the city? How does this fracture differ from the sleep and the way that divides the worlds of the body and the Winter Tale? Ditto Alphaville. We can imagine the past, but Eustache does not intentionally intersect around the film? Is this a magnificent job? Is Alexandre a fairy tale? Alexandre always shows himself, how or where to stay or worry about when to walk, when it will inform those who need less care than what they give them. Or does it try to choreographer others by doing it for themselves? What's different from Vertigo's Scottie? (I say, I think, too). There is a difference between Eustache's Léaud and Truffaut and does God exist? What is different from that of Leah? Whatever, no matter what the recent roles, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, how old is it? Once I came to Antoine Doinel (Léaud's character) Truffaut. For a long time, every three or five minutes, twenty-one men wandering down the hallway, come wearing a piggy coat, Leu hair, a nose facing one side. I had no idea whether this was a conscious or unconscious mimicry. I was old, but I have no idea how I look at myself. There is no scarf. I have a brother who looks like Bresson's car.
