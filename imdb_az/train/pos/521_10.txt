This is probably one of the most authentic stories I have ever seen. Basically, this is a story based on two worlds, one obvious truth, another imaginary, but at the beginning of the movie, it says that if it is a real place, it is just a coincidence. Anyway, Peter Carter (great David Niven) was going to fly with a plane, he spoke with the June (Monkeys Who Hunter Planet) and he loved it. He meant jumping without parachute, but was saved somewhat, now he sees and loves his body in June. This place, like paradise, is unhappy, because he survived and planned to come to his own world, so he sent the French Conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to love him, but obviously fall in love. Peter proposes to him that he should appeal to his other world court. Obviously, when the lovers announce that they want to die for one another, June offers even its place! Like Bob Cohen, Bob Trubshawe, as Kathleen Byron's Angel, starring shorter (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough's English pilot and Judge / Judge as Ibrahim Sofaer. David Niven was number 36 on the 50 UK actors, the movie was number 86 on more than 100 Great Tearjerkers. It was 47 in the 100 Great War Films, with 46 numbers in 50 UK Films and numbered 59 in the 100 Big Movies. Outstanding!
