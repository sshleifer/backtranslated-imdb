this movie is just about to show you there is not much need for a great explosion, muti-billion dollar computer graphics or a good movie, to have a lot of paid actors and actresses, all the excellent story line and area you need. the maker of all Japanese movies Akira Kurosawa strikes. I recommend this film to anyone who loves epic time. and Kurosawa before they work. 10/10
