Let me start by saying I am a great Carrey fan. I will admit, although I have not seen all his films * cough * magically * cough *. Bruce Almighty was welcome. None of the other evaluations really did not realize that they were moving toward the end of their lives, and I did not know the writers' thoughts. Perhaps I could not help but felt like a poor attempt at the re-creation of Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> In a positive note, The Daily Show is Steve Correl HILARIOUS and thus. If you are a great Jim Carrey fan, see Bruce Almighty or just want to see a comic comedy in a strange (que soft piano music).
