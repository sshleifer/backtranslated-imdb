Trailers of this film can show violent scenes or fundamental sexuality, but these scenes are rare pieces chosen to attract viewers. Of course, there are those who point out the main message of the movie: <br /> <br /> They constantly begin to work and others, using the forces they can use elsewhere, to oppress others. <br /> <br /> Even though it's hard to find a movie showing a brutal as Hundstage, a film that has to endure such a life is harder. Technically, the film is more like the Short Cuts, but it's documentary style episodes. Without any glimmer and without worry, without any hope. Documentary style is even more disturbing, as you can understand, there are people there and many, although our society is paying attention to the beautiful appearance. In one place, the porn industry has to do its job, unmarried intruder violence has to take place, and hopes must be somewhere. <br /> <br /> If you know such people <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie without any comic scene (some of them repeat reputed supermarket, it's funny, but this is true) melodramatic, follow. But subtitles will lose when watching out the subtitles I'd like to accentuate.
