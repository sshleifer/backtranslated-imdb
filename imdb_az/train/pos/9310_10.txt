Wow, how can I film this movie without my eyes? This, of course, was the focus of my life. The raptor graphics were not as nice as the award winning editors continued to use the same shot throughout the entire film if the film did not actually fit in the scene. Wow, what a genius. I will never forget the brightness of the Raptor Planet, which is packed with the plot of the film (for example, a couple of T-Rex animal animals with a raptor and a moment when Pappy is a torture cameraman, "Colin is a girl!"). I would like to thank Sci-Fi for another classic.
