Sometimes a filmmaker like Kubrick is a unique, desperate and challenging component of this great movie or piece of work that has made a great work for a century to bring a little extra. <br /> <br /> The story of Stephen King alone does not have enough flesh and potatoes, even making it difficult for directors to escape most employers. Heck, even the King itself could not have gone so badly. Kubrick shows how the king perceived the universe, how he would turn the page into a screen, which led to a vision and a directed masterclass. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's miss-en-scene is usually terrible. The film is moving sharply, sharply, at a faster pace, but not less than 160 minutes, even though it's not fast or heavy. Overlook Hotel is a luxury corridor like the camera, as a kind of mystical labyrinth rife for exploration, as a camera tracking shots exposed to all glory in strange decorated interiors. Kubrick has a symmetry and geometric approach in space that remembers how the Japanese managers worked in the 1960s. As you can see, all the elements are balanced within the frame. <br /> <br /> Separate drawings are definitely different. The first weight of the Jackin typewriter was sent to the screen from a ball, like drums coming from another floor, or as the author himself prepared, as evolutionary tool itself, and then nothing was just short. A red tea flowing through the elevators of the hotel on a slow mile. Jack slams the door with the ax, the camera moves with it, watching the action is not static static, but inside the door, as if the camera moves into the ax. The ultra-fast growth of her son pushes her daughter into the head before we see her daughter, who has two dead children. And of course, the bathroom scene. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting was not much. It's Jack Nicholson, because his madman is not entirely successful. Yes, it looks semi-crazy anyway. Freaks make her an exaggerated cartoon. On the other hand, Shelley Duvall is one of Kubrick's most inspired choice choices. Coming to a series of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES US, NASHVILLE), her character brings the right amount of fragility and emotional anxiety. A spectacular and very sensitive actress.
