"Prisoners" is a very third film. All the dialogue and character interactions that take place inside it come out of the long lasting south of the last day. <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration with director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years ago, in a film named "Bountiful Trip", a film appeared to be relative to one. Masterson is not necessarily a good guide. In fact, he just has enough of this side. <br /> <br /> Because this is actually a film shot in the movie. This is a film that is at least part of the movie. editing or directing consciousness, all comes to an end. There is no defect here when I'm worried. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), are totally unaware of anything but life. Young actor Lukas Haas, who was acquainted with the New Testament and the "Witness", has the same character as other early roles. He was calm, retreated, frightened and sad. These are the qualities that are natural to him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a topic like "Prisoners" does not hurt this movie. This header, along with the opening scene, creates a more purple image of a higher-angle. You would also like to talk about it slowly, if you are not interested in stage production. Otherwise, they are more often a movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
