One of the best comedies. I've seen this show about 10 times, and I'll probably watch at least 100 more. My friends and family often quoted from this DVD, and you thought you were doing nothing but watching it. The initial part of Alcatraz is a bit slower, but Eddie may or may not pass through the scene. See the section "Cake or Death" (part of Joking on the Church of England) and part of "Hitler / Pol Pot" (it's hard to tell, just look). The best part of the show may be Eddie's facial expressions. He can say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eyeshadow will probably help, huh?) Fair warning: Eddie has to throw up to four letter words.
