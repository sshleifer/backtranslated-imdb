Eight simple rules have begun as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and his attitude to his children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I have chosen Kerry Bridget many times, Bridget has been seen before, Kerry is enough. <br /> <br /> Early episodes were entertaining, good, simple, young, and styled in relation to Paul and Cate. guys, but I think they lost the show slogan when John Ritter died. I was amazed at the player and the staff who wanted to continue the series, but when he died, I realized what the program was doing. The whole point to me was related to the eight simple rules of my teenage daughter. It was written by a real man with his teenage daughters and Hennessey changed the importance and change of the show without his father. <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed fierce, Rory was the same, and Cate was always giving her life lessons in funnier when she left Paula. I think Granddad is laughable (especially when watching those big runs), but I think JJ is unnecessary for the show. He was partly laughable, but when he came in, the story lines were very similar to the other American comedy series. Not all the newer ones are bad, the only excitement is missing and everyone is working at Cate's School and CJ and Granddad do not always find it uncomfortable as well? I would always present this show to your friends, because it was previously strong and worth a look at Paul and Kerry, but later the best of them were on average.
