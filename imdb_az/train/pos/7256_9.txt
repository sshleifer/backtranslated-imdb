When I first came out for the movie, I saw the long day's death, in the film I thought about a good soldier, and gave the real account of men in the war. This story moves at a great speed, trying to return to its lines with a prisoner of war, showing a group of people behind the enemy lines. <br /> David Hammings is a good actor and Alan Dobie (like Helmut in Germany) surprised me that I do not believe. I find this movie on VHS or DVD and I feel it is a sad movie that is so sad because it is superior to many other war movies I've seen.
