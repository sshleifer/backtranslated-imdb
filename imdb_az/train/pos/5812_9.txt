Moonwalker is not a movie if you are not a Michael Jackson admirer. I am a big fan and I'm very pleased with the majority of the movie, the ending was not fantastic, but it was the first 50 or so minutes - an admirer. <br /> <br /> I personally can take the first 50 minutes several times. <br /> <br /> In each video, dancing was breathtaking, listening to music, and enjoying dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you are a great fan of Michael Jackson, if you are not a fan / Michael Jackson, you need to be in good shape. <br /> <br /> 9/10
