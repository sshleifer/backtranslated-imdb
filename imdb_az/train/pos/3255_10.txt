Each scene was perfectly designed. This movie has a beautiful castle and crew. That is, Robert Downey Jr. How can you get a bad movie with no one, and no one will be there. With her incredible talent, she has the opportunity to revive any movie. This movie was perfect! I watched this movie in Blockbuster sitting alone in a movie theater and saw it as a voice, and could not resist it and brought it home with me. You can say you are my favorite romantic, but this movie touched my heart, but at the same time it made me laugh. Even though I was crying, the whole movie eventually clarified the vitality of my worldview. I offered my brother, my fianc√©, who completely admired this film, on my scene of fear, action and pure humor. This sense of feeling is a good movie. It can laugh out loud, touch your heart, cause love, and enjoy your life. Always be aware of the fact that you are only conscious. The choice is to live and feel this inspirational film. Who knows? What can you really do? And if your mind would be open to the mystical miracles of life.
