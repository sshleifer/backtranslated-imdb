When I first saw the Exterminators in 3000, there was no hope for my film. Although it was not as bad as I thought. This is an Italian version of the "Roadwarrior", which is known as Venus Venantini, including Italy. Behind the story, Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sachetti are also responsible for the story of Zombie cookers. You can also see other relationships with Italian fright films: Luca Venantini plays Tommy and you like the role of Mary Robbins and Johnny Robbins and Cannibal apocalypse Mary's brother's role at Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (Dead Dead City of Hell). A very entertaining movie with some darts.
