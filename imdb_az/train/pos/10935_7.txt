Well, I must say that this fun movie was hell. Although the dubbing was a pretty favorite, there were a few moments when the film would turn into a clear blue color for no apparent reason, and I was not disappointed. The story was really quite interesting: The last member of the Poison Clan should be able to watch the other five members and identify who is using it for the evil and for whom it is. In the course of the training, the whole clan is masked and after all these are returned to the lines and change their names. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fighting, like every member of the poison, the Clan has a different struggle style: frog (my beloved), snake, scorpion, lizard and kentipede. Battle scenes have actors jumping all over the place, and thankfully, the camera is built and uses a wide range of strokes, so you can clearly see all the motions. <br /> <br /> The story is that the story is a little dragged down to the first half of the first half. But with this, you win and you will not be disappointed!
