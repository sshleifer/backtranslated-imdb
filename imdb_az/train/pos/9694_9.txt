We took a stunning and fun movie. I was surprised to find that Paulie's voice was played by Jay Mohr. The performance was very modest, nor dragged into Schmalt, nor under the prince of New Jersey, it was not Mr. Mohr, who is not looking at the baby's face, but some old pro. A very striking performance is really charming, and its talents are now pleasing to take on a number of films seriously.
