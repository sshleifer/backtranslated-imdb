This piece of work is no better than anyone! Awesome movie! It is written by Levine's lover and described as the best performance of Christopher Reeve's career and one of Caine's best. I wish I could get a staged version somewhere ... Maybe I'll come for a moment. Hopefully, it's hard to find a very bad, frustrating movie because any Hitchcockian, Agatha-phile or great movie lover should be 'absolute'. I can not resolve very little movie immediately, or from second or third perspective, I can not estimate, and Deaththrap wins 9/10 and gets each one of them. We need such films and deserve it!
