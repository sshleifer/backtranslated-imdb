8 seasons flew, but first, shorter than 2-7 seasons in the early 1959, the last, in the autumn of 1965. CBS chief William Paley revoked Rawhide's production in September 1965 after watching the show on September 1, 1965, and canceled his lineup without Eric Fleming in September 1965, as Gil Favor, who set off after the seventh season. The last episode, released in November 1965. Only 1966 CBS broadcasts on January 4, 1966. <br /> <br /> I often wondered if Ravhide would go through colorful shots for last season. Many of the great westerners of the 1960s were colorful until 1965. CBS was decorated with the colors of the autumn, but most of them were for sitcoms, but the westerners like Gunsmoke and Rawhide were black and white. The Gunsmoke Episode Snap Decision was the last western (and latest prime time network series color transitions) on September 17, 1966.
