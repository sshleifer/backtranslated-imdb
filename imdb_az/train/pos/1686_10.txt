This film, which has made serious decisions in all these rivers after a long hard week behind the table, is a good way to relax. Like Wells and original radio broadcasts, this film will take you to a remote alien country and a sci-fi parade. Captain Zippo Buickin died on his big accusation. He was a brave man. The impressions of Jack Nicholson shine toward the outer face with dark sunglasses and leather clothes. And always avoid the 'death bull'! One point of this film - stopping the curses - return and relax - and "Prepare to Earth Scum to die!" You just have to see it for yourself.
