In terms of visual beauty, this movie is outstanding! I did not know Technicolor coming out so early. I do not like to end, although the whole film is fantastic and I wish it would be in North Africa. Casting is good and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course it's so attractive, and I also liked it with this flick. Basil Rathbone is perfect for this movie. I could not go through scenes and gangs ... Hotel, palm trees, desert, there is everything there ... legionaries also bring the feeling of "Beau Geste" to the film. Of course, they do not shoot such films. Do not fail to watch this classic!
