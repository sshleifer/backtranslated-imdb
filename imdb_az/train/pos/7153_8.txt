My wife is a teacher and she is familiar with the story by reading a few lessons. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film has many parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is over. and I thought it was right. It starts a little slower and I have to admit that I'm a little bored - but it's interesting enough to stay with it. My son is glad to be successful because of being a very happy and rewarding movie. <br /> <br /> Casting was very good. Since I did not read the book, I can not confirm with accuracy, but Jon Voight was really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> In some cases, if you do not want to be loved by this movie, you hate those who hate to hate and laugh for being laughable. <br /> Especially when it is happening at the beginning becomes tiring. All flashbacks (although important for this story) can distract. Even after you come together at the end of the story, you need to pay back for your patience. When everything is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
