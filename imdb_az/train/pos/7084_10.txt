I can not resolve whether this is one of my favorite films. There is a good tension and emotional core, but I can not decide yet. I absolutely loved it. This is Terry Gilliam's first film I've ever seen. My first impression? <br /> <br /> The film is set up in the future. But this is not very difficult. A person from the future is sent to James Cole (Bruce Willis) to get some information from the past (from 1996). A virus killed 5 billion people. From the future, it will be sent to get some information about it. There is also a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly. Love story is beautifully illustrated and you can really feel a longing for a regular life in love and longing. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie that, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film focuses on the attention of one person and his longing for a normal life instead of any boring social. "You want to see the ocean, with it", especially in this film is a tough one. It is chosen to pay attention to tension and confusion in the mind of the person. Therefore, this is not exactly a apocalyptic film, but rather a romantic philosophy that can be interpreted as a reality, from the time-lapse to reality, and so on. This is a special feature film of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> Complex complex runs smoothly without adding many characters. <br /> <br /> The performances are very good. Bruce was surprised by the fact that there was no regular tough guy here, but he did a good job of a loving man. His despicable despair is beautifully described. I have to check out his other films. Magnificent Madeleine Stowe is very convenient to watch. Since I have seen this movie, I have been very discreet with her. A woman who is sincere in his illness and eventually falls in love with her has a great job. Brad Pitt is a real surprise with the description of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> The latter is a great hesitation, and this is another reason to watch the movie. Length or complexity is not a big problem, because this movie is moving pretty fast and there are enough incidents to make people interested. In this film every event has a meaning and nothing is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> A good tension is 10/10
