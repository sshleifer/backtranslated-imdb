For the longest time, I liked this movie better than the original Baking Bears movie. Well last summer, I watched them together and decided that I was wrong. The first is Better Care Bears movie (you might guess if you read my review for it). <br /> <br /> According to several people, he completely abandons any knowledge of the first film. In fact, I will not think the next thing that contradicts with such a statement (especially some of the characters and some of them). When I'm little and watching it, I'm very little confused and excited. <br /> <strong> <strong> <span style = "font-size: This can not think of a movie for little kids with DEMON as a villain! I'm not a minute now for bad guys who want to steal the spirits of the camps and care bears the devils are good, just for little children will not be in a movie! Sometimes you hear from the Mexican film "Santa Claus vs Satan". <br /> <br /> It is almost like the name of the devil, Darkheart, and because he gave him special powers Kiddy flick is too dark for eh? And I've mentioned that Darkheart is the most dressed girl in the 10-year-old girl Freaky! In the meantime, some other kids look at BABY CARE BEARS Care-a-Lot in the same film of demons and baby care Bears <br /> <br /> Of course, everything ends at the end (but before we look at the Darkheart trapped Bears' souls are scary o [surprisingly] deeply disturbed on a scene.) But I asked him if he found the cult audience he deserves so richly. I can only re-watch myself.
