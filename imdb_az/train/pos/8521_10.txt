I absolutely loved this show. I watched it in the last episode of the late 90s. Honestly, it's a beautiful family drama that is rare today. A show that you can follow along with your friends or your children. Of course, it has changed a little since we have seen Jo's books, but still with great stories and good lessons. Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke), actress Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort) performs a great job as an actor. Learns romantics, children, and students developing Jo and Nick. I would recommend this show to anyone.
