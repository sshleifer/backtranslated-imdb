I like this movie very much, but the fact is that you will not understand it until you move to Yugoslavia. The majority of actors have already died and this was the best actor in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is on Divx and may be in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All these were the Yugoslavia, the Balkan peoples. Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists will not poison the nation's mind with ill minds.
