The 74th Oscars were very good. The work of Whoopi as Empee was very laughable and light. I personally liked his last look, which had some strange looks for his old language and jokes, but that's fine. The audience liked it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Vudy Allen and Sidney Poitier made an Oscar for this to commemorate. <br /> <br />
