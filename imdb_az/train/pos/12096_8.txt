I watched this movie a few times and found it very well. This film is also known as "Terror's Fortress", "Terror's Loss" and "Fashion Macabre". Barbara Steele is his usual beautiful and creepy essence. George Riviere, a man with a leadership role, is doing a good job. The whole film is full of atmosphere and there is a good tension. Camera angles are good, and vice versa, the player is not bad. This movie is very suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have a DVD editing version, which is far superior to the edited TV version. Hold some popcorn, turn off the lights, come back and enjoy. John R. Tracy
