I have never met a person (hundreds) who hate this movie. Think that anyone who sings it is a little saboteur or a victim. There is everything in this movie. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan?" <br /> <br /> This is not my favorite movie, but the same person's leadership (Hayao Miyazaki) is my favorite IS. Anyway, this is my first 5th place. And I saw many movies.
