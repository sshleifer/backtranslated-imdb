Well, what can you say when watching this fantastic movie, when my nerves are still confused? Director Jacques Audard should give a name for himself in France and do it right. Vince Cassel is no Tom Cruise, and Emmanuelle Devos is no Penelope Cruz, but it's a careless and engaging thriller that starts with slowly off with some fantastic actors and some crazy character building, and then begins to put on a strain of strain tension. Others have written about the plot, so it is more than anyone else in the film that the director, actor and cameraman play, and everything is real, no foolish weapons, it's pretty safe, expressions, emotion, as it is. Give yourself a boon, DVDs, a bottle of wine, turn the lights down, remove the phone from the hinges, and sink yourself in the Hitchcockian Thriller :)
