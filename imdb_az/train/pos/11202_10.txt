Initially, I thought Ring would be much more than a normal movie, which is a usual structure. How surprised! Of course, the plot is simple - a girl is in love with two men, but Hitchcock brings it to us with silver and silver, with compassion and pain. He describes the strength of the exhibition's popularity, both of the men, and the elements that make up the vast majority of his biggest films (North by Northwest, the Rope, etc.). .) The Master also did a great job at the beginning of his thirtieth year!
