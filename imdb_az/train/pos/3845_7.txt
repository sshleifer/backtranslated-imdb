Slowly, entertaining erotic tension, which is undoubtedly some of the many graphics and "blasphemy" scenes that distract some viewers. However, it will be so difficult for you to ignore some of the creative sequences of this movie or not to see Krabbe's first degree performance. Verhoeven plays an interesting ambivalence, playing with the meaning of the hero's vision throughout the film. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes, everything is turned into a ghost and unpleasant end is not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
