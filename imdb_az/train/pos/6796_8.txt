Zodiac Killer (2005) was an exciting film by German-born director Ulli Lommel. He is the leader in production, production and joint stars. Along with making a cheap movie, he is also interested. Herr Lommel is about to fall into a new horror when he acts in almost all of his movie catalogs. I talked about Boogeyman I and II films, War Birds, Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol is a crowd outside of the stranger's permission). <br /> <br /> Although he uses many old footage in the film, he works well (and I can add it to creativity). <br /> <br /> A young man who creates a copy of the original Zodiac Clay is watching. he wrote with the writer (Ulli Lommel) about the series murderer in the late 60s and early 1970s. Writer-friendly David Hess helps him to test and find this elegant zodiac. Is this murder suspended? Will the writer put two and two together and restore his old reputation? David Hess is still a man? <br /> <br /> This film does not belong to the original Zodiac clay. I also heard people crying about this video. So what. The director's old school art style reveals the reality of video footage. My only complaint was the use of Herr Lommel's earlier films (but why can I say "wait")? This is a strange and street-level horror movie. This film is not about to be killed, as it was a refusal of the states in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Ulli Lommel is very high for fans.
