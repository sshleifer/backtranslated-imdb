I never know a movie to arouse such a debate in my life. I believe that this movie will be remembered as a classic all the time. I used to wait for this movie as I liked Lock, Stock .... and Snatch before, but I thought it would make a lot of disappointment after some negative reviews. I absolutely love this movie and will not wait to see it again. This film differs from both the aforementioned Ritchie films and the better ones. I have my favorite directors, but none of them have left a great move as Guy Ritchie did in this movie. I believe that filmmaking has brought it to another level (I know that by most responding to this film, most people laugh at this statement, but I believe that time will prove to me right). This movie is very surprising, and it's far more than a couple of hours of work because I'm trying to stop thinking or to divorce everything. Now I've taken everything that's happening in this movie (some answers from the endless hours of thought, some of the answers to others' movie readings) and I will not wait until Sunday to see it again. People will go to the cinema with open mind and I hope they will be rewarded as i and others.
