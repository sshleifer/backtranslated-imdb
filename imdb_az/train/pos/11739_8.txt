"Elvira, Dark Mistress" is a kind of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with supernatural touches. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson), the owner of the new station, continues to work as a television horror filmmaker after rebuilding with him. She now relies on the Las Vegas show to hold her, but she learns more money to learn to start the show. Things look hopeless to earn money until she's aware of her death, and then she goes to Massachusetts to read Elvira's desires. A house in need of repair, dog, and cooking is what it left behind by Aunt, and Elvira still has trouble losing money for the Las Vegas show. More and more difficult for Elvira, the elder of the smallest and narrow city, to become even worse. Only local hunk (Daniel Greene) and a group of teens will be friends with him. Elvira's uncle, W. Morgan Sheppard, was pressed to sign a contract with Elvira, but Elvira soon learned about his strong heritage with spellcasting and several impressive sticks. Elvira does not want to sell his cookbook to his uncle, but he decides to take his hands to know his strength. Elvira faces burning in the city's old grooming accusation and accusation between her and her uncle. The area is fairly simple, but humor and well-developed characters are moving at a good pace. "Elvira, Dark Mistress" is full of cute, heavy, bawdy and clever humor made by many vision gags, puns, requisites, songs and parodies. The secret touch of the film has become one of the best horror parody. It's a good movie that's horrific by all performers; Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway ("Oily."). There are also beautiful special effects. Many people (including me) wondered if Elvira's character could make a feature film, and the answer was yummy, YES!
