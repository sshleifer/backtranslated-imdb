JUST RESULT The strongest speeches and some creativity (although quite predictable) is a flawed but decent film. Sean Connery is a death penalty reprimand brought to save a seemingly innocent young black man (Blair Underwood). For proper connectivity, Connery focuses on a crime scene where he must fight not only with the passing of time, but also with the intervention sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Bending and rolling back rocks are numerous - some striking, and some - trying to uncover the mystery of aging Christians. The end of the climate is a little ridiculous, but the real reason is that it is worth the nightly nights.
