When I started with interest in movies, at the age of eleven, there was a great list of "I've never seen" and I would go to Blockbuster and rent a couple of days a week; some would not be for the whole audience, my mother would be nuts. I remember that one of the films on the list was "Chorus Line" and could never get it; <br /> <br /> Of course, I lost my list and will do everything to watch it because there were really some interesting things to watch. That is, taking a "chorus line", the stage game turned into a movie. I know that there is something we see so many things lately, but then it was a bit different; this movie has something special. <br /> <br /> Today most musicians have filmed, made the camera free, created different images, and took the characters to different places; "A Chorus Line" was born on a theater scene as a play and dies in the same place as a movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> Head of the Caucasus Muslims Office Recep Tayyip Erdogan According to him, silent competition between dancers is on the stage where stress is put on every dancer and talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences. <br /> <br /> Like a recent film, hundreds of dancers, including A Prairie Home Companion, broadcast a radio show, and all of them are fantastic, Atenborough is dealing with the problem of sustainability here. On the stage or behind, everything goes on and the time does not stop. Again, I do not admit that Atenboron has cut a lot of things to pull this out, but it is not certain; and in any case this is a great directing and editing (John Bloom) work. But in this small stage, what can you do with the camera that you are surprised? With only one setting, Ronnie Taylor's cinematography, approaching, growing and exiting certain characters, showing the scene differently, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Douglas, in the most important moment, says: "Before you begin, all of you are awesome and I am I would like to put you in charge, but I can not. " This is the only thing that reflects the truth, thinking about the realities of today's reality, and that the jury always went to the opponents (even when not good). It's tough, you have to imagine; At least here is a place where all this is really terrible. <br /> <br /> To illustrate some of the stories, characters use songs and the scene takes a new life and takes a full 'dream'. The music prepared by Marvin Hamlisch and the words by Edward Kleban are the movements of these dancers and the transition to movies that do not allow the display of these beautiful choreography prepared by Michael Bennett. The theater book is a flawless and very short scenario by Arnold Schulman; it often touches. Without such a song, it will be in a word; <br /> <br /> Cassie, a special dancer performing by Alyson Reed, comes to the stage to convince Douglas. it can do it. The words "I'm dancing you" never sounded in music and words in a more honest and beautiful way.
