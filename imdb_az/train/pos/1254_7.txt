Ed Harris's work in this film is up to a standard standard of excellence, that is, he stole the screen from everyone he shares with and has a giant Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a little bit of holiness, only lives on scenes when Harris is questioned by another prisoner's lawyer. Artistic control is a master class. <br /> <br /> Other cast members are all skillful and Connery is valid, like Fishbourne, but the story itself is no wallop packs. The field is largely condemned by white law enforcement officers and is subject to where it is forced. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Harris's activity is worth seeing.
