... it could be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). Apart from a good fan service for good girls (well, it was unnecessary), it was a story that distracted me. Takahisa is hurrying to Zeze and Gackt! and I know that some people will agree with me, but it was not one of the three greatest actors (Sho, son, and Kei singer) given to the best player (for me, anyway). Taro Yamamoto was the fifth boy at Battle Royale! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love Hyde, I worship her voice, but the problem is to extinguish some of her scenes, but I like the dance scene, the body of the dead man kills the other children. Gackt was no worse, and I saw how his character was getting out of the way. In Lee-Hom Wang, I can not say anything about my fundament, I'm not going to recognize it, but I'm carrying it with a castle without a star. <br /> <br /> This film has led to one of the best-ever collaborations, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my mistake if it's wrong). If the full song lasted about nine minutes, you will not see the length because Gackt and Hyde did not hear together. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is not just for fans (big fan base), but also for fantastic, futuristic films, Asian-style fans.
