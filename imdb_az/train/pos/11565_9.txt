ALWAYS <br /> <br /> According to Jean-Paul Sartre, "hell is other people". In The Double Couple, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate that this can be so precise. Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau, for creating two good friends who decided to live together. <br /> <br /> Before fikiks departs, both of them begin to get angry each other slowly, laugh and rise fast. <br /> <br /> Oscars have changed and become more restrained individual. <br /> <br /> Like Ungar, Jack Lemmon is absolutely superior, struggling with life as a single divorce divorced with neurotic, clean divorce. <br /> <br /> Unlike Lemmon and Matthau Lemmon's character, he is just playing poker to earn money for a child's benefit. <br /> <br /> In selected parts of Lemmon and Matthau, the degree depends on the beautiful script of Neil Simon and at the same time works as a team. Like two friends who are different in nature, these two, late, great actors create almost impossible partnerships, even though they are similar to their relationship with their old friends and their children. In fact, the world was shouting for something similar, that two years before Matthauau's death and before Lemmon's, symbols were reunited down a bit later. <br /> <br /> After Hollywood's next surprises, this idea could have worked to some extent, but at the same time it could not be close to repeating the genius of the original film. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's really possible to say something else. Simon's beautiful article, full of humor and laughter, has already hit the creators of this film. Although most important part of the film, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are written as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison. Traditional soundtrack ("The Simpsons"), "Odd Couple", is a great comedy and genius men, it remembers for cinema and is a feature of history.
