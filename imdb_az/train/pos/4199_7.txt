One thing about this movie about DVDs is that the DVD is very expensive. At the moment I have a lot to do with my budget, or I would buy it because it's a good example of movie cinema ... and I am very pleased with the tracks of Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> The criterion produces big DVDs, but sometimes the price is just a little bit. Here's a good thing for a 80-minute black-and-white, mono-sound movie, but it's not unusual, it's kinematographic-smart. <br /> <br /> This story came to an end with an espionage microfilm (here, like the cigar, the sounds, sets, etc.) here (Widmark) accidentally dragging Peters's bag out. (say three times!). Anyone other than Peterson is convincing in this film: Widmark, cops, US agents and communists, and especially Ritter's Moe informant. He and Widmark are the stars of this movie. <br /> <br /> Peters does a good job of playing cheap floosy but at first sight it loses its early protest with the "fall in love" with Widmark, though it is bad for her. Only in the movie world! Too bad, because this terrifying romantic part of the story goes away from it. <br /> <br /> This is a good but not great movie, and of course a mid-film movie that does not cost $ 25-35. According to this estimate, the film would be better at the noir market.
