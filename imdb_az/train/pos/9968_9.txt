My mother took me to see this movie as a kid, and every year, like my other Christmas celebrations, I would like to see it. The most common thing I remember was the foolish Satan and Santa who looked through the telescope. I am T.V. every year. We waited for the guide and looked up from time to time to show it. I usually played on Saturday afternoon. I just found it in English, which has got something special from the movie, and I wanted to find a copy of it in Spanish. I love this movie very much and have never suffered from nightmares, as others have suggested. Yes, it's a different movie about Santa Claus, and it's special and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids while explaining my favorite parts and memories!
