I showed this movie to the students of communication and the media because their lessons are endless: it is important to speak out against hate and can cause the oppressed to change. Freedom of speech and freedom of speech are essential for democracy. It's an event that tells Steven Bikon's activism and how Donald Vuds's journalism has brought the world to the world of discrimination. Freedom of speech gives an important lesson: "It can blow up a candle, but it can not be fired and the wind will hit it at a higher level when it starts to shoot." (By Peter Gabriel in Bikodan, in the crushing of the tree).
