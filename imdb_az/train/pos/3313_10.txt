Bette Midler is a longtime admirer, and his live concerts are my favorite. Bette excites us with jokes and brings us to ballads with tears. Bette, an emotional and talented rainbow, shows the best of his solid repertoire and new songs from the Bets of Roses album. It covers the generations of people who offer something for everyone. One and only Divine Diva said that he was the most talented performer around him.
