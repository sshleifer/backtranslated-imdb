Have you ever wondered how long a movie would go? <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is harassed by Harry Russo in an extreme world. <br /> <br /> Dear writer, anyone who has lost a killer or drug addiction, nothing will stop to destroy those who are mad about it. Harry, who is guided by soundwaves of his ventriloquist welding rubber, begins his killing. <br /> <br /> Famous filmmaker Ron Atkins comes to the first part of the movie's most beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Here's a similar film, Schizophrenia Necromaniac <br /> <br /> This is a really low budget movie and will not be for everyone, but something disturbing and terrifying this is a good choice if you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Do not expect something like Modern Day HORROR (like Scream) <br /> <br /> Watching the audience's discretion
