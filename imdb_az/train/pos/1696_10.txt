These are religious things. My friends and I come together once a year to enjoy this movie. Very funny and very dry. I've seen these moves dozens of times and still have not enjoyed it. Players are funny and get better every time! If you are satisfied with the "morons coming out of the ground," you will love it. Great game in World War II. I love Red Nipples to break the speed limit to foreigners, headline mistakes, DODs, Heat Exceeded Angihilator, Production Area, Red Camo, 1800Mph! "I'll buy a bucket!" Very funny. I love it coming out on the DVD! Negative care for yourself!
