David and Bathsheba are Hollywood, a director of Henry King, who has been featured in the 20th Century Fox by Darryl F. Zanuck, starring Gregory Peck (King David), Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah) Biblical picture. ) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is about the Bible from the book of Second Chronicles of Samuel. King David is King David, who killed the giant Goliath and was now the second king of Israel. The strong and trusting King, David, has greatly troubled your heart. It is the beginning of a trip to spy espionage and betrayal at Bathsheba once taken to the shower; Generally, for the genre, David & Bathsheba is a great, magnificent production. From the perfect design teams to its spectacular "Technicolor" (Leon Shamroy) photography, the quality offered by the genre's production values ​​is the best. Untypically, tho, the film sedated templed and 99% of its value is based only on dialogue. This is not for everyone who needs a few waves to go with the action ad or buckle. This very humanistic picture is actually a biblical love story full of heart sin, not to be defeated around the burning lever. But this is not a bad thing, because we see it moving very well (Peck has something stoik and sensitive to real good and Hayward pushes it to the maximum) and this is often skillfully forgotten by Henry King. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes from the point of a forgotten picture Biblical / Swords & Sandals genres (probably because it is a part of a conversation that has a heart as the main point of sale), but it is worth the time for everyone who is genuinely interested in genres. 7/10
