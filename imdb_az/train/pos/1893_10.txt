Dudley Moore's lover, Arthur Bach, has a charm that he can not help because he can not help this unique and beautiful character. You can not have fun with this infection laugh and giggle and shyness. I'm not really a Liza Minnelli admirer, though she was really good like Linda Marolla and I could not describe anyone else in this role. Sir John Gielgood was in the heart of the film and was named Oscar. The rest of the cast is a great and great "Artur's Theme," wow. Indeed, this was one of the best comedy of the 1980s. Greater films are better than every review, and so is Arthur.
