Given what these movies are, you should think that they should have fun. The film focuses on a house that strangers the stranger. Residents: Writer Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with his hair!)) Has become one of his own creativity; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), a little closer to a candle statue; The girl's incision is a visible facade, John Reid (Christopher Lee); <br /> <br /> "Blooded House" is really the desire to see (good duh, Peter Cushing and Christopher stars) and Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee Lee). Apart from being just tidy, there may be some vulnerable people who are suspicious of the real horror issue. As with The Shining, we can ask the house / hotel to keep track of past events. And if you do not have anything else, Ingrid Pitt (Paul's co-star) HOT HOT HOT! At the time of our release, he played the role of Countess Dracula and The Vampire Lovers (along with Peter Cushing). Perhaps it will be known as Barbara Steele - only one cries of queen, but I will mention my words: THIS IS GREAT TRUTH! <br /> <br /> I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele associate with something. <br /> <br /> I think Denholm Elliott is the only strange scene in which she wears a pink jacket and a hairy jacket. You read that right. Any name "Denholm" probably? He is excellent. Very cool film.
