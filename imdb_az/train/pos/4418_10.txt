<br /> <br /> It took Q & A after the Hawaii Film Festival, prepared by the director and her spouse. <br /> It was difficult for me to believe that it was all the power for the director and Harvey Keitel for the first time. <br /> <br /> <strong> This movie, which reminds Cinema Paradiso, describes the story of the young director about the return of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect that this is a revolutionary movie, its political stance is very strange. Many directors are referring to some of the whimsical scenes that work in an ambitious way, with the discovery of many movie histories (a great "bicycle thief" respect). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
