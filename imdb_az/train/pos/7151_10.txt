I read the Horseshoes in the fifth grade, so it was ecstatic when you heard a movie shot! Of course, because I was a busy guy, I had no chance to film in the movie. The holes were out of the city, but, unfortunately, we were very busy. I have heard all my friends see, and none of them has invited me. <br /> <br /> In short, it was good, but I read great books that prepared unhappy movies, as I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly there was a great opportunity to see him. It was weekly and my parents were on a cruise and I also gave it to babysit. My sister, 9, I watched her and absolutely loved it! Later, I took her to her babysitting home and other children, and liked it at 9 and 4. Even my parents love him and respect the critics of the film. Generally I like this movie for everyone who understands family morality and loves a cheerful dress! This movie should be on the first 5 "see" list !!!!
