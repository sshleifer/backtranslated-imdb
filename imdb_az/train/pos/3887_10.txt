I managed to get it out of the satellite, but I would like to get an original release in a format that we can use in the States. Eddie is truly glorious performing from San Francisco. I remember that it's so loud. My wife and I both enjoyed this tape and Glorious's work with pleasure, so I would take a copy and wish Eddie financial support from my purchase. We need more of its existing indicators.
