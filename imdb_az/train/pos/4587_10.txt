Although John Woo's hard-boiled, it's my favorite movie number 1. But the police story is my 2nd favorite movie. Breads, battles, and my favorite part of the movie, Jackie Chan, jumped off the rails on the sketch, runs onto a pole surrounded by Chrismas lights and dropped a pole on the pole and finally drifted on a hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy amazon.com for 14:98 (Or something like $ 14). VHS new line home video. Do not hesitate to answer any questions or comments. (I'm only 14 years old, but I know where a movie is located) everywhere you look for a movie and ask me to answer. Thank you and good night!
