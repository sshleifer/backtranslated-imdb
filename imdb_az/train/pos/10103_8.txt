I was looking for a copy of this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs), for years I could show my kids. The movie was funny and Spike and his group members showed why they were the best musicians in the business. They had to be good to play this demented. <br /> <br /> A series of extraordinary fireworks, firefighters and group of firefighters (without fire fighting) for centuries. The ordinary fugitives of the army, Spike Jones and his orchestra have their anxieties. Comedy assistance provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and plain human Hugh O'Brien.
