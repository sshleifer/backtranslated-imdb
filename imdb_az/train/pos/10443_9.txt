Richard Linklater's beautifully-romantic youth romance and Paris travelogue are one of the 90's best-thinking romantic films. Julie Delpy is one of the most entertaining performances of the decade, and is a Parisian lady who has one day with Ethan Hawke, strange. The dialogue (and those who are there) is sometimes delicate and exquisitely valuable, but this portrait of two young women who are romantic, intellectual, and spiritually interconnected is full of wonderful entertaining, touching, and understandable moments.
