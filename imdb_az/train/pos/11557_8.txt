Lemmon is a matchmaker, Matthau, who decides to have a neurotic pure "married husband" and to live together to reduce costs - often laugh at loud, sometimes sad story. <br /> <br /> Lovely photo taken and directed. The scenario is very thorny - almost always on the one hand for every line. Especially funny scenes cover two British sisters (Evans and Shellyn) who are surprised by everything that everyone says, but Lemmon cries with kids after she likes photos of her children and meets her former spouse in the house <br /> <br /> Matthau promised with drinks can act! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
