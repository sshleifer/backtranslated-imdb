As a student, I've often seen television movies, the majority of which is a normal loss of time when you shoot US television. However, it was well-crafted and made and finally a very nice twist. After seeing Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by the excellent performance, not the gamut, more than the usual expressions from A-B. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long time after returning to The Fly II. It's nice to see Robert Guillaumme again in the lead role. I can not say that I took Jane Leeves seriously after the days of Benny Hill, but he was just fighting for his role. All of this is a highly recommended film.
