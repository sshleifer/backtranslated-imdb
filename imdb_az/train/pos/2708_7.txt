Jackie (Russ Meyer's Vixen and Beyond Erica Gavin's latest film role) in a large "puppet" home after being sent to prison for a period of 10 to 40 years to avoid drugs and to refuse to do so, or at least in this early film Must try by Jonathan Demme. Because of the nature and vision of Tawaz, I regard it as one of the best films under the Silence of Lambs and Stopping Attention. This little classic is simply entertaining, sleazy and entertaining to be an incredibly good guilty pleasure and will never again be included in all parodies of the "Women in Prison genre". Here is the taste of Philidelphia, which sounds hot from my mouth. But, despite the film's fall ('Untalent show is a great job, sitting and long-lasting, Barbera Steele is very sorry for the other minor things) But these patience will not stop you. <br /> <br /> My price : B- DVD Extras: interview with Roger Corman for 5 minutes; Cast and crew Bios; Original Trailer; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold and many others
