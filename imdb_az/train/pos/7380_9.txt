The three main characters are described very well, especially for rock musician Anisio's first actor, Paulo Miklosa. He is extremely convincing in the lower class as an aggressor / invader. The film shows the effect of snowball on shadow business, contrast and similarity between lower and upper classes. Everyone gets away with envy and passion. 10 to 9-9.5.
