Poor scripts sometimes? Yes! Sometimes special effects on the grass? Yes! Often delightful sinful pleasure? Yes! More about Carl Armchurch and Darren McGavin? Yes! I've always enjoyed science fiction as a kid, but many Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horrible things have just come out as shit. Abbott and Costello took Carl Kolchak to win the "dark side" to give a new perspective on the classic Universal monsters. Duke Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood's Dirty Harry, Garner Maverick, Rockford, Selleck Magnum, and Darren McGavin were Carl Kolchak. All these weak scripts, cheese special effects, cartoon and actresses, and the baroque group, including Carl Kolchak, were mixed with Darren McGavin. In spite of his insecurity, his sense of heroism was idealistic behind the truth, and was a realist who accepted the necessity of state officials and finally concealed. In addition, unlike 98%, Kolchak was ready to wipe her neck, and let her know what to do, even though she was aware of her death, the end of the journalist's career or the detention period. Carl Armchurch was a charming and intelligent man who was driving a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (an old car used in the way) to save his sin for humanity. Thanks to Darren McGavin, another heroic hero, Carl Armchurch, was the hero of the herman brought to life every season. Now he's gone and I hope he's watching him watching his play on DVD, playing Kolchak The Night Stalker, which is very entertaining!
