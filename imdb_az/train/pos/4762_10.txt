I thought "The Souls of the River" was a very good Babylon 5 movie, a series of independent speeches from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. <br /> <br /> If there was an episode of the series (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite stories of the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have always chose Scoggins as a Christian, though JMS did not write too many serials and had to endure the Byron / Telepath area. If you shoot extravagant humor about brothels and "poor" actors on this stage, this is a big deal. Probably I love the third of four films, but not in any way bad.
