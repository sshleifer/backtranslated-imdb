This comedy, which begins with many headaches and sorrows, succeeds. There are many films of this genre that do not approach this depth and plot of the most famous actors. This, of course, plays an exceptional role by its outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, the reality of their characters is that they capture your interest and emotions quickly and keep them in the movie. Firstly, the action seems non-walled and harebrained, but gradually, these two very miserably damaged people try to heal themselves, hopelessly and unwillingly, though they are angry with each other. Rogers's fierce facial expressions and the furious accidents of Shedder are so terrifying that they feel like a waiter. These two beloved, but deeply afflicted people will care for them and hope they will succeed because it is in doubt, and everything is hanging over excessive emotional light. Hopefully, viewers will see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy because this movie proves its worth as a successful actor without doubt.
