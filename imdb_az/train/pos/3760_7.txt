The Academy could not have won the awards, and I acknowledge that it is very cheesy but so fun! Nothing will smile like Bill and Ted. Lovable, optimistic and cheerful, Bill and Ted are a great way to unlock. <br /> <br /> Although I love the Perfect Adventure, Bogus Journey is funnier for me. Death flippin hilarious and Bill and Ted are more pleasing. People are sorry to love this movie, but only really ambitious movie viewers say it's a little fun. If you like, you will probably be an admirer of the Wayne world, Dude My Car, Dumb and Dumber. If you admit it, you will be foolish, humble, and open the trickier box. So watch out for them just hitting and giggling!
