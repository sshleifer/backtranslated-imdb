Madhur Bhandarkar gave all the raw materials. The best part was to forget to give the ingredients. The viewer is short and crisp, and now there is a viewer to choose from. <br /> <br /> Madhavi (Konkan Sharma) is a journalist and is pleased with his work. A simple and free life loves a lover who loves her and a beautiful guest room with Pearl. It covers the nation of today (the Celebrity page), where it has its very supportive editor Deepak Suri (Boman Irani). But because he's hitting his life in the first place, he's in turn turns away and goes into crime. Amigos! He waited for a new world. Surprised by the Revelation, he was shocked. His reaction led him to lose his job. Finally he returns to page 3. Now, when it comes to popularity in the party, he knows the true appearance of each one. <br /> <br /> There's a message in the movie, and it's raw. The audience should get their own colors. The theme and scenario were fantastic. There are very good ideas for preparing spectators. Before the pedophiliac exhibition like Foreplay-Club, the bath is shown briefly before the gey-movements. Dialogs are strong and actors are really good at conveying it. Charu Mohanty speaks volumes of 2 words, and these two words are very successful in expressing such inventiveness. Certain choices could have been better. Songs are no longer in place; but the background was needed. Atul Kulkarni plays a small role in high impact. A little flaw was seen. Atul Kulkarni should be labeled together with Honesty intelligence that describes Konkan Sharman. It could have been a good dialogue because it sounds like a preaching. The meeting between Thapar and her daughter does not require action. This scene is not very professional. <br /> <br /> Generally, pedophilia is an absolute watch movie with selective options before the event. It can break your mood.
