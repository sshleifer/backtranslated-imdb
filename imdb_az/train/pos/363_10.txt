This is about movie development. People are growing and people are faded, people are surprising and hopeless. All this and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. <br /> <br /> This film has made me a lot of people and a sense of pride and I believe that this movie will play a special role. Every prison in the world needs to be compulsory every Saturday - it will touch your grace. Rating: from 10 to 10. <br /> PS: I admit it: the joy on the final stage was tearing.
