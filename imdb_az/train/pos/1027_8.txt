<br /> <br /> I've read these ideas several times. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I liked them all. Davis was the fifth most valuable person in silver. That's not a big deal. However, his character (General Hammond) left at the end of seven seasons, and Anderson's character, Colonel O'Neill, went to the office and the quality of the series suddenly dropped off. <br /> <br /> I do not know if Hammond is more important than me or I'm going to go back to **** after seven seasons. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons though were awesome. The movie Stargate first seemed mediocre, but it turned out to be, though it's not the original intent, but a brilliant setup for the series. First, I believe you watch the movie, then watch the first season of the TV series, and then watch the movie again (a new assessment will be around for the second time) and then <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series, it was not good, but that's not good. <br /> <br /> After finishing this series, make sure to follow the Stargate: Spin off series from Atlantis. <br /> <br /> Do 7-18-08: Don S. Davis died just a few weeks ago. This is a great loss.
