<br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <strong> is claimed. It's just a favorite movie. In the 80's and '90s, I saw little girls watching more strange' adult dresses'. Because they did not wear nappies because they were more provocative. In some cases, there is nothing provocative about a diaper. (just a joke) I read that the film's description and the place where it was called pedophile would have watched it. This is sick. Look at me, if you're watching it and you're worried about it, maybe you should look into your mind and try to figure out why you're upset. An innocent movie made up of a movie parody. B.B. All of the films were parody, there was nothing else. Today's parodies / spoofs are graphics in nature and are almost pornographic scenes and pretty ugly language. Should this be more horrible? I can watch the trouble, but sometimes it takes children's stories and makes them parody foolish. That's what's falling under your skin. Since 1926, they have a great movie (I do not know), but how do we know that these silent films are PORNOGRAPHIC? This 'Prohibited Hollywood Code of Pre-Code era movies' is so bad and bad. Will they not do such a wicked thing in these days? (note the sarcasm)
