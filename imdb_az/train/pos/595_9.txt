When John Wayne took the story of Alamo, he built a complete Alamo in Brackettsville, Texas, which is still there and attracts tourists. During this standout, the screen will be a set for future Alamo interpretations. Someone like Sea Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton said this was done in this century. <br /> <br /> However, I say Alamo: Fifteen days Glory is the best Alamo story I've ever seen. John Wayne's movie is a good thing to be wrong, but John Wayne's movie is a redone to fill the screen features of John Wayne. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here, and his rollicking boundary character is a beautiful interpretation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can confirm that before Professor Lon Tinkle read a book about The Alamo from The Wayne, <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was right for young people, as well as Tinkle, who was also alive after Wayne's filming. William Barrett Travis, was a slave of accidentally a idealist freedom fighter. Returning to the day has seen no irritation in anyone. Travis's hyperactive sex drive is something that has not been studied or not. <br /> <br /> <strong> The largest city in the Caucasus. <br /> <br /> Alamo's hero was convinced, but his career in front of Alamo was an argument. He was a smuggler, a slave trader. But her heroism denied her death. No clue is in Arnessin's description, and I've seen Bowie on the screen. And, of course, Bowie prepared the knife according to its characteristics. This guy needed such a weapon. However, Alamo: For the past three days, Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, the main creature of glory, left the rebellious rebellious North American, who came to Mexico at the invitation of Mexico. Unfortunately, Americans have come up with preconceived ideas about freedom that freed the at least white people who are not far from the south. Ra√∫l Julia plays Santa Anna, a more controversial figure in Mexican history. <br /> <br /> This film is a screw performance by Lorne Greene, shortly after General Sam Houston. Greene was not too old for my Houston concept but really old, Houston was at an early age in 1836, yet it was not Texas's patriarch. However, within the limits set by him, Greene is doing a fine job. <br /> <br /> See John Wayne's version for romantic interpretation of the Alamo story, but I recommend this movie for its historical content at a high level.
