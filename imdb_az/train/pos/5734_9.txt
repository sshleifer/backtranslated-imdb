I think it's a great admirer of David Lynch's works, because it provides the audience with a unique look with typical "Lynch Elements". After seeing most of his works, I thought I could guess Lynch's next step. I was dead. Dumbland, David Lynch, is something I can not imagine. Still, after getting rid of the first shock, I began to think about this very modest main character, and stressed that all the absurdities, cruelty, cruelty and hatred presented here reflected the truth and distorted it. There are things we do not really care about in our lives because they are either abominable or terrible, but we are surrounded by Dumbland, so I have the courage to pay attention to these pieces and pieces. This is not a movie that is laughing in a strange, distorting sense of humor, but it is merely a reflection of everything that we do not want to observe with simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Accept it, do not love it. Only there. Finally, if you are careful enough, you'll find Lynch typical elements. I recommend it for tolerant people!
