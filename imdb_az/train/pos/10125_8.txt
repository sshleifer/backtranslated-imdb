This film is a great start to the trilogy of the Miikes triad society and the trilogy first. The trio's films are thematic, and if you get closer, these topics are really understood in all movies. The Shinjuku Triad Society tries to prevent the kid from joining a group of extraterrestrials towards the sibling of Tokyo's Yakuza. The kid's brother is a lawyer, and as the film progresses, the need for a triad network grows. The film takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore extremely fierce and tough. Miike has done a lot worse, but because it's a serious movie, it's going to be very difficult. As always, there are many perverted, mostly homosexuals. Film is not a typical gangster film in many ways, but with a great driver and true flawlessness. If you only see the Miikes movie (Ichi, Killer, Fudoh, etc.), you need to check these films as they are some kind of compromise between the aggressive top styles and its more serious aspects in their films, as seen in other trilogy films. As always, Miike has at least two scenes that you will never forget (see and understand for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
