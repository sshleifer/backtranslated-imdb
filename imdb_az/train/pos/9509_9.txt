Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. Indeed, I do not know how slowly everyone will say that. I thought the speed was perfect. The film is a hit-man / killer who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman) about Michael Sullivan, who is perfectly played by Tom Hanks. He completes this job, but it does, because Rooney pays home and helps him financially. He was nothing, and Mr Rooney gave him everything. However, she is in a difficult situation when she does not know that her children are her job, and when someone is witnessing a bloody murder. And when a brutality arose, he left with his son and retreated with revenge. They peel off the abbots and closer and closer. They are a perfect team. Hanks always does a great job like Jude Law, who plays his creepy role as always. This drama shows a beautiful story and shows how the 1930s are.
