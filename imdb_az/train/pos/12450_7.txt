This short (<90 minutes) work was leased and monitored. The sad movie meets with the best treatment and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, is a "Creative Adviser". Character and those who love it are respected. Spiegel's direction is the best thing he has ever done, and casting has done very well. Alexandra Staden is incredibly physically perfect, with the original Jim Holdaway adapting to the modesty. Find a terrible one by throwing him! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope Tarantino & co. I will continue to be more involved in the series - it's interesting to see who want to be Willie Garvin, who is unlucky!
