His chosen films are brilliant for the basic 'longing' of production (in the sets or simulacres of the films it interprets) and its delivering! But if you want Freud, you know that Zizek acquired Lacan's version. This should not be confused with Lacan itself. As usual, Zizek presents gusto and convincing ideas. Rushub is a very small job and therefore can be more gusto than the actual content. Cinematically, it's a stone. From a psychological point of view, it will have everyone's (Freud, Lacanians and Jungians) clinging to their heads and having all the convictions to reach the popcorn. Zizek is a phenomenon and pop.
