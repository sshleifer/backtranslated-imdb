I've seen this movie again and see how close the novel is, if we do not see Cary's (Leslie Howard) childhood part. Taking into account the fact that there are so many things on the screen at that moment [not a lot in the novel] Mildred [Bette Davis] has been very well informed about the nature of the character. I wanted to help everyone who falls into this movie, on the other hand. I read that Maugham was asked to write a novel for sale, but when he started at the studio, he began to cry and did not finish more than a few mistakes, and the whole project was poured out. We can say that Romance is written in the heart and that the film is a good fit for at least part of it.
