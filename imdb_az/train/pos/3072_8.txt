Panic is a hidden small ship of the film - we can do it with great pleasure to know that Henry Bromell is a better writer / director in the first half an hour. <br /> <br /> The film is set up slowly with a quiet, devastating scene taken by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most noteworthy children's actress. for a long time, as David Dorfman, son of Macy, thinks his lines are completely unwritten thoughts. Rich and rewarding, this movie will remain for a long time after the credits have been rolled.
