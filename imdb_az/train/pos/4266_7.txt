First, half an hour ago, he looked at a black-and-white television in a small Samoan village and thought he was excited. Now we've seen it for the second time, and soon after, I do not find it funny. I do not find any cunning thing anymore. <br /> <br /> It's 1945 and Fred MacMurray is dead to enter into one of the armed forces. He lit a lamp in the excavated excavation and a genie appeared to give him some pleasure. (Ho hum, of course, but the entry is far better, fantasy is pretty lively.) MacMurray says he wants to be in the army. In addition to Poof and Washington's soldiers, June Haver and Joan Leslie enter the USO, especially hot and inviting, wearing many lace or lavender covers. Washington sends MacMurray to the enemy - not Hessians, who speak German with red, but to spy English. The Hessians are besieged in Bierstube and read Vaterland's many fun drinking sounds of consciousness, "The white wine is winier and the Rhine water Rhinier / bratwurst mellower, and the yellow hair yellower Frouleins jucier / and the walnut steps are goosier." Characteristics are as good as the best of Riga. Otto Preminger is a suspicious and evil Hessian general. "You know, Heidelberg, there are 1 in 241 against you, but I'm scared." <br /> <br /> I can not go too long with these fantasies, but these are totally funny and words. When MacMurray wants to be on the seafront, Columbus is full of wind and is presented as a fantasy big opera. "Do not you know that a sailing west knows / is a valuable investment? And you think, who provides the means, but the Queen of Queens Isabella?" Looking at the new world, someone said he looked great. <br /> <br /> "Even though I do not seem to like," said Columbus, "but this place will be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> Anyway, everything is finally corrected, drunk enough and MacMurray is winding up with the right girl in the corridor. <br /> <br /> I sounded very sweet, but it was cute. Kids will enjoy the smoke and magic and dark love story. The adults will get a stroke of the more difficult elements of the story (who are the Hessians?), While they are not college graduates, so they stay with Legerdemain and say, "Wow! Awesome!" They say.
