ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) As many people, I always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive "Odd Couple". From the mid-1970s on television series, their incredible job was a high-level signal for television ... easily flipping scenes and screen versions of the fairy tale. Nevertheless, how do you go wrong with pairing with Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau? Matthau, like Oscar, is a particularly good form. Lemmon, if you've seen the outstanding performance of Tony Randall before, goes a bit like getting used to Gilbert. The scenario is good ... definitely the best of Neil Simon. (Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most influential writers in the American theater). Storyline is simple: Felix is ​​a clean, strange and moving Oscar with his new wife, and shepherd who needs money to pay for alimony payments. Their correction is like a normal marriage, resulting in some fun tiffs and spats. A very entertaining and a few great linen.
