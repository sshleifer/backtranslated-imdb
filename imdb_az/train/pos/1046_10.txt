Probably one of my favorite films of all time, a story devoted to selflessness, devotion and noble work, but it is not promising or boring. Although I have seen 15 or more times in the last 25 years, it will never be old. Paul Lucas's performance brings tears to my eyes and Bette Davis is one of the few really sympathetic roles. As the grandmother says, they seem to be more "dressed for children," but they are more entertaining to watch. It is convincing and surprising that the mother is slowly waking up in the world and on her own. If there were a lot of thumbs, all of this movie would be "up".
