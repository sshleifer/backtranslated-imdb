Despite the perfect trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was looking forward to disappointing the movie because I did not take great reviews. <br /> <br /> Some movies have left a movie to show how beautiful Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the whole film, every character is convincing. The romantic moments between cruise character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia, are realistic and closer to tears (probably because they are really real to each other). <br /> <br /> The Vanilla Sky movie will blend you in the last third of the movie and have little chance of ending it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, David Aames makes a strange feeling of sadness, shock and emotional feelings. <br /> <br /> This movie is intellectual and needs attention. <br /> <br /> This is not difficult, because your chances will be completely filmed and you will not get your eyes off the screen for a second. <br /> <br /> Generally I'm watching the movie. But Vanilla Sema still remains on the agenda after watching. I recommend everyone who wants a change from simple, shallow movies.
