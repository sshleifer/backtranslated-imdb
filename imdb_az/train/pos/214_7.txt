Former Voodyard team Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the best known, but they hated each other. More than 20 years later, they agree to come together for a special television ... but still learn that they hate each other. Willy's only brother / agent (Richard Benjamin) is trying to work together. <br /> <br /> A great hit of the day and Oscars for the best supporting actor of George Burns. I (somewhat) liked it. This is a non-stop liner written by Neil Simon. Some were funny, but Willy and Alin's stranginess made jokes. I also did not like Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor, and something about it flipped me wrong. Here, too, his character is so casual that you're sick of it quickly. All this was fun. Burns is a great deal of effortlessly switching off a liner, and even Matthau has adapted it. Their verbal battles are the best sequel of the film. And Benjamin Willy's nephew is very good as he tries to work with each other. For me Burns is just worth seeing. This leap career started a great deal, and two years later there was another hit with "Oh God". So this is good. Only good - not good. Matthau's character truly loves this difficulty. I'll give it 7.
