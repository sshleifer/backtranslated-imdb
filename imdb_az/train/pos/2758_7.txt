This movie is about a tough friendship between a businessman and a man with Down's syndrome. <br /> <br /> Characteristic development in this movie is good. We believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects the family, and Georges is a "innocent man" who needs love and care from a "normal" society. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes of the movie emphasize the desire of Georges to be abandoned by their family and behave as normal behavior. person. Repeatedly played song reinforces this message. The film shows that people with mental disabilities are good-natured. We treat them with distinction and indifference, and emphasize Georges' presentation to the waiters in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> We and those with mental disabilities can be very happy to share these people with the world. <br /> I was emotionally exposed to movies and characters. It is a movie touching for good-natured spirits.
