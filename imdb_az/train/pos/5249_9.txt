Choosing a SNL skate for a movie was better than the last one. <br /> <br /> There was something inevitable about sexual content. <br /> <br /> Sexual content could have been an inevitable thing, but it could have happened. Because of the restrictions on live television, I learned not to wait. I suppose that more than the producers would think of the risk of Leisure Suit Larry ... <br /> <br /> Of course, I can not have a PG-13 movie that does not reach the heights of more successful predecessors <br /> <br /> but I do not doubt that this will strike ... (Tim Meadows is inclined to do the characters, which disturbs me with other SNL alumni who are very concerned about me)
