I read that Jessie Matthews approached and played with Fred Astaire. Jessie Matthews has never been to the edge of the pool to make any American music movie at the top. If it were to unite for this movie, it would have been a single lifetime event. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry that Damsel, who is in trouble, is going for everything. Fred Astaire, story and author P.G. adapted to the screen by. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen comedy and songs by Gershwin Brothers. <br /> <br /> There's nothing you can ask for more in this movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from a leading lady. Although Ginger Rogers has shot several films from Fred Astaire, Angered Damsel is a unique Astaire movie without Roger when they are a team. Young Joan Fontaine was thrown at Astaire against this. <br /> <br /> His symbol does not have one of the bites made by Ginger Rogers in these films. All that needs to be done is sweet and thirsty. He does not give anything musical. And if you wanted to evaluate all the dance stars of Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine would come out. A poor woman is just horrible when looking at the number of things. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby is playing with music, along with Emperor Waltz, while Fontaine is not a musical thing to do. <br /> <br /> It's a colorful situation, and I think you're doing something really good in this situation. P.G's fragrant green green English village Wodehouse is actually extracted from this VHS. I especially remembered Astaire and Fontaine in the expensive garden. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen, <br /> <br /> P.G. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wodehouse's aristocracy, with Constance Collier, has the most powerful gamut and once loved Montagu as a wonderful person in the film. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit of a terrible Damsel is a foggy day, the most famous song in the UK capital since the fall of the London Bridge. <br /> <br /> Best of all, Fred Astaire is one of the finest, elegantly designed, one of the songs that can stand in London and even after. <br /> <br /> Young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, classic, classic honey, classic dance, classic comedy. Who can ask for more?
