This film was opened for poverty in the first weeks. Meena Kumari died and only the people were rolling. All in India Radio, especially Inhi LogoN, have played very often that, though recognizing their beauty, I was ill! <br /> Yes, it took years to do all this. Because the marriage was very unhappy, and Kamal Amroi was forced to earn a living for filmmaking; it's not surprising to look at the skeletons and dresses! Just listen to Lata's voice, not Meena Kumari's age and sick. The re-recorded songs, such as Chalo dildar chalo, have the young voice of Inhi logoN 50. Only one can find Ghulam Mohammed's songs that are not included in the movie; I would like to hear a few songs and publish them. Recently, in an interview with Lata (2007), Ghulam Mohammed Madan Mohan was named as one of the best composers outside of Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Do not forget to also see difficult singing songs, very unusual actors. Raj Kumar has only a short shot from the middle distance and you only see the possibility of Meena Kumari. Kemal Amrohi made an opportunity for the necessity and paid attention to the stars and the moon. Any other movie, this song would have been closer to each other. <br /> <br /> I would like to beg this as it is the most beautiful film ever. Baraat (old), Devdas (old versions), Bandini, Do Bigha Zameen, Garam Weather, Support, Guddi, Aan, Pyasa, Kagaz ke Phool, Sahib Bibi aur Qulam, Qabulillah, Abhimaan, Guide, Sujatha, Bombay ka Babu, Daag , Parineeta (old), Umrao Jaan and others. And if you value music better than the price, just enjoy the list with the Patchy's Peakeza, but do not miss out on the above. .
