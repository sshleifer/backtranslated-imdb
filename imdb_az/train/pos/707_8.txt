I say honestly and have not seen a lot of independent films, but I thought this was a very good one. Direction and kinematography have been drawn without a deviation. These angles, parameters, and lighting have successfully led to the nightmare that successfully captured the main character. Many unpleasant and memorable images in the film remain in your mind for a long time (always a sign of a good director).
