This is a great "little" movie. I say "small" because there are no hundred or nine fireflakes or many bursts as in John Woo. Great speeches by Roy Scheider and three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer appears to have more chances with smaller products today. The film is very easy to watch, the story is much more than a washing machine - it gets worse just like the thickness of the part instead of everything going around and around. Nice finish, very positive. I can not read Elmore Leonard, but it can not be so different from the movie because it's FELEL as I watched an Elmore Leonard movie.
