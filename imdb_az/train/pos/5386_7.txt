This movie was played very well in 1932 and probably will not work today, because its style is a bit old fashioned and flawless. <br /> <br /> However, if you are a person who respects older Hollywood movies like me, you can have a little fun with the movie, and why you can use it - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> Problem gestures are found in a ward. In this large room there are half-flat beds waiting for women's birth, but doctors worry about possible complications (Yikes - a parent really traumatizes mothers!). Like the "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island" Episode, each mother has her own custom story. With so many extreme and naked stories, you need to stop the blasphemy. <br /> <br /> In one of the films he says, "There is a father." You do not see the mother, but it's a very nervous father and a funny relief. But it was very nice here. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden were upset. Loretta was sent to a prison hospital - she probably killed some terrible guys. You do not know exactly what happened, but you think you are trying to force yourself! However, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison and her husband was herself and her supporters as much as she could. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a very scary man. Hamster's main instincts - really, really bad and alcoholic hamster! She is very funny and worth seeing in most of the film. When I learn that he can not earn money to sell his twin, I love drinking his hot glass of hot water! <br /> <br /> The Hollywood style, which is delayed in the film, has a typical Hollywood style change. It should be emphasized. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who is really a baby. Surprisingly, they put women back in the same cafe, like women waiting to give birth! A crazy woman you've lost a baby some time ago goes down the psychiatric unit. She claims she is a baby. Then she runs again and really gets one of the kids! <br /> <br /> There are more stories, but that's what I've mentioned. As I said, this is a soap opera of the species and is very entertaining and quite sad in a few stories. Particularly, he has done endurance, heart and has done extremely well. Especially, Farrell and Aline MacMahon have been a few good performances, such as the chief nurse. Generally, a very good movie - and a few years later I did not think it was necessary to recreate the movie (typical for Warner Brothers).
