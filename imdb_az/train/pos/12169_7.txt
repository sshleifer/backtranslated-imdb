On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets with the great dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) at the bar, many drink and wake up in the bed next morning. Her future mother-in-law calls her and tells her fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) to come to her apartment, and she in desperation calls Becky to leave her in a hurry. She soon learned that Becky was Karen's brother, who was whipped and then in the preparation of a wedding dinner. It is a comedy comedy. The first attraction of this film is, of course, the trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, are incredibly beautiful players and extremely bright and Jason Lee has strange comic, good performances. Many smiles throughout the story, but there are some scenes that are really cheerful. For example, when Paul Becky found his bed; when he finds his paintings; in many cases his imagination; In the adolescence, while trying to get and receive explanations regarding pocket medicine; Most of the neighbors' scenes, the minister; When Karen called her store; or police found a suspect in the attack. I can take into account many other scenes, but I can improve reader lease or take this movie and be very entertaining. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?>)
