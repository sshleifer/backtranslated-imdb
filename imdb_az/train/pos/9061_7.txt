I liked the movie very much. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a few times as a child and enjoyed having a movie about the book. <br /> <br /> I was sitting at the age of 11 and 8 for a child and a girl, talk to the girl who came to see the movie. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it is possible to avoid any problems for several days. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> so it should have had a "dillery" line referring to Woody's private part ... the only shock for me (and at the moment you heard the audience's noise) in the movie) ... There is no clue why it was filmed; it did not add anything to the real movie, except for the shock / gasp factor ... besides, it's a pretty good movie. Nice to see all the Pepsi girls.
