The film was better than the other reviewer. A nice family movie. For a while, the journey has a fun fantasy. The story takes place around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally found a way to travel in the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, no one believes in trying to explain his losses. She is a girl who is related to her age and can help her daughter in many ways. She can help her relationship with her father for a long time. This is a Hallmark movie reminiscent, so give it a chance and decide for yourself. Children targeted approximately 6-12 years (perhaps some older), and PG or G were highly rated. I'm an adult who can appreciate a wonderful "family" movie - I'm not the other reviewer.
