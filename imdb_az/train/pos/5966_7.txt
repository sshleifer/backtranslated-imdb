In fact, I never sat on the metal satellites and things, but I think this movie is played in this kind of game. Of course, a movie does not really matter or really appreciate it, but fulfills the purpose of entertainment while playing it. The story has a metal band burned at their hotel, one of their fans said it's a dream dream and the group band begins going on a killing spree outside the cemetery. Yes, a little "Elm Street Nightmare" is here. Freddy did not betray a girl in a car before. There was another movie with a heavy metal band, but it was very different when they had a city like a group of children and how they played them naked. This is simply a group of supporters, first helping to kill the soul, and then try to stop it. Nothing is so terrifying, because I do not remember all this. The scene I most clearly remember is the scene of a girl wearing headphones and then exposed by the band's aggression by some creatures. Nothing is good, it's a nice time filler.
