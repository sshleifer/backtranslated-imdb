The film, though slightly "thinner" after reading the book, has yet to become one of the biggest films. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". He is doing a great job of expressing his feelings from the book. Many films are on the mothers night as well as with the sense of the book.
