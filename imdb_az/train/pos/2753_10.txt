My most-loved movie! I've seen a lot of movies, but it shoots them all! Spectacular, beautiful story. You will begin to love the "normal" caring gentleman. Although he is an actor, he is also a very nice person. And more importantly, you teach the people with Down Syndrome to be respectful and distinguished.
