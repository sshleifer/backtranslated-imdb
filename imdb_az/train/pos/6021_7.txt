According to today's standards, this is not necessarily a so-called "classic" film, but it is still worth seeing. The main reason for this is that you have to be aware of the fact that the 60's is ideological and ideals of good. <br /> <br /> I've seen it, but the movie in SUNY Geneseo's English literary class seems to be a trivial composition of the first 60 characters, but the film is far away from being somewhere. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, if you leave the movie dissatisfied and mixed, the film has done this: it has conveyed an unhappy appearance to the future, which makes you feel unreliable and angry. Perhaps this was a feeling that the film was intended to be an example of a youth. <br /> <br /> So, Zabriskie Point can not describe a very good (or interesting) story and at the same time its symbols can be unilaterally and predictable. At the same time, this kind of clich√©, too, is a very good move to overcome the necessity of sharing between Mark and Dariya. Even the anti-corruption requirement is inaccurate as a gov- ernment against which they are opposed.
