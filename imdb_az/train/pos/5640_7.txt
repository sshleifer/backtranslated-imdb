I really think that this movie is great personally. But there is a reduction in each film. Now, some may have not watched Hilary Duff's "voice uplifting", but if you think about it, this means that these two shows are very similar. In "Brave New Girl", Holly wants to get into the Haverty Conservatory badly. Terry's "Raising Your Voice" L.A. He wants to go to his conservatory (he does not remember the conservatory's name there). Both are in the music field and both must read at the end of the semester. These two movies look like each other. Although I personally like the "Brave New Girl", it's better to say "Raise your voice".
