There is nothing to compare the person that Pat Robertson is bad and that the program is bad, there is nothing to compare the bad and the righteous. The devil's definition is contrary to evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will say good and bad things! He does not know that he has fulfilled Bible prophecy. If you do not know God and you do not know him now, okay. He still loves you, but when you finally deliver your knee to God, and you will be, it will be too late for you. Allah will not send hell to anyone, even you! You will go there and your part will determine it! May Allah have mercy on you and give you the experience of a Sham path. 700 Club and Pat Robertson's ministry is one of the reasons I'm here. Alcoholism, adultery, and, incidentally, God has reached the television screen and used it for Pat Robertson and thanked God! You have the right to say, but you have no right to curse your words. May Allah have mercy on you.
