TIllman Jr. is a drama about the first African American Navy Diving (Gooding Jr.), reaching its goals despite being a regrettable coach and definitely a regrettable coach. The scenario is not bad, but sometimes a bit overwhelming, but the direction and mobility are the first degree, and this movie inspires you to do what it does. DeNiro's management liked it, though it was not as good as its masterwork (taxi driver, cross-operated father, and others), as well as other good performances like the Comedy King or Angel Heart. DeNiro here is always convincing and convincing, a good performance, Gooding Jr is not bad, it's definitely one of its best performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
