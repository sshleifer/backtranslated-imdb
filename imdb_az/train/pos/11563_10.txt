I watched a few years after the television series and did not care for me at first. Then, the memory of the series went back over and over again, and I found it to be absolutely cheerful. According to Neil Simon's staged play, it is not too "open" for the big screen, and this is one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are bright and supportive as Oscar and Gilbert, especially as John Fielder, as Vinnie. Even now, certain moments make me laugh at the tears - Felix tells me tonight's evening dinner in the middle of the game, Oscar's reach, and Feliks around the apartment, Giggins 'Pigeon Sisters' Felix's stories and, of course, the legendary cafeteria scene (later, when Nora Ephron "sees Harry Sally"). Razor has a sharp dialogue. When children think of Gilbert's overdose, Oscar says: "They can be vitamins! It can be the most healthy in the hall!". Fantastic!
