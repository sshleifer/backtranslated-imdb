I saw this movie for the first time at high school when I was in the first class, and the movie remained with the years. It's not about voice, no kinematography, even dialogue and a bit of ill-treatment, but the message behind that is most important. If you're a teenager and still have a child at a secondary school, it's not a bad thing, but it's a problem. The tones of the girls I know are now children, and I think they have never watched this great movie and they did not clarify if they had seen it. About not having the chance to have sex. Any girl can be pregnant for the first time. This is not myth. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> NO DEATH!
