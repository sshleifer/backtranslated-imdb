Russell, my fav is great in this movie. But it covers a large number of movies, human passion and sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexual is addressed and respected. The film realizes that the viewer's tolerance towards other people is a way to get rid of humanity. A great love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat their scenes again. Although no one is in love, it is possible to work with those people. All the characters are dumped and perfectly described.
