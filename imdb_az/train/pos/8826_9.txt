<br /> <br /> A woman, entering a small cafe, has fun with a rational rectangular idea in this ridiculous situation. Suddenly, musicians play and one person begins to read the headline, dancing with the music comedians on the table, the scene appears ordinary, but most customers and two musicians can withstand. gestures At first, temporarily, customers were reading pieces of paper in the palm of their hand with breaks from the song (very bad, but). <br /> <br /> Why is it that ???????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????? woman is a miracle. The answer emerged as if the soloist's jacket was opened and seen on the deck - just before the explosive surface ... <br /> <br /> Even if you do not hold the lyrics (potentially ironically), the situation - the perfect speeches should give you an exclamation ... I would like to see it again!
