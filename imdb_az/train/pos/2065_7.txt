Fearful Symmetry is a welcome episode with a few errors. The first thing about the episode is that it is located at the base of the Highland Air Force in the city of Idaho, south-west. One of the seasons 'Deep Throat' occurs near the Ellens Air Base in southwestern Idaho. I think the Air Force bases are one and the same, but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, Zeynal Zeynal's son, reminds me of strange, old school teachers. They should love children at one time, just how you can imagine. Just as it should show more care to animals at one point. I liked the concept of episode, but I felt some discrepancies. If aliens can not kidnap people and keep them safe, why not put the animal in the right place? And do foreigners now have difficulty returning pets? I do not buy Muller's theory of space problem with space-time stability. As if there was a specialist in this regard. And I thought Jayne Atkinson did not act as Willa Ambrose. Apart from these nitpicks, this episode is still an interesting definition of the animal DNA and the product of human DNA.
