I watched this movie on television and admired the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a proper movie and you can watch it for African beauty and of course Mccomb. At that time, I was thrilled to watch this movie, and then I'm working for VCD of this movie, but I can not find it. The Greater African Shiites make his film look and merely limit the size and grace of these animals. All parts of the audience can watch this movie, especially children will enjoy this movie. However, some scenes that drive Mccomb strengthen parental guidance for this movie. It's a nice and fun movie for everyone.
