If this film frustrates you (like us, and others from the theater), it is a disappointment. The film is faithfully presented to Bettie Page because it was probably his strange and naturalistic career as a pinup queen of the universe. <br /> <br /> There are many reasons to see this movie as its sudden qualities, the sudden separation from religious change and the naked and captive modeling are biographically clear, but it is difficult to understand. At least W. Mott Hopfel III (tailor-made and tailor-made with fashionable tailors) is a loyal booth in the 1950s under the direction of Mary Harron, an unusual cinema with some of the stranger performances . <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol's most underrated supporting actors, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak, to avoid Oscar-winning and technically challenging lead performance including). <br /> <br /> Ms. Mol has a few scenes entirely naked and most adorned in an incredible time and in "specialty" suits (magnificently dressed by costume designer John A. Dunn), but he compassionately maintained the taste of Bettie Page's tidy body. <br /> <br /> Ms. A graduate of Molli's page, progressive little "bad" slogans and pupils' toy scenes, is a truly beautiful actress with full control of the artist. <br /> <br /> The scenario brings us to the US in the 1950s, where legitimate suppression of sexually abused, legitimate theft and harassment of pornographic brands seems to be a legitimate suppression. 50's in New York, seamlessly complies with newsline shooting. The Miami 50s come in a super saturated, 16mm-style color. <br /> <br /> The real Bettie page captures us, smiles and comes out of us, but it's light, but not dangerous and just insulting. <br /> <br /> And from this technical point of view, excellent biopicin should remain at least.
