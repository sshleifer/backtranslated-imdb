... it should not miss the classic one, which is a great dialogue and scene. In a beautiful story, in a comic richness-legged situation, Mel Brooks is not a bad result, maybe not perfect but funny; D Not rated, BS. Look, then look at something like the final destination (2009) and tell me Life Stinks deserve the same price. If you do this, I do not think we can be friends XD At this point, I recommend the Fourth Season of Curb Your Enthusiasm to every Brooks fan;) Against the ignorant ideas of inchworms! I have to draw 10 lines from here to post a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P.
