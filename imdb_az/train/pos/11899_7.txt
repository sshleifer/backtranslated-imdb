Those who make such a product to such a degree have probably never seen the production of George Balanchy, or the disregard of Macaulay Culkin's star's failure to influence their decisions. Atlanta Ballet, from 1960 to 1980, was quite successful at being the first ballet company to allow this product to be played, and many times onstage, unlike the New York City Ballet. The readers are convinced that the film is a very precise indicator of this production, and that the use of a child with a limited dance cap is not a cheap stunt he has imagined to exhibit Culkin; He had the idea of ​​using a child in this position, because it was the idea of ​​using a child for Marie. <br /> <br /> This is a deliberate film; in a way similar to Laurence Olivier's "Othello". As in the full movie, the sets of stage production were expanded to a size of a movie, but less artificial and the ballet was shot with simple simple closeups, and the "fun video" was featured in the overrated Maurice Sendak-Carroll Ballard version in 1986, without breaking rapidly. In this 1993 movie, there are only two wrong steps. One is the addition of entertaining and absolutely unnecessary sound effects (mouse trails, children "Dasselmeyer", etc.). <br /> <br /> These sound effects are not heard at any stage in any "Nutcracker" production and have been set as a cheap concession just to shake up a complicated audience who is not interested in watching the ballet in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another wrong step is Macaulay Culkin's nuts makeup looks totally funny. Instead of wearing a big mask on the screen (Balanchine production is always the same as when playing on the field), Culkin is really prepared as a toy - it looks like a leather cap, white wig, a beard and a beard. She also made her face a bit, and her worry about her makeup is still a well-known form of American, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr's "Wizard" (though she did a great job of the makeup movie). <br /> <br /> Compared with Baryshnikov's spark-and-shooter, Baryshnikov's sparking mask shows how good it is - when Baryshnikov's head was dropped, the jaws were actually moving. <br /> <br /> The Macaulay Culkin version is pretty good, of course, except for Culkin himself, as does his dance, and does not mean even being spectacular. (Sugar Plum Fairy and his Cavalier Balanchine are outstanding dance roles in the production of "The Nutcracker"). The colors of the movie, though, can be somewhat brighter, since it's a fantasy. Bright and adapt it to the choreography of Tchaikovsky's "The Sleeping Beauty" ballet music in addition to having the sequence of the faithful - Marie filtered down, falling asleep on the sofa and Drosselmeyer "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> running out of the film, or even those who despise (or hate), two major failure, even though they should have a chance. First of all, as it looks when it hears that in Culkinin is good.
