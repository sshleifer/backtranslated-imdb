September 11, 2001, millions were killed; but 2,819 life ended in a particularly horrible way. They had to destroy single duty buildings, but more importantly, people were victims of an aircraft kidnapped by extremists. <br /> <br /> This film captures a deep glimpse of four people who died in a catastrophic event and a man who lost his life. <br /> <br /> Charlie Fineman (played by Adam Sandler), an old dentist living in New York, lost her husband and three children on September 11 while traveling to Los Angeles. When it comes to unbearable incidents with events, it finally contacts everyone who remembers their past lives; his relatives and his best friend (Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon and Mike Bender). He totally denies and does his best to forget his past life. It continues until Fineman does not remember her old college friend Alan Johnson (played by Don Cheadle). The two sides begin to grow, but Finman believes Johnson's help in helping people from their old lives. Slowly, however, Fineman regains his trust in Johnson. <br /> <br /> Alan Johnson's life is misleading despite all this happening. He is a person who helps to start dental practice (dentist). One day, his name, Donna Remar (played by Saffron Burrows), said that a patient was trying to move her and wanted to have oral sex for her. Since this is a married man with two children, Dr. An unpleasant surprise for Johnson. When he comes home from work on a special day, he sees his ex-wife (Fineman) and tries to put him down. <br /> <br /> <strong> Despite the fact that Fineman does not know who he is, he fails but gets another opportunity and agrees to get Finmani to reach the coffee. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie is its use as a motive. One of Fineman's physiological seats is music, especially Springsteen and other classic rock artists. <br /> <br /> When you find something unpleasant when you want to open the story or talk about things, puts it into the headphone and drowns the world with its music. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, I think: how can I cope with the loss of my family? How will I deal with such tragic events? Too often think of something. We always think that you will be there, and we invite you, do not want to, and we often accept it. We realize how important it is when it's too late; and a blow like this can destroy a person physically, emotionally and physically. I really do not know how to handle such a thing. Can I face the problem, can I cope with it, or move in my life, or if I let the headphones out of the world?
