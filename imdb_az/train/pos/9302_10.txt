Most of the comments were positive, but I want to add that viewers should pay attention to the groups. The designer has beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture, etc. Along with it, many fine art deco treatments have been used. We need to pay attention. The film is characterized by a very rich characterization and symbolism. All gangsters were released - it was like seeing old friends and that was a cure. The dialogue was sometimes fun, but sometimes stilted and I suppose it should be in this way. This is a movie buff movie. It was made by people, for people who love average. Do not miss them.
