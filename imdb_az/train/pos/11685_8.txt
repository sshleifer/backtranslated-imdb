You find this movie really funny because a boy kills a black comedian (Chris Rock) and returns to his 50-year-old white men body. His behavior should change and he does not know that he will continue to act as before. He listens to rap music, sings, and plays the stereotypical part of the city's black man. The real humor in this movie saw this behavior united with the black society.
