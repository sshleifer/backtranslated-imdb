Most of the classic films of the past 60s did not keep the audience from worrying and confronting them. He did not lose his strength in the Cold Blood. His use has still forced the audience to think. There are some complaints about Truman Kapoten's non-fictional stories about non-fiction novels. This can be true, but this is a situation where absolute lack of uncertainty is completely deprived of the film. Particularly, considering a simple and manipulative moral drama today, seeing a movie with a persuasive political voice that fills the viewers with the need to review their views. To be honest, I am not sure if I am convinced of the movie's central message, but I am surprised at her courage. <br /> <br /> Even if you agree with the death penalty, you are very happy with the movie. The two potential-driven activities are intense. Scott Wilson (still one of the most groundless actors) is hesitant about being a nihilist leader who uses his voice to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also hesitant about being more obedient with two consciences. His character has a clear voice, but is horrified to go against Wilsona (which is a very good homoerotic subtext in his character). Cinematography is awesome, bright, but flawless, and really, the audience is watching a documentary. Add another classic account from Quincey Jones and you have a workbook. (9/10)
