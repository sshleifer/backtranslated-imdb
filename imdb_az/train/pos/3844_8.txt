When you read the summary of this movie you think that this movie is a strange movie, and in some cases Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) is being destroyed by vision and hallucination. Gerard Meetings are gentle tips (and little or many) about what happens as the story continues, and is a great fun to try and understand the spectrum used by the viewer. Despite the use of symbolism and a few instruction to end the film, it keeps a very high level of excitement throughout the film and does not dig for a minute. This is largely due to great performances by Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and Paul Verhoeven. His directorial style is clear, and looking at the different aspects, De De Vierde Man can say that he is a typical Verhoeven film. This is typical for people who are familiar with her Dutch films, because it's only talent and the graphics are a talent to say the same things and a great story, not because it's typical for people who are familiar with American films because of violent scenes. People watching Verhoevens' American films appear short, can say that they have no ability to describe a good story and pay attention only to blood and sex. Some people think that, though, I think that every film is a very talented director who wants to convey a deeper message. Although not a good movie, Hollow Man (his latest American film) is an example of Verhoevé's science fiction splatter films, and maybe companies should rely more on him and invite him to take on more movies. You need it. Only watch Dutch movies. Not only do they need certain freedoms, but also show that they have a remarkable talent. <br /> <br /> De Vierde Man is a step closer to Hollywood and, of course, is the best. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8
