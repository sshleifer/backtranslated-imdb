It's not a movie to be protected from war, it's a battle at an elite level. These are the elite troops who know what they do and are proud of them. Even if he is a pacifist, he still loses his skill and defeats his enemies even if they are against being capable. Films are slow and extremely uncomfortable, and in many cases no warfare as modern movies, war movies can go more and more. Even though you have killed yourself on a personal level, this is a pity in other ways. This is more than a man's film. You do not want to miss something after you start watching. The thoughts and feelings of men in the film are not the story itself, nor is it a war or an exciting story. <br /> <br /> If you go into warfare, see the programs you read about SAS, and so on. DO NOT WANT THIS MOVIE !!!!! <br /> <br /> Sean Connery in 196, 49th Parallel (1941), The Star and The Dead (1958) and Cliff Robertson. All this shows a war on an unusual and personal level. Enjoy!
