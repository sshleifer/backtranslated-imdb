You just saw the Australian premiere of the Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. As mentioned in program notes - It is a great pleasure, totally circulating, touching, entertaining, dramatically and harshly meaningful. More satisfied. I believe that the rest of the festival movies go to this level of entertainment and I hope to see more Chinese movies to be screened in Sydney in the coming months.
