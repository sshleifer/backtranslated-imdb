it is really a treat for every Bolan fan, some may think that it is a bit above and only relates to the Ringo and Marc's ego, but I think it's similar to other concert videos. Marc is not the only one who's been born! With Elton John and Rinqo Starr, I especially liked the music videos for the children of the revolution. this clip is worth all the money, I do not believe they do not release this version alone. The film is really good, especially for us. Now I was 70 years old. but in general, the whole world has completely removed the events around them. media, Marc Bolan and T.Rex, and later played popular music, they only played a little bit with their doors, although only really popular songs. <br /> <br /> From my father, I know that, seeing it, returning part of the youth, never lived. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's too long. Marc is the least supporter of the child, you have to see it. you can find it somewhat boring or as mentioned earlier. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians! <br /> <br /> The only thing that just makes me feel is the Ride White Swan cassette. but forgive him because he played so much on Jeepster and Get On.
