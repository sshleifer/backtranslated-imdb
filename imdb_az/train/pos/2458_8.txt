The movie was a cool mood when I sat down and did not plan to change it. But this is a dramatic power plant. I was on the sweat and then needed a shower. What's up? The age-limit theory of a teenage girl living in the state of Copenhagen, Denmark. Soon my idea came to my mind that the plot was entirely taken from Beckham's bending, where there was an Indian girl playing football and breaking her daughter's wedding. Here we moved Kung Fu to a Turkish girl who broke his brother's wedding. And there is a love story and of course a competition. After accepting it, this really was an amazing, emotional drama and shows off some nice Kung Fu (I'm not an expert). Missing actress Semra Turan is not just Denmark's female champion, but also a great performance, as we consider her first film, and we believe there are some autobiographical impressions here. education as an actress. The rest of the handle is OK, the camera is good, Kung Fu is tight. Sidenotes: - Men have respected the Turkish audience that they should do something. - The hero finally returned and the audience was shocked when they attacked the boys who were brutally beaten and beaten by their brother. - Xian Gao, Chinese cinema Kung Fu actor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon), played the lead role. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it in a movie, it's probably a good and intense experience and I do not know if it's running on a small screen
