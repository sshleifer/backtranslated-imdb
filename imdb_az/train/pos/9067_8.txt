After enjoying some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". Once, I did not predict the end! It was funny and fun, and despite the headline, a ton of cunning humor had not appealed. My sons (6 and 10) also loved it: oh and my 45-year-old boy, all the time, smiled at his face. This is just an unbearable family movie for parents. The relationship with the younger brother is very close to real life. "It just does not stop reading to worry me!" Also, making friends with new children and shaping these friendships is justified by the behavior of the children. Of course, parents should behave somewhat strangely, but my favorite scenes have just begun my father's new job. Have fun!
