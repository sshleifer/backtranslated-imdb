I really liked this movie ... the characters, the attention to detail, outstanding performances, stunning lighting and cinematography, beautiful soundtrack ... anyone who wants a combination of intense intensity and lightness of touch will not work for you. If I had lived in Elizabethan days, I'd say that this is something like a Shakespeare tragedy. <br /> <br /> In some of the films there is also a Drama-Suspense movie. <br /> <br /> Simple, but the story is too complicated. The film is clever when it comes to relationships and topics. The majority of the story is more subtle and does not explain, and does not explain that it works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). Sometimes I felt that I was part of this story in the 1930s - there was such a realistic imagination in the style that it talked about. <br /> <br /> I often read films based on them, but in this case. <br /> <br /> (Even though I enjoyed the book). I got the DVD, which is fine. Because there are beautifully deleted scenes and deep insights. <br /> <br /> (I'm a younger brother, it's smaller than a boy in the movie, so see it after seeing it for the first time, because I have problems at home and want to use it as a tool to start discussions on father and son issues. and discuss.)
