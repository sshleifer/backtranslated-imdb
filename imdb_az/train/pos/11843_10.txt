Spirit: Cimarron's moon is usually a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> The mix of animated species is unique, the story is awesome and music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Drawing animation is a special thing about many animations. Especially magnificent as they have expressed through cartoons, especially the animation of horses. Although it is easy to communicate with the horses' body language, many young children and people who do not learn horses can not understand. Without words, I imagine that it can be difficult to express these characteristics. Therefore, I understand the "eyebrows" they add to the horses (there is no thick line in real horses). One of the few things I've learned about horse habits that can be described in a strange way is that the Spirit leads to her mother's flock. <br /> <br /> Some people, while drawing the white army officers as "bad guys", are stereotypes, think of all the movies. Native Americans are described as such. Sometimes; They looked at the disbelievers very badly. For example, in real history, Appaloosa was postponed due to Army Officers. <br /> <br /> Consider what happens to one of the best-loved sexes in the world when Native Americans do not save them. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at how the horses chat with each other, and how to get the reality. . The feelings of the soul have been expressed with a little narration, but mostly music (by Bryan Adams). <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams have done a great job explaining the story with their song and lyrics. <br /> <br /> For the first time or twenty (yes, I've watched it) when you watch the movie, you would not believe it. Some scenes draw your breath, some of them bind your eyes. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence of the Spirit's homeland will immediately bring you a great action. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why some people hate this sparkling movie. In general, I appreciate it 10/10 - you have to watch.
