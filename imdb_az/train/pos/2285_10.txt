I have not read this book, but the whole movie was afraid of a thought that I was thinking about: Vonnegut. No writer, movie maker, and all the intelligence and work I have ever seen have not seen any movies. The film also had the same problems with Vonnegut's novels: jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols often joked. Campbell was also a Vonnegut character that was perfectly reflected by Nick, Nolte. A Vonnegut had all the riches of the "hero": anxiety for political borders, malevolent dark humor, unstable action against stress, and a lack of desire to push the reality version against those around him. In general, when I watched this movie, I was always amazed and sad. My first Vonnegut novel was the feeling I read the Cat Cradle, as if it were the best oddball thing I thought, THAT thought and it was true and important. Yes, most of the army is nothing more than the "White Christmas" album. So it goes!
