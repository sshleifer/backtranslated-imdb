This story based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces ("The Fall of Usher's House", "Death Dance") is, in fact, very frustrating. It is similar to one of old black and white films about people in the old dark house (for example, "Cat and Canary", "Old Dark House", "Night of Terror" and others). Boris Karloff is anxious for life-long puppets who insult guests. Will the film die early (or it?) And the residents of the house are exposed to some horrible experiments. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <strong> <span style = "font-size: />
