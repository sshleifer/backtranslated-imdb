I do not comment after reading the very short "No worse" comment. This movie is better than bad. Acting does not play anything but a toy, or even a toy, but it acts like my son's comrades. The film is clever and awaiting the audience. Twice back is the creation of flash story lines, and the story helps, without speaking as a time filler. I watched this movie with my kids and watched a few days later. If you have children, and if you have a dip of diabetic coma on their syrupy sweets, check out "Hole". My 6 year old was so much like my 11 year old and my husband and I were very glad of them. How many movies can you tell about?
