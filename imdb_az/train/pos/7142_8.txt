Firstly, a novel by Louis Sachar, Deluxe, has become a successful, entertaining and well-prepared movie. <br /> <br /> Siqourney Weaver was a supervisor, like Shane Labeouf as Stanley, and Xleo Thomas, like Zero, in a very good way and actors described their role well. <br /> <br /> In the film, it's over. The main storyline is Stanley Yelnats and Camp Greenlake, who spent a year and a half on the penalty. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This organization is engaged in racism and a deeper story of the film. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madmin Zeroni, the 100-year curse of the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these stories touch each other. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the belief of many people, it is not necessary to read a book to understand the film. It's easy to understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Xleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (Supervisor) and John Voight Sir) act in the film. D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kash (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray) have increased their comic relief. <br /> <br /> Holes is engaged in some serious issues, such as racism, shooting, and violence, despite being a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> At some points, the dramatization of the film has done very well. <br /> <br /> I would like to read this movie to people of all ages, I would like. You should not miss it.
