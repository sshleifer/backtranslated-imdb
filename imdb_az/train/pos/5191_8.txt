Scott is right. The best 2-person sword fighting in the film is in the middle of this movie. The sword fights with many fighters, but not good. However, fighting in the middle is best compared to Japanese samurai films. The scenes from the Chinese sword, in my opinion, have never exceeded Japan in terms of entertainment value. Especially a person must fight with an enemy group scenes, excel in Japanese films, such as Lone Wolf and Cub series. Although Japanese duels were at least a second or a minute, the intense intensity of those moments made them even better. However, Chinese swords are superior to Japan. In the middle of this movie, the scene was a five-minute battle with the finest choreography. Other battles in this film are also very good, but if they shoot this movie they will reach 7 for a scene. If you have not seen it, you have to do it. John Woo is a man.
