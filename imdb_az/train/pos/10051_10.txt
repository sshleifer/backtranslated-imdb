Family problems are expanding in real life and about this movie. Love can keep members together using exams and trials, and this is about the movie. A man, father, has the capacity and the blessing to protect his family in the face of distress. Even though children are older, parents still love their children and grow up in a difficult way to understand that they are ready to provide the cushion. All actresses reflecting the characters of the composers made excellent speeches. Yes, I shed tears on the way I knew that I was a young adult and later a parent. It is good to see that every young adult and parent would be good to see, and some will not understand it as parents. It should be a place for those who care for their families.
