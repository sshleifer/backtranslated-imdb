Viggo Mortensen is a strange secret that can be the reason for the death of a prisoner (a well-run by Lane Smith) as a new prisoner in a supernatural presence of stars, various prison guards, and prisoners. Lincoln Kilpatrick is a liar who knows the secret and is frightened of his life. When I think of prison films, I always think of action movies that play a role in high caliber drama such as Stallone or Van Damme or Shawshank Redemption or Green Mile. But I did not expect a ghost story along Exorcist III's line. The prison is an atmospheric effort and, of course, remains the best film of Reny Harlin's career. The film is creepy and moves well (at that time) from an unknown cast. Lane Smith has set out to be the best because his manager believes in a cinema that is beyond the expectations rather than the usual clich√© of bad personality, rather than nervous and twitching. <br /> <br /> 4- (Good)
