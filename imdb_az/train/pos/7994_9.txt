I liked this movie very much. In the dark, it's not a dodging bullet, but the car-chasing brain move film. many symbols and motivations are very uncertain, allowing the viewer to reach his or her own ends. <br /> <br /> Love or intentional motivation or desire to repent - is the "right" of what he feels. "Lord, will forgive us what we have done?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Denizli Washington is a great actor in Washington - I am honest, but not something for me. I do not think of a bad movie made by him - and he has a huge support cast. I would recommend this movie to everyone thoroughly.
