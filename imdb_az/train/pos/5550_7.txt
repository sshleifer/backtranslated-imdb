this 1917 feature is emphasized. The pride of the clan explains the story of a girl who began to become the clan leader after his father died. On an island on the shores of Scotland, the villagers live a simple life of "fisherman folk". My image is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but there are some stunning ocean decor in the movie, and the boats in the cameras will work. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant movie. In 1917, Pickford was a great star, and this movie appears to have just been written for him: a brave young woman succeeds. Pickford lashes from the Tiksinli villagers to the church are very funny. And the last scenes on the sink are very good. Not a great Picford movie, it's still worth seeing. Matt Moore (married to Pickford's brother Owen Moore) is in love as well as the grass island guy. Leatrice Joy is one of the peasants, but I could not get her out of it. My image is a feeling of an eerie feeling when many calls and gongs intersperses and alarms to the village. Very effective.
