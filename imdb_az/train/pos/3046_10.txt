All good movies inspire direct "direct" video clipping flick. I was afraid that the movie "Gladiator" was not really good, because I did not see any movie that was similar to anything remotely from the novel in the new releases for months. Then I saw the last month's offer, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Full Moon's Puppetmaster series and Blood Dolls, but I have never seen any killer puppet movie. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> What happens to a camp of Demonicus Alpine Mountains? One of the roads, James finds a cave with old gladiatorial works and forces him to pull a helmet out of the corpse and try it out. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, like many Full Moon films, there is little or nothing. budget. Sometimes I swim and edit Blair Witch Project. Attempts to cut hands and heads remind me of Monty Python skit. The guns really look like plastic as it looks. In a word, this is a weekend by a group of friends with a digital camera. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with such a cinematography, just wait for this technician. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Tranquillus does not really act as a gladiator, at least Latin speaks. Actually, I liked this movie very much. Perhaps not a killer puppet movie, but Full Moon still conveys! The only thing that made me dream was the full Moon Videozone at the end!
