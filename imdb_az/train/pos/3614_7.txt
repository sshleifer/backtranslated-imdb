Girlfight resembles your grandmother's cooking: the same old recipe that you tried a million times ago has yet to become fresh and new. Explain and explain this story to the uneducated people before: a young woman with the wrong side of the road deals with a painful, obstructive father, and one man tries to win his opponent with increasing charm, trying to improve his boxing position. Put your eyes on the eyes of the cliche, and they are not right: it is a clich√©. However, this film was hypnotized by a very well-functioning and sensitive direction of dialogue and 'new'. I ran to cinema because it's exactly like it, but I do not make the same mistake. Defineately worth a look.
