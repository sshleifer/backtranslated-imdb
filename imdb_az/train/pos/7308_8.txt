With a simple story and an attractive hero, this was the beginning of a fear film. John Carpenter brings Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, his debut role, his role-playing role) and his bad guys on a nightclub of Halloween when he plans a secret night party to pass through hell with a painless psychopath. <br /> <br /> Mayk Myers had already fled to a nearby man after he had already killed his brother. He is now in Haddonfield, Illinois, where the murder occurred. After laying a packet in an abandoned house, after putting his eyes on Laurie, and taking the path of each one of his way, he begins to turn a fun night into terror and turn it into terror. beautiful cinematography and lighting really make the moody horror look frightening ... with long-lasting bizarre shots, it's almost as though the maniacal serial killer himself is. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is, of course, obsolete, though it's no less cold. The only idea is one thing, and this little shocker is one of the most popular and memorable horror films ever made up of seven albums ... and it has finally set Rob Zombie's equally intimidating and new standard of horror today. available.
