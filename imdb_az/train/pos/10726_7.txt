For my surprise, I love Spacecamp, remembering it 13 years ago and recently recruited it. I was very impressed. Certainly, special effects such as Armageddon and Deep Impact on daytime space movies are far superior to those in SpaceCamp. But there was a story in this movie - a very stereotypical eighty story, where he read the next dialogue line before listening. But what I like about this is not so much a movie, so there is a refreshing change. Early roles were interesting to add lightweight and fluffy substance with Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson, Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw. The robot named Jinx was very sweet, but unfortunately, there were more emotions than some basic characters. The film was, in turn, almost inspirational, and it is interesting to note that it was shot at NASA Spacecamp in the state of Alabama (I think).
