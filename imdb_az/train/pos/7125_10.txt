Goodnight Mister Tom has been beautifully drawn and beautifully implemented. It is not completely loyal to this book, but is it obliged to do so? No, no. John Thaw is as spectacular as Tom Oakley. Changing from Gruff to care was well-conducted, counting more than convincing Scrooge at Christmas in Carroll. This is Thaw's best time after Inspector Morse. He was seriously adapted by a young Nick Robinson, who portrays his full convincing image of a vaccine that has been traumatized as a result of an abusive relationship with his mother. They gave the script and music a value, and you see Thaw's body playing. Amazing! The most moving scene revealed that Willie was involved with Zak's death, and then Tom talked about his family who died of scarlatinas. Take it, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
