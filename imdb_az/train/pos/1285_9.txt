The sad mid-old lawmaker George Maxwell (a beautiful performance by George E. Carey in this picture) can no longer be a naggy, cold wife Edith (a terrible Anne Bellamy). Even worse, poorer George saddled her baby with a newborn baby and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (washed dark Sheri Jackson). George, a cute, charming and free-inspired hippie caretaker, has a bloody bundle with Candy Wilson (played with a sexy aplomb by Patricia Wymer with delectable blond pattern). Corc's pseudo-biker lover Laurence Mackey (a frightening Robert Tessier) prison, where she has been blackmailed by the self-defiled Julia Freeman (a beautiful toxic turn by Kathy Williams). Director Tom Laughlin (yep, the same friend who describes Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLarty makes a nice smoky story, the delicacy of delicious women, the softness of the tummy and the humiliation of violence and the very entertaining advantage. Moreover, they ensure that the 60th youth culture uninhibited sensitivity to all the wilds and coordinates the plot for a short period of up to 75 minutes, which does not ensure the film's dislikes. A strange highlight is that Candy's heartwarming friends are inviting Maxwell's home to drink tea, banging rock music, and, of course, a basement bash full of warm bare dance shepherds. The strange account of Robert O. Ragland has been gnarly spotted. Stanton Fox's black-and-white cinematography adds an extra curling edge to extreme sleazy rides. Best of all, it's a striking showcase for the absolutely charming and fresh-faced pixie Patricia Wymer, with these flick ratios, sweet, bubbly personality and attractive beauty burned on the screen. Common dirty treatment.
