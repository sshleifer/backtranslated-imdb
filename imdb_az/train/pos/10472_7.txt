Everyone who loves reostatic music enjoys this movie. I have some minor complaints that some actors (Maury) are basically pacing and playing a certain role but their roles are really convincing, but I do not have the time to write a detailed review. I just do not want to warn anyone who is watching this movie, or I'm going to watch this movie as CBC television in Canada: THE EXCLUSIVE KNOWLEDGE version is like the WHALE MUSIC Reader Digest. Cut off all scenes and subtopics from the movie (if you can do them). The majority of films were shot by the CBC, half a penny from WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. What a horror they do to the movie. Take a video or watch in a theater, but watch on CBC television.
