I saw Panahi's films at the Melbourne Film Festival first. He differed with the different characters and completely different Aussie children, how they reacted and behaviors, and still with the same level as other levels. Perhaps, if they had seen a similar film, they might see individuals as individuals and avoid racism, which can often fuel the unknown fear. There are great political differences between the culture of the minority and the Iranian culture, but there are so many fine differences between the films that this film is so successful, it is extremely interesting. It's unique in my likeness. I saw that they watched the characters strongly.
