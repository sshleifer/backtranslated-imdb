When I found this movie on my local video station, I was expecting to have another Chef American Vampire movie in the same array of "The Lost Boys" (1987). "To die" is a really good movie. sometimes sometimes dark, but still have enough stylish set pieces and surprises to provide vampire enthusiasts. It's a perfect blend of romance and horror, and it's strangely surprising.
