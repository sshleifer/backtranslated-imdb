This time, Kermit, Fozzi, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla chicken colleges and played a music that they were trying to get on Broadway. Generally, after having difficulty obtaining this product, all of them are separated and go on separate paths. I love the characters and the bride. The songs made in the film "Again, Together," "See Me, Here I am," "Welcome," "I Love You All Alone," "Rat Jazz," and "She Will Make Me Happy." Frank Oz, and all actors do a real job like the Muppets.Make it 91 minutes Rated G. My rating: A.
