How difficult is it to comment on the difficult movie? Not good, but then good to say good. What a compelling look, you will fall before you get there. <br /> <br /> Tsunami photographs approaching the shores of Thailand, you know you've lost your lives, but you have to watch. <br /> <br /> Naudet's brothers have the best of these interpretations of the tragedy, what is happening in another country, neither panders nor injustice. The works are cellulose, and the viewer is very small to understand or understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can not change the date, if you do not want this movie, humanity is in the darkest time.
