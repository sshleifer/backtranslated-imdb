<br /> <br /> Returning home for 5 years Tenko survived and Marion's two-tiered "Here is what it is". <br /> 1950s: Time for re-dating. The bell is here all: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica and the next Maggie and Alice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> <br /> From the Marion family to the Joss Health Center, everything has changed for almost 5 years, and the best of everything has changed. <br /> <br /> Many shocks to Dominica's farming and some really exterior seating tension. A tragedy and disaster have a real meaning, once again, ending destiny and fighting for women's lives. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < they were friends. It is a shame that this is really the end. I could still watch it. Excellence.
