That was excellent. Touching for Russell, moving and perfect. I like this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 stars or more. This film is a story of an outdated soldier who learns that there is more life than military service, and people who learn that warfare is a must have defense. We cried, laughed and long ago sat in the panic of this story. An action flick was good for the writing job and area and was pretty solid. The latter did not bend, but it was still excellent. If you get rid of New York, or if you're missing out on it, this is for you. There was no Goran or violence, so it was not difficult to watch. Something for everyone.
