<br /> <br /> It was necessary to say how regrettable the structure of the tension around a theme, which is more appealing to the beauty of cinema, the perfect frame and the terrible hole. There were two narrations, one had not been seen. Both of them are trying to explain many paintings that have led to a long scandal. The film is about the explanations of all the theories and explanations, but in the end, I must say that it is shocking. Of course, it is a film worth more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> The movie was played just 66 minutes and the movie was still a complete job. Fantastic direction! I need to talk better about the poet's blood, which reminds me of some strange reasons. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the word "artsy". This is a fairly professional discussion about different theories and stunning visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz draw it. At least for me. Beautiful movie.
