I've seen this movie about 6 times. And every time I see it, I am more amazed at the story and the player. Like a train crash like him. Its approach is exquisite, but very effective in achieving the goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> It's a great dilemma in the center of the story. On the one hand, there is a big boss, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack), the mob boss, Zappati, who is deliberately trying to keep the predecessor and the status-quo on the other hand without the knowledge of the old boys network, which is the head of the New York administration. When Zappati orders Zappati to order himself to kill himself, this situation ends well. <br /> <br /> In the film, he also orders Pappas to do politics in the same way. (as my personal weakness): - You do not end a single person's life at a time - the only thing new in this world is the history you do not know. <br /> <br /> Generally, it is a big movie worthy of a higher rating.
