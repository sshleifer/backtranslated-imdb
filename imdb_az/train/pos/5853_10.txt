I liked this Summerslam very much because of the appearance of this sequence, the look of the curtains and the appearance of the only one. Anyway, WWF could have been one of the best Summerslames in the case of Lex Luger in the main case against Yokozuna, but now it was good to have a strong man with a big fat guy, but happy times have changed. Luger was a terrible event, as was every game. Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Sky objects, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening, a bodyguard Diesel, IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid in this show, Bret Hart takes Doink first, and then takes Jerry Lawler and Harts and Lawler were always very interested, then Ludvig destroyed Borga Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took another giant Giant Gonzalez, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka Bam Bam Bigelow, and Headshrinkers and Yokozuna against Lex Luger maintained the name of the world, dug the match and ended extremely. But it's worth 8/10
