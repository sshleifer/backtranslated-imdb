I recently watched the Spirit and loved it very much, I guess 4 times in HBO and you'll get a DVD. Those who gave negative impression were probably just thinking of another vehicle trail and "Thelma & Louise" just another chick pee. Despite the darkness of the results of these films, the themes are somewhat dependent; freedom and individualism are very important and there is usually someone who wants to get away from you. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this film is the kind of caring, thoughtful 'guardian angel' that helps to overcome the difficulties of key heroes. <br /> <br /> It is noted at another glance that this film belongs to the subject of civilization occupied by someone else. <br /> <br /> I thought animation and story were beautiful, animators really look, move and have horses for natural movement. . As the story progressed, the feelings of the Spirit were very clear (yes, they converted horses to a little, but it is similar). You experience a few forest scenes, a river, and a forest fire. In other quieter scenes (most of the time), it is permissible to please the backgrounds. One of the great things that really works on the story is that it does not go on the route of a chattering animal. It would be far from the story's power. Instead, the story flow is explained by a random story with the main character, and is further added by the fantastic soundtrack. From another source, they were not afraid to give the story somewhat dark (actually, this film will be seen for me). <br /> <br /> Let's talk about some films that have been spread throughout all films and are the final result. <br /> <br /> Those who appreciate horses love this movie, but this is less than a horse movie. I do not think that it would be a good movie to accept children if you have been offered the kind of benefit you have so far. But if they are a kind of thought that can handle mandatory stories such as Rings and Black Beauty, they will likely love this movie. Hell, I'm 35, and I love so much.
