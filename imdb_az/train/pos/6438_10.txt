"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" .. below as above .. The very special point he met with Divine and Man. I like this movie ADORE! A gem. <br /> <br /> <strong> I talked to my wife. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist laughed BRILLIANT as Daniel's first-ever passionate, charismatic and powerful performance and cried through all the notes. His inner light and exceptional talent shine at every stage, in every mutual respect, at every meeting. <br /> <br /> There were many archetypes of the film, a Christian, a wounded child, a magical child, too much. artist, teacher, priest, aggressor, aggressor, victim, son, divine cheating - EVERYTHING true and true of everyone's life - all this caused great embarrassment and compassion for me. <br /> <br /> Such a thought is a real treat to show a full-fledged, entertaining movie yet. Oh, do not forget the wonderful chorus of the angels and the beautiful voice of the angels. <br /> ALL THANK YOU - This Swedish movie will undoubtedly capture the world's population. BRILLIANT!
