Look, this is one of the best films America has to offer the rest of the world. The freedom to hate this movie is to hate it. I remember that the early 80's was a period of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us, and the destruction of nuclear weapons was almost resolute. The hero of this mess came from Stroker Ace. Ned Beatty's performance in this film showed that it was not a recurring type of single-dimensional sacrifice. His victory is inspired by everyone. On the screen between Burt and Loni, chemistry is comparable to Brad and GÃ¶kniper. Jim Nabors is a poet. See this movie tonight!
