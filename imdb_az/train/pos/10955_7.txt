I first shot Sarah's show 8 with a fine oil, but I fought a bit late with humor, and resolved at 7. <br /> <br /> You love Sarah's humor. or you will not. If you do not, I doubt anyone will be able to convince you. People know who you are and this is perfect, but you know it. Movement, the first season, gave us fantastic luck to Sarah, her friends and her family and life. In a memorable episode, he was "shot" by Officer Jay for the first time. - "Do you know why I'm here?" he asks. "Because there are all C high schools?" he quizzically responded. This was really a question. - This is a fun thing in my book. Sara can get you out of the way. In another episode, his relationship with God was very laughable. God added a joke with a jealous and jealousy. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it was my second season. Even though there are not some new and inventive comedies, a unique poop and fart jump into the jokes is so simple - I'm here and there a few good laughs, but most seem like filler and writers, some struggling to attract original materials.I have lately feelings for the sophomoric and tiring episodes, but I cook for the stones I find (Turtle) and wait for it to turn around.I think it's an admirer of the "Magic of Jesus" rhythm and thinks I understand what you can do, let's go back.
