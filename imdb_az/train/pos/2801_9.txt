When I promise that I love this movie, my scalp is still clever from burning coal. Bring Coals; Again I say, "I love Beckham," I love. Of course, there is much in the confession "at least". A little movie this week; Scenarios are on the side of paint-by-numbers. <br /> <br /> Even the film did not clarify the invisible eyes at Sid Square: character springs topics, construction. It is both surface and bottom deep, but the reviewers are not in the layers of the artistic tops that seem to be the most scratch. Strong, sometimes semi-mild female bodies do not just show on the screen, but hitting the edge of a football, doing a better job of promoting a stronger and more aggressive than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi. These are the real bodies (excluding Keira Knightley), not to look at the first case and then to fight. Their beauty is their movement and self-determination bodies. And in my book, the leading actress Parminder Nagra is one of the most beautiful creatures on the screen? As a result, a movie can be felt by women without feeling it because it can claim a sensitive face as "clarity", but its performance has honesty and un-intelligence intelligence. As they are dealing with the devil. Like the "Bride and the Prejudice" of Chad, the relationships between women blend with a chemistry that is beautifully collected in the category of "Sweet Valley High" as "best friends" or "sisters." Perhaps Chadha is right even to comment on the film's flirtation to give up lesbianism. There is a power that can not be dropped into a simple hetero / homosexual love triangle "Bending like Beckham". The true nature of your taste is ultimately a mystery? <br /> Yes, there's something like that.
