I thought it was an absolutely charming movie. The story looks like John Waters's gentle translation: Pecker's greatest gift is the ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong performs well, but the best performances are given by his grandmother, Mink Stole (hilarious crowd) and by all people Patty Hearst. I think that the reviewers are on their way to this issue. The film is considered to be the Gospel of Pecker's worst work, so the film is quite clear, and I think it's an artist who really is a hopeful one.
