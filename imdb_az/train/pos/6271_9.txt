I liked this movie. It was very nice. There are all these: machines, gunfire, battles, and even a token girl. Except for the car, this is no better than anything else. A little shooting, a little fighter, a little bullet around and lots of LOTs, with a great follow-up. Jumping is almost impossible, but this is possible because of our good friends in the IMDB, as film is not as bad as painting people. There are some qualities and I like to watch it. Actually, I liked the movie. I did not have to turn off my brain to watch it. I always say, "Is that possible?" I did not think so. or it resembles it. 10 at 9.
