I do not think it's perfect 10, and I agree that this is on the highway above 6. No, the Brokedown Palace was perfect and yes, it has been repeatedly used. If this is good and I think it's some strong moment of this movie, it should not be repeated. Claire Danes's players, like many times remembered, were perfect as Kate Beckinsell, and I thought that Bill Pullman was just as terrifying as the supportive performances (Pullman's wife, crooked police, jumping or walking, or what's her name). <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Film art has beautiful shooting Although some of the movies were a negative thing, there was a good thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> This is the friendship between girls - in fact, girls' personalities - did not develop deeply until the middle of the night. Before that, it would not be possible to lose interest because it had to be more characteristic than before, and as the girls were initially arrested, certain scenes were almost shimmered so there were so many jumping characters and scenes without the development of this type of movie I think it would be appropriate. However, it is not my main problem. And warning-spoiler alert. <br /> <br /> There were dozens of times when it was over, AWFUL. It was terrible in two aspects. Firstly, I wanted to have a happy end, despite being expected and much Hollywood! Yes, it was an emotional and powerful endeavor, but in such a film there was a sense of justice, and I sat down for it. I was extremely shocked and perfectly performed by all the participants, but I felt that both girls did not want them to be banned or forbidden, at least what happened to the police. That is, there is nothing wrong with bad people, and they all go away with it. Very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> And I do not understand the latter uncertainty. I understand the inspirational endings to think, but this is not a mystery or "Clue" movie that we follow, and I really want to know something about what happened, who is guilty, and so on. <br /> <br /> There is still much to love about this movie and the actor is definitely. On top of the list, I would rate it 7.5 and definitely need a glance.
