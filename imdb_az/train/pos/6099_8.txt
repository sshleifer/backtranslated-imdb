I'm still stuck in this show, when it's an awesome hour, night-by-night ads and all of that, even today, night and day, wirelessly, I've pulled back the cheap VHSs from this show. <br /> <br /> Serial Freddy Kreuger is not about - the first two episodes of the episode are just something like that, but Rod Serling-esquire is a spokesman. Instead, each episode was a different nightmare with terrible childhood's traditional horror theme, dating, wildlife, dating, money, death, dating, and ... hmm ... dating. <br /> <br /> A teenage teenager is mistakenly mistreated by an episode that says "I will love you forever" (in truth, at least for a moment ...), a young man with a strange man , he can only find himself in his cabin, where there are trophies filled with other hostesses, and there is only one possibility of comparing a cortege with a hockey (and thus wounded). <br /> <br /> In one episode, Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) was like a tasty mysterious pizza merchant with a delicious new mystery. It's not genuine, it's still creepy and fun .... <br /> <br /> However, some episodes were great. My personal sweetheart is a "poor life", where a young man's parents are stranded when they want to go to a college at a burger college. Make a little puppet show with old cheeseburgers and chat with him - coming through a strange guy until late at night and suddenly his life is the same. No, not Freddie, but a thief with a weapon - the whole mind blowing episode - the last thought of a child ... with a bullet. The second half of the same episode (many of Freddie's Nightmares episodes were mainly two inaccurate short stories), but also a "heck off the hospital" - a car accidentally killed by the driver - in the nightmare clich√©s of the creepy hospital , and then in some of them - your mouth is sleeping or waking up during an operation - your dead friend is trying to bring you to a dead body for a little bit. <br /> Again, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes have been reported to be THE FIRST BIG. They put the strangers as arrays, and then nobody likes them, they think about staging and then do not shoot videos. This Life is only available on the PAL DVD in the UK, but I'll still get it.
