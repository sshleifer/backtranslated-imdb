Generally, I was very pleased with this movie and would like to invite those who love to film indie. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to point out the similarities between the pieces of this movie and Nichols' Closer. Adrian Grenier's character is very similar to Closer's scene, where Rosario Dawson is asking about sex life, especially with less rigor and intensity, with Clive Owen's character Julia Roberts's "Love." Also, "Anna" is the name of Dawson and Roberts. No coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play, supposedly based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen". So, I'm not sure how this relationship was formed. <br /> Does anyone have any ideas?
