The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. First, it was interesting to see how an example works that I think does not use any of the original characters. I was very surprised how it was played. As a rule, sequels are never as good as the original with a few exception. Although this film is not a big movie, the writer has managed to keep the main themes and the vampire lore first. Jon Bon Jovi was initially defective, but proved to be a half-worthy Slayer. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I doubt that Mr. James will do this. <br /> <br /> Generally, this was a good time and I would watch it again. <Br /> I was asked two questions, though ... What happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a slayer? We know that we have to leave it to think about it.
