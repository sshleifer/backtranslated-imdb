This is a sad movie that should be at least 250 films out there. This is still the best Action movie ever. Today's action movies are very bad. Actors and action directors do not know how to fight and correct it. more than that can be done in Hong Kong as Jackie Chan. Stunts are so smart and wild do not think I'll ever be able to see it. The start of Chan and his group entering a hill car from the hill city is just amazing. The latest battle stunts for me are the best fight stunts for the movie. The last stunt rattled Thursday because of the garbage on Thursday was badly injured.
