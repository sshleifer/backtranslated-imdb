I believe that this is the most powerful film of HBO pictures. This movie should be shown at theaters so the public can appear on the big screen. This video is available and make sure to search for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and scenario. Speeches from Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless. A masterpiece of the genre.
