Many years ago, I found a copy of the "bargain bin" of this movie for a buck or two. As it has been pointed out in 1933, this is a great deal in many respects, and this is actually a cheap film by the "poverty line", the "Majestic" studio. This movie is very valuable, yet it is still worth a look and provides a few surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is so familiar with many German cities, the last deaths that appear to be the work of vampires! This introductory addition is Dwight Frye. Renault played in Dracula and is very similar here - though he plays much nervous and strange. In this case, he is obsessed with his pet bats and begins to blame him for the death of people. The film does a good job of providing some of the "red bottles" (ie, the wrong potential) and can be irresponsible, even though it is not a genius to solve Frye's problem, WHO and WHY are interested, and makes it very different. medium scary movie. At the same time, some of the best actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas, as well as Universal Studios kits at night (they are for the day), despite having very little money. The result of the movie is pretty good, though Fay Wray was always terrible - I thought it was not a movie. I've seen him in the IMDb more than most people in the movie, and I have noticed his characters are inaccessible - always sounds like "screamed lady" and provides little innovation in every film. <br /> <br /> Generally, for those who are fond of old-fashioned movies, this is excellent and worth seeing. For those who do not have fun, it is likely to be quite inevitable.
