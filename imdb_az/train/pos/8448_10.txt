<br /> <br /> I was a great admirer of the film "Murder: Life on the Street", so I did not wait when I heard the merging movie. <br /> Everyone was disappointed. This was one of the most powerful 2-hour television I've ever seen. Everyone liked to look back, but the greatest happiness was to return Andre Brauger because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss is always the strongest part of the great show.
