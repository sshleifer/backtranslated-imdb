Great Horror movie that will rock you after you settled down. The atmosphere is very creepy and elegant, but it's the best thing about the movie. <br /> <br /> Life is very interesting and attracts attention since the first minutes. <br /> <br /> Dear Daughter, Although the Black Lady is unable to appear on the screen, she gives some shiny scenes to capture the audience. Dialogs create a very descriptive and imaginative work, and it really scares. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, watching it in the theater is a completely different experience, but it's as intimidating as the movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Ghost movies, and it's for people who want to be afraid.
