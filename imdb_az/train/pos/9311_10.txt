It was the worst movie I ever saw, but it was the best movie. Sci Fi's original film is likely to be bad, it's fun! The line, "I've seen the dinosaurs well!" probably the best quote! Also, the structure sounds like a dream that causes a pot. Now, we can imagine that the writers wake up after a long night playing dancing during the dance period and then combining their ideas: The cosmic seas have an alien planet with dinosaurs and medieval houses. Protecting a science-learning group. The best idea! In fact, the full Sci Fi fit the original movie control list: the weapon of dinosaurs in the medieval times of the weapon of a terrible toy travel <br /> <br /> So watch this movie, but not buy it.
