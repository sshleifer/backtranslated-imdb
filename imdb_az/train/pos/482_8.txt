This is a poem in a beautifully presented and filmed movie with sensual craftsmanship. The atmosphere of time and place is perfect. (The lake region of Italy in the 20th century). This is a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and convincing. The settings are exotic. Some of the scenes --- the funeral boat on the fog --- the longest gravity of the chess table in the center of the fierce brick floor --- are beautiful images. And not necessarily happy ending, this story is a bitter sweet. If film is art, it is close to a shah. <br /> <br />
