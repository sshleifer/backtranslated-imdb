this movie is as good as stupid movements, dark motion and a very small area! This film is worthy of special impact when viewed as director of Event Horizon. Costumes are something crazy. One of the soldiers does not speak, so let others tell you what to do. As a result, the explosions end up as a big movie. I personally liked Russell with "tango and cash", "avoiding new york" and "executive judgment". You need to see this movie should leave your mind at the door to no science fiction film science action!
