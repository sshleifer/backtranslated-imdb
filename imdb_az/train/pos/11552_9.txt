There is another movie that really needs no advice. This classic comedy is very funny and entertaining and, of course, inspiring a successful television series, which ultimately will say to many (both I and myself personally). <br /> <br /> For some, it's hard to heat up like Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, like Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, if they were demolished in a television show on Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe the contrary). But in both cases, it seemed as if they were partners in the film in real life that they would be able to do this. <br /> <br /> The most important of his wife, Nil Simon, is the humorous material and the place where the laughter really happened. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of ODD COUPLE, neurological and neatly strange (Lemmon) is a place where a 12-year-old married couple from a long-lived spouse and Manhattan apartment, a self-contained and completely irresponsible friend (Matthau). Inside the same four walls, these two challenging hospitable people make up some spectacular funny predicaments.
