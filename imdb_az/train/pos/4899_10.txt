I'm glad to see this video in the store. We were looking for some happy movies and this was a real gem. I liked the movie, a story of lovers, not about a few wonderful twenty; Rather, it is a story of some of the sixty-six things that are used as twenty-one. A beautiful, well-written and beautiful act. It's a pleasant surprise for Scottish castle lovers. I was smiling and preparing to watch it again, and I did it several times before turning it over to me.
