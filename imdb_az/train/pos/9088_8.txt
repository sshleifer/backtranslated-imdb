While talking to the Hollywood Hotel, three things could be said from the actual hotel, the radio program, and partly inspired by the first two parts. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons spent the year 1937, opening the Hollywood Hotel in 1937, starting in 1937. a fair share of radio viewers. Powell hosted, sang and kissed Louella and film star guests. <br /> <br /> Then the American Radio Artists Federation went on and demanded a salary. That's why they got the job done. In 1938, the Hollywood Hotel program came to an end. Of course, both Powell and Louella went to other radio stations. The whole story is covered by Tony Thomas in Dick Powell's film. <br /> <br /> But before removing the chip, this film came out of Powell's home studio of Warner Brothers inspired by a radio program. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with Benny Goodman who signed a Hollywood contract. <br /> <br /> When she left for Hollywood, she was full of a filmmaker, Lola Lane, her sophisticated double real-life Rosemary Lane and Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> Mowbray is the voice of Powell that you use to sound in the epic of Civil War, together with Lola Lane. Then Mowbray develops a Lina Lamont problem that he wants to go to the Hollywood Hotel radio program from Hollywood. There is a studio on the knee. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer present a really good score for the film. The great hit song originally sung Benny Goodman's band Johnnie Davis as a song sung by Hollywood's Hollywood Hollywood Holstore. I'm fond of, but Powell and Rosemary Lane sing a song, I'm not like a Fish from the Fish. <br /> <br /> Johnny Mercer, Brooklyn Dodgers, or Sally Rand, writes about Ginger Rogers, this is an arrangement of American popular culture in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley here is choreographed, there are some imaginative things we think he's doing with his previous work with Warner Brothers. Berkeley's great moment is in a drive-in canteen where Powell and Healy are forced to hire. The issue starts with Benny Goodman, released at Hollywood Hotel, and then begins singing at the Powell, Lane and Edgar Kennedy's insults in all places. You know what you expect from the exploitation of Edgar Kennedy. <br /> <br /> Benny Gudman is starting to show why he was called Swing King during the band, which is part of the ensemble with the drummer Gene Krupa and xylophonist Lionel Hampton. I'm singing along with Frances Langford. The last castle member of the band was probably a small man, like a radio speaker. He died in 2004, but became the 40th US president. Ronald Reagan always celebrated Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as two sons of Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel was a pleasant and entertaining one. The film is dated, but in a charming way.
