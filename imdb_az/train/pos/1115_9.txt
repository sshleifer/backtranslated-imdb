This is one of those failed films that resulted in even more sad, unfortunate death in the box office. I watched this film shortly after keeping it in a local theater, live cinema, and saw it as a living thing. Of course, the second (or third) is worthy of approach. Sandra B., by taking these words and taking some of the well-known songs on this track (Hank William's "I Lonely I Could Cry" with his version of which you can easily move in tears). Maybe one day, the audience will be ready to take this movie a little bit more (though not laughfully). Some viewers will not be so old and boring that the movie moves at a fast pace (thanks to some nice editing). Perhaps a revival is the lower part of the pipeline.
