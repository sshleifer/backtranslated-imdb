This amazing 1983 BBC television production (others are not a movie here), the classic love story "Jane Eyre", Timothy Dalton plays Rochester, and Zelah Clarke, like Jane, is the best version ever made, but also the concept and the Charlotte Bronte is the most committed force of the novel. <br /> <br /> Classic is classic for very special reasons; When the filmmakers begin to interact with the very heart of the classic, the classic is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of this Jane Eyre create a great deal of affection for the multi-level sweetness and enjoyment of pleasure and dignity, worthy of respect and devotion to the story. The performances are pleasant, the music is just right, even the gothic design of the house and the exterior photographs are beautiful and puts the right tone for production. <br /> <br /> Although my only criticism is light, this version, like any version of Jane Eyre, does not see the Christian influences that make up Jane's character and affect his moral choices. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice, but she would have been married to her and decided to stay in Rochester after having married her. "Oh, only divorce," she would say to her, or she would live with sin. But Jane Eier knew that she would not be able to handle this kind of life, and she respected herself. Why? This decision was taken from the Christian example of Helen Burns, his true friend, who was martyred instead of turning the other cheek on the foundations of the Christian faith he learned from childhood, not from the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institute. One day, I would like to describe one version in a more appropriate way. A classic novel ending with a heroic title "Even so, the Lord Jesus!" it should not have the foundation of that belief.
