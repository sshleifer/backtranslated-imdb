I rarely see a film dedicated entirely to me; That was one of them. Well-acting, dialogue, structure, and scenery were wonderful. In particular, I laughed at the scene with a few loud voices. The slapstick comedy performed by the hired handmade was a floor to me, but I admit I am a jerk for the slapstick. The story went back to a summer camp where some 30 years old people joined the group 20 years ago. The camp was a farewell week because it would be closed at the end of this season. As the elderly, the camp was different, and they differed from each other. <br /> <br /> I recommend this funny, animated movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
