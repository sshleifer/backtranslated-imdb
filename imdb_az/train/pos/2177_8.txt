We saw the silent version of this movie and it's pretty straightforward. It is difficult to see how a silent version of Louise Brooks, a French player playing a silent sequence, is difficult to see, because it is silent with silent technique, long-term sweeping of a single indefinite narrative speaks remarkably in English ... The only voice that votes for The section is the ultimate scene watching Brooks's shot for a "movie for a movie": Moving images in the background while moving, moves in the mouthless silent song. I was not surprised to find out later that this transition in the advanced version was highly appreciated as a new technique! <br /> <br /> The film is like a dream after the sunny beauty of the opening scenes and the tale of the fairy-tale is inevitable. As a 'Louise Brooks' film, Hollywood comedies or GWPabst's German melodramas were nothing but a better and more pleasant one, and Brooks himself is a different creature. <br /> <br /> But the film the second half of the unexpectedly deeper than the first appearance; was beaten by the rich parasites who clustered around its beauty, the pauper prince turned to teardrop with his humble, born true love ... and the fairy tale ended very well. But the fairy tale turns into a disaster. And yet, he is ironically, justified without social reactions beauty competitions: after the intoxication of his moment, Lucienne is overwhelmed by the hot line of married life, as he is capable of manipulating his woman, Dilettante Grabovskiy, is still quite in the self-interested prognosis - young lovers do not make each other happy - André ironically, , and her husband, in turn, remembers all the work. <br /> <br /> In many cases, the "Prix de Beauté" reminds us that if there was a simple job of a non-conforming marriage, something would happen ... but the real tragedy love each other. Murnau "Sunrise" to me. But if so, the Fairground and the photographer will create a distorted mirror in happy Sunrise scenes; not a dream, a lying nightmare. The following morning was not a miraculous combination, but an empty bed and went out of the house. Lucienne died again to seek brightness and freedom from André's life, leaving a letter to tell him he loved her and always loved her; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gossip columns, Finally, when the young worker penetrated the rich sanctuary of the exam room, he greeted him with a weapon he was looking at for his opponent and laughing by Lucienne. he left it. He killed him, but Lucienne had never seen him, even though he had been killed by an image depicted on the screen as he had killed him. As André was seen, seized, stopped and pulled down, two women joined in an infinite, powerful moment: the girl who died and the above dreams were still caught up in the above-mentioned predictions, cellular time, without knowing that celluloid was not eternally absorbed or loved by death. <br /> <br /> The element of the main work in the film is the character of Anton André's worker and is the betrayal of the modern contemporaries who do not serve somewhere to be his licensed castle. She is an ugly man who never succeeded in getting her daughter, toilet and workplace in a mood of a rose, and a smiling face for social acceptance, with an uncertain smile: a more talented and popular, or rather a spectator, with his torturers with whom you are invited to laugh. If the intent does not disclose a dark side for the heroes (no sign for me), the character is just a funny relief, but it's a funny relief with a certain bad edge. When we recognize it as just a Peeping Tom on the shore edge, the revenge of others may seem a bit overpowering; it is easy to laugh; <br /> <br /> Let's also note that while he is in no hurry but with André's colleague and regular sidekick, ongoing attacks often cease to be very funny. Beauty, nightmare and sleep.
