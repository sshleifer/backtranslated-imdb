Believe it or believe it, in 12 minutes this movie is a full-length movie (1912). Very, very few movies were later longer, but this is not strange, it sets out the rest of the only small movie! No, what's different is that all the actors (except for a frog) bugs ... yes, mistakes! This simple, small, local comedy could have been regarded as products like Chaplin, Laurel, and Hardy, or Max Linder, but instead, the Russian product uses bugs (or I think that looks like bugs). Chaplin, Laurel, and Hardy have not been discovered yet, and I thought Linder was busy, maybe that's why they used the mistakes! Using the stop-motion, the mistakes migrated and danced and incredibly well fought - a realistic heck than 21 years after King Kong! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a good time with Mr. Beetle. His wife, as if waiting at home, is almost like a club. But, unfortunately, Mr. Beetle, he was captured by a local film buff. Moreover, she does not know, but Mrs. Beetle falls on the bohemian locust artist. Of course, there is more to this local comedy, but the plot is great for elderly and adults and children. <br /> <br /> It is strange, but also very beautiful and can be watched.
