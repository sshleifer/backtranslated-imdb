I loved this movie for the first time since I first saw it in 1979. I still define how Kurt Russell described Elvis, his actions and facial expressions. Sometimes his fears, his appearance, look like elvis. Fortunately, this is aired on the DVD, so all of what we expect ultimately can have a great quality version of the movie. I've heard some detectors or some detectors, but I think that it was only 2 1/2 hours to work with John Carpenter and I remember it on television (two years after Elvis's death!) Doing a great job. Actually, I did not see an Elvis movie that was approaching each other. Be advised.
