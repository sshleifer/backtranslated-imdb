Everyone knows exactly about "time and love" by George Ede aka, father Fitzpatrick is on the move, you have to be? When they were released, were they talking to Charlie and Annna in the church? If I have to rent the movie. It was a great movie. Serendipity liked it too! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met a true love (my Soulmate), and although I had the experience to meet him at least while I was waiting, I was not ready for such emotional relationships. <br /> <br /> Of course, we were married, and I was not competent enough to give as much as I thought. I was satisfied with myself and deserved my love and opposed it for 7 years. <br /> <br /> He is finally embarrassed, but still frustrated and angry and is blaspheming on the occurrence. <br /> <br /> This film is a lot of things, because I'm still waiting for a deal with me and only true love. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> DOUBLE! THE BEST IS OUR LIFE. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the Bible writers and Bible Students are proud! This film is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth the wait, whatever happens, it will be! Nothing is possible, even if it's your second time around! Thank you!
