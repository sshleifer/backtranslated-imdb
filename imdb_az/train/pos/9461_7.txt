Steve Carell is a person who can connect Dan to a movie that he / she likes in a real-life movie that is not going to love me. It's just a great heart that the movie laughs loud. Like all of us, Steve Carell, fans of this Bureau will not want to see him, but you know, I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell, stars like Dan Burns, who is a widow's father who really does not love her. One weekend, she goes to see her and her daughters. When he was there, he went to a bookstore and falls into a woman. <br /> <br /> Dan is on the road, and sometimes I find that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) is a little incredible with this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). Does Burns really come together to play board games and make many other people able to do something? I'm very skeptical. I do not know such a family. Does this give me a thumb? <br /> <br /> In the real life of Dan: *** / ****
