Blood Castle (Demon Lover Scream, Blood Altar, Ivanna - the best, but the least exploited movie maker name, etc.) is a very traditional Gothic Romantic movie. That is a great, creepy castle, a foolish young woman, a mysterious old man, with horror and supernatural advice and romantic elements in the modern sense of the genre period. It is also deliberately tempoed and means that the movie will work well for the terrible saga, which is a great snare. <br /> <br /> If you love movies like Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963), but at the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, you enjoy the Spanish and Italian horror, and you can enjoy Blood Castle. <br /> <br /> Baron Janos Dalmar (Carlos Quiney) lives in a large castle on the edge of a traditional unspecified European settlement. Indigenous people were afraid of it because the legend was lying on a woman, and soon after her death - a certain thing that put dogs on her. This is a great problem, because the baron has a very good appetite for women. At the start of the film another woman was killed and wounded. <br /> At the same time Dr. Dr. Ivanna Rakowsky (Erna Schürer) wanted to be taken to Baron. The castle of Dalmar. Except for a city that is hired by Baron for chemistry experience. Of course, nobody wants to go to the castle. Finally, Ivanna finds a shady person (even a cadet) to take him. A single woman living in the castle, Olga (Cristiana Galloni), rejects Ivanna and says she should not be there because she is a woman. Baron Dalmar is crucial that he will remain. He remains, but a little reluctant. <br /> <br /> The Baron attempted to rebuild the impact of the heavy burning of Baron's brother Igor. Unfortunately, Baron's brother is strange, dark liquid. Moreover, Ivanna lives in strange and imaginary dreams. What happens only in the tower? Baron is responsible for the crimes? Is that crazy? <br /> <br /> I want the Blood Castle to be more than mine. As I mentioned, the film is very intentional in its pacing and is very simple. I can go in such a way. I'm not a negative to Haunting (yes, I'm a very small minority), but I think it's a great fear in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava. From that time I love Dario Argenton's work. Sometimes sometimes Blood Castle was a little slower for me. <br /> <br /> Ivanna scenes have a lot of interesting conversation scenes that slowly go through the hallways of the castle. <br /> <br /> But the film's atmosphere is worth it. Director Jose Luis Merino managed more than a successful set of places and places and was drawn very well by Emanuel Di Cola. However, Blood Castle feels a relatively low budget, and is then a movie produced by Roger Corman (usually low-budget, often surprisingly high-quality quickie). That's why there is a sign of Bava colors and complex set of decoration trees, everything is more minimalistic. Of course, the following Retromedia print does not look like a 30-year-old photograph that has been left in the sun for too long. <br /> <br /> Merino and Di Cola have sometimes created fantastic images. For example, Ivanna had an exaggerated point of departure in a dark corridor, and only a wall of shadows was just a characteristic element. <br /> <br /> The audience is pretty good and women are very good and women are very good and women are very good, especially Schürer - very attractive. Merino uses this truth by combining a fair amount of nudity. Schürer went to shoot many films like very gentle egg pornos, as with other genres, Sex Life (1974), Naked and Lustful (1974), Strip Nude (1975) for Your Killer) and Sexy Seducer's erotic exploits (1977 ). Blood Gala is very tamer, but in addition to ugliness, there are soft scenes that still offer aggression and bondage, and of course there are scenes of mixing sex and death. <br /> <br /> The original attraction here is probably a romance that is so slowly lit as something else. Elements of horror, mystery elements, and slightly unexpected curvature close to the end, but Sonda Blood Castle is a couple of love and amazement (often physical threats or damages).
