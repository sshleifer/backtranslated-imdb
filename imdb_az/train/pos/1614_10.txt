There is nothing about Moonstruck. I'm from an Italian family living in New York and want to marry a little while watching her. Actors and actresses, plot, subplots, humor .. they were all fantastic. It starts a little slower, but many things happen in two days! According to this movie, I fell in love with LaBoehe. Moonstruck is number 3 on your favorite movies. At the stage where you left this "good feeling", you repeat your "lover" or one of your favorite lines: "Old man, I eat another piece of these dogs and hit you until you die"; "Chrissy, bring me a big knife," "who is dead," and "you love Loretta ..... because you're good because they know they're crazy about you." I always put Moonstruck because there is nothing good to watch because it makes me happy.
