Well, this is a Ivan Reitman movie. With a rare exception, Ivan loves to entertain. His films are not generally "deep" but they often have enough fun. My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me so much that I laughed more than I thought. Uma Thurman is very spectacular and I love his paintings. I also love Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a flat dream. I'm not serious about it, the movie goes upstairs and is not very unique, nor is it anyone's going to the previous place .... this is a nice rental and I do not want an OK history film headache and brain shake. This refuge is fun and there is nothing wrong with it. When you get away from things like "Super-Girl," you're a story about relationships and relationships have worsened. A boy meets a girl, the girl leaves her alone. And in the end, characters are looking for love. All of them are "poured out", as well as a wrapped life span.
