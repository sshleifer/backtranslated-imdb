Yes, I'm telling you that DVDs can be finally released. <br /> <br /> According to my humble opinion, this is Errol's most fun movie, especially with the release of "Gentleman Jim" Corbett's ring career. <strong> </ strong> </ em> <br /> <br /> <strong> I think this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe. You can feel how much fun you are here. Ward Bond really liked the role that John L. Sullivan played. Bond was not good either. <br /> <br /> Boxing scenes here are just the right amount, and they do very well. Corbett's family is entertaining to watch Jim's matches on the stands as well. Outside the Arena, the Corbett family's constant arguments and shouts can be heard a little bit, and can be happy, but they can bring the scene to a fitting conclusion. <br /> <br /> And Sallivan's speech in Corbett after a great deal of fighting is a feature of the film and much of it. Some rumor critics (Variety, for example) did not like this end, or most of the film is not so-forth, but most of the films are similar or unique. And in this case, a beautiful story and a wonderful ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very gentleman who spoke very softly, not like Flynn's drawings, Flynn is still a good man). <br /> <br /> This is one of my more entertaining classic movies. I have never watched it and I look forward to the DVD.
