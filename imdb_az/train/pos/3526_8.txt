There he is spying on a woman in a similar emotional state and looking for some companionship, asking them to present themselves in a club to solve their problems. When he agrees, but with the condition to keep their names in their possession. So, when Scott arrives home, he finds the cops waiting to ask. His wife was killed. Where did you come this evening at 8:00, asked the Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? She does not know the woman's name. Barman remembers Scott, but not woman. No taxi driver. Drummer in the club (Elisha Cook Jr.). Scott dancer, even wearing the same hat with a woman (although he did not admit it with her). Something goes on, but no matter what Scott is, he is incapable of defending himself for trial, and his death sentence (the most delicate 'evidence' in the history of Hollywood). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Phantom Lady " The schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in the Black Angel and Leopard Manda In addition, Rendezvous in Black and Bride Black are characterized by a characteristic of a lover or spouse who died in a pen that is not well-worn but in the right hands, hot spots, sad dialogue, the inconvenience in the narrative is not the point. <br /> <br /> This is Siodmak's first corpse, The Killers, Criss Cross, continued to distinguish himself, but he was perfectly integrated with cinematographer Woody Bredell (they were Christmas Holiday and The Killers.) There are several stories in the camera: one shot, a deteriorating spirit of a character, appears to be sitting in front of a 3-way mirror that offers many personalities. The same character as a craftsman, Van Gogh, portrays himself with his pounded ear hanging on the wall. But Siodmak and Bredell are actually looking at the noir when doing what the Phantom Lady does. All of them were released early in 1944; damp pavement, atmospheric bags and fear, sharp contrasting b & w, naked expression versions of the truth (while in Kansas, Scottish jail), lightweight balloons and so on. A magnificent picture to look at. /> <br /> Apart from Franchot Tone, the subject of the movie and the relative experience of the director (and probably the budget) offer 'B' movie ambitions. I think the Tone was a bit smoother. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not much and actually comes in quite a few scenes. Ella Raines is very good (and pretty nice). With Elisha Cook Jr you need to be convinced that her "sexual scene" is so subtle. It's another scene when Kansas is going to ask for it from the barman. It is a street scene, because it can stop at a subway station by transferring it to the streets. <br /> <br /> <strong>
