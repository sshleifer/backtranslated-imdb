It was one of the best films in the 40's - Warner Bros. Photography by Sol Polito is undoubtedly the best accomplishment - beautiful compositions and lighting with subtle shade. Max Steiner creates one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of the classic leit motive. Music adds great emotion and excitement to music, and is subtle and memorable. Let's note that the same production team who made this film won the title of "Now Voyager". Note that, Bette Davis is a historically-featured movie that is credited with awards and prizes for playing his role. In my opinion, "Gay Sisters" is a better movie - better, in all sections, and more interesting, intricate and pleasing. The most unusual film, instead of designing its modern creative sensibilities or hyper-critical excellence and demanding standards, enthusiasts entertainers. Everything should be judged on the basis of its own time and effort, trying to obtain it. Most of the complaints I read in these analyzes are very childhood and completely disappear. If you are hungry for a great fillet mignon, do not go to the baker counters and start to squeak and suffer from egg sweets. The art of film criticism really lacks a large part of the population. I apologize - maybe this movie was a score by Rolling Stones and a hundred ink and soul search subplots, you would be happy to gladly. On the weekend, I will shoot an old film without claiming a modern intellectual!
