Twenty-five years ago I featured this film in Entomology in some children's classrooms and still remember the children's excitement; they were respectful! It is not just about other animals that use the height, but not the termites living and living in the Gil Castle. While watching the colony of Mongoos, a cobra monitor has a fantastic scene fighting the lizard. This is not good for entomology classes, but also about teaching ecology, termites and other organisms, and the whole ecology of all organisms living within and around the height. <br /> <br /> I wish I could have DVDs so I can watch it again and show others.
