Recap: There's nothing wrong with Louche's casino in Tanger. The casino is about to approach and is preparing for the next day. Leave the owner Louche and some staff leave at night, responsible for modesty. Suddenly shoot a gang of casino robbers, barefoot. Models are unknown, they have already killed Louchey and hid behind the money. But nobody is still alive, knows the code to open the casino in the casino. The box itself is drowned with explosives, and the attackers can not hit the door as planned. <br /> <br /> Please note that most of those angry few days ago, Blaise of Hate, neither saw nor read. The first point I want to make is this is a little unfairly classified. More importantly, this is the basic idea of ​​humility and of Miklos. Of course, there are some actions, but they are really an integral part of the story. <br /> <br /> As it is already mentioned, the main area and the main steadfast scene, Miklos. An innovative and interesting way of putting a backdrop of a character, and most of the story goes over the edge of the casino in the past. One says that this is almost like a pilot for a television series, and the feeling can really be used like this. But I felt that it was a better way of introducing more character than what they saw. <br /> <br /> I think of two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nicolay Coaster-Waldau. He did very well. The Staden, in particular, describes humility very well and is truly confident and talented. <br /> <br /> 7/10
