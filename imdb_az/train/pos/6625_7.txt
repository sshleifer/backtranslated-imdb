If you've ever seen the trailer for Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will never see this movie. Unfortunately, Renaissance has been the same trailers manufacturers. <br /> <br /> The story of the Renaissance refers to a detective who is involved in kidnapping a young woman and a medical investigator. The setting is a futuristic Paris, and elements of science fiction are intact. A special thing about the Renaissance, though, is his story, not his story. Renaissance is a 3D computer animation like Final Fantasy, but with ultra sharp contrast, black and white is stylized. The result is stunning (although 3D animation problems still vary from time to time: some robotic movements, lightweight wooden facial movements, etc.). Like a highly stylized, beautiful cinema, the Renaissance sees the audience astonishing. Story and writing, although not visually the same level. This is not a bad story (and, if you have not seen a trailer, it's more exciting than for me). However, this is a very non-genuine story, and puts a tax on the cornice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will consult Renaissance's friends that few lines of dialogue are desperate. Unlike anything I have seen before, it is a worthwhile experience that sees the vision and its uniqueness. Even though it's not perfect, this is a story that can be traced.
