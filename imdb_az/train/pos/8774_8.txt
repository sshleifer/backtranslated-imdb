At the end of the 1800s, San Francisco worked in a bank owned by Errol Flynn (like James J. Corbett) and participated in domestic "battles" (boxing), such as working and drinking friend Jack Carson (Walter Lowrie). One day, included in the Comstock Bank, where Mr Flynn works fine Alexis Smith (like Victoria Ware). Flynn is drawn with Mrs. Smith's elegant beauty, she offers to make money. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good work (in fact, the attempt of buying) gives him access to the Olympic Club. a comfortable gymnasium (with boxing equipment). However, Flynn's magnificent and practical joke (touching men on parallel bars) irritates the members of the Club. When the English boxing champion meets the club, members try to fight Flyn with the man. Flynn's defeat, hopeful Flynn will resign - Flynn is winning! <br /> <br /> For the first time producer Robert Buckner forms a wonderful package for Warner Brothers and director Raul Walsh. Mr. Buckner, of course, was in the brilliant "Yankee Doodle Dandy" studio of his success story (scenario). Unfortunately, this story is ridiculous. There was "Gentleman Jim" - the story was the film of the essay of the original James Corbett, "The Crowd" - but this film should be a matter of being so important. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very important person; he maneuvered the scenario lightly and was recognized as a perfect actor in the early 1940s. Many of Flynn's characteristics (who?) Were inevitable as great demonstrations, and that's one of them. Smith invites invitations to the audience as she is interested in. Director Walsh ensures smoothness and smoothness. (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
