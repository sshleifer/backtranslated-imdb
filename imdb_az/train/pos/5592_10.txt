It is famous for bringing the world to Hedy Lamarr and full frontal nakedness, but oh much more. In fact, this is one of the pinnacles of kinematic poems, with some of the 1930s, with the same influential group as Paris, Tabu, Olympia and even L'Atalante. Based on his fantastic, symphonic account by Giuseppe Becce, he is nearly silent on his miraculous descriptions. A masterpiece of art and film art, yes, editing, direction, writing and acting. The good 90% of the film is perfectly moving. Machining looks like an expert in using motifs. Perhaps it is not as subtle as possible and maybe a bit modest, but the appearance of objects such as insects, light and horses carries the story in a beautiful way. A little walk of dialogue, thank goodness, not surprising. They can not imagine that they can imagine. To say the least bit, the last bit is very strange. We have workers assembly reminding the silence of the Russians. It is only logical in this understanding, but it's done in a very good way so I refuse to tear it down too much. Ecstasy is a reality film. This is one of the best films ever.
