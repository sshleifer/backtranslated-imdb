Only 7 or 8 people will receive me if this movie really does not see the trailer or if it does not have any information about the movie. <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments briefly and saw that others have the same experience as it was almost a surprise. like me and just recommended to watch it. Good advice. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez, a coaching trainer, is a successful, intelligent television programmer, playing with a joke created by co-worker. Seriously the Russian Roulette. The story follows a documentary style behind it to succeed.
