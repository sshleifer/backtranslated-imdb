For the first time I saw this movie at the festival. There were a lot of good movies, but many of them had long ago thought about me and Insomniac's Nightmare was one of them. Tess is definitely a talented film director. Shooting was great. Casting was perfect. Dominic shone in perfectly prepared role. There was not much to know about her character, but we wrote the story with care. And Ellen - I will not wait to see where it ended! She shows a lot of talent, and I hope she will shoot a few films. With all million dollar budgets trying to earn a cheap excitement, Tess shows that there is a good story and something that is not needed as long as the actors. Kudos, everyone joined this movie. And thanks to Tess and cooperation. to spread it on the DVD!
