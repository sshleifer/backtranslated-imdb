Another comment about this film sounded so bad. The pictures were very new - I think that the script and acting were good. Davis was young and fresh. He did not find the way we expected. <br /> <br /> Many films came from this movie and, as we can see, this film has been on some roads over the next 70 years. My voice sees it and remembers how old this movie is. Soak up and open and perhaps you are shocked by how difficult the characters in this picture feel about the early part of the last century since 1934 .. I love it, and hope that you will influence your thoughts on it by comments and comments from others.
