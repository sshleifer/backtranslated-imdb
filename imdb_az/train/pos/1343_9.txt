Thre is not a Scorsese movie I've ever had in my favorite movie list. But this is the best thing I've had in my DVD player for about five years. Scorsese's sophisticated movie moments and how Hollywood works are extremely gracious, calm and clever. <br /> <br /> 3 DVDs are material value. Because everything about the American corporate culture would be silent, methodical, fraudulent, and content-based content. But an American production could have demanded that she just loved movies that were popular favorites. I wish everyone would take one page from film love. For personal, dreamy, and special reasons, you should love the movies you love. For more "Thefather", "Me-too" sounds and so on. People have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite films. Movies are more interesting if they do. Scorsese knows that his ideas are being explored and makes him an attractive subject in this regard. <br /> <br /> Over the last ten years, I really appreciate his expressive, courageous interviews. <br /> <br /> In a negative note, Scorsese is good at telling you a good thing, when you are really excited to show a dark movie about movie history. I want that three ends out of the nose bridge. Very exciting.
