True classic. Beautiful film shot and moved. It reveals a Parisian region that is alive and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the 'Hotel du Nord' and the hotel itself are still there, it is not as delicious as gay (literally). The film has been lost for over a year, with a loss of breath and bitterweetness.
