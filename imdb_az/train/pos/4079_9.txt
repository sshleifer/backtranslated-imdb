I first saw this movie in England (called Laupta: The Flying Island) at the age of 8. I totally liked it and after a while it was lost heart failure and missed it. I was stupid with stories and characters, but the most notorious and beautiful music. Sometimes, as part of the costly expensive laser disc, it would be simply a true English dubbing version called "Non-Iron Dub" (dub really by Ghibli themselves and just spread by Streamline). According to some reports, Voice motion is ineffective, but there is no genuine "debate" in the dialogue, or the original Japanese has the same raw energy and I think that James Van Der Beek's management is very old to play. They made some trivial changes such as changing the name of the main king from "Pazu" to "Patzu" and added some dialogues. But the worst thing is that they have violated many scenes with interference music - for example, the opening scene of the conductors was first silent, but not everyone is talking to Disney's moronic request <br /> <br /> This movie is still the latest animated and capture his films, and I can not recommend it enough. The site is simple, yet attractive and the film is a poor man, unfortunately, disappearing from the most modern mass market, homogenized animation.
