"Frailty" is actually a psychological thrilling film. A film of fear has all the trash, but it is not. "Frailty" is a film that accepts religion and makes the difference between right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Frailty, a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons, are God's works. It is worth mentioning that they are the trinity of malicious serial killers called "God's Hands". The father is killed by some "terrible" ways when he and his sons are doing what God does and what they do. He claims that he received a message from an angel who specifically instructed him to remove the demons living on earth. God gave a list instead of his names and his "services"; he and his sons will be given protection, mainly the police will not be able to capture them. We see all of them worrying about us. However, these two sons, especially the eldest son, are really worried about Adam. Adam himself doubts the existence of the supreme being, that is, he changes everything in his father and a weekly basement. She knows that her father has been unconscious, and what his younger brother Fenton has done is convinced. Fenton does the same thing as the other half of this puzzle. He seems to be in a hurry in the world of God's father and the demons. In my opinion, she is very young and easily impressed. But everything that happens in these three events is quite convincing, in fact, very convincing. <br /> <br /> The events in the film can be seen as a live hallucination by three main characters. I say that because each one responds differently to the situation and at one point in which everyone claims to see God. Dad sees offenses as the first task. His "task" finally consumes him and soon becomes a turmoil to overcome the demons. In fact, its hallucination is the first. His "commands" and his list of names are part of this hallucination. Take a look at the scene where you find the ax on the bar to understand where I am. His younger son, Fenton, is easily affected by all these demons and destruction conversations. Being so young, it's easy for her father to be trapped. Adam, in the other, doubts his father's actions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> During a while, when the father was killed towards the end of the movie, hallucination ends. (How and under what circumstances can I say)? But I would say it is not welcome. After his death, he is moving so fast. (The story is explained through flashbacks, as seen in the eyes of his old son Adam). In fact, Fenton explains the story, not Adam. The story is explained in the way it accepts it with its actions and actions of its brother. Fenton went crazy and continued his father's tracking of the FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Religion is a key issue in this film because the film shows how easy it is for religion. misinterpreted by those who do not fully understand. Before the father found his new job, he did not have a deep understanding of religion and generally did not believe in a higher being. His sons Fenton and Adam frequently chanted church hymns for innocent little children, but apparently did not clearly understand what these words were. After coming to the new post of Father, both of them separated from each other - Adam Fenton was suspiciously suspected of being a high being when he was being driven to his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very good tension that creeps up your excitement, watching it alone.
