Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are good, but what makes this neo-noir juicy Hopper creepy, violent character and JT Walsh's sneakiness <br /> <br /> A drifter becomes a mistake for a hit man and is a little <br /> < br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie that Cage went to Wyoming for a drill, drilling, his friend ... and the opening scene of Brokeback Mountain, when the characters did the same! But this is another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is the best one here ... a step ahead of foreign, seething and explosive violence. <br /> <br /> JT Walsh (RIP), as well as a dark past, is trying to live legitimately (well, almost) well. <br /> <br /> Here's only 4 real characters, Red Rock, a lawmaker working in Wyoming. The first twist gets early and there is a wonderful neo-noir adventure in the little town of some dream. Happiness. 8 points.
