This is actually a trilogy of Somerset Maugham's 3 tales. The first is Verger, about 15 minutes long and very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman was dismissed from the church because he could not read or write. What does he do? Of course, it opens a tobacco shop! <br /> The second was a story I read 6 years ago and was Mr. Know-All until I heard the familiar, instantly-used application. The other 15 minutes is also very good. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> It's just about an hour long, it just drags. Everything is not bad, as it is in the last 2, it's fast and lifeless. I watched the first quarter watch and went on to the last Tuesday, and still saw it as logical and really did not miss me. <br /> <br /> So I gave them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10.
