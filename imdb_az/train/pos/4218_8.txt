I've seen lots of Columbo movies too ... In fact, I've looked at this one though, although I only have one or two. I always liked Columbo, though I did not see much of it at all. Peter Falk is always the perfect choice for the character because of his appearance, voice and charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the series was re-launched in 1968, the most recent (and probably not last) movie in 2003 is 35 years. First, Falk took 40 times. Serial consists of 68 films (except for my account), all of which are for TV. Although nobody has seen a film in the movie, everyone knows this character. If you ask me, this is a very good job. The area is pretty good. The only problem with this is the emergence of murder and murder at the outset (though it's all the same for all Columbo films), it's no secret, but it's hard not to wait until Columbo decides it. Pacing is a good, challenging scene, you're bored. The actor is very good, especially Falk and Ruth Gordon. There are some dialogues in the film. The characters are well-written and valid. Dialogue and script are something unusual for television. All this is good for a movie, yes, a striking television movie, and absolute value for any fan of Columbo and / or crime / mystery flicks. 8/10
