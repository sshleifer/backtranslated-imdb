First, it is odd that the average user does not appreciate the user's imagination. This show is a hyper-reality that creates a unique one. It is not necessary to know why Ned could bring people back from the dead, or for a minute. <br /> <br /> I have seen the miracle of screaming tricks in childhood, and often look like a ghost. <br /> <br /> I say that this is a fresh one, because it is polar opposite to the majority of the television audience. <br /> <br /> It is nice to add a little run to television experience. <br /> <br /> The Hyper Reality Show is my favorite party. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Living and innocent, <br /> <br /> This demonstration is to disguise the morbid nature of death,. Though fun, other television shows took the back shelf for this series. <br /> <br /> Daisies quickly put on my black list.
