I complained about abolishing ABC at six degrees. If you find enough people to be the same, it is enough to bring this spectacular show to life! Just go to the official site and the rest are simple. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and symbols. The whole concept runs out of sight! I was surprised that my favorite show ended in just one row. Why is this? Six degrees extraordinary, there are better than many other television programs out there! It did not tell me that this could happen before a friend heard a call from him.
