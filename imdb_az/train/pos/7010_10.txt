Before seeing this movie, I see a lot of comments that everyone has a good view of the good or bad ... <br /> <br /> I really want to note that Woody Harrelson may not be in many parts of the movie, but it looks and When presented, Will Smith and Woody Harrelson were surprised by the message, and they tried to create the whole area until they really understood it. <br /> <br /> I am not a very sincere person, I believe in a good conscience, not a conscience. But there is one action to compensate, and there are not many films that can show it in my point of view. <br /> <br /> I agree with the views of a person who reflects the signs of "suicide" in this film, but I do not believe that the movie is a "message". trying to send, but "sacrifice." <br /> <br /> This film has the potential. The script is incredible, giving value to every penny. If you love drama from a man who does not want to watch drama films, it should be watched.
