May and her husband will go to visit their children and grandchildren. The lunch and the "children" are very worried about the trip, unless you actually see each other waiting. The heat there is missing. After dinner, Mine said her husband did not feel good, accused her of eating her daughter, and wanted to go home hungry. That night he will die. <br /> <br /> Missing a widow in May. He did not have a careful marriage or a very interesting event, but he had one goal. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Shortly after her mother's arrival After a while, she stayed with her daughter Paula, telling her mother that she did not feel very much herself. She is anxious about not educating her mother. Despite disarmament and surprise in May, he does not have the energy or the ability to do it right. "I am your mother and I love you". What does he say? (I've heard it many times from my own way and did not understand what it means). Paula is a little (well, slightly) neurotic. <br /> <br /> Paula is in contact with her son's friend, Darren, who works as a son in her son's home. When Paula works throughout the day, May begins talking to Darren and lunch. <br /> <br /> Darren is married with his autistic son, Nicky, and his wife, but does not sit at home with his wife. <br /> <br /> Liquid, He has a connection as seen. Darren was involved in May because she offers a peace and understanding that can not be taken away from other women in her life. (He is also interested in the money he says he / she can afford to "get away from it all", although he / she does not care about joining it in such a journey, and that they will not wait or even expect a woman to be in the reserve room during the day and in May, Paula often tells her that Paula will leave her married Darren, part of this mines rationalization. <br /> <br /> Paula's writing group, May, is applied, but is combined with an unwanted widow <br /> <br /> Finally, as Paula's a little strange relationship, we see common hatred on the Mayan surface, and many graphic sketches performed by her mother have really been her mother and Darren. <br /> <br /> The film will surely be seen by a large number of people, and the recommendations will be divided, at one point, Paula <br /> <br /> Of course, a good mother does not want to leave one child while on the way to a local pub, while she is feeling that she hates her until the end of the day and returns home after leaving her home. But in the film, she first found out that her husband was not a friend, so there was nothing. He did whatever he wanted. He was angry, but he said, "It's easier than ever," because he got up with him. Although she is not the best mother of May, she is a woman who wants to be mere sexuality and want to live for "a few minutes" for her lifetime, until she finds any sympathy for her. <br /> <br /> He wanted someone to listen to him, to be a woman friend and lover who wanted to introduce him as a human being. <br /> <br /> Paula, although neurotic and unhappy, may have been far removed from her parents. Of course, it is not difficult for Paula to know exactly what his mother had done. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, which is more complicated than I mentioned and, of course, many, perhaps controversial, reactions from the audience. <br /> <br /> Whatever the film has left us is a fear and a fear of a single life. Anyone who is considered "correct" or "wrong" by every viewer, old age and loneliness is inevitable, in most of us the feeling of fear.
