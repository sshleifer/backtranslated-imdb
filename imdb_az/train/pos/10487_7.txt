Saving Grace is a good movie with the right heart. Grace recently had a widow and left her husband's wife with many debts. She can lose her beloved home and see no solution to her anxiety that begins with growing cannabis. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers want to live, and many are good people who think that the villagers like their neighbors as their neighbors. There is something wrong with this picture, and it portrays the effect of cannabis on the user. None of the actors and writers of this film actually had a drink. It is ridiculous and only ridiculous that villagers behave when they smoke together. The scenes that are replaced by the true English slapstick and, in a clear film, are, unfortunately, less unpleasant.
