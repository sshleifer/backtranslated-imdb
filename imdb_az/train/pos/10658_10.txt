I just saw this movie when I was 10 years old. I remembered all these years so I did not sleep for a week or more after seeing. It just hit me completely. At Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter wants me to get a copy of her maturity. I did a lot of research to find out which film was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was there, and finally managed to get his name and analysis. I really liked it, but I was very scared! Jaqui
