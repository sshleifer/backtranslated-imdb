I saw half of the last year's movie, and finally, I was so happy to be able to find it on the DVD. Recently ranging in PBS and so on. I watched a series of real-life series. None of these were close to explaining the story as a movie. Based on the REAL reality, no fist, a dark, happy, tragic and enlightened way to be shown to anyone who is interested in students or early border life. Add a good script that works well on both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell part. The opening credit also indicates that it has been funded by the National Fund for Humanity. If he had this product tax, he would be happy to see more. I strongly recommend it and encourage people to tell a friend if you see him and enjoy the movie.
