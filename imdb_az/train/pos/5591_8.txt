The alternative name of Ecstasy is the Love Symphony; a theme that accurately describes the mood and feel of the film. Ecstasy was an early writer and could have been a classic movie if it was released during a silent film. This film is a visual cure and deliberately designed to capture the sensitive lyrical quality that the viewer provides with an artistic low key fashion. The director's style is clear in Europe. Theme and sexuality were more complicated than those produced in Hollywood. Consider the censorship code in the US in the 1930s, which is quite a few. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauty of all time, is a perfect choice for this "Symphony of Love".
