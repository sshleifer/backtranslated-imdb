I've seen this movie a year ago and found out that Laugh-Out-Loud is completely funny. Real winner, I'm in my mind. It was a stupid comedy's emphasis, but it was a truth. In fact, like a hit comedy, like Elf. There were many serious moments, sandwiched between dissatisfaction. When the styles hit the black horse, you laugh at your bumbling antiques in a usual moment. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many people do something that they do not want to know about a friend, and your friendship will not end. <br /> <br /> How many people did not like this movie, I missed it completely. Totally awful movies like Napoleon Dynamite surprised me at the IMDb's mind. Take your advice and take it for lease. If you laugh at least once, I will compensate for rent. = D
