The problem is that the movie was put on the clothes of the concept that created the 60th edition of comic books, which could only be used as a "camp" for television and film (ie the 60th Batman show). So in an album, Monk Mayfair ends with the second bad man enclosing gold as a Herve Villechez, which creates for an Oscar status for albums (come), albums (come!), A scene that guarantees each night to give each other a night. <br /> <br /> Even in this movie there is nothing like this movie is absolutely fine. Providing a very accurate presentation of the pulp when it is fun and serious. As noted earlier, except for Monk: it is very fat, not too muskled. <br /> <br /> <strong> Life is a companion. I recommend for kids. But they are very close to the feelings of the pulp. When writers and producers follow the right path, they will guide it - I will give it to them. <br /> <br /> But Reeves's first two Superman films, although manufacturers have prepared Doc with loving care and scripting, I think we'll be able to do it later. The problem is that the film is schizophrenic. Trying to do the 30th class, but they also try to give Batman a "hero's camp" position. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, there was a one-month, pulp-style first project, and then someone came in and said: "Hey, come on, it's funny - it worked with Batman 8 years ago!" <br /> Doc lives with Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch does not respect Doc Savage in this movie, the guy is really demented. So, the series really will live on TV (alleged mid-season '99 -00 '), up to 90 Doc Savage once again.
