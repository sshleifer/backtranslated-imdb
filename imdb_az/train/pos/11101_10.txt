Sopranos were probably the last best show in the 90s. it was a sad one, it was the best show on HBO or TV, and everything was not written to you, it was brilliant, for you had to think. Casting was very nice. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and has played a lot of good things, as well as others. Each character has some defects that made them real and allowed them to communicate with the audience, and it lasted for a long time. The last episode was good, but I do not know how to get so different things that Tony did not die, sat on the meadow and sat down with them, and the only tension in darkness. Tony should go to court and I do not feel like he is dead ... Long life Sopranos and Toni Soprano live .......
