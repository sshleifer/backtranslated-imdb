No one could argue that this was a 1945 war movie. (Can a war film in 1945 be a work?) And, with regard to the Guadalcanal, Al Schmidt spent some days in the curtain to capture the nuances, as Mr Garfild played. actions of a blind person. Robert Leckie, in his book The Helmet for Pillow, sang to the murdered foxhole's wife, who wrote that Shmid should "need the country's heroes." <br /> <br /> No, I think the country did it. And there was one here. The film, only ten minutes in the studio, has a single battle scene and more than half of the movie takes up less than half, but this is the most cowardly and most accurate image of men. I remember the screen, including the "Special Ryan Storage" under fire. <br /> <br /> From the technological point of view, men are frightened, cry out to each other and to the enemy, without color, stereophonic sounds, screams or eyes, bleed and die. movie is outstanding. It is not only a mechanism to learn how complicated the 30-minute, water-cooled Browning machine is, or how to shoot in several rounds, or not as a fire. hose, as in many other battle movies. Technical accuracy is added to the riveting quality of the scene. The need to remain committed to small explosions is terrible when it's about fifty feet away from a few terrifying enemies, when you and your two isolated spouses get away with placing a small weapon. <br /> <br /> The audience is strong, not brave, including everywhere the 1940s, including John Ridgeley and the radiant, young Eleanor Parker. The obvious love story is reserved, but it works and ultimately moves. Includes a stunning dream sequence. It's not the builder, but it's genuine and effective for a regular 1945 movie. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have written on the scripts or can be changed by someone else. He could use some pruning that could lead to some uncertainty. Still, there are some bizarre verbs with a striking effect on the viewer: "Why does not God kill me?" And "Lee's eyes, look into my eyes!" The depths of pain in a few sad words. The striking bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in the war film shot in 1945. <br /> <br /> A lively, but perhaps unnecessary note to a contemporary viewer is that it is difficult to believe that many of today's children are thinking of "drips", "gee", "untidy suits", "iron", "swollen" a man "and" sorry for you ". Let's look at the historical context and be kind to our judgments. At that time, some of these lobe tongues were advanced. <br /> <br /> Real weak points? The wounded veterans come together and discuss how much their collective future is, and even though they are in a complete line in sequence, "Since you're a silver plate in your head, I think you're a bad person." Sometimes silent voices and silent prayers are both unnecessary and open -It's pretty unpleasant. "Please, God, come back to me" and something like that. <br /> <br /> Good filmmakers acted in their own restrictions. Perhaps this is the last fade in the Independence Hall shoots and inspires the races that inspire American Beauty. <br /> <br /> None of these can undermine the film's benevolence, especially the terrible battlefield. Not often on television. If you have a chance, do not hold him.
