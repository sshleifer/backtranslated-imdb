A delicate film about finding some happiness in everyday life. Pacing, camera work, emotion, haunting music account and the pure charm of this picture show that you need to see it. It is not judged easily by those who are easily or emotionally twisted. The only drawback I have about this film is that it is not technically perfect. Todd-AO, Technicolor, and the best sound format available (an intimate film can be prepared in seventy millimeters). The influence of Italian villas on the inhabitants would be more lushly and smaller favorite moments would have been. Beautifully seen and heard. Well, it still needs attention like a cute little movie. Whenever the satellites come, I can not keep watch over it. <br /> <br /> Heroism, intense and dissatisfaction is always a joy to watch, and I should really recommend it more frequently. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, and the player is superior to the player. A film about the medieval and people's choice. It is a deep and thoughtful thing without a heavy hand. Look at a seating area and report its impact. If you do not get it, perhaps we've had enough or something else wrong with you.
