It's incredible, Gojoe flick with a passive message that moves an Anime and Hong Kong-inspired samurai. This child of the film is effectively portrayed by the hero (a great work assignment by Daisuke Ryu), depicted by murder-boddhist monk Benkei. <br /> <br /> <strong> Benkei swore to kill again, but he still has a sword to fight against a devil occupation ... <br /> <br /> Gojoe is difficult to judge. Visual footage is stunningly designed and beautiful, but very cunning (circular cameras and high speed drives, expressionist shots, colored colors, digital effects, etc.), so the result is extremely tedious. That is, the beginning and the end of the film are stylish and powerful. Only the director Sogo Ishii would be wise enough to avoid the sack of his craft. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a film with such an anti-violent message, Gojoe uses a lot of energy and screen time to describe endless combat scenes. In addition, the way the violence is always at the edge of being attractive; In fact, a blood bath against night sky appears to be one of the signature images. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly and tragic aspect of violence. Still, Ishii is not convinced that there is a traditional action movie or a deep moral allegory. The audience can not be sure about it until the end of the movie. Although powerful (cynical), Gojoyu rescues; emphasizes that this movie is more than just a fest.
