I know many people have a special love for the story of Dickens' story of Alistair Sim, but this will defeat this 1984 version for me. My husband and I have a copy of this movie in the VHS and watch together on the eve of each Christmas. <br /> <br /> <strong> Talking about the past. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> is moving. I think he has a speech at Patton. The spirits are all effective, and each one is more crawling than the last. Although the Christmas Spirit looks in the form of a dark, floating, skeleton, Bride blows on my back every year. And what a player that supports it! In particular, David Warner is a high form of spouse as Susannah York as Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> I remember that this version is closer to the others, but I can be wrong because it's been a few years since I read it. Regardless, this is a terrific Christmas classic.
