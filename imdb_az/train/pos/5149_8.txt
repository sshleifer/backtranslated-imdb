This is a brilliant documentary drama covering a new ground, rebuilding all the kits and relying on the truth. For example, Munich is a very straightforward city. Why is there a hill in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 did not surrender, but only one Armenians. However, it is declared surrender. For example, European news providers did not (and did not) close their headlines when they were confused with their documents. But in the film, this serious American work is done. For example, the Nazis did not accept the German Eagle, but after coming to power, Hitler introduced him as one of the root winding devices. Indeed, the majority of this frustration is less than Hitler's longing. The film also carries myth that the beer hall is hatched at putsch Munich Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlyle makes a beautiful picture of the subject. But his supporter is not the best and often the same. These comments are based solely on the first episode. The first one can only hope that the latter will be better, but do not put it on top.
