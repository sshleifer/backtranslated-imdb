Despite this obvious budget, it is worthwhile to speeches and songs in this movie. Walken's is one of several musical roles so far. (He is a wonderful dancer and singer and his acrobatic skills - watch for cartwheel!) Jason Connery also plays a leading role. A great child story and a very favorite character.
