An unpleasant addition to Graham Greene's kinematic canon - his perceived mistakes can now be regarded as virtues. Director Shumlin, the theater director, frames his movement with a material-coated density of media and offers compositionally-preserved compositions compulsively. Both a dark tension and a story of moral upheaval (a 40-year-old tension for female character), a perpendicular hero, returning to the terrible and bloody (and possibly paedophiliac), brings far-reaching ideologies of the Spanish Civil War into a dangerous reality, a horrible crime , the stunning insights into class and capitalism, intelligent theatrical metaphors, Greene's rare proximity to God, and only a happy ending when you do not know anything about history.
