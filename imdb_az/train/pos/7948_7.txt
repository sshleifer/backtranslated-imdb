I have not seen the original "Amazing Journey" since I was a kid, so I really can not compare two versions. This version explains a cat that left his family together with his fellow villagers, with three animals, two dogs and a cats, when his father had to go to San Francisco to work on a new job. <br /> <br /> This story could easily be shot as a cartoon, but both versions are actually alive, moving movies using real animals. One big difference is that in the next version of animals, a person speaks with his own voice and does not give his personality anything in the original film. (A similar chat device was also used in other recently-featured child racing films such as "Racing Stripes"). Some critics are quite strange about the use of this device, but in my opinion, giving different identities of animals helps to reinforce the film rather than reinforce the film. Animals were named by the great names stars, Don Ameche, Michael J. Fox, and Sally Fields. <br /> <br /> Both dogs are men and their connection is parallel to many people in their "friend-friendly" films. A golden retriever shade, intelligent, old old dog; The chance is young, rough, rude and impulsive. Chance for English eyes looks like a boxer, but is actually American Bulldog, a different breed of English brother. Sassy cat is a pretty prize and a good-looking woman. She is very proud of her status as a cats, her eyes are superior to any dog. <br /> <br /> In terms of competence, there are some mistakes in the film; it can be artificial, some events (like animals attacking a mountain lion on a river) are incredible and human symbols are completely unforgettable. However, it's mostly a movie directed at children and I doubt that she will love it. Of course, any animal-loving child will do it. (Some professional critics, James Berardelli's comments on reducing the "fame" of the film, professional critics are not always the best instructor for children's films.) <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Heroic heroes of the film face the dangers such as the moon, the mountain lion, and the porcupines in the desert, and the excitement is a very unpleasant family movie 7/10
