Scoop *** out **** Woody Allen is not my favorite director, but I enjoyed the "Match Point". Fortunately, Woody Allen was a beautiful dark romantic trance that did not make a star. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is the last film of Woody Allen, and this is one thing. <br /> <br /> Yohansson Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Plays a young college journalist, Sondra Pransky, who has a life-altering stomach. Joe listened to a boat with a bucket and the sticks that Reaper had taken to another band. One of those souls is Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) secretary. He tells Joe that Peter can become a serial killer in the streets of England. Joe returns to his life with a lifetime and gives this information to Sondra during a magical move. Sondra takes part in a magic show with magic Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). He volunteered to go to a disappearing box while entering a box and travels to Joe. <br /> <br /> This film is faced with a great sense of lightness and is still working compared to the Match Point. Johansson and Allen are doing great work together. Allen's humor is perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman, like the "suspect" serial killer Peter Layman. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie to see if anyone does not want to be watched. The casting ensemble works well and the story runs and you sometimes forget that Woody Allen follows you. I said, give it a chance because you can only do it.
