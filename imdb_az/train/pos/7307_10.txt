"The night came home," warned John Carpenter's horror stories of classic posters. In a small American city, attempts to trace Michael Myers' s sister, Laurie Strode, murderer of the animated cartoon, eliminates all her friends in this process ... Lauri's rescue for the seemingly complex Michael. In the 1990s, this cunning led to extreme horrors and continues today, as well as a bad remake in 2007. <br /> <br /> The difference between them and simply simply "Halloween" is the best. <br /> <br /> Designed on a very modest, tough budget ... Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned a sub-genre of "sex-strayed youths with a knife / ax / chain / psychology."
