This terrifying and strange adaptation of the great novel of Stephen King Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne and Denise Crosby, who died just a few years ago, and some really terrible effects. Conductor Mary Lambert, and this is not only a surprise, but also a few versions of the King's work. The zombie child is equally remarkable in the description of the child Gage (Miko Hughes, later "New Nightmare"). a terrible character has been dangerous and spooky.A. For those who do not think it's not cowardly (watching the dark girlfriend at the end), watch out for the dark alone, and I guarantee that the "Pet Sematary" will crawl, so many horror movies or "Texas chain massacre massacre" should not be watched. Recommended for horror supporters!
