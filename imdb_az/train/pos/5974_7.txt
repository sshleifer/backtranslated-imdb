When I watched the VH1's "100 Most Metal Moments", I heard about this movie. In the section, Gene Simmons (who is a fugitive) and several other interviews, discussed how terribly this film is. Unlike many people, I'm more interested in checking movies that are more laughable than a kinematic masterpiece. Since this kind of treatment is half an hour, I know that films are not as close as it is to people, and I love them more than ever before. It was my experience "Trick or Treat". Now it is difficult to shoot a film about a teenager who is receiving messages from a fatal heavy metal star because one of the grape notes can not be mocked in the premises. Of course, this is a strange place, but never before! Give cinematic points for originality for Pete! If you want to buy a DVD, do not be fooled by the thoughts of Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons, who have no prior information about the movie, stars. However, despite the unforgettable role of Simmons, there is a funny returning like Reverend (rightly speaking, a Miracle!) Speaking against Ozy heavy metal. The first thing is to see Özzy with short hair. And for something else, you can not help but mock laugh. Of course, this is a cheap shot, but it is effective. The player is pretty good. I found the hints convincing. The teenage symbols are a heartfelt cliché. So look forward to the style and style of the nerds. And like every one of these movies, a pretty girl is a good person who is sincere for the main character who is betrayed. Why does it first come out with such a tension? The field needs an obstacle. There is no other reason. But I can not deny that one of my guilty tricks will watch the bad lungs in this movie because I went to a high school. The film was of a great interest to me, but the third actor was very conventional and caused my eyes to move, because it could have been a more predictable situation. But the film is not bad at all and it's worth seeing on a rainy day. (From 7 to 7)
