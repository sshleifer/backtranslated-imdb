This is one of many recent films that have only recurring stars, less complications, and fuzzy feelings. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol, respectively) meet in a friend's marriage and start the process of organizing their marriage (unbeknowst). He has been married for two years and has been in a honeymoon camp for a while, and other couples also behave similarly. <br /> <br /> If you see Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq then have you seen it? this movie. Land plots are the same, there is no surprise element in the whole movie half hour. Everything is expected. At the beginning of the day, I was glad to see Darling (also playing Deol & Khan's chief roles) and talk about their chemistry, so when I said "why" I told her that I was renting our brother "Just married". <br /> <br /> Let's see it: Because Kirron Kher co-stars and his ordinary lover. <br /> <br /> Skip it: Because all this couple-fest nonsense !! <br /> <br /> C +
