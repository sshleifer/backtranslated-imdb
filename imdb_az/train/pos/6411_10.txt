This is one of the best military films ever made. And it's great to pay attention to values. <br /> <br /> Goodness and DeNiro are outstanding in leading roles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> It is wonderful to have Carl Brashear's racism of the master cheerful strongly and quickly, with respect and love, through respect. The title shows the source of their bonds. Carl Lumbly has not seen anything until recently, following how Carl's father Mac Brashear has been so brilliant. <br /> <br /> In a film shot by Carl's father, Memorial is a memorial to help pass through difficult times. <br /> <br /> I'm a picker for choosing movies. This is one of the rare ones I want on my shelf. I'm sure I'll be back in the future many times.
