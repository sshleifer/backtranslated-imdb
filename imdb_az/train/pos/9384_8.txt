Unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) wants to be honest, because "cowboy noir" is an excellent example of success in the business (he has a boom foot). She could not really do anything else, she decided to lie once. When entering a bus and making Wayne (late, big JT Walsh) owner Wayne's wrongdoing for a cunning employer to make her sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in fine form), Michael and Waynes agree. * Then she goes to Suzanna and tells her husband's intentions and accepts money to get rid of Wayne! <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Red Rock West . Written by his older brother, Rick, John Dahl was smart enough to realize the potential of a story in a truly isolated small town where he had seen better days and could be involved in any scheme of residents. When it comes to abandoning its principles and giving it a degree of self-esteem, honest people can have an attractive idea. At least, Michael is a very complicated and twisted story with some sort of basic characters, though they are morally vulnerable. The lighting of cinematographer Marc Reshovsky is in his fury; The sadness in a cemetery even gives a fine quality to everything. Although the article is not particularly "logical or convincing," the film's audience has a great deal of interest and can just draw them right. <br /> <br /> Cage's leadership is doing well, but its co-stars have a great old time immersing their nourishing and longing-motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are all entertaining to watch these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor Walshs have a funny fusion role for lawmakers (especially a good twist, Walsh is also a local sheriff) and the country and western star Dwight Yoakam, the movie is also a welcome last credit. <br /> <br /> This, is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> <strong>
