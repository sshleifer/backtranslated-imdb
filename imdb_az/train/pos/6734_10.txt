Riding Giants is an incredible document describing the history and stories of three influential big wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has done an incredible job with the director's role and should be congratulated for such a brilliant work. The structure of the film is brilliant and works perfectly with stories, interviews, animation and surfing. Music music is generally enjoying watching this movie, Riding Giants is a brilliant follower. His personal moments are Laird Hamilton's creations at Tequepu and his commentary on Greg Noll's conclusion at the end of the film. But really this whole movie is a great recommendation recommended when you have the opportunity to see. This is a better shame, but this is a remarkable gem. 10/10
