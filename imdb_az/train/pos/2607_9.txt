The season finishes sent mixed messages, I felt a sense of joy, deceived and deceived. Roseanne told all his followers that nine of the whole season was a lie, because his wife Dan died. He also acknowledged that his family had never won a lottery, and that the 9 seasons were just what he wanted or desired. When Becky and David Mark talked to Darlene, Becky and Mark said they were pregnant. That's why I believe he wanted it to happen, but it was not. The end of the season was good but sent mixed feelings. I am always a fan of the show. :)
