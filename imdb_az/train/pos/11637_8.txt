Scream is Wes Craven's latest fairy tales. Since then, Scream has a streak of unbearable loose ghost enough good enough for a blockbuster night, including the disappointing sequels. Perhaps the genius and mastery of the film saved him all his energies and creativity, as when it comes to dinner, we have nothing to do with serving him, his doo doo. Finally, after giving some bad movies, she gives us tasty, relentless, matte, creepy tension with Red Eye. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams has once again played a hotel manager, having a crucial political figure and regular contact with the hotel. At the airport, he is introduced to Jackson Ripner (Cillian Murphy, Batman Beyond). She knows a little better after a delayed flight and a breeze breeze. If she does not know she already knows her. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also known by his father, he will never see him if he does not cooperate and fails to meet Jackson's demands - use their relationship to establish regular hotels for assassination. <br /> <br /> Everyday is nothing but excitement, with predictability and sadness scenes. Although it's a good old fashioned tension, it's the beauty. No special effects. No more cheap. Only classic confusion. McAdams feels with violence and regret, McAdams helps her with her as you applaud him in every move he finds in a claustrophobic position. <br /> <br /> As always, entertaining and convincing performance. It's either his sweet face or his unanny ability to cry out sincerely, but it always seems to be sympathetic with him if his role is required. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy looks naturally creepy, so even though the fragment does not reveal it, it's not surprising that the last crossing to a charming strangely unmerciful jacket is. Perhaps it would be better to see the personality of a beautiful person as Toby Maguire turned into a dishonorable craze. Nevertheless, Cillian Murphy played a certain role after his true identity, whether he really wanted to die or at least assaulted his donkey. <br /> <br /> Do not see this feature. As with Craven's latest pictures, there are moments and heart rate devices that keep your screen in your eyes instead of your watch. If not for you, you will always jump with your girlfriend or boyfriend, or popcorn, and jump to one of them. Wes finally gets right. Undoubtedly, he is not as humorous as Cynthia, replacing McAdams at the front desk to keep order at the Red Eye Hotel, beyond his branding skills. The Red Eye was a relief that was not a frustration. Instead, McAdams will enjoy another incredibly talented performance, the minute Murphy look crepeer and Craven's classic traditional tension mastery vision. A delayed and starting flight to Craven's guard came shortly after Scream.
