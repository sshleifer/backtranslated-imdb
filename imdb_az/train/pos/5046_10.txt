Cabin film channels have such a trash that I hit with a stone. <br /> <br /> The father of two children hears those who say "demons" to kill those who say "God." <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> The opening credits show that the film director was often one of the dumps that could be a warning to a bad film; <br /> <br /> It has been repeatedly mentioned in some of the following films: <br /> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> fields and scripts are first-class. <br /> <br /> All actors give absolutely convincing speeches, especially the leading child actress. <br /> <br /> This film is as good as the Lamb's Silence.
