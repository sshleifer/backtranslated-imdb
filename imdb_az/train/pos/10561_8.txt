<br /> <br /> Ice cream cone was invented in New York. <br /> <br /> Kevin: After a long and intense break, we shot Busby Berkeley in addition to Warner Bros. This time the Juggernaut stage production is the ultra-fast Footlight Parade, playing the role of James Cagney as Chester Kent. I am 100% convinced that Cagney has directed Berkeley with the pressure of the city, which has been able to put forward new ideas for every minute speeches. Joan Blondell is also highly addictive, like the secretary-revolutionary-love interests. Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell subtotal is not as big as this time, less unpleasant. One thing Berkeley mentioned was that they did not leave alone a scene that seemed to be too extreme and complicated to carry out at any stage, then a film. Obviously, Busby is probably blocking most of the music tracks that the story can do. <br /> <br /> They say that I'm very pleased to be here until the end of this film. The "Shanghai Lil" nickname is estimated to have nearly as nearly as nearly as treacherous speech. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six movies in three months. We must be a new note. In any case, it completes Warner Bros. The music trilogy "42nd Street" and "The Golden Gazettes" in 1933. I strongly advise to watch three consecutive songs, and I'm surprised that when James Cagney Busby Berkeley is sewed while Chester City plays, The role was inspired by Busby, and I hope that Berkeley is a type of person who wants to see Chester's dance performances in everyday life, something interesting about Cagney has not really looked like a man of the traditional sense: he was 5'7 "square, chatted with a single New York accent. But the guy was versatile, and he was going from poisonous bandits who are so famous to the types of producer that we are talking to. He was primarily a prominent figure on the body of a character, with the rest of the faces facing each other, Joan Blondell returns and stole just the show as a faithful and lusting secretary of Cagney, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, a lovely couple, but more than ever. it looks like it takes less screen time; Billy Barty is still a bad thing. The film is predominantly of the age of the Codey era and adult-oriented music. The 50s and 60s were more family-oriented and the Warner music of that year (not against the Shanghai Lil, Keeler was a bad thing to do with China) was the perfect pinnacle. <br /> <br /> The last film: Eight Eating (1933). Next movie: I'm No Angel (1933).
