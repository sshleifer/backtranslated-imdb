Stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven blood lake. And the cheese is, of course, and suddenly unattractive. It reminded of the great event, because he had a revenge complex set up by the same incident, and the girl came to the good guy because of the same bad behavior. Strangely enough, there is Gloria Grahame, but not Alain Delon, not Glenn Ford. Can Adaine be as beautiful as a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat going around? But it's totally stiff and cool in the ice. No one can touch today - I think probably someone like Jude Law can try. It is difficult for every girl to look good. The music was funky and perfect and there are several excellent car chases (and generally my cup of tea) - a nilly one in the woods, especially in the forest. People were also creative and bloody, for example, faced with a pretty scarf. However, the overall atmosphere at the cheese edge was affected and essentially taken. Most of the things I have seen lately are more creativity, excitement and freshness in the "forgotten" film.
