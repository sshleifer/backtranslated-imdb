Ulysses should not be compared to the novel in any way, since they are two completely different people. However, in this regard, the film is still trying to keep many of the elements that make up the book's work, but since it's a visual tool, it's harder to get the depth of the mind. In my opinion, this is the best film that they are preparing for the material ... and this is the one who regularly comments on films that do not resemble their literary partners. I come to my book, but the movie is still fun.
