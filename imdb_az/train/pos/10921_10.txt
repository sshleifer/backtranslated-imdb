After reading some good reviews about this movie, I decided for a spin (I got it on a DVD, so I was a spin pun ... I am not a dork). The start was everything I had hoped for, a perfect fit (along with a few quotes that I heard on different Wu-Tang albums) had to be a good movie. But the area I was hearing was very big, very much anticipated. Every time I saw a character (excluding Lizard), which was Venom. Moreover, just a cool character is killed in the middle of the movie. Okay, so the plot was not very good, but at least had a good kung-fu right? It's wrong. The battles were short and very few and far away. All the different styles were pretty cool, but I wish the battles to be longer. I hope to see Lizard's escape and some crazy work on the wall, but it never happened. I hope to work a little bit faster in Centipede, but never happened. I used to think that Scorpio was waiting for more than 7 minutes, but it never happened. In short, not many. The battle is quite regular. Do not be fooled, there is only one plot of this movie, this does not mean a good thing.
