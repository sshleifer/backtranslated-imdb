For the films such as 'Anchors Aweigh', many Oscar awards were awarded during warming for a few happy hours. In 1945, it was a bad year for a good movie or something that started with Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" album. Because Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of the role of Singin in the Rain, the MGM had to be something wrong with scenic systems. <br /> <br /> As long as the studios have great studios and Hollywood itself, it is a good behavior during a very valuable tour, which is favorable for staying on the other side of the globe. <br /> <br /> Gene and Frank Sinatra's brilliant talent, today's audience would not have to deal with an unnecessary workout, although there is certainly a good difference in the preview of music for more people than a trap. Previously and later there were more pieces, but in this case all the tempting Kathryn Grayson scenes could be eliminated. It could have been non-opera thinkers to watch the movie "Kiss Me Kate" with a remote control of any movie. <br /> <br /> If in 1949 there was a need to deal with the purchase of women in the City, maybe not to let the happy sailors leave the beach with Jose Iturbi and pronounce the whole piano "Susie". We are very lucky to get a screen test at the gold studios at MGM. Later some participants are more lucky. Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson has no regrets about successful screenshots, but hopes for a permanent non-opera enthusiast for the ultimate pink slip. However, for all, the star talents do not ask for a choice of at least the wrong MGM film, with an intimate, lightweight interior with young well-groomed young offspring well-trained for the negative mood of the war era. <br /> <br /> The film's natural purpose is to blaze in Jerry's dance with a mouse, and it's Gene Kelly's cartoon adventures in a fantasy. /> <br /> This is a good thing that Fred Astaire knows what he thinks before he starts dancing on the walls and ceilings. </ p> <p> Sprinkle rainbow, chocolate suit, cream and cherry and banana split sundae, but in the form of a layer of solid sugar, which eventually melts in your mouth and is a good feeling. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
