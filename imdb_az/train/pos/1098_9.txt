Contemporary audiences recognize this little movie primarily as the "The Money Pit". Ancient viewers today are watching with nostalgia pains: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in a simpler, less complicated period. Or was not it? Of course, the time has come a way to change perspectives, and today there is a natural interest in controversy about the debate with many heartwarming social and political commentaries, old and less provocative films. "Mr. Blandings builds his sleeping home," so it can be more than the 1948 audience. There are politics comments, but subtle. Finding a home in the late 40s was a really striking experience, just like Levittowns and so on. Policy in the film? Children always talk about progressive ideas taught at school (there are teachers accused of communism in real life). In real life, Myrna Loy was a living activist, a Democrat, and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no Democratic firefighter: he married Helen Kahan Douglas, a young Richard Nixon, who accused him of being soft on communism (and destroyed it). Jason Robards plays a small role in the film, but his political activity is less distinct. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, would be a very liberal democrat for many years. Cary Grant, who is almost alone, reflects the political feelings of most of Hollywood's decisive conservatism. However, it was 1948: Communism was a real threat and the black list was in the corner. Ten years ago, political activism re-emerged in major films, and then it was not so subtle.
