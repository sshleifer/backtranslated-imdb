Disassemble your diverse dim-smart young "adult" (very loosely to use) at the Dayton Hall University, which has been closed for the demolition of your partner garden by various psychotic nutcase (deliciously essayed by glye by unhinged by Stephen Sachs). Daphne Zuniga plays Daphne Zuniga as an angry actor (Daphne Zuniga, Debbie, has started here as it's a bimbo knocking on a car). The Mungle is a surprise surprise twisted Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (also known as "Stewart"), which is copied in Christopher's creepy account of a few bloody murders (baseball sticks, bludgeoning, chicken wire strangulation, standard drill through the head, something terrible), then "Intruder" Young, with a small smidgen of gentle, uncompromising female nudity, blessed by "Power" and "Kindred", is a fun, dazzling, dreadful, dumbful and drecky low-level funny, funny, funny, funny, funny thing.
