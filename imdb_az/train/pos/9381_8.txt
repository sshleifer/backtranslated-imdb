Looking for a job for a businessman in Wyoming, a drifter is wrong, causing any kind of complications. Cage is amazed at the failure of the loser, who lost the hope of earning a living and leaving the city, but he could not escape from the main city. Hopper is doing the best job, playing a psycho known as "Dallan Lyle". Walsh is a crooked sheriff and around the good cast as femme fatale as Boyle. The scenario prepared by his brothers, John and Rick Dahl, consists of delicious twists and turns, and John's leadership creates a terrific "neo-noir" atmosphere. Wise and entertaining, shake the viewer from the head and never allows it.
