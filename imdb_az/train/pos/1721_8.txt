A few years later, if this movie was made several times, I'd give it a lower score. However, for 1909, it was a tiny little film and still stands today very well. Do not try to compare this silent film with the latest silent people - the industry has radically changed from the first decade of the 20th century to the movies, like the 1910s and the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 11 minutes (roughly average for most films) and Edgar Allen Poe's story change, AMONTILLADO GOAL. Although many people are familiar with the story, I will not give further information because I do not want to destroy the film. It is just enough to say that it is very creepy!
