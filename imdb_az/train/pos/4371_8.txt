Braveheart first appeared, I was enthralled, and it was usually one of the most brutal supporters of the movie. When Rob Roy appeared, it was a movie that interests me and I did not think the movie was a great movie, though I loved it. But over time, I was grateful to Rob Roy and my enthusiasm for Braveheart diminished. Braveheart is a great fun to be sure, but there are also flaws. The most important, in my opinion, is undoubtedly an unusual description of Roberto's Bruce, the greatest king of Scotland. Another film is a historic mistake of the film, which surprised many historical productions in history. I think that just as in this movie, I'm just worried that Melbourne could only be seen for the first time (at least with me). On the contrary, Rob Roy grew up over me for years. In short, this will prevent the most obvious faults in Braveheart. But Rob Roy grows more mature and sophisticated at every glance like fine wine.
