Midnight Watching Cowboy is taking a masterclass of acting / directing / cinematography / editing / writing. When I was released for the first time, I was too young to follow, and for the first time I saw it a few years ago, but the time-test was completely stopped and I looked at it several times. Everything about this movie is brilliant, from Voight and Hoffman (well known for this film, though I always like Voight's one of his innocent painful images.) Hoffman coughs with illness and greed) stunning cinematography and perfect edit imagination sequence. <br /> <br /> Many of our contemporary filmmakers are shocked by the fact that they are not prepared to risk creating films that are skilful and interesting. Midnight Cowboys should be viewed in all movie schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
