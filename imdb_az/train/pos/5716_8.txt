I have not seen any of the Grudge movies in Japan, but I really love it. While watching movies I rarely drown. It is a rare thing for me to be afraid of the effect and sound of the sound but afraid of a movie. But I was afraid of Grudge. Maybe I did not expect anything when I watched it. I did not expect to be afraid. I did not even know anything about it. This was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you either love or hate. Most people compare this to the Japanese Grudge movies, but even though I have not seen them, it's not really right to compare any movie. This film is based on itself. <br /> <br /> The story is poor, most people say it. I agree. The story is minimalist and carried out with the aim. The used story techniques - for example, a broken time frame - are completely implemented. The director knows exactly what he is doing and has so much vision he wants. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8 out of 10. It is a movie that will enjoy watching or hate. It's so simple.
