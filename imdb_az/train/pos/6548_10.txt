This is a great movie! I played all the Nancy Drew games and read the books, and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and funny! If you have not heard Nancy Drew, read his first book (The Old Clock is Hidden), so you can get Nancy and then watch the movie because they really do not introduce symbols in the movie 'fast names. ;) Your whole family was very pleasant to me. This is one of the last Nancy Drew's films, which Nancy Drew's actors have seen. This movie is more like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy Drew likes it, you have to watch it!
