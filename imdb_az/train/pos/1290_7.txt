Yes, I remember it! It's been a long time since I actually watched it. The story was absolutely surreal, but it was still great! Everyone who takes into consideration films that evaluate and analyze what is the purpose of the film. It is similar to the "First Child", which is a similar example. Some movies look like here - just plain and funny nonsense. Such films can not be judged from the point of view of hyperkritic. Of course, these films are poor, they have no developed story, they often do not work in the first place, but if they do their basic principles, it is good. I do not want to have this movie all the time here, but I still think it was funny, it was a very unpleasant series and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is an intelligent player anyway.
