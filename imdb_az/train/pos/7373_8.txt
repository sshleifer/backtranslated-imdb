Before my regular comments, my main concern about this is the LOVE SONG, but there is a working time of 94 minutes IMDb, Wellspring Media runs 88 minutes in the United States. Please enter any details about this! <br /> <br /> Two friends who go through a very strange journey set off for a great adventure. In some cases, one girl accidentally throws a girl and runs away as both run away. More than just a big chase, it's getting worse with the movies, daft, and Spike's ill-treatment of childhood, and puts it in the boom box as a toy bear. Some viewers do not like the character Spike-based story, but without the slightest frustration added to the story, the film would be very easy. Unlike Spike's "uncontrolled child" behavior and behavior, Heaton's Spike will see a more stable character as a "great man." Frankly, I was heavily agitated by Spike's ridiculous movements, especially the smell of the spray, but in a hopeless situation, part of his mentality chooses to temporarily rescue. <br /> <br /> He says his wife meets Hasan Hajiyev's spouse. Thanks to Glenaan's great performance, he wants to choose Spike from prison and continue his friendship. For all of this, it would be a good idea for Heaton to keep Spike alone and try to save himself. I think Heaton feels like a protective elder brother for Spike and it is difficult to break the loyalty between the latter - until everything is so awkward. <br /> <br /> Although some of the cinematographic works are very beautiful, the story is more enjoyable than just the men in the desert. Beautiful scenery, rainfall, and gray sky offer noisy noise that enhances the feelings of tragic situations. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Public Image Ltd." The use of the song "This is not a song of love" is also an unusual account, and the title of the movie is quite clever. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's aimed at two different people who run away from another man to hunt you (played by a cool, quiet David Bradley). Great budget action is not fun. <br /> <br /> We're going to spend a lot of time trying to find a minimal and dramatic thing, no matter what, and offer a lot of tense moments that keep you breathless. <br /> <br /> I really love Scotland's recent films, these soldiers, Dogs Soldiers and Satan's Tattoos. I am also grateful for the subtitles provided on this DVD, because the emphasis is sometimes fast and difficult for some viewers who can understand it like me. <br /> <br /> Scary, dark and often tense, THESE WORDS are very tragic, but talking stories. <br /> <br />
