The film begins with something less than hyper-kinetic, more submerged Dead or Alive: strange underground activities are being detected by police officers. When a police officer is killed, a Tatsuhito is involved ... and when his brother Shihito is found, the work will be very bloody. <br /> <br /> The former Miike, the Shinjuku Triad Society is still full of adherent sex-acts, although it's not even eclectic or luxurious. Instead, as Tatsuhito earns his way through the underground, pulp fantasy is a very well-trained plant, a labyrinth that has led him to a gay Triad leader who sells illegal body organs in Taiwan and keeps the brothel almost hooked up, especially at the head of the police killing character). Tatsuhito's brother is in contact with the society, as Tatsuhito is forced to make himself a dirty cop, and he uses similar fierce and sadistic tactics to penetrate the violent world. <br /> <br /> Wang is primarily interested in these small jobs, which is related to Tatsuhito's nemesis. Tatsuhito was born in China, then returned to Japan and became alien to it. Wang is a stranger in China, killing his father and developing a criminal wing in Japan. Wang is also a striking Shakespeare character, and it's strange that you're less likely to feel sorry for Tatsuhito during his last interview. And Tatsuhito himself is a similar tragic figure when he has to deal with the lack of ability to manage his brother. <br /> <br /> <strong> Although it is rude to say that Miike's films are lucky on shocking values, it's really easy to explain why Miike could create a painful, immaculate character. <br /> <br /> -PolisisDiB
