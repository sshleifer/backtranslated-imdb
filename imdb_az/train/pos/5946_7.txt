"The world's best" is a unique project. <br /> <br /> So, this is a trailer for a Superman / Batman crossover movie that is at least in this form with movies, characters, actors and land line. a great deal of bullying, more standard than standard daily movies. Trailer is nothing for you. From this point of view, I did not like this short project. While watching this trailer, it is more distressing and more exciting and at the same time saddening, and probably you will be deceived, as long as the long-term movie of this novel is not available. The sequence was surprising to see why this project was originally made. Surely Sandy Collora's skills have been shown, but he has not been able to do this in a short time like the previous movie, Batman: Dead Son. <br /> <br /> But this is really a big thing from a movie theater when you have to rule this briefly. The Batman: Dead End, cardboard sets, cheap home suits, and the third will be better off than expecting it, though it's the degree actors. Shortening is not always effective and obviously budget is not at a high level, but rather very beautiful and professional, with very nice dresses, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There are some effective shots, but also many naked ones, mainly Superman flying sequences. I do not know if the man was standing in a moving car, he was directed at a camera below. I found something very unpleasant to watch over. But, indeed, the better and the more spectacular moments are worth it. <br /> <br /> Although Michael O'Hearn was clearly not the greatest talented actor in the surrounding area, he seemed to be a pretty good Superman / Clark Kent. Clark Bartram repeats the role of Batman again and Kurt Carley seemed to be an excellent Lex Luthor. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> After the new modern interpretation of the two main super heroes of that film, "Batman Begins", "Superman Returns". It is interesting to compare styles and character treatments of these films. <br /> <br /> <strong> It's really nice and fun to hear that Kevin Spacey is playing Kevin Spacey, who plays Lex Luthor at Supermen Returns. <br /> <br /> Although you know you are more and more, it creates more hunger. Regardless of what you are planning to create a full-length SÃ¼derman / Batman movie with Waner Bros? I thought the events that took place a few years ago, but nothing has been heard since. Instead, two new Batman and Superman films were shot; <br /> <br /> 7/10. "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns"
