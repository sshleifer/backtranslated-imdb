Although Busy is not surprised to develop a tumor in his sinus cavity, this movie is a poor decision, but one gives me a full taste. The first 5 minutes are the most dull 5 minutes in any movie; with boring, bad dialouge and then with a Spiderman stance, Busey yells the worst line ever film ever created ... "the worst nightmare butthorn!" I would laugh so hard in part of the egg. This line has a very good resonance, and Cluney also respects the "hi Freeze, I Batman" line. Other classic moments are avoiding warning Busey that he has been killed by his CIA partner constantly ... by mistaking it in the chest (all this was made possible by a super slow-moving flashback sequence of tracking paint) ). Nadas have an ashtray, blow on the face and "this is not my fault, and you know it!" As you can see, the image is missing from a bad man and hit his friend, so ... The other noisy moments must be thrown into the ground to secure his escape from his old friend - logic, physics and absurd to all plans. Finally, McBain jumped from Thunderblast during a tense episode of guerrilla warfare and began to prevent a small object and I moisturize myself. Some of Busey's best work today is rent or buy "butthorn!" My voice is perfect 10 (poo meters).
