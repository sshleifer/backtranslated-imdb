I said that this movie gave me a double identity. I did not say it again and started talking again as a normal person. But it is very difficult ... there is nothing. Was this disgusting and disrespectful? Well, let's get a lot more mood. This movie is just bad! This is not a movie to show to your dad, but you need to show it to a teenager or an unborn boy at your workplace. In any case, return to the soundtrack. Fortunately, this site has some Ladies Man (in the studio alert, should someone have an apostrophe between e and s?) So you can always say something good to your boss or your cops. I have a sheet in my wallet.
