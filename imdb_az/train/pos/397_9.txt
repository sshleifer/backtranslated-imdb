I should not admit that Tsui Hark is a species, and you can not go on a man with a strong film. <br /> <br /> The new legend of Zu Mountain has really improved since it can not be easy for a Chinese fantasy to be presented to an audience, and the director tried to bring back the classic fantasy story of Mount Zu. One in 1983. From the renewal of this new millennium we can see the vision of Tsui Hark's Zu Mountains. Spectacular visual designs, fabulous fantasy epic, have been perfectly designed. All the pictures stuck to me. Great cast with just good play. <br /> <br /> Now, the bottom side will be questioned by a narrow storyline narrowed down to a 95-minute movie. The site may not have much to do with the characters, but you have to re-examine the film and understand the characters themselves better. Some of them may complain about many physical battles along with supernatural powers to defeat enemies, and spirits struggling with hands do not really mean anything. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this beautifully stylish picture. It might be a tough story, but we looked at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", and we were involved in the field, but it was really stylish and awesome. Tsui Hark always deals something different with HK. Cinema. An American audience may have difficulty understanding it while watching this movie because it's Crouching Tiger, not a Hidden Dragon, a new genre. Although not a masterpiece, these special effects are better than Storm Riders. This really needs to be checked.
