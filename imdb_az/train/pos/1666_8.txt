This is a 17th-century Italian painter and especially a film about an artist. At that time, Artemisia was a non-professional woman for women, and she had the courage to pull out the ridiculous men who reflected the rare membrane. <br /> <br /> The camera work is primarily a place where artists work. There are some big shots. Families of candlelight light up the fine works of classical artists and are interested in seeing their artists and students with a detailed scaffolding by detail of religious frescoes. The artistic elements of the film (suits, facials, makeup) are a remarkable fact that Italian churches have preserved all the details of their frescoes for centuries. Beautiful Artemisia calls on her father to study under great Florentine artist Tassi, who has become an art in the field of perspective and landscape art (heralding many new things), but the uncertain Artemisia is more familiar with new techniques in painting. After breaking for her, Tassi forced her. His father was angry. The trial is followed. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama ends with a fairly simple story. The outstanding feature of the film is its figurative presentation and detail. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says she is happy to make herself a woman who flees to the wind with a large amount of clothing. his father is painting to ask others. As for this movie, we will be the most beneficial.
