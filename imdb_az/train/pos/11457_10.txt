As the jacket has announced, this movie is "Gorgeously shot and masterly edited", and, yes, it's mesmerizingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> They say that unkindness we receive in stoic rock and thirsty locks and water flows in the hands of Goldsworthy's ephemeral work. <br /> <br /> And therefore the beauty of his works <br /> <br /> Follow us with a melancholy touch on Matthew Arnold's words from Dover Beach: Listen! If you listen to the bark sparks of the gravel that the waves are back, Careful, up to the rock, Start and stop, and then start again, slowly shaken with cadence, at a point close to the end of the film, Goldsworthy says, "The words are doing their job, but what I've done here says more" . In a word, I did not blame myself, and for a moment, I think Goldsworthy, whose shape and timing, change, tissue, color and composition, is determined in a resolute and intuitive way, is more than simply saying words. <br /> <br /> At another point, he commented on what "What is staying here ... and what's not". <br /> <br /> I think that in the 20th century, the artists knew very well how much ephemeral the greatest works of art were even compared to space-time space; and they began to comprehend this concept by compiling the works that were deliberately distant. I think that short-term people would be one of the most powerful works of humanity and would be part of the art of timelessness. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, this is part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work. He carefully creates some of the straw or leaves that he or she can reach, or places them in the river on the ground; but this process unites both the composition and the combination of the period. <br /> <br /> Ours also need both passage and time to understand our world and our place in us. And it is important to carry out these works in the context of nature, so those that are created are in nature. Stones of stone walls and Goldsworthy stone are silent and solid, but we know that they are not monuments of eternity, but will remain for an indefinite period and then return to a state similar to each other. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> This is just a time and form experience. In a sense, Shelly's famous poem "Ozymandias" resembles the "work" and even the tea, the art lives out of our experience. Therefore, the Tibetan sand is so carefully designed and measured, and then given to the winds as they are finer and finer, so we know that all of us are intelligent. <br /> However, in the modern world, these works of art are tolerant to photos and videos. Goldsworthy is a completely photographer (I need to say), and all his works, even those failing, he says, draws his pictures that he has to look at them in a more mood and see what they do <br /> <br /> Thomas Riedelsheimer This kinematography produced by Fred Frith should not be missed with beautiful and harmonious music. One of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen and one of the most moral.
