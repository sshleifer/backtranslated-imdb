Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were some different moves, but this could be expected in a movie that was made in such a short time. I did not think of moving forward in the film, and I found it pretty fun. Sometimes it is ridiculous, but in general I recommend it. Probably, they used all the shining goggles of nearby stores and some of their suit designs were pretty good.
