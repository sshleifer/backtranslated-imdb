As I mentioned before, John Carpenter saw the classic, first of all two films in 1978, and was very impressed (another classic Conan Barbarian). It was really scary to me that Michael Myers (friend of the imaginary friend) was my friend afterwards to ensure that the only monster in my bed was killed in my dream. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 year old terror. <br /> <br /> This is a frightening classic and I'm convinced that my modest look will not justify the justice he deserves. The most striking feature of all of these is that the film is not a guttural reaction yet, more cognitive, or not immediately subconsciously. All this can happen. It is not located in the territory of the country of origin or in a foreign country (the most up-to-date horror, for example, Hostel, Touristas, Cry Wolf, Saw, etc.). Sometimes graphics and the rest fall into our imaginations. I believe that this is the least cautious element of a nightmare that frightens people or fights out of the night with a soundtrack. It is still working, because we can replace the third or third degree of killing with something terrible that mentality can create. Thus, we help our own fears and anxieties. <br /> <br /> The carpenter is preparing a simple story about a daily, middle class, suburban, and relatively good child who stands on Halloween and kills his brother. He carries out his next 15 years in only one organization (we will not experience it with gratitude), to escape and return to his hometown, extreme Haddonfly. Killing and killing on the road. The baby name is Michael Meyers, though he is not a person. John Carpenter uses Michael Meyers as a metaphor against the intended security of the middle class suburb. <br /> <br /> Michael stopped killing a human being after killing. <br /> <br /> <strong> Chaos in the US Bureau of Security and Security may still be shot. He is not a serial killer, human or psychopath. It is an unbearable force. The absence of any dialogue, except for general bundles, bleached white shatner masks, and some breaths, help degrade Michael's generation and complete it. This is the source of all his power. In no way is headless, silent, and disappointing. It helps to avoid cinematography (post-card effect), information / motivation / commentary and Donald Pleasence (Dr. Loomis) veteran story experience. Sugar is sold over outstanding performance and anxiety. This is also an innocent girl who is the first to watch Jamie Lee Curtis's film, Laurie Strode, at least to face chaos. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the first movie of fear movies (Black Christmas came out 4 years ago), this is not the least successful, and it is not reduced to review. If you are not afraid of long-term fear movies (like me), it will probably make the sound of the soundtrack sound in the first tones of the signature sound. This movie comes as a horrible movie and one of the pinnacles of John Carpenter's career.
