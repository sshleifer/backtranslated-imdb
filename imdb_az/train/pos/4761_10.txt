A perfect movie with beautiful performances from Zack & Lochley. Garibaldi came to the station from their anger (and me). (Despite all the relationships with Jerry Doyle, I lost sympathy for the character on Season 4 and 5). Zack (who loves the show best) is not far from starting criticizing and bringing him to justice. I'm sure Zack was able to. The Soulhunter area is interesting, especially if you believe in paradise like Zack. Humor completes this beauty. 10/10
