<br /> <br /> Von Trotta appears to be relatively comfortable compared to the previous film Versprechen, Das (1995) against the story of the balance of the film. /> <br /> This direction has been closely monitored and given the visual acuity, especially the visual expression (highlighting a mix of headlines and a new candle in the modern era reminiscent of the death of various characters) <br /> <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the Caucasus did not intend to do so. Von Trotta said it himself! Secondly, the time of the events was actually historically accurate (actual dates were shown near the memorial), and prisoners were suddenly released as in the film. <br /> <br /> <strong> There is evidence that shows the dissatisfaction with the case of the Caucasus and plans to return those who subsequently have freedom. <br /> <br /> Generally, most of all, it's a very regrettable event, a 'very moving' period. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that has long been on display (for various reasons). <br /> <br /> I also like Margarethe too!
