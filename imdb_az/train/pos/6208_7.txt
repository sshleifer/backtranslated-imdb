1997-based indie drama Henry Fool was a seemingly safe choice of a movie. Distributed drifter (Thomas Jay Ryan) travels to the city. Her anarchist arrangement and delusions were inspired by a nerdy garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write poetry while trying to boomer her sister (Parker Posey), who was raised by Henry half. As the poet's thrill, Henry diminishes. There is nothing specific about any characters or story. <br /> <br /> For Harold and Maude's Ghost, there was always a possibility that a pitch would go out on the screen. But Parker Posey is not a semi-official Queen in India. "That is, when a writer / filmmaker, Hal Hartley, came up with a new incarnation for his form, a movie was born, and although we were born with the same symbols for many years, dark comedies, this is spying! Henry could have been an international spy and an alleged double or even triple agent for a few years before meeting with others, hiding from the dead or the agents and officials of many countries. who wants only an unusual magazine containing coded secrets that can only lead to instability and nationalities, and Posey Fay is a wife dedicated to a woman or widow, depending on what she tells the truth, to find Fey Henry and / or hot controversial magazines. efforts are multinational sensitive individuals at every turn and the satirists include stopping a globe-trotting, never knowing to believe or trust, and that's not what we are. <br /> <br /> While converting these unlikely characters into the Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan area, Hartley's script keeps its ironic miracles in its first look and protects it from slapping when exposed to physical dangers. Paranoia's dazzling lamp, the bipartisan and today's geopolitical musician unions are beginning to collapse. Nevertheless, fans of the first film will be pleasantly surprised by the refinement of Hartley's recycling methods. (5/18/07)
