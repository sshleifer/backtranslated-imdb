Considering this review, I regret it, looks like Hollywood, and I have to vote for 10 out of 10 in a rare chance of interest in her freaky / funny world. But it was good at all seriousness. The first episode is clear that he finds his feet, but Silverman's stupidity keeps on going all the way with him. This comedy is not a loud comedy, but it's a good thing, there's a lot of laughter, and it would not be right with your desires when you laugh, that's the absurdity of the audience. We can easily see this as a strange Drew Carey show with an incredibly powerful central character. We look forward to the episodes that are worth a watch. It's a good chance from the usual comedy there. <br /> Ps, Sarah? Call me....
