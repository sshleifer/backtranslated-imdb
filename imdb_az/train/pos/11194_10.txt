There was a dialogue about wrong writing, bad directions, and the best speeches. Why would you ask for more? There is nothing better than laughing. Zadora's hilarious parody of the Hollywood car, which he often used to work for himself, combined with scenarios. It's almost as funny as the "Spinal Tap", although it is not meant in such a way. Do not miss Ray Liotta's first movie line, "It looks like Penis."
