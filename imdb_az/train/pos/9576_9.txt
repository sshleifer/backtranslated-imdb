One of the most nihilistic and cruel films I've ever seen is one of the most tragic and moving ones. This is a motion melodrama that the world has never seen before. Sometimes, the slippers held me close to my tears, and then they conveyed the verses that shocked the bum as a crushing blow. Performance by Edison Chen. The story of a HK-Cop and a Cambodian killing each other is as strong as they lost humanity. "Dog Bite Dog" is pure HK-Bloodshed without heroism.
