Before watching this movie, I thought this movie would be as beautiful as Flashpoint, because before watching this movie, Flashpoint was the latest Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I've watched before. Despite sex scenes I was disappointed, Dreamquest's sex scenes would be as big as Flashpoint sex scenes, but I was disappointed. Except for Asian Carrera's sex scene, any sex scene in this movie does not make me feel great (what I would say). Big Jenna Jameson could not make such sex scenes. Felecia and Stephanie Swift, these lovely girls, are also disappointed with sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Despite her adult film, this movie is very good if you go beyond this sex scenario. If adult film standards are usually available, this movie has definitely increased standards for adult movies. The stories, activities, trends, kits, makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great. The actors of this film really worked well, they all did a great job. Dreamquest definitely enhances the quality of adult movies.
