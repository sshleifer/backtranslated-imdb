Weapons explode, buildings exploded, cars collapse, and it's just ten minutes. <br /> <br /> For the past few years, this action-packed film (hence the headline) of the old CIA prison, which has not been fired, is quite worthy. <br /> <br /> The sharp and toothy Gary Busey usually sounds like a villain in this charming squirrel, with his usual crazy charm, but a little bit more unhappy: after the whole show. Which, by William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. but does not mean there are many terrifying support roles. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala and many other "forgotten" characters. <br /> <br /> Busey has to release a group of "abducted" American military elites and a high-tech "supertank" (pasted on top of the cheese). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This question, of course, is as demanded in the CIA as in any film center ... but without propagation.
