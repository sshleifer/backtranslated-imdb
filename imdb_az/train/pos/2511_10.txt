I was looking for a movie with a typical fan. I would like to check it out. I did not expect much. After all, a musician, an actor and a script writer? Many talents can not survive in one person. Right <br /> <br /> Wrong! Do not leave as quickly as one of my favorites! The story line and characters have typically lost in Hollywood special effects. The story throws you out of your senses and draws you together. Understand that you've been stuck to one another just as the credits go. <br /> Sometimes the player looks a little over the top. However, I believe the comedy intentions and character are very appropriate. Otherwise, I would not expect the level of activity I witnessed. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing more than once. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that this movie be so laughable or missed unexpectedly. Do not hesitate to go with your doubts, but I am sure that you will find a place on your shelf.
