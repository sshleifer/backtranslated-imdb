Following the growth of Detroit, the strange streets of MI and together with his friends in New York, I became a member of House. I joined the Theieves House. We adapted most homes to the same rules, but they were professionals who would like to increase and commit credit card fraud to get fabulous jewelry and clothes we want. Even a jealous queen called me secret service and learned how to drive and drive a license and cash in the seventeen states until I went to the Federal Prison. But in this movie I learned a lot from this queen and I recommend you to follow it. I even read about how we grew up in homes in Detroit and how we got involved in the crime. My book, Identity schemes are available for sale at Amazon dot com or Identity Schemes dot com. But trust me, Paris burning is very good, since 2005.
