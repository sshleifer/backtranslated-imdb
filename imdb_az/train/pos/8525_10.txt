To evaluate this film fairly, it is necessary to think about the possible genre: children. There are more rules in this movie to watch all the movies that are fun and entertaining in this movie (which will not be able to overcome some humor or language). Sequels hurt me, but it was pretty good for him. You know that Fraiser does not have the power of star, George has invested in humor and enjoyed it as Shouma was led. It's not just something for watching a movie and getting awards for the Academy Award, but if you want to watch a simple, entertaining, energetic movie, it's a good choice for a young, easy-to-follow, and sometimes a well-planned audience.
