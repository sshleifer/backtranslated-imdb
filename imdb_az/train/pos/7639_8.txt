This is not a big movie. Imagine (some sub charterers are played even worse), the movie is in no sense beautiful. There is nothing real or new. If you like big movies, this is not for you. there is still a great deal - a really great story plus. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own lives. The girl we did not ask for a date is the story of the failure of the experiment, the friend we left. This movie works and touches it because it's a small story. This is the life we ​​live in, with all our regrets, even the message hits: Every life we ​​have had its own traits. I watched it for the first time, it was 15. It was shown on one side of my school. Every once in 16 years I think, and every time I see it, it gives me a smile. See it. That's good. You will be happier than having it.
