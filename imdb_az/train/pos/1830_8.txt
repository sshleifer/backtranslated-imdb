Above all, 'St. Ives's film is based solely on the story of Robert Louis Stevenson, but this is not a criticism at all. The original novel was an endless story with the death of the author, and the filmmakers were able to adapt and finish it, despite the fact that Stevenson was different from the original, bringing to life many favorite characters. 1813: Capitaine Jacques de KÃ©roual de Saint-Yves is in the Breton aristocracy, orphaned by the Revolutionary Guinean and now serves as a husser in the Napoleonic Army. Since he is a 30-year-old hussar, he is claiming to be "indebted" at the age of 34 because he is a "black protector"! Undoubtedly, when faced with a problem facing those prayers, our surprised hero is in danger, but a real player in Albania brings him to pray and a beautiful song / singer's bed. Unfortunately, it also leads to the loss of the commission ... Additional mistakes are taken by the British and sent to a rape camp in the Scottish castle. <br /> <br /> Toys and boxes awaken, while attracting the attention of Miss Susan Gilchrist's younger brother, Flora, who is the world's best traveler in the Jacques Swanston Cottage. They are in love, and most of the story is Flora, who helps her escape from Jakarta and find her father-in-law, her old Comte. Of course, there is a problem. Jacques' s older brother, Alain, is an alcoholic, perhaps an understood - very happy at the time Jacques emerged when he left her in front of the house ... Cue betrayed! <br /> <br /> There is an entertaining subpodrom of romance between the Ottoman Empire and the gentle, noble but kindhearted great Farukhar Chevening and Aunt Susan who have captured the Turks. <br /> <br /> Allowing a natural prejudice in favor of any movie that my heroes share with my name 'St. Ives is sorcery! These beautiful swords combine a balloon-flight, comedy and romantic adventures. Fairbanks, Colman, Flynn, and co. I love a movie that does not like companies more. Acting is wonderful. Anna Friel makes Flora an inspirational and seductive heroine, and Jean-Marc Barr, like Jacques, is a really charming hero. Miranda Richardson and Richard E. Grant are already my great favorites, and there are great entertainment like Susan and Farquhar, who work as a funny context for those who are in touch. Rakish, planning, but ultimately disastrous Alain, shows that Jason Isaacs has a classic sliding style, as well as the "The Patriot", as well as the twisted images! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> \ n \ In the book, the castle, where Jacques is imprisoned, is clearly Edinburgh, but the film taken in Ireland, Germany, and France is 'High-level', providing 'a place that definitely does not fit the names of places like Swanston, Inverness and Queensferry.' Costumes are also a real boiling point, starting in 1780, until the designated period. This is surprising, for example, as well as good-natured women like the heroes who were dressed in the 1780s, in 1813, even though they were inaccessible with "low-cost" character. Of course, the costume suits are heartwarming: these previous styles are visually appealing and elegant and they work in the director's world. Totally 'St. Ives '90 minutes are pure pleasure.
