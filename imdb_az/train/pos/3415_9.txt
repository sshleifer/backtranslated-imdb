This movie was incredible. This is an inspirational piece of cinema. The character is fully developed by the director, Lucy Walker. I would recommend this to everyone looking for a special human film showing humanity. Lucy Wlaker demonstrates the beauty of the landscape. This film is an example for people and human nature, and sometimes against people. Internal confusion and victory are very great in its subject. It is interesting how Tiebtans showed blindness as a sign of the demons. This film gives light to a culture that has never been demonstrated. Lucy Walker gave Erik Weihenmayer a vote that he did not hear. Thank you to Lucy for your vision of the filmmaker.
