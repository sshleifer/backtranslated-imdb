This movie is absolutely funny. Cunning is not just a trick, but the player is scary. Special effects are asinine and the whole film is determined in a post-apocalyptic desert. However, it was still allowed to produce the most attractive movie. It's 101 minutes to laugh that we all know that 3000 will not have any fuel or any El Camino. There are other things that I do not want to spoil because of those beautiful moronic movies. I recommend this film only for its moral standpoint. I do not know who can watch it as a high-quality feature, but if you need a good laugh, look at Exterminators 3000 of the Year!
