Fragile Carne, before his big era. HOTEL DU NORD, although hesitantly focused on and long-lasting, is full of attractiveness and beauty inherent in French films in the late 1930s, and this unusual touch with the director is relative lightness. All of its advantages are: interiors broken by boundless, sophisticated, delicious camera movements; placing a melancholy of light and shadow; Alexander Trauner's remarkable, indispensable sets, like himself, show that his personality is shaped; Maurice Jaubert's dull music in calmness; a casual imagination about romance, tragedy and philosophy; <br /> <br /> In fact, the film's biggest failure and I'm surprised is its script (usually dialectically as a reducible person), its importance to the extraordinary speeches of the greatest players of all time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . <br /> <br /> The boarding house carefully sets up the idea of ​​opening public, along with two stories related to condemnation and romantic, metaphysical and actual isolation in the film. The destroyed love scenario is the least functioning. Annabella is very nice, but in tragic circumstances is not very good, the richness of Aumont can be quite striking, though, according to nature, any real, hindering romance. Maybe it's just a matter of being sincere but a few months later, a few months later, with a young, very attractive sibling who is in desperation to hit each other. Their high flight lines are also very embarrassing. Of course, I do not want to consider it as expedient - they are symbols of youth, hopefully and probably France, or France itself, to despair, resign, waiting for death. <br /> <br /> For the conversation to be really strong, they must agree on a logical level that I do not feel here. <br /> <br /> Keeps this plan, M. Edmond, a character associated with the great tradition of French swords. We gradually learn, though, that Arletty is a concealed murderer who blocks prostitution and accuses his partners. In the previous "role" and its positional strike - it had some features; hiding in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> In this way, one of the few people who has been accepted by someone. Perhaps she is related to her husband. a collection of signs and death is an inevitable reality; the strongest personality must be defective - the romantic prototype of Edmond Melville's clinical killers. <br /> <br /> Except for one - he gives a short hope, only an intensified allegation - if this is not a very irresistible irony - a deadly solution. <br /> <br /> All this is a really good performance by Louis Jouvet. I learned the theater work at college, but this was my first taste of the screen capabilities and it shows itself to be worthy of the elders - the quiet nobility for Grant, Mastroianni, Clift, Mason, Mitchum, Cotten, is a concept more than an actual person that, of course, is allegoric). Edmond's film begins with a small supportive character but appears to be a tragic hero of some forces. Like all these great actors, Jouvet's brightness is hidden. Formal level, ten years before Carne's bloom, Technique of the Great Hollywood melodramas, Ophuls, Ray and Minnelli. <br /> <br /> <div> <div> <div> <font color = red> </ font> <div> font> </ span> </ div> <div style = "color: red;"> The principle of the film is the motif of water - the floats are floating and the hotel stops - but there is a channel instead of the Renoir's open river, destructive and manmade, no place to go. The film begins after the end of the movie, and receipt never changes, except for a short break, which is condemned to return to both runs. Characters can only escape death - narrow rooms they occupy, walls and frames that capture them, and windows facing an escape that never runs out. Hence, any hopes are very important, and if it's romantic, it's dangerous.
