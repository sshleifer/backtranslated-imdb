Hundstage is the first feature film of seidl, which previously featured documentary films like "live animal" or "model". Seidl worked for more than three years in this project, but costs only $ 2 million. The actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who have played them. Cinematography is very good. the whole movie is concerned and some scenes may be too much for "ordinary" viewers. The film shows a lot of gender and violence, and people can not communicate with each other individually. Finally, we can say that it is one of the best and most perfect Austrian films in the past years. please worry about my worst english slice. <br /> <br />
