Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements in the tired genre of the first person. Patrick Galloway, a secret expert, explains the story of a giant warrior called by a estate agent in Ireland to investigate an Iraqi phaenomena. The game is determined in Ireland after the war in the world, so do not expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket-throwers. All weapons of the game can be considered antiques, but the true entertainment in the game is its spell and they are a system that operates. It is ambidexterous for its hero to use his hands at the same time: spells with the right arm and uses a weapon with the left. It is very entertaining that can be thrown and left at the same time and is unique to this game! The graphics are great and the average power P.C .. The design is also cool and atmospheric. Basically the game is happening around Afghanistan and the kiosk, but there are many other places waiting for improvement. Thanks to Clyve Barker's talent, the game has a good story and structure (something very rare for the first person shooter), and the sound that sounded before the big and very strange atmosphere is also good but not excellent. But there are two major defects in the game. First of all, the mission, for example, is a great deal when you go to that room, for example, all the doors of the house will be locked apart from those that lead to your mission room, but this will limit the freedom of search. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antiques can not apply to most fps players using the highest tech weapons. As for the difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Many have a moderate disadvantage, but sometimes it is more difficult, but not difficult. Generally, an uncertain game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
