She watched both parts twice. I'm glad to see Patrick Swayz, an old hero who enjoyed the story. He was as convincing as Alan Quartermaine and, of course, improved Richard Chamberlain's performance. I acknowledge that I would like to see someone else as a "Diseased woman." Alison Doody should stay up-to-date and non-periodic numbers. There was no woman in the 1800s. The rest were horrible and followed the slanders very well. I'm glad to see that this generation's actors are not afraid to work on different characters and are not afraid to get old. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide it. No matter how beautiful a green youth then 50+ can be a very sexy person (and Patrick is really sexy). Go with a great smile for the hood character lines.
