Normally, I do not like Emma Roberts, but after watching Nancy Drew, my thinking changed. All the actors in the film did something funny and funny. Most of the time you spend watching a mystery movie can settle in the middle of the show, but in the movie you really are there. Finally, clues should fit together until you understand all the crimes. I was surprised to find out about it yet. The whole movie was really clever and people who watched me loved the movie as well. The dress was my favorite part of the movie, it was so sweet. I do not think there will be such a movie until afterwards. Most popular girls, despite the fact that the part was not right, gave me nine, but they still made me laugh. It was a great movie and a great mystery. I'm definitely waiting for it.
