This film really deserves more recognition in its acquisition. This is indeed a striking and rich illustration of blood gardens, fertility, and loyalty within the criminal world. The film is beautifully drawn and you are in the classic crime scene as betrayal and power. This film is a movie that shoots a film and, at the end, requires full attention and insight and rewards. This hong is the lady of the kong and hong kong and china are a nice change, not a wire frame, but a warlike epic that appears to be a great contribution to the world of cinema. It's fair to say that I have to watch twice to beat some of the characters because of numerous relationships in the film, but it has a great symbol, actor and arrangement of development. All 8/10 have ALL's great-styled characters, but it does not stop long enough, and the music really did not come to me, and I felt that sometimes it did not sync well with the action (so it loses some points for it.
