This movie surprised me. My friend said that this movie was a "chicken whistle". My son, it was wrong! This movie has a big family appeal and there is no sex scene like movies. Jake Gyllenhaal works great on Homer Hickam's shoes. <br /> <br /> Science, age, family conflict, a great train scene ... This movie has everything. The sound mode is pretty good, though the score is very small. The music of the 50s began with a film on the verge of greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD should be drawn with coal. The replay value is great - I've seen it a few times now.
