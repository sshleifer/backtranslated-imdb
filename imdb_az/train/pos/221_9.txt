When I first saw this movie at Radio City Music Hall, I remember. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau was awarded the Oscars for his film at a meeting with former US Secretary of State George Burns (RIP). His performance is wonderful - because he is Willie Clark, who is over 20 years old. His behavior is first degree. ("Do you know what songs you wrote?") And at the front desk, speaking to a Spanish-speaking boy, "No, No! Enchilada!") Indeed, it's fun! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> No remake with Woody Allen can be in any way the original fit, because of no curiosity.
