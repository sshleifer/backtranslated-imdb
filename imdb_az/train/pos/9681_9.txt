Paulie parrot add to your favorite animal movie characters. This movie is a love story - Bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and Dear Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian watchman, Marie's parents, helped sell her a tutor who spoke and meditated many years after selling it to a bowl store. We learn all of Paulie's harassment before the heartbeat is over. Cheech Marin and his dance handles are beautiful. Beautiful photography for a long time. The great little movie, the word mouth, will make her love the cult.
