Amazing! Wow. I saw this last night and still think how good it is. Although each character feels real (although most of them are small, selfish, they are a hole) and a strange story - the middle aged widow begins to shake the jealous lover - feeling completely convincing. <br /> <br /> And director Roger Michell sets out for her best performances, Anne Reid and Daniel Craig in the North (the latter the next David Thewlis). Notting Hill is far from it as it is not possible. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
