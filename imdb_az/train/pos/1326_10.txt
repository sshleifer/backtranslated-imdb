I saw this movie in a college film festival in the 70s - FOREVER for the release of this movie (finally). I was in Brazil, so I assumed that she had not yet made a video. I've been watching video stores waiting for this great movie to come out for the last 15 years! <br /> <br /> According to some reports, there are several articles about film shootings: several hundred years ago, when Europeans first encountered the tribes of Amazon in colonial times. The white man is wrong as the enemies of Jewish greetings, so he intends to kill him. Before sending him, they make him a part of his tribe. The whole film is a country that has been accepted by its gatekeepers, watching the National Geographic documentary. This is so. Cosmic plotline? No. Scattered thoughts on the diversity of human life? <br /> <br /> Yes, maybe this kind of warning ... this movie has a certain nudity - it's not the nakedness of Hollywood's noble savages ... it reads it above: National Geographic, super realism) <br /> <br />
