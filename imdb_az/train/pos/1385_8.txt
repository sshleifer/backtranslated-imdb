After one night in Paris, I saw the first social project Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille. A very beautiful movie about three 15 year old teenagers, all of them in the same psychological stage. Many scenes allow teenagers to return to their first feelings of age and sex. it is possible to imagine that the director wants to deprive the girls of the first strong feelings, and even in such a situation does not undermine the possibility of the story. Sometimes you can find the movie a little slower, but it creates a charming atmosphere. Floriane and Marie are very convincing in funding talented young actresses. There are very small details, but this movie also has revealed what synchronized swimming is: surprising!
