Two adventurous teens, good friends, travel to Thailand for the last time before leaving and leaving for college. It looks like an enjoyable time during hiking trips to the exotic lands, while traveling to Hong Kong and giving an attractive strange answer to their luggage. Nabbed by local police and justice in Asia can find that justice in the United States is very different. <br /> <br /> This is the main story line for the "Brokedown Palace" and was good. The film is doing a decent job to describe the arbitrary and anti-corruption justice system in the Third World. In fact, the description was very small, because prison conditions are often worse than the picture. <br /> <br /> This is a sacred thing compared to the rest of the world, although we think how bad our justice system is. Unfortunately, there were many situations in the movie that blocked the story. All the attempt to escape was a false fantasy. Comrade believes that guards or viewers are totally blocked to think that they can get a bribe to bribe inside a patchy column and that they will not be discovered by systematically supervised guards. <br /> <br /> The story is not about nagging as Alice's (Claire Danes) backpack has been taken. Did he really agree to transport drugs? We guess. She was keen to predict that the girls were innocent throughout the film, but we will end up in the movie that one or both of us can not really be guilty. <br /> <br /> The move prepared by Klaus Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very definite and good. Extremely exhausted and numerous Danes, in fact, acted as an actor in this film. His drawings were often faded (though not his character), but improved as the film's development and the terrifying situation. Beckinsale, on the other hand, flies under the radar's short career, and suddenly shines like two beautiful shoes in the prison. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman has been infringed. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <Div> <div> <BR> <BR> <BR> Tourist's Thai view was interesting, but I did not want to go there. <br /> <br /> Generally, a fun movie was not felt by placing some ridiculous scenes. I gave it 7/10.
