Definitely a great drama and Ros's top notch ... I highly recommend this movie. In his opinion, the Oscar award was the outfit! The only real sad thing here is that Universal did not see any video formats, whether it was tape or DVD. They do not see a very good movie. However, the universal universal library does not pay much attention to the DVD. See if you get the chance to see it together (why rarely do it in cables)! I will not go into the story, because I think that most people should give an idea to the film and many "reviewers" write down the story of anywhere. <br /> <br />
