McConaughey is a fright / thriller? I have to see it. <br /> <br /> My wife has just begun. <br /> <br /> I can not say more than without neglecting the whole movie, we apologize. Just know that at least you will be surprised if you decide to follow it. <br /> <br /> All major players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job of directing these children, and his player was awesome. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges you to think. Daddy crazy? Does God exist? There are demons? How accurate it would be to go wrong. Anyway, what is "right"? I still think. <br /> <br /> So, I suggest Frailty. 7/10 and this is one of the second, and even the third, award-winning films.
