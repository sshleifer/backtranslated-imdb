If the movie is a noisy admirer and they do not use it as their own, then the answer here is not Hollywood. We need to refer to the French language to commemorate the extent to which a well-prepared film of this genre is subtle and terrible. <br /> <br /> Read My Lips, read a nice little gift from directors Jacques Audard to faithful people. Emmanuel Devos and Vincent Cassel have dramatic stories and great performances. <br /> <br /> The main complex was written in the 40's: but unreasonable, yet tolerant, femme fatale (which is vigorously ambitious), grieving each other, experiencing mixed hopelessness and longing for each other, manipulates one, develops intricate love / hatred, Heist, double cross, close calls, and many schemes. All moves occur in troublesome, delicate and / or poorly lit areas. <br /> <br /> Audiard, of course, has made some modern feelings. Femme is an underappreciated office worker who uses lip-reading ability to fatale is almost deaf and its revenge for those who marginalize. And when you wait for the steamy love scenes, you see that both characters are sexually inadequate and immature. Add a bit of contemporary technology and music and it looks like a modern movie, but it does not make any mistakes - it's old school movie noir. This genre and any movie is good as one of the best I've seen all year round.
