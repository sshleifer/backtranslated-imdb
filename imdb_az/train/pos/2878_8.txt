For a very long time in my life, I did not like this movie, or I did not like it. I recently looked (a sleepover, funnily enough) and I liked it more than once because I was under six or something. Now, I appreciate this with a few other Disney classics I've seen recently (including Sleeping Beauty and Pinnochio) or whatever you write. <br /> <br /> Now, the animation is transformed into a clever "Disney" area, the mood of the mice, the emotions and the plot are highly appreciated. The animation is very good, and in most cases you see where other characters are. The animation also well illustrates the style of the city's background (two times briefly). Disney, surprisingly good, changes the original tale, the dresses and the main part (usually I do not like Disney movies, they are not like the original story), but I'm not worried about it. I feel that they make the necessary changes to make this good Disney movie and I do not think that she often changed her book in some of Disney's films). <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a girl who works for her dreadful mother and sister. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will be watched with other people. Immediately the family is not good enough. To do so, it is advisable to watch it with your friends (and your immediate family at any time). :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who love Disney at least for some who love fairy tales and love rats. Enjoy! :-)
