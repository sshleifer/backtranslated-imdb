Atlantis: The Lost Empire has the best, straightforward animation and cleverly written dialogue of any Disney movie I've ever seen. And I believed in the first 15 minutes. Especially I love the sound of Don Novello's Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Too bad, the whole movie moves at approximately twice as fast as it is at least in the first move. An important feature of any Disney movie is a delightful antagonist that Atlantis did not provide. It is in the best condition. In the middle of the film there is a twist. All this. There is, however, a great movie. Everyone should check it.
