Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce are brilliant in this beautiful example of brotherhood love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick (Nicky), a 12-year-old younger, twin brother Liugta, a mentally retarded young man playing Eugene's medical school. Baltimore, and is related to fraternity competition, the twin's unbearable bondage, child abuse, and good issues that always get worse. It's full of charm, laughter and tears. If you have not already seen this movie, please rent, I promise you will be glad to see how such a beautiful movie will be recognized.
