Michael Keaton takes part in the game "Johnny Dangerously" on gangster films made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne DA's brother, Peter Boyle's boss, and Marilu Henner's girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton says he owns a pet store that holds a child who stole a puppy in the 1930s, and then tells him how he came to the petback shop. Her mother turned into a kid at a small age to buy a pancreatic surgery ($ 49.95), and began to work for a head coach (Boyle). <br /> <br /> There are some staggering scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is persistent as Johnny's frail mother needs her body instead of her body. Johnny's director, Peter Boyle, gives Griffin Dunne a comic performance like a plain axis, "play ball" with curved Burr (Danny De Vito). Like Johnny's Nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri appears as Moronie, a tortured Englishman, but you need to hear it instead of reading it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; . For some reasons, this movie was released, and Keaton's other gem, like Night Shift, has not heard much of it today. With some demonstrations and scenes with true stones, you'll find great happiness with "Johnny Dangerously".
