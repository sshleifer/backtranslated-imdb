Superman and Mole Men are probably the supreme adventures of Superman. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, where the world's deepest oil wells are. There, though, some of the radioactive molecules go out of the well and look at the city. Jeff Corey and many urban residents are trying to use the aggressive mole resources. Can Superman change people's ways to save their mole? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and Mole Men are very clever, well-written and very good film. It's still a great Superman adventure, though we've just blown up Supermans just once. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
