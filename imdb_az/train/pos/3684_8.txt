... It is a moving holiday for Paris. "Ernest Hemingway <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How much talent can not be counted in Paris, immortality in painting, poetry, poetry, short, but unforgettable quotations, and yes - famous film director Max Ophuls spoke about Paris <br /> <br /> "This is a bright boulevard under the street lights, and your breakfast in Montmartre has been presented with glass cognac, coffee and warm brioche, gigolos and whores. night <br /> <br /> Paris always associates love and romance with a collection of short films titled "Petite romances", Paris, Je T'Aime, often presents sketches from 18 talented film directors around the world. Each of them has one of the 20 cities in the city of Light and at every age, we get acquainted with the Parisians, sex, color and roots. we are in love with some changes and stages. In some "romantic romances", we are experiencing unexpected encounters leading to sudden interest, proximity and possibly relationships: Podalydes in Montmartre Street, and Florensia Muller's Open Movie, or a white boy for Cyril Descours and Leila Beckty, as a girl begins the cultural romance led by Gurinder Chadha in Quais de Seine. I will include Gus Van Santin's short film. A child of "Le Marais" <br /> <br /> Some vignettes are ambushed and even dark. <br /> <br /> Some vineyards are real and even dark. Valter Salles and Daniela Thomas at Loin du 16ème, Catalina Sandino Mareno (Awarded by Oscar-winning Oscar Prize for Maria Gracein Maria), every morning without having to work. One of the most memorable and truly heartwarming films is "Place des Fêtes" by Oliver Schmitz. Aisa Maiga and Seydou Boro could have been two young singers. These promises existed for a short time due to the hate and intolerance of everywhere, and the city of Love and Light is no exception. Indeed, another man coming to me was Bastille, written and directed by Isabel Coixet, by Sergio Castellitto, Miranda Richardson, and Leonor Watling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All 18 small gems . I love some of them. Others felt weak and might soon be forgotten, but I usually get the DVD and know that I'll be back to my favorite movies. "Place des Fêtes", associated with Wes Craven's "Père-Lachaise", "One of the best and most intelligent people" Oscar Wilde ("Sideways" director Alexander Payne), will end up having a problematic relationship. Payne also directed "14 Arrondissement", where Denver, CO's only middle-aged worker, explodes his city by singing the French with a heavy emphasis on the city. Payne's entry by Joel and Ethan Coen (who?) Steve Buschemi is with my most demanding and tedious "Tuileries" for being my favorite. On both shirts, American tourists sit on the benches by observing the surrounding life with different results (at Park Margo, after visiting Metropolitan Steve and Louvers in Paris). Margo says, "My feeling is sad and bright, my sadness is brilliant ..." Steve's character will sometimes learn that even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide will not help a tourist avoiding something wrong in a foreign country.
