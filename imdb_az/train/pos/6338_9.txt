I liked this movie, which I have seen several times in the original film, but could not remember any details. In my opinion, this movie is more elegant and not black than the animated film. I really liked how exactly that kind of character was and why it was his way, but the legend in this movie was not the original Grinch, but Major, which was different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey took part in a big movie for both children and adults.
