Very strange and entertaining movie. About a very tough and dense wounded man who is trying to walk as a closed indoors / vendor in his life. The director really kept a very regrettable feeling that the story served well. Finding a great humor in the accompanying pain is original and uncomfortable. There is a sequence in a test center that really exists, and it laughs at me, not something that is not often needed. One of the more memorable films I have seen for a long time. It does not leave my mind and we look forward to future efforts by Bronstein. Fantastic performances around. Simple Line "I really appreciate it". now it's symbolic to me.
