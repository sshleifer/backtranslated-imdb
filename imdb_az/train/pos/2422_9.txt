Yes, it's a low budget. Yes, this is one of the earliest movies of Candyin, but perhaps the most funniest! John Candy has been removed from the SCTV's "Going Berserk" and shows it. Candy is just a cohort of elderly cousins ​​who just falls in love with a lover when you try to help a boy with a ghost (huh ?, see the movie) or Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) talking to her mother on the phone or just countless phrases that Candy can provide you better check your pulse! If you love John Candy for "Only Lonely," I can not recommend a movie, but if you talk about John Candy's SCTV days, you need to see this movie!
