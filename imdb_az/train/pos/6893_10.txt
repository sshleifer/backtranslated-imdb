Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, funny, tender, brave and lover. Like the story or other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou!), It gives a superior dimension to a movie with even a single piece of work. rhythm Never boring, always creates new emotions: For me, the best French film of all time.
