The comment would be added to RELEASE TATE, but it could not find a place for that. I was surprised that this movie was featured in the United States in February 1955. I saw him in the "first run" theater in Washington in March 1958. Re-released or an issue? In my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but there are some classic characters. John McIntyre does not work as a corrupt judge / businessman / thief. Walter Brennan is basically the same role she had previously made in the Red River. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives a great performance. I saw this movie half a dozen or more and I did not repeat that one more time. The photography and scenery are beautiful and offer a great fun for an hour and thirty-six minutes.
