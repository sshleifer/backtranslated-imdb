Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very loose player in the short cartoon market. This market is dominated by the Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies shorts from Warner Bros.

Colors are good mix and each small detail is displayed in a massive epic environment. The concept itself is brilliant. The elves attract the heroes, as "Old Man Winter", which effectively describes the cold and brutal feelings of the white season. <br /> Here's a strong message too. At the end of the war, the elf did not move and the elves won the winter, but the elves disappeared until the end. So the point is: only one person can create a difference. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Spring" is a noteworthy classic of the short animated film. More importantly, the director of this animated film was here for the first time. And who is the "Spring" director? A certain William Hanna ...
