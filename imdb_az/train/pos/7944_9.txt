There is nothing, or if you have a pet and a pet with you, and who is your love anyway? Betcha never thought you would think the same way! <br /> <br /> Beautiful, beautiful family movie. If you have a soft spot for your animals, it is guaranteed to cry, regardless of age. When I was a little kid, I was used to watch this movie all the time and now I love it as I've seen it at the age of sixteen. Then I can not decide on a cute character and I still do not think I can! I love all the animals. The dialogue seems very realistic and comfortable, like a very affectionate, but painful family. I love Luck and finally says that he is finally a family. Cheese should remember, however, that it is a family movie and that it is perfectly fulfilled. <br /> <br /> Sassy has the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect leader / role model for a young, adventure Chance. The way of animals surprises people, but, of course, has been able to interact with the vast majority of predatory moments (eg Molly's survival, ending). Let's not just talk about an incredible soundtrack that gives you more emotions and accompanying feelings. I give it 9/10. Compare with Cats and Dogs and Dad (even better rated).
