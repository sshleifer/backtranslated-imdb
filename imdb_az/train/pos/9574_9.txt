It had to be one of the best films ever to get out of the HK for a long time, just looking at the title and waiting for my hand to cover it. This show depicts the fantasies of the actors and the fact that, for me, Sam Lee's incredibly credulous behavior and a killer machine that turned Edison's normal idol image on the contrary. It is definitely for those looking for a stylish and action-packed movie. However, I must not warn you, it's just an exciting movie, as every character in the film is dead and in trouble and tries to breathe. Provides life's true thinking.
