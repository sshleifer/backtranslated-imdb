First, the film is a work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a small boy who claimed a million dollars and how a child spends. I do not want to say what that is? Walt Disney really did get out of this time. Comedy is the vast majority of what is expected, but it is unexpected. That is, this movie was OK or it was OK. She also teaches many things about clever young people, and this kid is a really smart and intelligent trunk. But that is good. This guy like a guy can pick up a hot police girl and his father can release him freely. It looks like a murderer is released ten years. If I did, I would have been beaten up by a Sub Jack (crying when it was used to make your pits really difficult). This kid is really lucky. Back to the story. Filmmakers really knew what they did when they made this movie, but it's still not perfect. The player was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry, what did the father do, but the bros was good. " On the other hand, special effects were also naked. This movie is now based on reality. At the same time I hated and loved it.
