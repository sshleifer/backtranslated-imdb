I believe that Sopranos is a great show for all the supporting characters. So far, I bought every video and waited for the release of the rest. In all 42 episodes so far one of the best is definitely Episode # 3, Denial, Anger, Admission. This episode deals with the favorite character of all time in Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for kidnapping an incorrect truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was awesome because he was really one of the few characters against Tony and his band. Finally, when he used the bath, he began to shoot at his eyes and this is my favorite scene in the history of Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after trying to kill Christopher Moltisanti, was my 2nd favorite. Tony and Pussy hit him in the Hucklebarney park after capturing him and torturing him. # 3 my favorite character, Sean Gismonte, who was killed after hitting Christopher. And finally, my # 4's most beloved character is Chucky Signore, Uncle Junior's henchmen. Toni was killed by boat. All the awesome characters die. It's just a bad thing about Sopranos. All the cool guys are always killed. What do you think about Sopranos? They must have all episodes of the characters supporting the dead in hell and they try to torture Chris, Tony, Junior, Silvio and Paulie because they have to take revenge. Brendan Filone will shoot back !!!!!!!!! 1
