(There is not much to Spoyler because there is nothing to reveal, but still, I describe a part of it ...) That's it. This is the most amazing film I've ever seen. Although the "strange" "laugh" and "ego ride" is quite close, there is simply no word to describe this film. In fact, strange music videos with opening half an hour or really really no plot or durability, some of these previous MJ falls. One of the main parts of the "movie" section in the section where MJ blows a slippery airplane that appears to be a semi-arc communication application is from the Yellow Submarine (your dear brother). <br /> <br /> After about an hour, begins, is a signature of your "hero" with many claymation (some really creepy). Obviously, this is still a bit of anxiety as it is quiet (discounting songs) and temporarily loses them. Thank him because he can be a witness to a falling star and I will not do it again, and become a claymation rabbit. He uses these obsolete disguise to break and hide the past, but because of the reason I can not recall them, they see (no!) And the creepy persecution begins again. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the end of the exploration, the MJ brings a bird life, it is by a police (in the middle of the desert) to the garden. The rest of the film is just as strange as the MJ clears a bar for Smooth Criminal's regulation, including hitting a man with a finger just killing the guy but burning his shadow on the wall, a weapon of a nuclear weapon . MJ, whom Mister Big (Joe, "What happened to his career at this point?" Peschi), when one of his friends was stolen, creates a magic tommy weapon, and at another moment Pepper describes this movie in a random way, shoots everything that moves. The last moment of the MJ when surrounded by Mr. Big and his special army. Seriously, this man has been working with them and they are shot as more commando units. How come? Why turns it into a complete robot from the gun and shield. <br /> <br /> This movie is the fourth of the fourth transformation, almost always supported in the corner and / or running. <br /> <br /> This film is rather surreal and has no durability.
