I watched this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It is incredible how homosexual relationships between authors and heroes are sublimated in the film. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> Pay attention to the incredible cut at the beginning of killing and killing. The phone has been tailored to Perry on the phone. Perry washed his face while washing his face. Only Perry, looking at the mirror and seeing the body of a man erotic, builds a fantasy fantasy playing in a cafe in Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> I know they will not die. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perry, a yellow bird that attacks the oppressed, speaks of her dream called "More Than Iscandar". "They wanted mercy," he says, "The bird killed them anyway." The bird raised Perry to heaven. Strangely enough, Perry Nuns says that he has a disagreement with God and His religion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Nancy Cutter offers to sleep in a friend's home. He holds horse. Perry will take a picture of him and the house. Nancy can not sleep in her friends' home due to her husband's dinner. The decision seals his destiny. <br /> <br /> Perry speaks at Bogart's "Sierra Madre treasure". But Truman Capotein wrote another Bogart picture called "Shattering the Devil", where McGuff is a fictional treasure hunt. However, Dick knows that the heroes of the film have not ended up with anything. <br /> <br /> <strong> If Dick wants to earn money, he thinks that $ 10,000 is in Cyprus's security. <br /> <br /> Perry's Mexican Treasure is like a stranger. <br /> <br /> Herb Clutter, who signed $ 40,000 for life insurance When we know what happens after a few hours, the insurance agent wishes him a long life. <br /> <br /> Dik said that they did not want any witnesses, that they did not want anyone to remember them. Later, in fact, they eliminated all the witnesses that they remembered. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> The audience witnesses after watching the feature film.
