I have reviewed the old VHS tape several times and met with the television show John Denver and The Muppets A Christmas. This was to find a DVD version of this show to go to my computer and buy it. I'm still upset about not finding it on the DVD. It was a 1979 show and a joyful show. I have a note and a CD, but I would like to get the DVD version of this show. The strip is old and the picture quality is pretty good, while fading is not as good as a sound CD. There are several songs that are not included on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and Muppets, this show will be a really good vendor on a DVD. If you do not have a CD, this is a beautiful Chritmas collection of songs from the show. You can find this album and still have a record player to play the album.
