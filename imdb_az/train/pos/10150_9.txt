Of course, this movie is full of gratifying, sweet and cliche, but it's fun. It's fun to do. Natasha Henstridge is so striking with short hair. His smile is bright and his beauty can not be hidden. When it comes to Michael Vartan, I am convinced that women love him. Both of them liked this movie as much as others did. I do not understand the comments that say there is no chemistry among them. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli, despite the fact that D'Abo's English accent had its Bronx, was fun. I did not realize the truth until I read these comments, but I returned to the DVD, and now her dialogue is more for me than the English, but it's perfect for her role. <br /> <br /> This is a story of two beautiful people who are married to others but seek souls together. It can be a difficult story, but who says that movies should play like a documentary? It is more real than any drama that has been shown every hour of the tube. That's why we watch them and stay alive every day and enter the world of symbols on the screen. I thought these actors were doing a good job, but hey, I'm a tearful emotional man. <br /> <br /> Talking about the events in the Caucasus, I will come across a great super movie that I already know. As you can see on the Movies Channel or on Lifelong Films, make a note of what to watch or whatever. I think you love it.
