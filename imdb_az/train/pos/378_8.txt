Spielberg's "Color Purple" reminds us to become a candidate for ten Oscars and cyclists these days. More worrying is that Spielberg is not the best director anymore. <br /> <br /> According to filmmaking, filmmakers are worthy of a higher rate than theirs. <br /> <br /> This story is, first of all, an African woman, her father and then her abusive husband. The film covers a few years and is mainly focused on women in Celie. <br /> <br /> This is a few days, it takes several days. <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-size: <br /> <br /> Some of the movies can really appreciate the end of the movie, but I did not admit that if a similar content in a movie would have rounded me up, <br /> <br /> The film is for Oscars for three actors: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress) I think Goldberg and Winfrey are certainly worthy of Danny Glover is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Spilberg has not appointed the best director because of his efforts, and Spielberg's leadership here is a bust because it's a missing beggar's faith. but not in any way below average. <br /> <br /> Finally, the story is a Pulitzer Prize-winning material, with a pleasure, give it a try, and possibly O I'm thinking of how badly a scar night is going to be.
