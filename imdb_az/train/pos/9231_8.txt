<br /> <br /> FLAVIA THE HERETIC, which we follow in the strange journey of Flavia, is a strange entry into the nunsploite genre - sleaze, feminist journey, and "history." He does not rejoice in the fact that he does not believe in the "rules" that dominate around him and the enlightenment around the world, and that he escapes with the Jewish prophet Ibrahim. Both captured and flown are brought to the place where another "non-believer" joins to accelerate a Muslim occupation. Flavia is dependent on Muslims who want to "engage" the monks and captivate them with a strange scene set. Finally, Muslims will be released and punished for fluvia as another betrayal of Christianity ... <br /> <br /> In a 70-year period, I would like to see a few good eyebrows and a nice leg surface, including nipple removal scene, a very good nudity, including a complete frontal and good story. We can say that the sorta is dragged at a few points, but it is not really enough to be so bored. I would definitely recommend this nunsploit / 70's to exploit fans ... 8/10
