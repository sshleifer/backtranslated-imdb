Although this film has many flaws, it is actually a fun movie of 80s. Eddie Murphy is here over 80 films. <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, though, the film is not perfect for its predecessors, but it's perfect with its perfect partners and foil. <br /> <br /> Well, with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, it's a fun rainy daytime moving comedy. <br /> <br />
