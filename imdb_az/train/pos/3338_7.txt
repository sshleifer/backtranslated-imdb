Fever Pitch is a fairly fun movie. There are many funny moments (including the shower scene hilariously disturbed). <br /> <br /> Like the most romantic comedies, there is a "dead zone" in the middle of all heavyweights, "it breaks with me", but it continues to be funny all the time. <br /> <br /> Although the section is about fanaticism against Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sports. <br /> <br /> You need to be a fan of this movie. Of course, it's very easy for me: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy. <Br / <br /> from 10 to 7. <br /> <br /> Barky
