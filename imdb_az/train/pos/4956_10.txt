This movie is really original and coincidental. It is difficult to find these films about Hollywood movies. I really enjoyed watching this movie, I bought DVDs this morning and watched it 4 times a week. I love the Pazz Spanglish accent, it's really cute as it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < I learned more about life from this movie (well, or at least in the life of the US) ... life is really coincidental ... Sometimes, if you meet someone, they will pass through your life and be friends by chance, and spend a lot of time with them does not, maybe for a while, but with them he enjoys '' the process '', then he and they will never meet each other, but when they are together they are really unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The price of this movie may be inexpensive, but its meaning is not cheap. I rarely learn anything from movies, but this is no exception.
