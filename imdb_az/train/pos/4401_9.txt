Devil and Ride, driven by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger), are another gem in the title of these fine directors. For those who do not know the history of the Kansas-Missouri border wars during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and you will visit America's sad part. Some of the outstanding action scenes (sometimes bloody). This is a story of love and devotion, especially between men and one lady. These stars, like Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright and Young Woman Jewel, have never seen or heard before, I would like to see more) .Active is a very well written (very well written) novel <br /> <br /> This long a movie is 128 minutes, but worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My rating **** <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
