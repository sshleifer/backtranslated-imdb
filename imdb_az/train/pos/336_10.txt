As it is already the best version of the Homer epic. It was totally shot in the natural Mediterranean in the Mediterranean. The sea and the sky are stunningly blue, the islands are green and not touched. Clothing is linen, wool and fur, feet are stony and bare, everything is somewhat firm and primitive, a bit of Cacoyannis or Pasolini, and it's all right. The story is based on myths, but if it is still supernatural, it gives us a good idea of ​​how life would have been at the beginning of the 10th century BC. <br /> <br /> Rhythm is a little slower and tougher, but it's so beautiful that it's going to take him too soon. In fact, it is unbelievably close to the original area by Homer, if not the text itself. Ulysses does not seem up to the first hour; he is staring at his son. Then, suddenly, a kingdom on the island of Foyes lost in the land, and the royal family looked good to him. His adventures are told to the landlords as a story: terrible Cyclop, Circe, Underworld, Sirens and so on. The magical world. Finally, 20 years later, he comes to İthaca'ya to his homeland and all those who claim to be his loyal wife, Penelope, are killed dramatically. <br /> <br /> As a story, Odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor for a person's life struggle. Casting here is bright and international. Irene Papas gives us the typical Greek tragedy style performance like Penelope, but it is like the most beautiful Albanian actor Bekim Fehmiu Ulysses. Really well-visible and completely convincing, this role really looks prepared for her. Strangely, he did not suggest the role of this criterion afterwards. Nausicaa is also known as Barbara Bach (like Barbara Gregorini) and then James Bond, "Spy Me Loving Me," and Michele Breton, playing with Athena, was featured in a strange film called "Performance" with Mick Jagger. <br /> <br /> As it was 35 years ago, the series was actually one of the first major European television productions (Italy, France, Germany and Yugoslavia). I've seen this mini series up to 1974 on French television in eight sections. I was a kid, though it was black and white, and made a very lively impression. <br /> <br /> Recently, I was never shown on French television because I thought I could look at my whole life for a long time. <br /> <br /> Recently, on the DVD (all beautiful colors) via the Internet. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles in Italian only, although French and German versions existed earlier. I did not hear that this movie is in English, because it is not widely known in the Anglo Saxon world and is very shameful. <br /> <br /> <strong> We will talk about the events in Damascus. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> There was no version of Odyssey earlier or later. In 1955, one of Cameroon's Kerk Douglas's plays is a classic sword-in-the-box, not like "10 commands", but effective for such a complex story, and not too short. The Hollywood movie, which was particularly damaging to Konferovsky's special effects in 1997, is sometimes very odd, far worse than Homer's story and atmosphere.
