This is a TV show, which is a frightening film. The 13th class did not have a movie on Friday. Poltergeist heritage: I'm not very sure. Movies could be connected freely. <br /> <br /> Freddie Elm Street shows that her parents were burned (in the first episode I believed) and was the number of parents. disappointment. You would expect more parents to be with all the children in the 1st film. But oh well. Freddi is mainly a narrator for the show. In some cases, people are watching their movements in their real life. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is a supernatural or surprising twist twist, which shows as a crypt from Tales like other anthology. <br /> <br /> There is no acting, but I believe or not: violence is sometimes superior to the film. This show continued for several seasons and the fourth film was timely. I heard that the protest was canceled due to the parents. I watched many children like R, so the shame was forced to destroy their parents for everyone. Four more films came after the series, so there was no overall loss.
