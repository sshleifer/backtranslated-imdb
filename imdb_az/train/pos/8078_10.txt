Although this is a disaster at the box office, it's my favorite movie. It gives a powerful family message. Bikini has a lot of violence and a song with a group of girls. Compared with other Bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more real. Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan are an incredible combination. If Amitabh Hind wants to see his father, he is describing it in this film. Reading the critics' eyes is not just ignorant. This movie has comedy, romance, drama, and a particularly good move. This is a movie that you want to see more realistic than the main Hoon Na (still good movie) movie.
