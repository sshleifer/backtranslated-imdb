Do you want to escape your boring and stressful life at school or at work and to go through your magic adventure, to be one of the closest friends you encounter with all kinds of dangers and disgusting people, and to solve the mystery of language? a lost culture waiting only to find the secrets of one? Even though you are not a fantasy lover, just a few hours of life, do you care about being a child again and caring for any world? <br /> <br /> This is exactly what Miyazaki's "Tower in the Sky" is. Young, but very brave and ambitious engineer Pazu, living a rough life in a mining town until a day, a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky and travels far from the clouds. All these are in fact the traces of pirates and military units. Simply put that every child is an incredible adventure that sleeps somewhere or somewhere, and every time I see it, I feel it's time to melt my anxiety. <br /> <br /> The story, like the movie Spirited Away, Howl's Animated Castle, or even Princess Mononoke, is magnificent or incomprehensible, since Miyazaki has a lot of old works and agenda. Still, it's hard to say that these films are superior to any one of them, because all three of these films are at one point or another, the mystical, ridiculous, especially on the other side. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it does not work hard to be any allegory, and it is not a story related to age; instead it can be one of the best illustrations in a child's concept. The artwork is not only beautiful, but the prospect of using children's eyes is just beautiful; I can not just help FEEL, watch hundreds of feet in the air, watch the big trees and clouds watching on the earth or at the ocean, or whether there is a "camera" to see the incredible part of the height <br /> <br /> " The Prophet (pbuh) said: "My Lord, San or Chihiro / Haku, the angel of Sheeta Pazu, as if it were literally dropped from the sky to the life of the day, a perfect man for him from the start. most of them come up with their good words and beautiful facial expressions, not just an admiring reminder I use, but their extremely friendly friendships, even if they remain all over the film, to the last frame, so they are more than Miyazaki's pair <br /> <br /> At the same time, It's an easy-to-shoot movie in the "Sky Fortress" because you're sure to make it here, no matter what a casual movie you are. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, tension, fantasy, romance, and even some western ... everything here is related to the fact that everybody (perhaps horrified) goes to the movie. That's why I can easily present it as the first Miyazaki movie; <br /> <br /> The last song of the movie, when translating into English, translates a sense of longing, and is ideal for those who do not wait for the incredible uniqueness of some of their latest works. a sort of lost soul, and a sort of spirit that can be found in our worldly life. "I do not want too much lights for a long time, you are in one of them ... The place is as if it were carrying you, leading us to someone who always welcomed us." Miyazaki has always presented poetic lyrical words to finish Joe Hiasashi's excellent honey scores, but I've also seen a touching song of love and inspirational sleep. <br /> <br /> "The Tower of the Sky" can not be the most sophisticated, magnificent or meaningful work of Miyazaki, but it certainly can be perfect, as it is intended. a true vision of childhood fantasy and a beautiful race of truth, for adults who want to have the same sense of imagination when they are just careless little children. Sit back, relax, and love it for what it is.
