This game has a structure that you can want to see in fun and actually funny. The Spider-Man is set up by a mysterious accuser. The city is replaced by a strange gas, and the symbols like Venom and the Fear appear on the whole of the city. Who is behind these crimes? Can Doc Ock be? Well, it seems to have turned into a new leaf. Venom does not appear to be attracted just as the Spider-man has determined that he spends a good photo opportunity as seen. After coming out of the other heroes and many villains, Spidey will open the mystery. Fighting is not difficult to take on the ground, struggling with bosses is very entertaining. You collect the comic books, run away from the internet, and have fun in many parts of the city. But this is a weak point. Spider-man, because of the shooting of his nets with the skies, is not a strange thing to do. Specifically, you do not have a multi-maneuverable web-slinging, compared to the Spider-Man 2 movie video game. Still, it's getting worse with the story, especially with other elements. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for a wild motion ride.
