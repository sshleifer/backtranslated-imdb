In his first criticism, critical and financial flop turned around critics and said that the film's director was the best. Some of the most exciting and beautiful women in the film (Detroit, Ben Gaszara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) are similar in reliability and love to feel the movie after falling in love (Audrey Hepburn, Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Most of the scenario is written or rewritten on the film day, as it seems to be a movie director. Ben Gaszara is excellent as the chief detective who oversees Audrey Hepburn while leaving the singer Colleen Camp and as seen on the side of the cab driver, Patti Hansen. John Ritter stubbornly follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately fell in love with her. Blaine Novak (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena) has a few girls following. This movie has some great performances by a proven cast. Standouts are Audrey Hepburn (there is no line in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzara is never one of the best (and an inspiration option for romantic lead), and Colleen Camp is one of his best roles like Manic Country singer Christy Miller. He is a blessing to watch as a fire of his lines delivering a rat-a-tat-tat. Highly Recommended! ********* stars!
