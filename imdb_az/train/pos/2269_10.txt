I recently read the novel "Mother's Night" and now I have a DVD and have often watched her. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see and hear a few films that I saw and watched, but not to Vonnegut's brightness, but to turn it into a screen. <br /> <br /> In the VHS, watching or watching this movie should be seen on the DVD and the filmmaker should comment on the film. <br /> <br /> The film is still complicated in terms of material and dialogue to see if a film is about to take a very simple story. text and can not be diminished, film can be a book and the most adaptation I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
