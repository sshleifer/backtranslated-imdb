This movie is light, comic and beautiful. <br /> <br /> This is better than the US and French standards, and best of all, it's better than sentimental comedy and English. <br /> <br /> Each character is touched, and interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is beautiful, Sylvie Moreau is better than the Catherine series, Stefan Gagnon's charming, Emmanuel Bilodaau is great in its bizarre role and Genevi√®ve Laroche is the best friend! <br /> <br /> Take a few hours before making any negative comment on this movie, give it a chance, and add your own view.
