Kate Beckinsale impressed! Bravo! Very bad Ritchi does not look as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did an incredible job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emmas's father. I love the last scene when it is in product and treats employees and high society friends (in addition to novel, but well written). Emma must now show that she has accepted it. She is a changed woman. This is very quick, but OK. I'll include it. Samantha Bond plays Emma's former teacher and assistant. He is beautiful. I would imagine it. I believe it's the best Jane Austen in the UK. American versions of English literature are made for money, not for quality. See it!
