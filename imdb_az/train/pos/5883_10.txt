Watching vocals and physical activity, I was stunned and surprised. The roles of each character he played were perfect. Words, words, every gesture, sunrise, all explained. The movie talked to me. He has enlightened me in a different perception of the man who believes in humanity. Believe in peace and soft behavior. I also believed in sacrificial and human dignity. Without power, demented and without feelings of grace. It is incredible to ask for the power of humanity. This movie was afraid for people around the world. And, I think they are sorry. I love this movie for conversations and facial expressions. This movie is blessed.
