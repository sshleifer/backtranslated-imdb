Jackie Chan's Police Story is an important film for both Jackie Chan's career and Honkqqq. <br /> <br /> Chan has written and written, The Police Story has a basic structure like all the films of that era. and as the genre and most of the film's Storys movie, the script is nothing to write. <br /> <br /> The film's director, Jackie Chan, plays a beautiful boy's police, struggling to condemn the local network lord. <br /> <br /> The film's direction is nothing, and as Jackie Chan gives us without any effort in the best direction, this responsibility lies in the unfounded masterpiece "Miracles". But Jackie's work is fair and respected. The directing mode of the film comes with scenes of fighting. <br /> <br /> Speeches in this movie change with giving Jackie a very strong typical Chan boy, but this is the best-performing role that can be seen in Sammo Hung's "Dragon's Heart". Other actors in the film give a good performance like Bridgete Lin and Jackie, who play a good part of the unwanted witness, but does not demonstrate full potential. The magnificent actor comes from Maggie Cheong as a sympathetic and funny police chief, like Jackie's unlucky girl and Bill Tung. None of the appearances in the film are sufficiently low to influence the quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> The action in the film is that this movie is urbanized, with the contemporary style of contemporaneity separating it from others with modern choreography, the action is part of the biggest battle scenes on the camera. First of all, when Koo (ganglord) deals with a drug deal, no John Woo style sequences, it serves as a great start for this movie. Then, when the famous machine runs from the hill and slips into the heart of the slope, it dims everything. This is a breath-staged sequence copied by Bad Boys-2. As Jackie is trying to convey Bridgete Lin's home, she's still in the middle of the movie. This is really the first scene to see the awesome fast paced hand to miss the battle that has become a norm for all modern martial arts films. This sequence is fantastic, choreographed, timely and smoothly designed to maximize the scene's cruelty. But because of the dictation of the tradition, the sequence of image struggle is at the end of the film. This sequence shows Chans best choreography, stunts, and camera / editing jobs. This consistency is known for two things: the amount people send through a high-volume bottle, a number of people's philosophy and jackie's 5th-floor balcony slide down a bent and slide it down with a glass roof (this can be seen). Although both of these factors are unique, the most striking part of this sequence is Chance's ability to join the battlefield and to combine the uniqueness of choreography. The action at Police Story has become one of the best shot and edited actions of Chance's career. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, Chance is one of the best action films of all time, due to the Police Story, unexpected storyline and scripts, working in the middle of the field, the best choreography, the best shooting action and, of course, its most spectacular stunt, makes this an important view for everyone. Afterall, watch a Chan movie for action!
