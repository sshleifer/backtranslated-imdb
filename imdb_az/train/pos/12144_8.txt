I thought it was going to continue to the 36th Chaolin Chamber, but in fact, there was a "sister" with a light heart. Gordon Liu is a star as a strange hero in search of learning kung fu to defeat this frustrating Manchu ... but this time it is lighter and more comedy. The film is located around the local paint factory, where the salary was cut off due to the recruitment of 10 new Manchurian bosses. Liu plays the name "Chao" and knows who can talk because he thinks he is a master of a chaos with almost magical kung fu skills. <br /> <br /> Since last year, he will go to the Shaolin monastery to study the Kung Fu and return to protect them. <br /> <br /> Comedy really begins. In the monastery, where several bomb attacks were made by Chao. It really builds many funny moments and choreography in a very big fight. In the "36th Chamber" tradition, we see every kind of neat and exciting (and superior hockey) training methods as well as creative use of wooden benches. <br /> <br /> A mixture of craftsmanship of kung fu and bamboo pier. Chao is not accepted as a student in Shaolin, but is built to build a bamboo pier for the "10-year restoration" of the monastery. I bought a DVD on a bamboo scaffolding building and was inspired by the director Lau Kar-Leung. The West uses only steel tubes and shorts, although this is a few centuries (perhaps thousands) of art, and the pontoon in Hong Kong is still built from a large bamboo. As a result of his scaffolding, Chao develops a special kung fu style ... whatever he asks, he responds with joy, "scaffolding kung fu!" first tested a dust-up time with Abbott at the monastery. <br /> <br /> <strong> Kempinski, </ strong> <br /> <br /> Generally, it is a kung fu movie. .. I would recommend it to anyone!
