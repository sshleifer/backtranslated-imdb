At first, I saw that these stones were back in the way of Joe Sarno, and I would never forget Jennifer Welles. At first, I thought that the movie was more effective than Sarno's film, but Jennifer introduced it, for the first time, I saw it everywhere, sat down and warned. It is difficult to prevent its presence in this film and it blends every scene in which it participates. I have seen most of Sarno's films and other films starring Jennifer Welles, and I must say that Sarno and Jennifer are their collective good. The leadership of Sarno's domestic drama drama is superior, and Jennifer (figuratively and literally) showed this one-sided act of prowess. Co-stars Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan and Ms. Welles often share incredible performances as well as common stars, as well as sophisticated housewives, often starred in the work of Sarno. This movie is classic Sarno.
