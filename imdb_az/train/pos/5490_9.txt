It's a really amazing movie. In addition to documenting the everlasting struggle of indigenous and invalid people, it shows its immorality, insults, and indifference to prevent the United States from defending human rights and self-determination. Chavez can only be described as a brave and charismatic leader, but can be characterized as an irreconcilable elite who is deprived of any sense of proportion or sense of justice. These films have marked a coup unlike anything we previously had witnessed. <br /> <br /> We can see the United States once again by cutting the ropes and cutting down all the feelings of true truth. It is heartwarming to explain the beginning stages of this rebellion, which is a tool used by the consistent American governments and their citizens, who are after the democratization of the witness we are witnessing. It seems that this is not the manipulation of television or general images, but of the fact that there are no actual documents fighting for the future of the people and its government. A truly moving experience for everyone who has a conscience. These Irish film artists deserve our gratitude. Long life Chavez. <br /> <br /> We must identify the concept that each country should choose to be its own government and that it should be allowed to develop in the most appropriate ways. The first stage of this process has to know what the reality is and this documentary is doing just fine.
