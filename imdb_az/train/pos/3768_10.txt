I understand that most people hate this movie, but I must admit that this is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think people will never give this story a credit, but on the contrary, it's hard to write a Return to the Future, Time Travel, and they include Time Travel and Spiritual travel. <br /> <br /> I also felt that Keanu and Alex were the best performances in this movie, they looked cooler, <br /> <br /> The design of this movie is very beautiful. Groups are sometimes incredibly detailed and massive, and it may be difficult to believe that these groups are filmed on two films. <br /> <br /> <strong > well awsome too. Bill and Ted, in fact, like the perfect adventure, look cool as they look at the Bogus Journey, which they look like FAGS! <br /> <br /> Even in this movie, the music is awsome, especially considering it. I can say a lot about this movie, I love it. But that's one of my growing movies, and I've always liked it so much that we can see why it hated it or just compared Bogus with the perfect adventure. <br /> <br /> WANT YOUR GOOD PAGE!
