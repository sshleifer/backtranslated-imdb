Once a year this movie comes in and makes it easy for you. You are not just trying to think that you are good, that's all. When you watch it, you like it and you take it home. I can not say that it is absolutely flawless but close. Acting - great, story-of-interest elements. This small family story is quite predictable, but this is not something that is important. This is the way to reach the blind girl. I am astonished that Basbug described the deep relationships (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing that did not really like me was the actress who played with his mother, very difficult and unnecessary. Keren
