I really enjoyed this adaptation of Emma .I have seen it many times and always wanted to see it again. Although only 107 minutes went on, most of the new plot and sub-areas have been flourished with pleasure. All characters are well illustrated. <br /> <br /> As Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensitivity, most of the dialogues do not deceive the novel. <br /> <br /> As a foreign country, I highly appreciate the excellent diction of actors. The setting and dresses were beautiful. In 1995, I was very familiar with this version with the Pride and Prejudice movie, but then the producer and the screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale has done a really good job of reflecting "Emma," Jane Austen said no one would create a heroine, but she would love her. He is snobbish, but he may not have enough young people and experience. Mark Strong was also a good thing when describing Mr Knightley, but I think Colin Firth has no character in Mr. Darcy's Pride and Prejudice. Even the last scene (the product festival), which did not take place in the novel, gave no other result than Emma's cold and Frank Churchill, though he had a thorough reconciliation with him in the novel, and would have been a double advantage. Sincerity strangely traveled, but on the contrary, it was shown throughout the film. Apart from Jane Austen's novels, I find more suits more attractive and more attractive.
