This show is awesome! I've been a fan since putting it on the premiere, and that's just me watching ... I've seen some awful things here, I did not want it, but I really did not know how one step was all that was addict. You can see all kinds of dependencies because you're dependent on drugs and alcohol, or eating disorders. And in fact, it's great to see some of the most famous faces that really come to light. In fact, there are musicians, an NBA player, and even young people who need help. And it was awesome since he started to show some persecution. Now you can see how long they are after sending their ep. If you do, please do so. It's in A & E and it's awesome! If you're right about the new eps, it's Sunday nights at 10PM EST ... so set TiVo!
