When you're the first kiss, your first boy / girlfriend, or your first child, you remember this summer ... this movie is for you! Okay, this movie will win an Oscar and will never win, but like a Dominican ... If you are not part of the film, there are some things that can go right to your head ... The children are raised by a grandmother, with parents and a Cafe Bustelo Tin (sooo Dominican!), Judy is followed by men in the neighborhood, going to the church and illuminating the candle candles ... the shine of the film was small details. Of course, all the studies were not to produce kinematic extravaganza, but to be NOR, it was meant to be an educational tool for those who want to learn Latin culture (type: new friends instead). Most of a bitter, bitter, treacherous part kept it without realizing it. As in "Y Tu Mama Tambien", this is the age of a boy. I recommend it (especially Dominicano!) = O)
