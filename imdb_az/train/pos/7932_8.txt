I know what to expect when watching a low budget movie. I'm looking forward to working to avoid being better off budget. I'm waiting for the good lighting (budget reasons). I do not expect the sound to be good (budget again). Rate these low budget movies as a great budget movie! I understood budget constraints with a low budget movie that I'm a filmmaker. Places, shooting and so on. Steal ... goes from the list. I do not want to say that all players are bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is natural. Karl has not been sold yet in Washington. It should be understood that each line is not important, and some lines are thrown out. I want to see what a movie is next, a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave it a 8. I wanted to see what happens next. Big business Quiroz brothers!
