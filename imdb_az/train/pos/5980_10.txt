First, this is really my favorite movie. No need to give a description to anyone, because each hole makes it. The metal scary jaw of the 80's, I do not fully understand with this practical, flawless, cheeky, flattering effect, made in a bad way, "bum-stick". The director (I heard) hoped for a hit in the box that he could continue and has a FREDDY / JASON type for himself. Damn, I wish it could look like it! Soundtrack's banging. The operation is good ... CHECK THIS MOFO EXPOSURE. and do not hesitate to chat with any die-hard fans, emails and for a while. Midgetorgy .... I can find YAHOO.
