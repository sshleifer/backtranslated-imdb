This stylistically intricate visual game presents a story in a story. Hero writer Bart Klever is suffering from new text. At the same time, we are watching the scenario of the movie. Bart's writer writes a film by a script? Bart's text struggle is the subject of a narrative as he cares for his home environment and his little girl. Sincere ambience offers extensive opportunities for illusion games involving space, light, colors and a few cats. A simple world outside the room is even more difficult with the unstable dimensions of the text that is affected by the interference of the cinema that serves as a point of view on the computer monitor and resembles a changing environment. Regularly changing viewpoints make the answers to the questions arising: what is "truth" and "illusion"? What part of the world is in expectation and is superior to others? Can anything in the prophetic scene be a key point?
