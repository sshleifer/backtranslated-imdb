This 5-part drama has only 2 episodes, but I can say that it's one of the best things I've ever seen. It has a TV, a silver screen and even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's almost demoralizing! As a viewer, I'm so excited to say that the episode is over two weeks from Monday until Monday. <br /> <br /> I am a modern guy who had been back from television dramas earlier. Compared to movies, television dramas have always been dated, very discreet and good, generally boring! The "Five Days" really brought the dramatic drama of the 21st century, so it's going to change for me at least. Watch it.
