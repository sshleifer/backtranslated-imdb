"Read My Lips" is a strange simbiosis that develops between the simplest, publicly-funded female office worker (Devos) and his workplace trainee exon (Casel).

Characteristic films with powerful psychodramatic weakening are good for everyone. Subtitles and good translations in French are easy to read. (B +)
