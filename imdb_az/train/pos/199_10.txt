I saw hundreds of silent movies. Someone will always be classics (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, General and Wings), but among them my favorite movie (can not be the best - but cute, yes). In fact, when I looked at the IMDb, I felt that the movie laughed at me right away because the movie was very sweet and well prepared. Marion Davies proved this movie with a really great talent and was not JUST William Randolph Hearst's mistress. <br /> <br /> This story comes from every expectation that Hollywood will be a momentous star next to Hollywood. His experiments and exciting cues of the stars of the era make a real treat for movie buffs and see!
