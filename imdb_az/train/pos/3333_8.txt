I did not see it last week at NZ on the plane and wondered how much Britain would appreciate both the movie and the book. I have to say that I'm affordable. Over the years, the fanatic association of Red Sox has been successful over the years if it works better than its commitment to Arsenal FC. As a Brit, I have not seen the need to understand baseball to see that we are interested. One question comes to mind - was the scenario written by Samb before the cancellation of the Bambino curse? Or was there another team in the frame? I'm a fan of the Red Sox (I know strangely, a baseball player) and I have to say that it adds to the taste.
