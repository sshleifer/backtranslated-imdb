Robert Altman should not make a film like this, but in fact it did, and this is a good enough tension in the writer traditions of Grisham's works. In Gingerbread Man, he is, of course, unfortunately, always has to work with something that he has not been very successful at all or at least as the director is not the first thing in the control list. One of the big, juicy ladder boards, which has been captured by a tough lawyer with a low-level woman, and then putting the lives of a good person in the woman's most striking ways, curling and consistency, is either. And surprisingly, Altman really wanted to take one of them "I saw him coming from here!" or such semi-conventional thriller. <br /> <br /> But it is surprising that Altman can hold some of this fine behavior or, more precisely, unwanted way, it's part of a very good ensemble, a small Georgian city. The film will be shot with a huge hurricane in Savannah and the drippings of swamps and rains are dampened with things that are immersed in and the atmosphere to maintain hormone and moisture (not a perfectly superior craft, sometimes good and sometimes not worth the Altman). Thus, the atmosphere is really strong, but is a private detective of Branaughun employer (sometimes) histeric Kenneth Branaugh, Embeth Davitz, Branaugh and Robert Downey Jr (then * not good?). Did Robert Duvall neglect you, for five minutes in the screen, make such a lasting impression to hang a picture? <br /> <br /> Some questions are weak or just a kind of standard (proxy divorce, abusive detention, innocent and closed children), but at the same time something I found attractive in Altman, something more grim. If this is not entirely mastered, it still works as a mystery-Southern-Noir, with limited circumstances.
