It's one of my favorite kung-fu films and is considered the most famous Shaw Brothers since the 1970s. Suicidal is interesting and twisted, symbols are each one of their own styles - the toad, the snake, the lizard, and so on. The movement is limited in comparison with other Chang Che / Venoms films, but looks different from the various characters in the kung fu style. I would recommend this movie to those who think that all the Shaw Brothers, especially Chang Cheh, are the same, most of his films are focused on 10 tiger and Shaolin and Manchu conflicts. This film is a breath of fresh air.
