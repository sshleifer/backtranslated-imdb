Crime: The movie proved to be a good example of a well-written, well-directed and well-run series. The end of the fall was closed so that the correct answer was not received at the end of the last season. All series and, in particular, filmed the life of the city (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with a very high degree of murder. It took a long time before I moved to Baltimore, but once I lived here for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And the movie preserved that spirit. I will, of course, ignore the new original episodes of the series, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers and want to give a lasting impression on the dark side of Charm City.
