Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is interesting to see that a world leader (like Chavez) who supports poor people in our country can be so low in the United States. His worst "fault", in my opinion, cares for those under the barrel. How bad can it be? I have always been impressed by Fidel Castro's + media response to the US government. Initially, Castro was a good man (around 1959) when Batista bathed Batman. Soon, Castro began to open Cuban companies in response to the needs of fat cats instead of roots in the cube. We want a good country, but why does not our media and our government share such a problem with the poor? If these children are "dictators," we can use more "dictatorships" in places where the poor are poorer in the world.
