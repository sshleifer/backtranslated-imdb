I feel very little to enrich this episode. To say that the season's premiere continues its perfect work has dropped very little, since nothing has ever happened in Sopranos episodes. In fact, the title may be an invitation to a non-true adult: Join the club ... <br /> <br /> Junior has pulled out of the place where he had escaped (mistakenly after a nephew put his bullet in his son's gut) for a crazy killing, the story It starts in a very nice way with Tony. Although there is no mention of what happened to him, he is involved in some sort of congress. It's not just Tony Soprano, it's not Kevin Finnerty, or at least a group of people think, <br /> <br /> Tony is naturally pure, The Sopranos tradition can not be anything but a ghost: Tony really is in a coma, doctors fate, his fate, his family and friends have endured illness, and Junior refuses to believe that everything is actually. Unfortunately, it did and Anthony Jr seemed willing to take revenge on his father's life. <br /> <br /> Excitement often appeared on the array, often Test Dream in five of the season's episodes as a kind of moral trial for the protagonists. Join the club, but using the earlier episode William S. Burroughs takes the metaphysical features of the predetermined program and pushes the envelope to the most endearing way: Tony is the one who gave a boost to his dead friends (the first hadith had caused the previous food poisoning of the fourth season) The obvious thing is radically different. The "heavenly" part of the story is deceptive, at least it is called Tony (by pointing to a character in a certain way, it will refer to "infinity") Too exaggerated or excessively respectable: David Chase is too much to use strange structures for himself has created a smart job; all help the story. Though Tony Soprano's talk of "help from above" in connection with Soprano's case may be a manifestation of it.
