I am not aware of a comic book like "Largo Winch" (or not a graphic novel? I do not really know it), but I have to admit, hearing about an agent / hero movie <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> You can never tell where to go (some clicks have been foreseen, but in general I can never say it) . Better performance than a lead actor and a really good support makes it a pleasant time. Some movies are not as full of hope as they can or do not expect, but a really good mix.
