The arrival of the director of Govind Nihalani's Vijay Tendulkar's novel is brilliant. Om Puri plays an inspector Velkanar, who is forced to keep the snack bar on, and has been brilliantly played by a loyal amputee. This is Govind Nihlan's most debated film. This is a very good and classic film. Smita Patil plays the female leader against Om Puri. Naseeruddin shines brilliant in the role of a community. Sadashvili Amrapurkar is the only filmmaker in the film, though it has only 4 scenes. This was Sadashiv Amrapurkars, who was the first speaker. He won the national prize for the best actor for this film. Best Film, Story, Supporting Actor (Sadashvili Amrapurkar) Filmfare Prize Laureate.
