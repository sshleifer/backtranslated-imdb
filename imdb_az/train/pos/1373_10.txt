This movie should be viewed for all librarians or librarians. All the good lines are directly related to the mass library. The public libraries and academic library arguments against libraries are a classic debate between librarians and schoolchildren. This breaks many librarian stereotypes. Librarians can even have fun - even if they are not sexually explicit in the romantic language section! The best movie about Libraries, Desk Set, of course, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.)
