I'm sitting on movies like "Tiempo de Valientes" and want to talk about movies for hours. This film has caused me to avoid my limitations because I am watching the scenes of the movie and entering into my thoughts for filmmaking ideas and dialog updates that can make something bigger than Damian Szifron's idea. <br /> <br /> Looking around, I do not think it's so simple, I think; this guy is a genius. Certainly, he has created Argentina's best television show, and then the first film full of some contemporary directors has not yet been reached. It is called "El fondo del mar" and has awakened my excitement to the daily cinema a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Szifron, Pablo Trapero will never be in "El Bonaerense"; The life of the Federal Police Office. The Trapo film was a journey to a person's mind and experience, not to the places he saw. <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: shows us how to examine the main characters Alfredo Diaz and Mariano Silverstein. The film has a great caliber actor, but these two actors will not be able to do without a movie. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who betrays him by his wife; <br /> <br /> Secondly, a psychiatrist assigned to the detective's treatment. He wants to deal with him at regular meetings, but the sheriff uses the time warrant and joins Dijaz in his diary: "Nothing, nothing, no problem". <br /> <br /> For a few days, it will open a part of the doctors who do not know the identity of the doctors. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two potentials can not be explained without observation. it shows that some people, such as Szifron, are so talented, that they are talented and are trying to sign our history today. To reach the point of incredible spontaneity at high pressures, Dizaz tells Silversteine: "How do we continue to treat it?" And Silverstein answers: "No, I'm not your doctor. <br /> <br /> In an interview with Diaz newspaper, she says," your friend says: we are laughing, we can not help her. "<br /> <br /> We can not help laugh when Daz crashes into a car on the street, or when he is unresponsive or guilty, while all the red lights on the street or smoking on a police patrol, and Silverstein can not believe him (but then he pulls it after drowning); the Silverstein Diaz's robber is trying to make friends with friends, and it's a magic from Diego Perett, and he's going to do it, and he's a psychiatrist who is on the plan "Locas de amor" but surprised by his followers. <br /> <br /> <strong> Luis Luque is back on the other hand, plus a cross-reference, reminds us of the great actor. <br /> <br /> It's a passion for that, I said that I can write about it, but unfortunately this is not my work, and I have to be accurate and summarized, although I have to watch and learn many old films, "Tiempo de valientes" waited for Argentine and I can be sure that there is never a comedy .
