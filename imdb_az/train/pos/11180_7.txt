It's not a good idea to put a movie on a movie by watching the story page. When people read a book, they automatically begin to see their "mind-blowing" movies, the places they are in, and how things develop. Everyone's mind has different eyebrows, so when the movie 'REAL' finally comes out, the filmmaker will always be in a single session, and it's just not measurable. All the screenwriter and director whatever the film's vision and hopes to reach their audience as much as they want to see. /> <br /> There is no better situation than movies based on Stephen King novels. The results can be breathtaking and really terrifying (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, DEAD ZONE'), or fans as a terrible confusion when it comes to the story of cinematographers at least (Kubrick's version is SHINING, IT and TOMMYKNOCKERS for miniseries). <br /> <br /> Although PET SEMATARY is not even close to the perfect King's adaptation, there are many moments in the book's immediate combinations of skin and bone, just like the blade on the screen. you can pretty much forgive her failure. For this, we would like to thank the director Mary Lambert (he also directed SIESTA, a full horror film, but see you need to put another list of freaky-as-hell) into a music video, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Most of you know the story, and I do not want you to give detailed information. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) moved his family to a perfect home in the country. Well, apart from the two bad details, it is almost perfect: it's being caught in the middle of the interstate road, and the big wood cemetery in the forest is back. Louis is a veterinarian and has a young boy for a boy ... well, read frickin 'math, so read books. All this is a King's story, so there is no mystery. <br /> <br /> Here are a lot of appointments, but it stands on a frightening road. Some of the scenes that are familiar to the book bring here an exciting, exciting life: Rachel Creed's (STAR ​​TREK'S DENIZE CROSSBY) immediate sick, crippled brother's horrific memory; Louis died before and after the deadly jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist); because of the pet cemetery, the "other" cemetery picnic. <br /> <br /> In some cases, she may vote several days ago. <br /> <br /> All the best demonstrations, especially the late Fred Guiney's good-neighbor. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the dead are better. <br /> <br /> The only problem with the version of the film is Gage, son of Lui (Miko Hughes). Lambert and the crew were still doing their best and, unfortunately, Hughes was very damn CUTE at the moment because it would be damaging to get the necessary performance of a child of one year to close the contract. his role as "evil", "zombie with devil". <br /> <br /> Let's also note that the scenes that this movie has featured are still showcased (especially Guinea's death scene). <br /> <br /> Besides, everything is still good. CARRIE is still my name for the best adaptation of the King because of my worries; <br /> <br /> POLICY is in the top five positions. <br /> <br /> Still, is the story adapted for a screen based on a book is terrible when reading the story? According to the probability of BLOOD ... already.
