This movie is badly accepted and poorly reviewed. Rebecca West's book In 1918, after the WWI, amnesia caused by severe shock and trauma, the writers called it a lot of books and movies. In time, as the heroes live, it's hard to live like the reality of the time: the British classroom to use the terrible deadly gas of war and the first war experience, the wife thinks of all the importance <br /> <br /> Like 20 years ago, It was still young and beautiful as well. <br /> <br /> Alan Bates is not allowed to see Margaret, his dear girl, as a soldier, as a soldier, and is characterized by her devotion to the "distant people of Maddad." After seeing this performance, she may feel strong romantic commitment to a girl who does not meet the expectations of the family and society. Margaret says: "We have argued and you have removed your face from me when you are facing it." Thus, we know that deterioration was something that made itself insulting, embarrassed, but forgot its memory with Margaret. I have not seen all of his films, but in places where I have seen, he creates a strong personality with the role of a disabled soldier. <br /> <br /> I even knew Ann-Margaret was the first and his performance was small. Jenny is a "cousin", as the result of the death of a dead child is a feeling of anger over the border between Jenny and Chris. Kitty keeps Jenny in her hairdressing kindergarten, Kitty says Kitty is always dying in that room, Kitty is more than just a way to Kitti to keep the odd coal out of focus on the sun, or she's feeling the missing child and she's said that he did not want her to feel as if she did not show disrespect to the child's memory. Also, Jenny plays a role in the home because the high society would do it for a fallen member. <br /> <br /> The buyer of the intense fantasy of a lover recently 50 years ago, I was able to contact Margaret and her husband's dilemma. I was not good enough for my family, and since I was reconstructed via the internet, I was still loaded with horrible Vietnamese experiences and helping her to marry a woman over her. he did not believe as he loved. My husband, like Margaret, was very cautious, but the tension was real. My darling finally managed to reconcile the situation in my real life only with a fantasy that loved me. <br /> <br /> I thought that it was a good decision to show that the experience of war was too small, in the mind of Chrisin. I thought of Ms Dalloway, a WWI soldier who committed suicide in the fantasy of Margaret's fierce memories and committed suicide on Chris's joy. On the contrary, the actions of a soldier may occur in Mrs. Dalloway often. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist Chris understands very little what is happening, and what is the biggest problem facing the whole group. Everyone seems to take their lives back, but is that the right choice?
