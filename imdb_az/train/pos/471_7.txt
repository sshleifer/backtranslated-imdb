This movie star, Emily Watson, breaks the Wave's glory. A man's obsession-related movie takes place in a resort where a chess tournament is held. It comes shortly after falling into a madness with a woman chess master Emily Watson (at first glance). This cynicism of a man who is cautious with cautiousness falls. All this causes anger to his mother who is more interested in meeting another young gentleman; a good gentleman. Her mother thinks this is a fantasy for a young animal because she is such a dream for a young woman. What happens is that it is mainly a journey of a person's psyche. This explains the story of the past that is closely related to the present day. Emily Watson is also an actress who plays the main character. This is definitely slow, but worth the look. Even the end was satisfied. :)
