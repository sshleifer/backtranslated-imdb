I always think that I enjoy watching movies and do not convey the answers to the audience. "Revolver" is one of these films, and many viewers say it's hard to watch, although I've got a little concentration and an open mind. First time. True, he does not compare with other common people, such as "Ordinary Suspects" or "Memento", but he is also a clever and thought-provoking film. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie about something else that was damned. Each scene, the angle of each camera seems to have been thought over for centuries. <br /> <br /> So, in order to sum up, you can ... look openly and do it. If you do not, no one "revolver" is for everyone. And I have 2 cents.
