I've captured this movie at IFC and liked it, though I felt like editing, it could have been a little rough, deliberate. The first thing I realized was a bit tricky because I was going to introduce a little Pulp Fiction-style non-linear area presentation. But it was a little difficult. I think the film is worth watching, but I think it might be a little cleansed. Some scenes do not seem logical after others. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see the low level here as it was here. It is not outstanding, but there are not really serious problems. I gave it 7/10. The film showed that at least Laurence Fishburne could act as she wanted. They just told him not in Matrix films.
