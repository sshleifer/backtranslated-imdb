The scriptwriter and the director directed me with the film, and they were able to do it with my film. The usual human condition was original, individual and immediate, as I felt personally in every situation. I believe that together with the scenes of the filmmaker, I will combine the musical power. Without exaggeration, I can tell you that the film's life has affected me a lot. In fact, what did not cry for joy? empathy just deep emotion? for a long time. I would like to find a way to show it to others. I saw at the Seattle International Film Festival.
