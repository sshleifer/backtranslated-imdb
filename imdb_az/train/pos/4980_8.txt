When I looked at the internet for previous sales prices, I ran to these comments. Why is it all serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I got this short movie 30 years ago from my parents and I'm always glad about it. I showed it to many friends and they all loved it. I feel privileged to own this original 1932 8 mm black and white Silent movie, which is famous or popular. After reading other comments, I acknowledge that the film is "dark." Great job! I just want to be longer. It seems to be the only person who has one of these works, at least in the market, and how valuable is it?
