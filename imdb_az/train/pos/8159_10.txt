Okay This movie is a delight. There is such a terrible fear that is mixed up with some horror and many black comedies. The dentist really begins to wound our mind and is pleased to watch it. Although this movie is for some people. You either love it or you totally hate it. Leasing And Not Watching A Good Movie If there is nothing else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
