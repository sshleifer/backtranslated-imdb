This is a gentle, easily comedian of the 1950s. Kim Novak Manhattan witches belong to a coven. He puts a magic to save Jimmy Stewart's neighbor, but eventually loses his power and falls in love with it. Witches can be "warm blood", but not love. Elsa Lanchester is Nova's aunt and witch. Jack Lemmon's brother, ditto. Hermione Gingold is a Witch and Ernie Kovacks is Sidney Redlich, a writer specializing in witches. <br /> <br /> I described it as a comedy in the 1950s because it could not be wrong for anything else. Everything is very smooth and polished, from decor to wardrobe and structure, to performances and to the direction. Take the character of Ernie Kovacksin. He is called "drunk and walnut". And how the film demonstrates these features. She asks for a second drink, and although her hair is always dressed in a jacket and she ties it like other gentlemen, her hair is a little longer and stronger. This is exactly the 1950s version of drunkenness and nut. There is no place; Everything is fresh and dusty. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart's shoes have been slipped into a tricky way. <br /> <br /> The Witches are the Zodiac Club where they get up. This is called "down diving". Nevertheless, there is a clean wardrobe, a strange waiter, a musician's quintet, a neatly dressed customer, and potted plants against the bare brick walls. It is not my opinion, or it is not such a "diving" for Greenwich Village in 1958. A diving idea in Greenwich Village is Julius or White Horse Tavern or San Remo or Swing Rendezvous, lesbian sex. The Zodiac Club is a high dive compared to these. <br /> <br /> The kookiness we always hear is silenced for today's standards. I would like to say that Novak is not alone, because his shoes run around his scenery. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it's a while ago, It's a pleasant romantic comedy. Kim Novak is effective as Gillian, who oversees the primary art shop for uptrodden. At the same time there is a very strange beauty, sensual and ethereal. It is a clever thing that slips more than trips. His eyebrows appear to have been drawn with a series of plastic French curves. Jimmy Stewart is as good as a conscious and strange victim. In the 1930s, he played common roles. In post-war years and in the 1950's, he was the hero of torture, but here he has good experience in comedy. Who was laughing when Hermione Gingold forced him to wear pants to treat Novak's magic and to drink a dirty mixture of ugly liquid? It is good to see him as a stoog instead of the threat of becoming an angry and angry human principle. Richard Quine directs the film without fireworks and special effects and makes some fun things that the game can not be. <br /> <br /> Early Kovaks is a well-known television personality in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> <strong> Celebrate Novak's story on Stewart. The face and ears of Siamese cat were merged with the amazing eyes of Novak. <br /> <br /> There was nothing at Ernie Covacks Show before or after. The word "surrealism" comes to mind. Only Bartok's concert for the Orchestra could have been staggering five minutes in a backyard room that could be worthless and not illustrated. And Percy Dovetail, an effete poet character, unimpeachable sketch. Loans from The Condoli Brothers, but this is quite coincident because these two children are virtuoso trumpeters with their independent career in Pete and Conte jazz ensembles. Conte later became a member of the Doc Severison band Johnny Carson's late transition show. <br /> <br /> The third type of operation is a bit lower and more "romantic" than "comedy". But it is never boring. The whole film is just as correct as Van Druten's play, and the kids will get a blow over it.
