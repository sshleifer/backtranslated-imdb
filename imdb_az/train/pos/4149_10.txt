I read some comments on the message boards, waiting for the full fury of this movie - but I was laughing while watching! <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I have another one to call a fully-feminine comedy I hurt. There will be only one or two actresses in a very comedy, but many men will support the symbol. It was almost all women - except Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnettin's short appearance - and worked. <br /> <br /> The charm of this movie seems to me in a subtle feminist message: you accept who you are. women's success in the public sphere, the strengthening of women's friendships and the violation of gender roles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Because of the fact that the film was not a great actor to get all the ladies and the studio behind, they abandoned the freedom of the theater and I agree. Everyone I recommend for this movie liked it and, therefore, a comedy that celebrated women's fears was not widespread and successful. <br /> This film is a love of open minds or women-centered comedy.
