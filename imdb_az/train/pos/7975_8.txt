I just love Malle's documentary. They are very elegant and simple but still interesting. I do not know why this documentary is working. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens. But still Malle manages to make her interesting and exciting. The love of humankind, even racist or homophobic, is not so great that it can not only help but also be in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle has shot most of the film in 1979. He came back 6 years to see the change. After 6 years, this material would be a good movie, but this small addition makes it great. Malle was just doing the work on the Up series, but in fact it is not. Up series people. Malle emphasizes what happened to every human being, and what happened to this society. And the change is great. In 1985, the Reagan era and farmers suffer. A proud people, now no one will ever see the future, and parents hope that they will teach their children something else and do agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very important today. Our financial crisis has begun with today's events. <br /> <br /> "I have great hopes for this country, because there are things that are right," now can be described as a bias against the dream, and a nation does not live long with this obsession, and in particular a democracy ... Well there are many good and many things in this country. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Good people are good" and they will never be - they will not subscribe to the envy of the moment. "< Unfortunately, this has been a headache for more than 20 years.
