John Waters has created the best-performing, full-hearted, dark, personal small movie I've ever seen (a Fast Food Fast Women coming soon). The appearance of the directors is untinted ... the story is weird <br /> <br /> The article author is Martha Bertrand, Martha, Martha, Martha, Martha, Plimpton's sister. Eddie Furlong is an inspirational cast. A grandmother talking with Mary, drinking tea, recycled clothing, yesterday's trash is turned into a present-day art - the lesson of the film, the most important thing we can value is a family ... and a modest life.
