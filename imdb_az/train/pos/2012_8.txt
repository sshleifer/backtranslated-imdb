This is one of my favorites all the time. Great music and some funny bits. Every time I laugh at Millie, the servant acts as a speaker, enjoys talking while talking, and ill-advised to polishing furniture. <br /> <br /> It is such a treat that a young teenager reads Mel Torme and many young Frank Sinatra. My mother, Frank Sinatra, also saw this movie at the same time in the theater. He said he would not clean between bobby-soxers (which did not have to split between those days). This film shows that young Frankin is attractive and attractive and allows him to evaluate his early talent. And Victor Borge gets a little bit of his daily, being a little bonus. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining movie, a sweet, simple storyline. Very nice.
