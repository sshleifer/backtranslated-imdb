One of the best television dramas in the last decade. For five hours, modern perceptions are constantly investigating many aspects of English society, and perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenging. David Morrisey is brilliant as usual. First, he faces a heroic confrontation with the hero, but works with him to reveal the truth, showing intelligence and caring. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe he is born of television soaps. His performance was spectacular because he tried to balance the demands of the job and the stress that cared for his mother. I can speak of each of the players who contributed to this spectacular drama, but their efforts constantly challenge the assumptions about any character that means small without such an absorption scenario. This is the kind of program that restores faith in the television drama, but it is almost impossible to solve most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the air waves.
