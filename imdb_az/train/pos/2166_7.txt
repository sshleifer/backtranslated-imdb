I'm not a great Tim Matheson fan, but I have to admit that I love this movie. It was dark and somewhat strange with some scenes, I did not know that this movie was a bit of SF and a bit of horror I decided to follow the idea of ​​this channel. I have not seen the idea of ​​this movie really bad, the characters are quite interesting, but it has not really been investigated, despite the full potential they can do to further this movie. I know that this movie is going to the movies, but I'm feeling ready for the TV, or if I'm on a flat video, it's a bit of a DVD on my DVD and if it's a story of X-FILES. Government initiatives or shady corporations deal with dangerous shady jobs. It's a good movie.
