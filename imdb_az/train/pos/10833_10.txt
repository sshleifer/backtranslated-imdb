This movie cried at the end of my life! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen a lot of great movies, more crap - ones. But when it ended the scene - it was charming - I cried! And if you do not, you have serious problems! Story archetypal - there is nothing new and original. But it is true - because such things really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I'm very surprised at what went on in the early 1970s ... At some points, Velvet Goldmine gave me directions! Docudramas really does not work very well. But this movie really believed in everything ... because they are a super hero, a way full of strange concerts, that's stupid and emotional, the group girls and alcohol, encourage rehabilitation and recuperation that they have been coming back for over 20 years. .. One bigger movie. Since I left Las Vegas, I did not move to any movie.
