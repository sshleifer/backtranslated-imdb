An outstanding and striking drama about hunting for the famous serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> The spectacular performance of Stephen Rea, a judicial science researcher who has been investigating, is the oldest communist party that wants to keep the Russian government, especially the one who is the biggest hindrance to its progress. <br /> <br /> The film is a key issue of the communist society's decline, and progress in the killing of a murderer is progressing in social and political changes in Russia, and this is a regular thing. There are conflicts with old ways and new ways, and they are represented by the Rea advantage (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rea himself. First of all, Sutherland looks down on the "down" system and looks down on the earth "down". But are there a common cause? <br /> <br /> Relationships between the two sides of the film are developing, and at the end of the film, Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect, killer and Glasnost come as symbolic. Excellent script. <br /> <br /> Additional loans help Sutherland's perfect and sympathetically impressive performance of Jeffrey DeMunn as a killer who can not hate us, and his absolute convincing Max Von Sydow, a psychologist.
