Nothing has come close to the quality of domestic production since decades of publishing Wildside. It covers the unpleasant but overrated Underbelly series that led to life events in Sydney and Melbourne's recent crime scene. <br /> <br /> Wildside is repeated several times overnight at ABC. "Blue Murder" (Tony Martin also plays a role but may be someone on the other side of the law). For some time I have not watched the show, I still regret the story of malicious stories and many human heroes. Casting is perfect: Tony Martin as a detective as a detective who disappeared as Alex Smith, a young police officer who played a gambling with his son, Rachael Blake (later tied with Martin in real life) as a public worker struggling with alcoholism. Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie himself) and young Abbie Cornish are equally well supported. <br /> <br /> ABC, the first three episodes on DVD just a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I think that the logic of such a marketing is beyond me, but I can only assume that licensing with original manufacturers may be related to disputes. <br /> <br /> A great series of very good aging. ABC's DVD department hopes to bring together its movement. <br /> <br /> (According to the moderator's information on an ABC message board, some DVD versions are expected in December 2009)
