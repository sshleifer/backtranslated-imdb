While watching this beautiful documentary, he could not hold his tears. It was a heartbreaker, worrying, and inspirational in one. I recommend this documentary to everyone who wants something to think about what they do with their lives. Or just think of something. Look at John's life as he lived in the last few months. You are looking at his days with a positive attitude. At one point, you can see that he is really incredible person. As you understand, there is something we all have taught. His life and struggles will make you cry, laugh, and make life easier.
