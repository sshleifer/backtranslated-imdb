When I'm 53, Ida is the second film I've seen as a director of Lupino. I think it was a better movie. This one has a daughter who wants to get married, and then sexually assaulted and looks at everyone and talks, she also runs away and taken by a family. Leonard Malti's review can only give 2 or 1/2 stars.
