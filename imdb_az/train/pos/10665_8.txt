As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years and just saw music this week. <br /> <br /> I really think Michael Douglas works very well. (I was blowing while watching music) with this post, along with Kasey. In my opinion, 'I Dance You on the Stage' is one of the best parts of the film, a valuable addition to music. Dancers and music performances, at least 10 times in the movie (easily made in the film), are more than music. The decor, lighting, dance and singing are superior in the film, which is expected and truly delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs in the discussion work better in the movie, the new ones are pretty good, and in my opinion, the whole movie is much more than music, especially a few d√©cor music. The bad point in the film is clear cuts between the actors' conversations and singers singing during the singing sessions for some symbols, but their dances are flawless, and the final product is more pleasing than music
