Two-thirds of the IMDb users voted on 8, 9, or 10 of the IMDb users who voted for this movie, and a user reported six video pageviews (whether this is a record or just an incorrect VCR?). Although the film is primarily intended as a part of the tour, it is quite an unusual attraction. But for some reason, I imagined him very jealous, and I had never felt his desire to watch him anymore. My idea was changed by Elizabeth Won Arnim's original book. My wife loves reading, but she does not allow her eyes to read, so she speaks as a book. Such books have encouraged a friend who is busy with others, but gradually gradually understood that this kind of humiliating calm was, though, in no way without sheriff and very well written. My husband understood that he would watch the movie, so he decided to take a video clip. I am very glad now, and I would recommend to anyone who appreciates the sale and purchase of a fireworks, a well-built character, and a calm affair with a very successful Mussolini Italian atmosphere. The story begins immediately with the WW1 era and begins with a two-year-old London lady, who leaves her family in a rented villa in Italy to decide on their savings and enjoy a holiday. Forcing a couple to combine this couple with very different characters and roots. The theme is more than just the interaction between these four very different ripe ladies, and not between the male visitors, but as a holiday. If you want action, excitement, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man-made disasters or Harlequin style romances, this will not be a movie for you. But IMDb users have shown collectively and very rigidly that none of the movies are needed to prove high earnings for watching, and if you want to give it to me, like the ones I like <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's very rare for me to watch a movie. In many cases, I find that this film is far from enjoying watching it, but I see that my tastes really enhance the visibility of the next segment of the book so there is such a powerful vision. before my eyes. (This is the last time I've been watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron TV on TV). In general, shooting of films has a broader appeal to the drama of the work to ensure the version of the film, but if there is anything, the focus of the audience is gradually reduced to keep the character development, not any background phenomenon. This works very well, though the book changes are small and mostly the film is related to the original story. Large credit director Mike Newell and four main ladies are all connected to the castin, which is especially famous British actresses.
