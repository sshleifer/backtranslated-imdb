This is the most hysterical comic show I've ever seen. I laugh a lot, but I'm sure we have left half jokes. This sculptor is a brilliant talented comedian. What I especially love is that the viewer never looks like "transporting" the material. His timing is flawless and united as a piece of performance, not a regular gags. Review.
