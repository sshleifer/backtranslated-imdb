This movie was seen by my husband and myself when I came out in 1978. This was a revelation to us. We really thought we were married and had only gay and lesbian couples with children. Obviously, we were wrong. Love can come out of the place you do not expect, and maybe you do not want it. But we both chose this love. <br /> <br /> Never has our sexual orientation ever changed. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. <br /> <br /> We stopped dating matters, even though we were old. <br /> <br /> This story is not too far away. However, because they are converted to heterosexuals, suggestions are quite unrealistic to me. My wife and I have been together for the last 40 years. We still go. The end of the story.
