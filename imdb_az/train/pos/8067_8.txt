If anyone remembers the name of Victor McLaglen, who will most likely answer that? or "Why?" Well, I believe, or Victor McLaglen was awarded the Oscars for Best Actor in this film, a poor, desperate man who wants to sell his best friend to the United States. This is an interesting film that will make a few dollars, though the shadows, which are the best, are the fewest. The film is held in Ireland, the ruling elite of Ireland, and all other symbols are fighting directly or indirectly for the Irish political independence, while McLaglen's character is money-consuming and drunk. The film is surprising that political activity is worth every challenge, as many struggling to create an active point, many are just not interested, and do not know what a fuss is. This is the mood of the movie: look at friend, it sells for a dime.
