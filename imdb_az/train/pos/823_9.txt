Until the end of the 2005 Star Wars Saga sixth and final episode, I looked like my favorite movie in the long-lasting series of 1983. <br /> <br /> Some moving scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry forest creatures, etc.) made this a particularly charming movie. The last half-hour, this scene is the best example of switching between trees from space ships in a matter of minutes to a single laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> There was no war between two previous two stars. There was a steady confrontation between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! <br /> <br /> In the end it was just a wonderful adventure story.
