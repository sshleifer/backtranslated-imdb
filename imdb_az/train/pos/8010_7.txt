Previously, I thought that this movie was the most important of Muppet films. Now I would like to retract that phrase. Now, in my opinion, LAMEST MUppet was a very fun movie about the TV movie, and it was one of the best. Life was really terrible. COMPANIES MANHATTAN is not a special thing, but MERRY MUPPET likes more spells than Christmas. <br /> <br /> One of the best songs is 'Do not answer', Muppet Babies sings and sings songs for the great finale itself. When I liked the Muppet Babies TV show, I liked the sequence of Muppet Babies (not that I was shown by Muppet Babies) <br /> <br /> Manhattan Mellows were a real showstopper to show themselves. Muppets from Sesame Street also appeared for the wedding. Kermit, "What a good way to end it?" As you put it on the last line. But I want something more fun than the beginning and the end. Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and Rizzo and Rats (great night, choreographed by great Jim Henson himself) and a great dance sequence, and the movie certainly entertains. MUPPET FILM, BOOK COURT, AND MOTHER STAR CAROL is a three-story MUppet movie.
