I was in this movie cold, dark November 8 afternoon. I played all day, I was in ice cream and when I arrived at 4 o'clock, I drank a cup of warm cocoa and sat on a blanket in front of the TV. I was surprised to watch all the happy and foolish cartoons - in fact it was dark and morally. My imagination was captured. I am convinced that the text does not miss, and Tolkien shortens all the wrong places for Purist. But still the spirit of the story, the burden of the kindness of others, the selfish, the arguments of the evidence, and so forth. Saves results. The animation quality is divided into complaints. But this is a place where the movie is superior to new movies. John Hurt is great in this business. If you do not like how the character is drawn, go away and listen only to it. Sound is supernatural. I have seen many times many times and always brings me to me as a child who once slept for magical adventure. For this reason, I am happy to say that the film is nostalgic for me, and I look at its shortcomings. But John Hurt and Tolkien's dreams have yet to reach me and still exist.
