This is the most controversial documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. <br /> <br /> According to photographs of hidden industry landscapes, based on modern industrial growth in China, Edward Burtynski brings to life the challenges facing us to choose not to easily see. <br /> <br /> This non-political film is neutral, side effects of the economic downturn, foreign expenditures paid by citizens of less developed communities, source of our comfort and waste of our consumer lifestyle. /> <br /> Strange, unkind, can not be ignored. It's a difficult journey, but it's worth gaining - stop ignoring and see these photos of truth without at least putting pressure on those issues. 10/10 definitely!
