Probably the best film of the year for me. This little French movie is put in the office Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) in office and runs the days of other men, uncredited, and open to him, a source of open conversations, partly deaf lips. He took action as a new assistant Paul (Vincent Cassel). The relationship between them is the center of the film. Mutual dependence, ties for different reasons. Carla Paula and her first appearance make her feel attractive for her appearance. Paul should help him because he does nothing to quell his feelings. She is indebted to a local gangster and she has a plan that Carlas has the ability to read lips. I think that the main thing that raises the average level of film / drama is the amazing chemistry of two stars. No matter what other characters on the screen, throughout the entire movie, you can experience this wonderful relationship between Carla and Paul. I do not remember when I witnessed this sex chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (won the French Cesar for the best actress). Indeed, you do not feel as if you're watching a player, which is really Carla. Vincent Cassel's chameleon is also beautiful. It is both a charming and attractive character that is unforgettable. For both of these people, I liked this movie and when I looked at it twice, I went back to the movie and started again.
