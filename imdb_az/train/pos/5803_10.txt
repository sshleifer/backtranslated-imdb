Wow, when I look at this movie from the garage, I've forgotten how big it is to run away. This is a story about a super hero who fights to save a few small children, a combination of Michael Jackson's bio, a collection of music vignettes and a story. Vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is Michael Jackson's super-hero segment (and it's strange as it sounds) into a car, a robot, and finally a space ship. Joe Pesci is a cheerful and long-lasting cool footage and great music to have fun! <br /> <br /> The original film is just an incredible "Smooth Criminal" video that is worth gaining that part!
