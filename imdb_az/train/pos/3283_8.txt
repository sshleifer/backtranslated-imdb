As I love the Surreal movie (in art and film), I enjoyed exploring this movie at IFC. This is definitely a goalkeeper. Most of the other reviews explain the general area (not all right), so I'm not worried about delivering it to everyone. Most importantly, Ana's approach is the concept of alternative worlds brought from the illness, and he is "alone" able to communicate with someone else, and finally, with my family, he is still at least a little worried. This fear movie can only be called a scary scene, but the Mom ("Mom" is a little sign "when it comes to age" because it's a pre-teen "hated guys") fantasy. I would recommend it to those who appreciate heartbreaking thinking.
