Only yesterday evening I saw the Canadian Broadcasting Company's "Matte Eye" series. The Toronto International Film Festival and others have recently been featured (September 2003). This is a very remarkable movie. The filmmakers really dumped into the story there to shoot a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves in the middle of the events, such as the coup. There was an unprecedented opportunity for events and people and, in most cases, it would be a story open as it happens. Of course, they have their own ideological perspectives (they are obvious), but they keep themselves in the background, and try to focus their attention on the events, peoples, history and history they lead to. As a film, this style is not unfounded in sense or aesthetics, that is, it must be. What we do to see if "embedded" journalism really should be. What we started to see is a country struggling to achieve democracy ... A true leader (Chavez) really cares about his people ... A story like a coalition of corporate / military / media related to strength and longing <br /> <br / > Democratically-elected leader is united for a blow ... and an unmatched introduction to a historic event as happened. <br /> <br />
