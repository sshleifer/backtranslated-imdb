"I did not want to complicate it, Leese. I suppose I can read it." The fright continues with 30,000 fascades. When Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is planning to use his cousin (Cillian Murphy) as part of a conspiracy assassination, a nightmare for Miami is a battle to survive quickly. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons I like this movie is because of the two-star chemistry McAdams and Murphy are both my favorite actors. For example, early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy: two people run to each other .... I gave it to myself to shoot a movie like this. Especially Murphy's character .. It looks so complicated in a really charming and innocent way that Jackson is still trying to do his job, and Lisa is trapped physically and mentally. That is, in some places it seems to be a concern for Lisa. <br /> <br /> Make a great excitement all the way. I'm going to shoot a movie about a movie about a prequel or later, but in fact I'm not a prequel of Jackson waiting for Lisa to accompany her. The favorite scene was probably so unexpected because the title scene. There was also a wonderful preparation for the famous "pen" scene. When will it last? McAdam's Lisa had a nice change, and she changed herself to return the victim. I was like a dining room and I was forced to ask some women about a food court. How great is Murphy's total weight .....
