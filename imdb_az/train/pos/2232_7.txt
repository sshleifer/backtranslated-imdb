I've seen it since I was 17 and have not seen it since. "CBS Late Movie" was used to show it on a regular basis at some point. I'm so upset and upset that I'm really sick of my stomach. Effects are not only where they are today, but also the feeling of being alone in Amazon has come after losing both parents and finding a good way out. I remember that insects and guts were the most realistic, eating their own flesh. This is a dark film, which is a controversial topic, though it is strongly designed for television. Please remember more information and more commentary if I get the chance to see it again. I've been looking for it for years. I think that CBS can be shown under another topic. I still had no idea of ​​the release of the video.
