Yes, this is a little standard, but enough <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James Belushi (I think) was worthy of the Oscar's role. John Lovits is brilliant and shines in the roles of Linda Hamilton and Renee Russo. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. <br /> <br /> Good movie with a good lesson.
