<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to Hollywood <br /> <br /> The film is about to end, and it's definitely natural gas. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have a bad performance. parts are funny Edgy parts are strange The dialogue does not have a boring moment Cinematography is fresh and good, it does not fit Hollywood norm (see what you mean when I see the movie) <br /> <br /> When I'm a kid, The film is not a classic classic, but it is a reason why Transformers 2 can be adopted by mid filmmakers because they are accustomed to seeing Transformers 2. The film's original and comic If it is pumped as many millions of units as it is, as many as K <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> </ strong> <br /> </ strong> /> A mini-masterpiece of a comic comedy that refuses to make concessions. One of my favorites.
