I have looked at this movie a bit and really found a website that claims to be an internal joke about the PostWWII Greenwich Village gay and lesbian world. Except for Stewart and Nova, warlocks and witches represented an alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, the scene game, was very gay and very familiar with the Greenwich Village. In my opinion, when I was in the 5th or 6th grade because of taking my parents, I saw Bell, Book, and Mom in the theater. It was difficult to get into a movie that did not include horses, machine guns or alien monsters, and I planned to be bored. But Jimmy Stewart remembers the moment when I climbed Kim Nubar at the top of the Flatiron building and hit the camera. As the theme of the prominent George Duning love theme has risen, I have something to feel that suddenly fell in love with. When leaving the theater, romantic / sexual love showed me that my beloved friends had left me. I am sure that I'm not the only early boy who has ever been born with Kim Nouak's cheerful, direct look. The gay tale is mocking that many people can jump to heterosexual adolescence. I was 50 years old, and I watched last night's movie, and the same feelings as I touched the hats after some years passed. . .
