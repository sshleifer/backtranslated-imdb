Theo Robertson commented that WW did not meet the conditions after WWI, which led to the rise of Hitler and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe, was the first ONE and the fourth time hacked 8? It covers this period and, together with the volumes before the series, clearly demonstrates the present conditions, and I feel it. During this time, a friend in Germany grew up, joined Hitler's Youth and his experience was very similar to that in the WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is far from the history of the film. <br /> <br /> It is only a sin and a small thing that I have a WAW: the numbers are not included several times. For example, if you are talking about lending, how many warplants are borrowed? How much to Russia, how much to Britain? How many merchant ships sank and when? How many ships of the German or Japanese fleet were there, in 1941? What were they? How many troops are there? How many unions have the total number of allies in the country? Many pieces could have been tied to each other, but I would rather pick it up! And, of course, I always want to see more military analysis. Why did not Patton and Clark not allow the German army in Cassini to escape Monty after riding out of Rome? Like Drezden's firebug, you can begin to understand the war until you see a portion of these video segments on the "common war". Auschwitz et al. As you can understand, before seeing the clips of the death camps, it is impossible to push around your head - it's incredible. Of course, it was LIVE vivisection of Japan's most unusual strangeness and human horror, that is human philosophy (reading Flyboys) and some "non-anesthetic" medical "trial" prisoners! <br /> <br /> Dave
