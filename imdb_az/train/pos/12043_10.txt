On the stage, on television, or in a book, "Black Lady" is a ghost story. Other reviewers have already talked about everything about this movie, but I thought that I would add an unlimited delay. The film, designed for television, is a deliberately slow-moving first act of the 1940s as a lawyer in London. I can understand why it will not appeal to all palates. Nevertheless, I love the British story for the great MR James James, similar to the BBC's "Ghost Story for Christmas." In the second action, the dream story begins to corrupt the client's work, as Arthur's boss sent to the provinces. The third act, unwillingly, results in lower back pain ... As Londoner, I saw the game. I have a book, a DVD-R, and an iPod unabridged audio book. In any environment, "Black Women" is a bit of a ghost story. This is when we have 2 DVDs in a legitimate region.
