I love this movie. There is a wonderful chemistry among the actors, and a very universal story tells the story of the dead son. I love the best, but the hamam is more than just a single story. When the father told his son's story about his wife's family in the northern desert of China, the element of water and bath became almost a sacred ceremony. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film was very effective. However, there were moments when the "very" sweet ... spitting during the scene where the park was read. But in general, I love this movie.
