Everything was better in the past days. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock is very easy to prove in my opinion. When I wrote this article I was sixteen, but I can not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock, even in my teens. Indeed, for those living under a rock, Fraggle Rock is strange creatures with odors that live in a rock. But they are not creatures. Rock is home to many other creatures, such as those who are very diligent Doozers and countless living plants. On the one hand, inventor scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (later friendships with Gobo Fraggle) live in the rock, and the other is a family that is ruler of the Gulf Gorgun. Five major Fraggles are episodes of some awkward situations in Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (arty and peace), Wembley (a friend for Kabul and Gobo), Boober (pessimistic local god) and Red (loves sports and general feistyness) perform at the same time and dance. Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show - areas can have complicated details that babies can not follow well, but their song and dance routines will also be noticeable. Heroes are strong and liquid, their conflicts are convincing and exciting adventures. The Gorgs Dreadful, Doc and Sprocket Illuminator, Uncle Traveling Matt hilarious (over 80 postcard segments!) And the last episode, Change the Name, really touches. Let's go back to Fraggle Rock again!
