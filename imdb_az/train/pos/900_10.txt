This is one of the best Bollywood movies I have ever seen. Family and friends are thinking the same way. This film is also romantic and dramatic. In my opinion, we need more movies or films to keep the South Asian culture alive. Witness Capour and Amrita Rao have made a very good performance in this regard, and their couples attract many people to cinema. This is a family movie and a romantic movie you need to see in a movie. The film is also from Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is good now ... The film's reception was also a great attraction. This movie should be seen ... Recommended for everyone !!
