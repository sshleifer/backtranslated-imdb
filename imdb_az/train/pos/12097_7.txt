This complicated story begins quite simply. An English journalist, Edgar Allen Poe, and his friend, Lord Blackwood, appeal to a person who claims to be in a strange Blackwood castle. There the writer travels around dusty chambers and corridors, and music and a part of a waltz couple until they take him to an empty place. He sits in cortis and plays with the melody you hear and is surprised by the stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood on his shoulder. It is a wonderful miracle that everyone has been expecting at night to make his room upstairs, and that it is always awesome ... Night of the Dead. Thus, the rest of the night begins with an astonishing number of extraordinary incidents that surprise the journalist. SPOILER AHEAD: Perhaps your favorite Elizabeth will not surprise so many spectators to find out that it's really a ghost. This does not prevent the journalist from being in love, but makes more difficult than average couples. This is an entertaining movie: ghosts, spooky castle, past events, sexual and violent repetitive images (both of which tasted Americans over the years). Attractive, seductive Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. Unlike anyone you see in the movie, it's strange. Recommended!
