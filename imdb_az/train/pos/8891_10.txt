I agree with other statements that there is no great history discussed in the film, but not a documentary. <br /> <br /> I agree with the Black Sea family. The scenes with them went out of their way. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, she would be fired a while ago, but when I contacted these stories and families, I found it very good. <br /> <br /> The lights of the 60's brought the tremendous and important crucial moments of the decade. I found it very entertaining and my time to follow.
