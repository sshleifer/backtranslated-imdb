Laurence Olivier, starring Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes, starred in "Ms. X Divorce" in 1938. Olivier plays the young barrister of Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to switch to the night room when night is too intense for her guests in the night room. The next day his friend, Lord Mere (Richardson), announced that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel and wanted to divorce her. Olivier is panic, believing that women will be Oberon. <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <br /> We've seen this plan or its changes with them. With this cast, it is pleasant. So, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, this great team at Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is doing a great job with a devastating charm and comedy, and he describes the ugly, nervous barrister. Oberon gives the right light touch to his role. It looks more fuller, fuller, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears a few beautiful street dresses, even though her first dressing looks like a birthday cake, she works with a hairstyle, she is ready to play Snow White. <br /> <br /> <strong> Disrespect to the people living in the Caucasus is worth seeing.
