Indeed, this film represents a lot of things. For beginners, this film is about a depressed student who has guns in school and about 9 students. One student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries. The character of the lead is a few people who regard it as a "loner / goth" despite the fact that the film is not. He looks quite mysterious, but he is the only harmless student in the victim class. He was asked to know the shooter and notify him before the night before he was on the phone. In any case, it is a very short and far-sighted person who seems to be disgusting society. However, for the first time, some unexplained events did not fall into the classroom after about a year after school. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it has been for several years that they are at a very social level. Alisha is a quiet, nervous, anti-social "goth" girl who is totally alone in her (although she is often able to read it, hid from a worm book), and the other girl is rich in the world and in life the "bubbly" girl who is an incredibly optimistic and trapped player in her fantasy world who ignores realism for her. I feel a good job to represent both of these roles in the modern school, but more importantly, the two completely different girls who do not know each other hate each other. <br /> <br /> The wounded girl is not the best thing to do when the once protected life and deep, meaningful truth to the outside world, to abandon society and to lock everything inside. <br /> <br /> Many people look at the relationship between these two girls and one of two things. Also, the story of a girl with a frustrated, frustrated girl, who is a rabid, hateful girl or an aggressive girl who wants to get into an innocent girl in the world, is one of the most intelligent people she really knows. In other words, people can look at this movie as a consideration of Alisha, who teaches other girls about life, but it is not about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is THE SELECTED things. Despite everything I do, there is a representative of how people use a great, life-changing disaster. Indeed, this movie is not very symbolic, instead of incredibly straight forward with the message, do not be afraid to open your mind, and you will not be able to get acquainted with your heart, some miraculous miraculous description. br> <br /> Generally, this movie is one of the best I've ever seen. Acting is brilliant, the story and the representation are deep and meaningful, and the feeling that passes through this film belongs only to everyone, but it probably cries. This movie is very heartwarming and very effective and if I believe that no movie can change a person's life ... this will be the first to change with me. <br /> <br /> If the film is incredibly entertaining and REAL, though you are looking for a moving and effective movie despite this action.
