This is my first comment on the IMDb website and I'm writing one of the best films ever since. "What a fright!" if you're laughing and crying, you're in love with reading the Georgian chorus's tradition (you're not a fan yet!) and you probably have the difficulty of watching and watching and then you feel good about this movie, and I like the actors in the non-leading roles creates memorable characters and is as interesting and important as a central character. The film plays a leading role in Vahtang Kikabidze (very good), but you will remember every faces around him. When you become home names for many Russian-speaking people, you can find yourself using the lines. A movie to live. Simple, yet deep, you'd like to see it again and again.
