"Margarita and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This pretty entertaining movie takes you through the opening scene and does not give you laughter, surprises and unexpected moments. Since 2005, I've been watching "The Matador" more than any movie. This is a ridiculous film unforgettable character performed by Pierce Brosnan perfectly. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) (hit-man) specializes in high-level corporate concerts (rich dudes assassination). He lives in the midst of a life-threatening crisis. Danny Wright (Kinnear) runs to a mexican hotel bar for one night. <br /> <br /> Danny is a successful family losing a great deal of business dealings that can turn things around. <br /> <br /> Two men are chalk and cheese, and not any other common ground, but in the same bar at night. <br /> <br /> Their friendship made me very reminded of Laurel and Hardy. One is a plain human being, and secondly, it is a stupid stupor that hurts them. <br /> <br /> Brosnan and Kinnear are the only controversial time and a wonderful choice, without affecting the beautiful performances. <br /> <br /> But do not make a mistake ... It's Brosnan's movie. It looks like one of the most memorable and stunning liquor symbols of ten years. He could have thrown his mother right away and would probably apologize. Brosnan can be the last curiosity of the movie, but it is still the most loved and full of performance. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to miss the Oscar node for this role. <br /> <br /> Imagine that she speaks with a high school girl and reads the line with an open mind. .. It is as if it is a damn. "He does this with the familiar Bond smirk and manages to get it, he tells a young man:" It's not a difficult situation for you to lose 30 or 20 years to your mother and then come back to me. " and it still boosts us with some of the really touching scenes of the movie, and most of them come to the end when the movie gets some unexpected turns.However, Julian uses his little black book to call his birthday When you find out, or when a night bedroom with Danny and her partner (Davis) soften each other, the film's unexpected feelings reach deeper. <br /> Matador is stylish and energetic. there is a role, only one hit man is looking for a way to normalize, friendship and the best in life. <br /> <br /> This is a 2005 look <br /> <br /> IndependentCritics.com is a must-have, and you have to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br />
