Critics did not like this movie. He was bombed in the United States and ultimately took a limited demonstration in the UK. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman is very surprising and totally convincing in Russia. <br /> <br /> The character of Dustin Hoffman from Chaplin "The Graduate" and "Birthday Girl" are at least 4 scenes. The 1960s classic is reminiscent of the audience (though it's a completely different story!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is open minded!
