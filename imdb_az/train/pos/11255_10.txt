Without a doubt, it is my favorite Le Carre novel, and it turns into a silver screen that wants all love and care. I have read a character that looks strange on this site, but I believe it runs that point. All Le Carre stories mostly love stories and this is no exception. This is a clear description of the period. Betrayal is the key to everyone's good. Pym upbringing is so close to me that I'm watching her. Peter Egan is in his best role and the late fucking Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are also remarkable. This theater is a theater impresario's dream. The story should not be limited to the awareness of the illness, but it means that a young man is slow, but spy and irrespective of his homeland's betrayal. All my sympathies are unique to Magnus Pym and Poppy (Rudiger Weigang is always as wonderful as her only true friendship, but also on another line of betrayal - love it.
