SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary on attacks on WTC.2. French filmmakers in New York are facing this phenomenon and are using it in the best way to film NYFD's actions. 9 There is nothing to worry about as the film's scenario. On the day of the attack seems to be another boring day at work, but it will change soon. When filmmakers set off with firefighters, they pull the first crashing plane, this is the only view of the first impact. He goes to the WTC with firefighters and goes inside the building. If the second plane crashes, people will realize that this is not an accident. In the coming years, we plan to rescue as many firefighters as possible. In the meantime, we heard sounds, they jumped from the tower and the voices of people falling in the ground, the most horrible moment in this documentary. Then the tower collapses and our French friend is forced to flee to his life. when you leave the building you hear him breathe a little bit. After that, the sandstorm is a great kind, and the screen is black, he was lucky to stay alive and now he can take a movie on the empty streets of Downtown New York. Because this documentary has a lot of historical imagery and this documentary will be in the memory of everyone because the film is completely different. As I'm in the daytime, I've seen the attacks live at home, so look more realistic. 10/10
