Bob Clampett's book, The Time of Hurtfulness, was frustrated by a very small structure of 7 minutes. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that he will be given a terrible bath if he does not crush himself. Unfortunately, it is not possible to stop a ruthless nose for the dog. The cartoon varies between the pace of the dog and the attempts to cope with the dog's adventure. In a great sequence that is frustrated by the scratch of a scalp that can not really be scratched, the dog changes color from shadows to blue-red to polka! It sounds surprisingly surreal, but this is an imaginary idea of ​​itching only in Clampett. "A Scent of Time" There are several elements that pure Clampett should do. The body of the dog has a strange concept that leads to several graphic scenes of the combination. At any stage associated with cats, there is unrestricted violence. In most cases, there's dirty jokes, including a big shot behind a dog, causing a dog's knife and trying to crush himself by dragging the dog back to the ground. He set out to address the audience as soon as possible: "Hey, I'll be fine if I can improve it." With a very limited concept, Clampett tries to create a 'Time In A Kick', a unique, minutiae-based cartoon. Like the early episode of Seinfeld, a spoon in time is practically nothing but funny.
