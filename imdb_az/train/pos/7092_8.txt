At the beginning of the Twelve Monkeys there is a story (perhaps apocryphal) about a sharing between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam. Gilliam pulled out a long list (as he argued) (think about the plane, one of the fifth elements) and gave it to Butch Bruce. He is titled "Things When It Comes to Bruce Willis". <br /> <br /> There is a truth about this movie (absolute truth). <br /> <br /> Gilliam did not give up when writing. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> I will claim that these two factors play a major role in the emergence of an extraordinary (non-commercial) success of twelve monkeys. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Twelve Monkeys are just what we expect from the Gilliam movie. It is also packed with Gilliamsque syurrealism and overall (but spectacular) strangeness. Gilliam is watching the audience wrong. Though the twelve Monkey's ends in the first place, Gilliam focuses on hourly affairs from Kafka, the fate of the unlucky actions of the body's characters. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam's films (especially Brazil). But all suffer from the same vulnerability. There are many ideas and enthusiasm that his films will end up as almost a stir-fits (especially in Brazil). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's driving force, but I do not deny that there is a pure breath in the intensive planning department of the twelve apes. The style, item, and shape look like an invisible merger from the previous Python. <br /> <br /> Gilliam is one of the first (and very atypical) bald, regardless of the above-mentioned rumors. <br /> <br /> For more than a decade, since Bruce has been filming, this film is very good, with all castings, especially a bonkers. Looking back, I realized that you were not really old. Of course, I changed. And it looked at the movie with new eyes. This is part of me, at least for the movie, to reflect on the mirrors, change prospects, and think about one-way travel after absurd. First degree film. 8/10.
