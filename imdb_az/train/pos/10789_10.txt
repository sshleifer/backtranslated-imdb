When I was younger, my parents watched this movie for me. I really liked it and watched it again and again. Even though I was in grade 3, I was watching from time to time. I recently looked back for nostalgia and found that although the show was not aimed at my age group (as I was in my late teas), I was still entertaining and educated. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and treats others well. Some parts are very entertaining. Also, this show does not have any bad content, so do not worry about having this show with kids alone and taking any bad language or some of them. I would recommend it.
