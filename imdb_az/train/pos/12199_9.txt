The first mystery is to estimate that Welles is the original film. It's a real adventure to see a complete skeleton and use cinematic trials as a beautiful woman once supported. <br /> <br /> If you do this, it's also a secret to one of the best movies. <br /> <br /> Velles's story is a miracle of a dark, dark world, because the mystery is increasingly a common thing: a simple provocation, a jealous man like a red chewing gum. <br /> <br /> The first real noir, but even darker. Unless you think about the camera, this is not a clearly wrapped world. <br /> <br /> For all the holidays, Kane was succeeded by the great drama and story. The camera was shocked, but I was experienced. Welles was going there to investigate the gospel of the mystery and to show Shakespeare himself. Both Othello and MacBeth have begun this period, and I consider them a part of their vision. <br /> <br /> Noir feels here that man's lives, even at least a little bit, are manipulated by random ambient factors. So Welles should make the environment a character to explain this story. <br /> <br /> So we have the popular lighting, blocking and angles we know (and have done so many times since). And we have deliberately closed sets: park, yacht, hiking area, aquarium, dock, courtroom, Chinese theater and yard. I am sure that the barbarians were cut by many and not character, but many 'foreign' stories dealing with this strange environment. <br /> <br /> The secret is my own solution, among other characteristic features presented as suspects. In other words, what is the manipulation of Black Ireland (a writer who writes a note and writer in one of the direct communication rooms): a force of human conspiracy (park or cultural appearance, courtroom) or nature (travel and civilian version, aquarium ). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a matter of delusions of the gods to be fun. This, of course, refers to what Welles does: it is a matter of Welles, highlighted by the Peking opera, putting these people on a paradise basis (including itself). Of course, the courtyard is directly connected to the perception of the environment. <br /> <br /> More about showing self-esteem: No doubt, she has a conscious interpretation of her relationship with her in the near future. But I believe he is a strong subconscious of his environment, studio environment. Undoubtedly, Welles, like his character, was very similar. <br /> <br /> This poor Rita comes from China, the Chinese theater, the Chinese theater, the upcoming aggression, and the loss of women. Invest in the surrounding environment all around.
