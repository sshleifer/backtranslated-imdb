May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparation for historical appointments with Mussolini. Privileges, tensions, and self-confirmation forms. an empty city, a housewife, and a journalist. The meeting of two different worlds. A shelter for a mother with a sad life. Shorten a classic victim. A story about loneliness and silence. About the desire of life as a form of battle and a form of fighting. A great character - a book given in the afternoon. This film is a remarkable poem to describe common loneliness in art. Really inactivate a relationship. With the inner world. The images of Il Duce, Antonietta's invincibility, Gabriele's patience and fragile tension, the directing art, give a glimpse of the genius of two great actors, a beautiful film about subtle delicacy, hypocrisy and beauty. arbitrary judgment, the essence of life and the reparation of any oppression. Loren and Mastroianni are great masters of intelligent players. It is an obvious work.
