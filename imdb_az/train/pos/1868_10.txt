This film describes the life of a growing person in the worst case, but unlike many people who are truly respected. <br /> <br /> <strong> The number of refugees and internally displaced populations is high. Antwone Fisher has married the same women for decades and has never deceived women, coca, cigar, herbs, alcohol, or anything that is very popular in the area. <br /> <br /> It's not very good to talk a lot about this movie. The only rating I can give is 10/10.
