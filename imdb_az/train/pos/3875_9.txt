This film was developed by Yves P. Pelletier, one of Canada's most absurd humorists. I was shocked when I created a second romantic comedy, but it was seen in every local festival and local cinema I knew it was a heavy cinephile, and I had a positive feeling about this movie. <br /> <br /> Hell, I'm right. The racing scenario (written by Pelletier himself) is a bit wrapped up and difficult to watch, but it's a box of 90 minutes in Pelletier's fashion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; "> Great prices for other films.
