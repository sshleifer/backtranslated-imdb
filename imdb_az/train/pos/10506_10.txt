<br /> <br /> I have never been to Nintendo 64, but once I played it many times. In addition to Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games on the Nintendo 64 system .I have played this game many times and it is good every time. If you have an N64 and do not miss this game, you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were on the side scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 is a 3D Mario in a beautiful 3D environment.The game. The game has a lot of things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and once again you must rescue 120 power stars from Princess and Bowzer. <br /> <br /> <strong>
