Of course, the Mumbai elite is a very striking and seductive eye-opening that delivers a clever way of life. From fake kisses to plastered smiles, it does not leave any stone to reveal the shocking lives of the rich and the celebrities. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal glitz and glam hidden in every dark corner of the world. Humanity and Generosity Social is like a vicious circle of the world in which Darwinism is dominant mentality. Everyone is driven by far more money, more fame, and far more important to driving the most embarrassing things away from signing film contracts before the child's resistance at the funeral. There is something in this metropolis, where there is such a large gap between social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes in the eyes of the hero. The atmosphere of divorce and the unwillingness of the public to live in. Bollywood, torture scholars, politicians and underworlds are in a mixed confusion! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a beautiful trail like the rich Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Terrific movie with the development of the perfect character!
