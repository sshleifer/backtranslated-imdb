It's always hard to put a stamp at any time in any movie, some genre, or whatever is best, but I believe that Laputa is actually the biggest animated movie ever. In my opinion, the master of the most talented director of Japanese animation directors, Hayao Miyazaki, loves him as the most powerful director, storyteller and designer, and covers all his favorite topics. The version I have reviewed is American Dobby in 2003 (I know it's a loyalty to fans of a glamorous animated film to keep watch in her native language); there are at least one English language, I have a VHS (which I have no idea of) and this version is the best I've ever encountered with a movie. <br /> <br /> Laputa describes the story of a man who grew up in a culture city called Pazu (here by James Van Der Beek). One day, a young girl named Sheeta (Anna Paquin) literally falls. Apparently, a bad state agent who is more interested in the magic crystal hanging on his neck is being followed by Colonel Muska (Mark Hamill). After the crystal to keep everything alive, there is still a bad pirate gang headed by Dark Dola (Cloris Leachman). The area is transformed into a crystal clear city of laputa, the ability to find the potential treasure of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure. There is a great deal of magnificent rallies, but Miyazaki knows how far this story is and the structure resembles the traditions and warnings of nature abuse. <br /> <br /> Nearly twenty years later, design work is still revolutionary in Laputa. All kinds of flying machines are very rich, but as carefully as possible, you will instantly accept them without blinking. Along with the magnificent flying machines in the world, along with telephotos and old cars, they are put together at the beginning of the twentieth century. But its transparency is the city itself; <br /> <br /> Laputa is both Eden Gardens and Heaven's Fire, and this approach has its appeal, power and danger. <br /> <br /> Laputa is blessed with a beautiful cinematography, besides being a thought-provoking and well-featured movie. Laputa shows the vast majority of films at a fast pace of ships that send a small man to ships that are like water-flying ships. even with CGI magic? can just aggravate. Although we see a small part of this world, its simple elegance stretches beyond the frame and we do not have any problem believing in it. Not one of my favorite, most exciting, motion signals in the film: A guardian robot on the ground accidentally reacted and threatened the castle. someone who wakes it up). Meanwhile, Pazu and the bandits are fluttering to escape, almost flying machines, falling jaws. <br /> <br /> From the horrific view of the robot approaching the latter's second firefighting plant, all consistency is to know how much time and camera angles are approaching the masterpiece and the audience. <br /> <br /> This is Laputa's incredible account. Composer Joe Hisaishi holds the beauty of this world, its conscious innocence, its exciting action, and the creepy uniqueness of the flying city and its strange robot guardians. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Although this DVD re-writes (IMO is not improving on its original account), here and there numbers adding the score images in a perfect way, br /> This is not a bad dub. I love the old Englishman and he explains many things with spots, but I would be able to penetrate (and fit well into Japanese) how well these sounds are. Especially Dola, it's hard to get out right, but Leachman takes place as a fiery old pirate woman (her sons are not as good as the original). Although he did a good job like Paquin, Sheeta, and Mark Hamill, I knew him early, and he had a lot of talent for Muska (I liked Muska's other Englishman a bit, Hamillin was good). Most of the film is on the shoulders of Pazu and Van Der Beek is beautiful. Listening to her was supposed to be included in another Englishman because VDB was very close to the original Pazu. Despite being watched for a single dub, it is the basis for extreme communication between heroes and heroes, and I do not think it's much more than watching this particular Anglicized version because I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Pixar is leading John Lassiter, and I doubt that he, like most people, simply loves this movie so much that he has worked hard to provide the highest quality. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki has succeeded In recent years in America with Spirited Away and Mononoke (several films did not interest me), but Laputa is still a great success. Everyone who gets acquainted with his subsequent work will enjoy this previous job, and again, this film is a masterpiece over every shot. I'll pay a lot to see this on a big screen; it would be good to know that at least this classic DVD is stored.
