There should be more movies about local Americans. Especially using real Americans, I think it would be right. I know that Archie Belaney, played by Pierce Brosnan, is an Englishman and has done a great job of describing this character. But the Hollywood suggestion is to put more Indian Indians into the roles and not use anyone. The people of Sioux lengthened the back door. Their poverty is betrayal of our country. Our country should return the Black Sea basin to Sioux. We ask the Israelites to return their land to the Arabs, but we do not endeavor to do so, and we should be ashamed of ourselves. We need to fulfill the preaching work!
