I watched this movie three times. Last time, I spent around mixed scenes to find the resolution for the plot. Perhaps the plot does not want to hang in a wacky place. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that recalling Ann Annan's long incidents is very wrong. <br /> <br /> Young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who is involved in a college with an unnamed heroes of a rich family. She helped pay for this very expensive education, but it never seems to have had a family affair. <br /> <br /> Ann shares her passionate evening with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, after her brother Buddy's tragic death, when Harris conspired to Lila, Ann suddenly found her to be pushy and hated her behavior. I must have left something important here. Ann's behavior is not completely clear. Anna leaves her relationship with Harris and marries one of those who are married to Lil's wedding. In spite of Harris's denial of Harris, he continues to feel deep in his deathbed. <br /> <br /> It was clear from the behavior of Harris and Ann and his happiness. <br /> <br /> The scene showing Lila's students' wedding shows showed that Harris had deep emotions for Ann. <br /> <br /> The film showed Anne's example for romantic relationships. He had always fallen in with men and denied them. This model was Harris and two husband. On the contrary, Lila married a man she did not like and remained with her husband until she died. <br /> <br /> Because of this, Lila Rossla was able to establish ties because she had not married. As you can see, Ann's nanny Annin Liley was able to get enough information in the last few moments to recognize and coordinate. <br /> <br /> <strong> Ever since the past, none of this communication has been filmed. <br /> <br /> I was interested in living in the last days of the house. According to him, he had little to earn his career to get such a home? <br /> <strong> Ann has always been one step ahead of the financial disaster when raising two daughters. <br /> <br /> I was very glad to receive the movie and music at another level. The seaside settlement was just so beautiful. Claire Danes was brilliant as a young Ann Grant. She is really a very talented singer. I love her natural currant bottle blonde look on film boots. If only those pesky CGI fireflies would come out, I could raise my entire movie sound!
