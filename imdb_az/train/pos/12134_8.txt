I love Leslie Howard in better films. For some reason, the performance of HUMAN BONDAJIN has never dropped on me. For the first time, I saw my film on the college campus in 1972, and the writer in a college newspaper commented that they played roles as Howard's Dirk Bogard was born as a betrayal by the 1930s and 1940s. This is usually the case, of course, as a man who can betray Ashley Wilkes (if he and Scarlett O'Hara were prepared by Margaret Mitchell - Ashley Melonie, not Scarlett). Howard can play all sorts and can play a role as RJ Mitchell or Professor Henri Higgins. <br /> <br /> Philip Armstrong can claim that Scott is betrayed by two opponents, but in the 49th they show hospitality, but they are the Nazis who think about it - liberal, western, Canadian-fair play is to cross double during the war. is not the same as emotional betrayal and Howard does not give up, <br /> <br /> According to some reports, most military servicemen will be punished .PETRIFIED FORREST a poet - a dream traveler, but this character was not betrayed, his character is just like a gangster by Humphrey Bogart.) Philip Carey's character is very sincere at Somerset Maugham's Human Bondage, for some reason he is sensitive to art and tries to become an artist, but unlike Strickland, There is no real talent in the century liklə, she highlighted with a club foot condition, to decide the focus of medical research. <br /> <br /> Philippe, a hockey betrayal Mildredə garsonu (Bette Davis), he and his associates claim to be betrayed and wounded. come. The cause of Philip's fall is not really considered in the film, but he is interested in the woman. And he finds an easy meal for him. Philip is in contact with two women who are interested in him (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee) and is more suited to his wife, while being attracted by this prostitute forward. He finds Davis, who splits Davis while establishing contacts with other men (Alan Hale and Reginald Denny, the latter's friend Howard's). <br /> <br /> Howard's performance does not really have enough passion, though Philip is directed to Mildre (when it's late, when he's back to it). Therefore, I have never taken care of the things I have seen here - there is no reality. Later, Vivian Leigh, with Gone, who loved Olivia De Haviland, has been tortured by a torture charge, with more love than a man. However, Davild's role as Mildred makes the movie important. Until 1934, he had various parts. He is a patriot of a pirate pianist's girlfriend, murderer of God, or a fugitive photographer or a mouse-like secretary. <br /> <br /> Like Mildred, she finally showed that she could become an actress by playing an egoist orchestra. <br /> <br /> He uses one third of Howard to film and exploits the scene when he tells her that she hates her kiss, and the last scenes show that her health may deteriorate and she can not keep it any honest business. Howard explains how equally bad it is (he tells her what her baby is, she's dead, and Howard tells you happily that he's the answer he expects). As a result, Howard finally got his life, but Mildred ends up having a death (ironically, his death, discovered by his ex-boyfriend Denny at a medical call). The Motion Picture Academy did not nominate Davis in 1934 (bringing a permanent change to its largest writing campaign and its current rules), but Davis was set up as a star. He won the Oscars as Joyce Heth in a year. Within two years, he was accompanied by HOWARD (together with the stars).
