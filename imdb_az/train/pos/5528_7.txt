This is a very nice and almost meditative movie; There is no dialogue except the story; decor and music perfectly praised each other. At first, the girl's red hair and fox did not connect me until I showed a friend (red hair!). It's almost an old fashioned kid's fashion, and kids have recently shouted animations such as Shrek or Toy Story. - but I think young people should be more familiar with the beauty and miracle of this film, of course. Perhaps its not the best movie of its type, of course, an excellent and comfortable appearance for all ages - not just children.
