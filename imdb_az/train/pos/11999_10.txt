I have seen this beautiful product and can anyone tell me about the actress who played the pianist's wife? - I am not sure of his character. I went to the BYU with him and contacted him - his name was Kim Luke, and I'm surprised if everyone has any information. He is not on the list of loans. This production was very good, tear in all accounts, a great move by everyone. Most likely, this is not what I would like to put into the 'general' category of players, rather than describing "feeling the wonderful things that led to the opening of the heavens for the last dispensary." Who has worked with Kim or let me know if you have a website or something! He was proud of his role. Thank you, Melissa Thorne
