This movie may be part of today's history, but in 1974, before Saturday Night Live, before George Howard Stern, George Carlin recalled only when Hippie Dippie was on the edge of Weatherman and slipped into heavy satirical humor. This movie is the father of all of them. Use it for its historical importance, as well as for powerful entertainment values.
