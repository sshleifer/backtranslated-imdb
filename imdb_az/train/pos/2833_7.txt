I saw this movie again thirty-seven years later. I was just eleven and grabbed this flick at South Beach at the former Cinema Theater in Washington, DC. In 1969, I thought where the horse was! was a very good film. But it's not as good now, after almost forty years now. Times changed, and this film is now a tired old-fashioned war between generations. However, it was only a memory space. It's really interesting to see fashion modes, old Vegas, delicate Don Rickles, chain cigarettes and hip opening songs. The player is deserved, the script is slightly extended, but his memories have been renewed. Where you are, where you are, may be where you are, but for me, it was still a nice and entertaining journey down the memory stick.
