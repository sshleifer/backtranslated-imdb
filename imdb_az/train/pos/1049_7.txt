Sweden's woman on March 24 will be congratulated in Sweden. This is a good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thought-provoking documentary. The film's director, Kim Longinotto, was retrospectively released in Gothenburg. He highly valued the master class, documented the document as a filmmaker, and briefed the audience about the special occasions that led to the double siege: the first version won well, the second film was shot and it turned out to be different at the end of the movie. Creating the possibility of being a very powerful film in this case was a very bad problem.
