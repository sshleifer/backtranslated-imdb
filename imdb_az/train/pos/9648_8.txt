I liked this movie very much. The story is slightly back and forth and it's not easy to follow. There is no solution to the story, and you really are interested in what is happening. I'm glad I liked this kind of movies. I love the "related" scenes, especially in the boys, and have been involved in their lives. Of course, any movie with bare Staphane Rideau will earn a few extra points. ;-)
