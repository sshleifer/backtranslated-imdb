The brilliant adaptation of the novel, which made Chile's president Salvador Allende famous, was killed. A luxury property that deserves the benefit of Esteban Trueba in East, and a wealthy property created by ruins, the brilliant Danish director Bille August micro, the main character of the Chilean people during this period, Augusto Pinochet (similar to Stefen's inimitable): this is an example is a process that leads to the image of the darkest senator. <br /> <br /> Bille August joined Bille August, changing heresy from Jeremy's arrogant and brutal brutality, a difficult lesson in life. it always forces us to change. Estebanda's law of resonating adheres fully to wisdom, as Solomon explains: "It is the same punishment that will serve you." Unforgettable Glen is playing, lonely, guilty of moral and platonic love, the wife of his brutal snowdrift. Meryl Streep also came up with a glare like Clara. Telekinetic forces, cognitive and subordinate to this jealous, conservative husband, are a characteristic and self-guiding character that we desire for ourselves and for all men. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuoso (Blanco's worthy rebel leader, Pedro Segundo is an unhappy person) or a humiliating portrait, like Stephen Jr, a whisperer of a senator who serves as a tool for the return of a boomerang. <br /> <br /> In the film, the intestines are stimulating, we have re-created some facts that need not be repeated, but this is still ridiculous (Colombia is a faithful example) and another reminder that everyone's life is beautiful because there is always Isabel Allende and only immortalizes Bille August.
