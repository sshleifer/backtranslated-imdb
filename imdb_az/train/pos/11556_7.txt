Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started working together. Since Lemmon and Matthau are one of the best-loved comedy teams in Hollywood in the last 100 years, we are best remembered as Best Couples as the Elderly Grumpiest. Instead, it was a classic comedy group, not just "perfect" as Pryor and Wilder, but rather the modern Marx Brothers' routine. Marx, Chaplin, and Keaton are so popular as a mixture of physical comedy and chaos. In Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play full-fledged chaos. Physical comedy is unique as Chaplins. This joke is usually against jogging. Your typical man is not a movie, it's coming against two young teenagers at the start of an old comedy with two-year-old men. Chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is fun enough. Although this movie is not for everyone, it's a big comedy.
