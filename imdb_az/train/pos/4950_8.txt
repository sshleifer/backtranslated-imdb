Knowing how to finish a movie is as important as casting, guidance and action. It looks fine when you see that a director / script is right. Only 82 minutes per hour, 10 USE AND ONLY, strives to understand the story, convincingly. Morgan Freeman (LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN) attracts attention as an "old" star, an old actor who plays in any role she has, is funny, sad and well thought out. When we go to a supermarket on the edge of a city by Kid (Jonah Hill, CLICK), we get to know "Ona". Underlining that he is a star in his car, Kid has been pressuring him to talk about his absence in the past few years. He is not too close, because he is going to go to an indie film shooter, where he is not only far away from that process ("I'm not part of it."). Kid, the director of the indie venture, is the relative and soon leaves her in the midst of indiheresville. Stuck, He decides to check the local market. It includes a beautiful Scarlet (Paz Vega), registered just about 10 or fewer. Not very surprising, not smart, He begins to use it as a head research topic for future independent film roles. <br /> <br /> But she does not just use Scarlet, she can help her look deeper. life. His wife travels together to return from a deceptive spouse and she teaches her how to get a new job, and even dresses for success when facing the Target as the epitome of the local dress.

Although these two friends are not like each other, there is no way to remain friends. They know they spend a lot of time and what they have from each other. <br /> <br /> This is a calming, but momentous moment, because Scarlet's sequence sits on the edge of the car's L.A residence. <br /> <br /> This is an independent independent production and is a bit of a waste of time. And you do not waste your time.
