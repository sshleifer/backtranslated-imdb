I would say that this film was awesome ... and if you want to be a Christian, why worry about looking at it? I've seen this movie before it's gone and very moving. Now, I see that they took these films to another level and created a series of Left Behind ... they make a close comparison and are definitely more modern to reach people. I really think it is to judge this movie, you have to see it, I do not make a mistake if you have 3 or 4 or 4 ... do not use our comments to see the movie for yourself! !! If you persecute them, God will bless you.
