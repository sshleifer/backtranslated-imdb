When watching this film, we should consider that it is not a normal movie. A bunch of gangster characters coming together in perfect harmony does not have one single symbol. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just pull back and listen. <br /> <br /> What's the reason for the user's commentary in this movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You do not really put a finger on the finger with just a funny world where the heroes dominate. Place of love and danger. A movie you can see more than once.
