Okay, first of all, despite the last person's review. They admit that they are falling asleep, so they do not understand what is happening! As the tension / horror grows, this film is not too bad, it is very remarkable. You will get an overview of the opening scenes that will be the cause of the following overall argument and confirm that you are right with everything that has come to an end. <br /> <br /> I liked it very much, and sometimes it was pretty good, and it was like old movies. See it late at night! I'll give her generous 7 out of 10.
