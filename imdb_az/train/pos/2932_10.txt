I've seen the fair share of my comedy and standup movies, but it's so original, it's very strange that you're always surprised at the video store. Murphy has some pretty bizarre jokes, but it's funny to pass. Only every movie can be funny. it should be called the "most incredible comedy 107 minutes" Murphy is a funny genius in this film and "It's Dr. Drulittle!" The ice cream man, the mothers who wear shoes, the paws' mustache, the racism, and perhaps the other things you think and the ones that are in your hands. If you see a comedy in your life, it is only if all the movies are Delirious.
