I immediately fell in love with "Daisies Pushing". This show is a great story, a clever dialogue and a great event. But that's not all - it keeps you up to the end. The main idea behind the show is to bring a person to life with a single touch and to finish his status - it is still interesting and may still be in the next seasons. But add suspenseful crime scenes, show unique look and highly experienced narrator experience. But more than the "Daisies Pushing". There is a certain charm that I really love and I'm waiting for Ned and Chuck in the second season.
