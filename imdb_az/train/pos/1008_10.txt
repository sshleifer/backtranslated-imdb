On the 4th of the season, I've been into this great program and then we've seen all the episodes on the episodes on DVD and continue to be better and better in the 9th and 10th seasons. Now it can not be Richard Dean Anderson Adding Ben Browder and Claudie Black, even after 10 seasons, has even given a strong and original look. Unfortunately, nowadays, the scientific exploration channel has been saved from this beautiful show for 11 seasons with no hope relays, direct DVD movie and more hope. Atlantis goes strong in the 4th season. And the Stargate franchise is now off the third spin off of dead dead jobs. This television show is for all scientists and genre people, because it has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and people. See IT !!!!! 10/10
