"The Brak Show" is good. "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast To Coast", but there are definitely a lot of bright moments .Basically, Zorak and Brak are going to go to school in a neighborhood of 50 'sitcom' This show is humorous and animated with lots of strange occurrences and strange characters, such as "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and may be seen in Meatwad in one episode) .But it is good, it has funny parts. Some songs are great, some are not very, but I like this show. The funniest character is Brak's father. (this is a person, does not know what a person is)
