This is a very strange HK movie in many cases. First, many business segments are not really entertaining. The first weapon battle in the film was ridiculous. Strong, foolish, not even ridiculous, but unreasonable. There are not some great action scenes, but I just do not come to the level of other films I've seen. The opposite, however, is that this film is not just people but simply a HARAKTER. All of the main characters are interesting (except for the bad boy, which is straight as a basic billiard table), and the majority are well-behaved. All the heroes of this movie are entertaining to watch. The dialogue is quite virtuous and does not lose much in translation. This movie is worth seeing, but hopefully, an uninitiated American audience does not think this is the best HK offer.
