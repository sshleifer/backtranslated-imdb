Color Purple is a love that helps people who are strongly affected by life's struggles and life-style struggles. Each character had a purple violet element. The film touches love, loss, hope, hatred, and triumph. Celie who lives in hell and lives to show his love for Shuk, Albert was not a man who did not make a mistake against Celie, he was thrown by his father and eventually met Sofia, his stubbornness was good and bad, even Nettie, had a gap and shortage in the film , but it ended in the end, and that was a sign of a good movie. Good work for all cast and crew.
