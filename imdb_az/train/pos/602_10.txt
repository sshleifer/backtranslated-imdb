Before, I did not dance to flamenco, but I felt like it was perfect. Figures, dances, how clear, the gypsies and rivals come together, when it comes to a seemingly endless movie. I've seen other Carlos Saura movies, and I admit that this movie can be the best produced. I feel that the best features of her past movies have been put together and that she is suited to creating Iberia. I highly appreciate the use of mirrors to discover what's behind the cameras. While watching this movie, I felt like sitting in Madrid in a small restaurant, watching a dancer on a wooden board over a delicious fruit cocktail in a relaxed way. For me, this movie is like a glove. I do not know how to get a copy of this movie in the US over the next few years. I would recommend this film to everyone who has been involved in the livelihoods of other cultures. It is safe to say that this movie is in my list of course favorites.
