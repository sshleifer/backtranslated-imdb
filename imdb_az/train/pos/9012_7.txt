Think of the difficulty of Richard Flying, who has a real passion. When she first sees her, she will be seen on a building in London, with her home wings. His crocodiles and other works were torn in the height of hopelessness and made a flying device for his jump. When he opposes the protective police, he is shaken, but puts him in front of a judge who ordered him to serve the community. Richard, whose relationship with her mother is worsening, decides to move to a countryside where he finds a place in the country where he plans to use his own aircraft. <br /> <br /> Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harcard unwillingly. She is a young woman who suffers from A.L., or Lou Gehrig's disease and is limited to a motorized wheelchair. Jane is extremely elegant, but there is a dark side and a salty word. Sometimes he uses a hand-held device to talk because his speech is not clear. What Jane loves is not to lose her virginity at any cost. Jane and Richard face the confrontation, but mutual tolerance soon brings comfort to each other. <br /> <br /> Jane, who is a porn on her computer, has an idea to find someone like Richard Gere in the American Gigolo: "Whoever, rightly, will have sex with him." When Richard brings him to London he finds the right people to work, but Richard agreed to rob a big bank, but unfortunately, Jane understands that if things do not fit into the plan, he will not be able to do what he wants, and Richard, in the end, is bringing Jane closer to a place where her life is excited, closer to one another. Peter Greengrass is a film that presents this quirky unusual situation, but Jane is not a romantic hero in mainstream films, but has a challenging aura that's hard to deal with and what he's trying to accomplish.Jane Greengrass Richar Hawkins, who wrote for her. <br /> <br /> For filming Helena Bonham Carter main cause. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; She is a beautiful Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branag does not look very good for this type of comedy. In any case, Richard has a problem as he explains. <br /> <br /> Gemma Jones, Anne, has good moments like Richard's old love. <br /> <br /> "Flight Theory" shows a good director. No doubt Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things.
