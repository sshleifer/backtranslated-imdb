Another Pokemon movie hit theaters and still heard the same old saying: "Pokemon is dead, honey bala blah". Franchising detractors could not have been more wrong. Kids are still playing cards, watching the television series, waiting for Game Boy Advance, and wanting to see "Pokemon 4th Film". <br /> <br /> "Pokemon 4th Film" introduces us two more "legendary" Pokemon: Suicune, Northeast North, and Forest Guard (and show star) Chalabi. Chalabi himself and a 40-year-old boy named Sam are traveling with Pokemon trainer Ash, his faithful Pikachu and his friends Brok and Misty Johto. Sam and Ash become a fast friend, once they discover the other mutual love for Pokemon (a great moment of vint-ball with Sam vintage Pokeball). Together, Ã‡elebi decided to protect the story from the rough, the Team Rocket agent gave the name of Velp, the hell that punishes Celebi for their own purposes. Will Ash and Sam be able to protect Celebi from the "Black Buttons"? How Suicune Suits? Jessie, James and Meowth will have a larger share of this movie than before? </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> your child / nephew / nephew / brother / et cetera <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ div> "dragged you"), we will hate it, because you decide to hate it. It may be, but it's simply stupid to spoil the Pokemon 4 movie just because it's a Pokemon movie, and especially when you miss it. Even non-fans can use this movie without knowing every last part of the Pokemon world. <br /> <br /> Unlike the first 3 Pokemons, "Unlike pokemon 4th grade, I'm not saying that you will be a Pokemon curtain for this movie." The film is released by Miramax, and this is the 5th edition I also work on ensuring the rights of the Pokemon movie. Miramax claims he owns some brutal-aggressive marketing strategy for the Pokemon 4th Movie, but what I have seen so far is that the usual Pikachu is a minuscule limited launcher, this time we are inviting. Hopefully, Miramax is "at least the most exciting version of Pikachu's thrilling Hide-and-Seek" movie, though not the future broader version of "Pokemon 4th Film". I hope the current release is just an iceberg type for this fun movie.
