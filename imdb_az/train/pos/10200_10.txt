Everything I've heard shows how bad the animation is. It may not be parallel to what everyone expects, but just look at it. Do you expect perfection in Hell? In my opinion, the purpose of the animation was dry and irritable. It was a pleasure to see her character change in this movie, which is likely to be closer to the event we get. I hope soon afterwards. If we want live activities, I think we can be worse with Christianity or Purgatori. I do not think Lady Death will be a good transfer to the movie. But maybe my personal belief is that all the notorious DEAD movies are wrong. No penalty was imposed
