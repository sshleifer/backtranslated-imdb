As a teenager, I have always denied my two sisters when I look at what my parents like to buy the Disney movie, like Cinderella, which I always hate. I asked for "Dumbo", but my sister won, we had Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Enjoyed the film thoroughly while slamming behind the playing room with my Star Wars action figures. <br /> <br /> Many things have changed since then. My sweetheart to Disney theme parks has been trained at Walt Disney World and now I have two young teachers. I want to show Disney as much as I want and we have recently watched Cinderella together. <br /> <br /> Because of Disney's new acquaintance, I saw Cinderella watching in a new perspective and I was amazed at seeing it. <br /> <br /> From the start of the film I did not understand why Cinderella suffered such a terrible disaster. Why was he so a slave to his parents, and why was he just not able to escape? I'm not very sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself full of story. Maybe the eye-catching animation or entertaining characters drew me, or perhaps it was timeless songs. Having listened to songs such as "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A Dream dream of a heart", he turned me back to parks. <br /> <br /> One thing about this movie is just the Disney magic. This creates many people, but you see all the little girls dressed like Cinderella in the Magic Kingdom and in the fantasy world, and you know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Cinderella may be, but Disney is one of the most influential companies in the world. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is not the most powerful story, it's an iconic type of Disney and movie history. This is a striking miracle, such as entertaining, idealistic and fantasy when we are a child. Imagine, this film has many meanings for many people. <br /> <br /> My favorite Disney movie may not be, but it represents everything I've loved and amused about the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Level: A (Superior)
