Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) is just one of his wife, because he is one of the most ferocious, neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his speech, but he can not seem to go out, he takes his friends home. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) has recently been divorced and lives in a bachelor's paradise. Smoking, gambling, diving, eating and cleaning is never a paradise. Now, with a suicide attempt, Oscar decided to allow Felix to move. Firstly, a game prepared in paradise, Felix cooks and cleanses and helps pay Oscar's alimony in time, but Oscar women and Gilbert's world today are likely to be gay). They invite a few English birds and Felix finds such a proposal that they and Felix will cry and talk about family life soon. It blows and throws it down, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as it seems and is soon to the top. My favorite quote "If you put a small note on my pillow, I could not keep track of my notes on my pillow 158 times," he says. F.U. "FU Feliks Ungar, it took me three hours to figure out!" Based on Neil Simon (script writer), it has a certain theater scene. Set and repartee and look pretty play-like (better or worse). <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Mathau have perfect comedy chemistry and have appeared in Grumpier Old Man films and the Sea, but also reprising the same charming / trail roles, but I'm sure to avoid the various names (royalty issues) <br /> <br /> This movie is like chocolate-strawberry strawberries. Chocolate is smoother, sweet and rich, strawberry tart, juicy and shiny red (if you do not take these bad green bottles). They are polar opposites, but together they emphasize each other and make a beautiful dessert. 7/10 <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
