I love this movie. When I was watching, I found that I could review it later. As I was able to absorb more than 2 main characters of Natalie and Adam's intelligent dialogue, I really enjoyed the second look. This story was very thought-provoking. I was very interested in interacting with Natalie's daughter and her friends, primarily she was enraged, but once I was forced to see how this trip started. I'm not disappointed. Gradually, the secrets that Sara had taken from her mother began to reveal a girl that was not so perfect, a ruler who seemed to be the most frail man wanted to introduce her freedom to her daughter, but, unfortunately, sometimes she really likes someone to give her freedom a painful on the picture. The audience, who finished with this film, performed a beautiful performance from Diane Keaton (some of the most well-known films - city and country thinkers). Diane Keaton's home is about to end, and anyone who loves another should wait to learn to live our own lives, to love others, to belong to them, and finally to ourselves. go This is a difficult lesson, but it is worth thinking now and then. Thank you CBS for this broadcast, it was worth a long wait.
