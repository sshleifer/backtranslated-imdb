It is strange that this movie has not been transformed into Denmark's big screen, so I have to wait for video freedom. My expectations are high, but here's no disappointment. As always, there is a fantastic, exciting and exciting area with Ang Lee, which will make the final and accurate shooting. Along with Unforgiven, this is easily one of the two best western 90s. <br /> <br /> People who are waiting for anything along the line of Patriot or Braveheart (who are acceptable) Mel Gibson will be sourly frustrated, all others who appreciate the above mentioned features will have a fantastic time following it. 10 to 9 o'clock.
