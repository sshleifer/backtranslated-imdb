The end of a period In the summer of 2002, "The Rookie" in the United States, "Best for the Best !!!!!" It was in Texas! In fact, the story began in West Texas, because it was proven by a field code found in a single sign. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie: It was great !!! !! It was a very good sport movie, Mighty Ducks trilogy. Together with Panhandle and El Paso, we took a movie theater in Texas from all the way to Metroplex (where I live). I know that I know this ballpark ("Ballpark in Arlington", now "Ameriquest Field")! <br /> <br /> Disney's Golden Age is the Disney's Golden Age in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> - Spring 2002 "All started with a mouse ... and ended with baseball."
