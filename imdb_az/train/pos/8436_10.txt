Only this movie was better than all the H finals: LOTS. But better than any movie made for television! <br /> <br /> I'm looking at Top 250, just a small screen movie: How did Grinch surprise Christmas? I think it's time to get this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I will admit that there are several shows that are better than the original series, but I did not cry. I liked to go back to part of Baltimore's Crime!
