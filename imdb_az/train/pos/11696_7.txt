"A thief of the night" was, in fact, ignored by the film fans because of his small budget (apparently) and his subject - the true Christian Church's Rapture and the fate of the survivors. Nevertheless, it was a story story that captured the viewer and considered his relationship with Jesus Christ. It touched everyone - even a priest who preached the Word, but did not believe it. This film and later "Remote Thunder" should be seen. While leaving the new "Left Behind" series, the effect is still the same, explaining the same story with a higher budget - "The Thief of the Night" has broken the genre and will always be remembered.
