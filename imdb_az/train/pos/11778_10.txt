This series adds new information and backgrounds of the book and includes individual speeches of the author and archeologists and other anthropologists. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not a series of answers to the need for "publishing or killing" as it is about the academician's book, but rather a thought-provoking answer to the question: "Why do white people have so much burden and we are too little?" Since he respects the inquiry of the inquirer and his community, Diamond was looking for a response that did not offend the public or the public. In a very simple way, I love to think in the same spirit as South Park's "Blame Canadian": "The blame for the wheat!"
