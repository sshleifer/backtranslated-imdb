Spoiler This is a great movie about an outline. He tried to get back to the little girl's owner. He learns a lot during his journey and meets many beautiful birds. If you love birds like my wife, this movie is for you. This film also has some sad tears. At the end, all of Paulie and his Russian friend work. For the whole family this is a rental, and everyone can do it.
