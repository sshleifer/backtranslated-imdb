Of course, the Titanic was a good movie, you see it for the first time, but if you really see it for the second time, the movie will definitely change in your opinion. The film sees the first love story you have seen for the first time and I think: ooh, romantic. The second time (and I'm not alone to think about it) is just boring and you just sit there watching the movie's thought, when is this iron mint coming? Even when you see it several times it is not so effective. It's not a bad act in this movie, but definitely not good. Glad to see DiCaprio not winning an Oscar for this movie, who is Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He will take half a good movie and will shoot less than $ 20 million. And then everyone was surprised that there is no movie with him. But enough, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. On the other hand, Kate Winslet's performance was amazing. And I like it, the director is very talented to shoot such a powerful film. There is a lesson to learn about this movie: there are so many love stories; filmmakers should not add romantic romance to every movie! Of the 100% possible, I'm just giving this movie 71%.
