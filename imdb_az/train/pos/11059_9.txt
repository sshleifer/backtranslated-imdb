The effect of Hal Hartley's Adrienne Shelly, "I Think of Him," is not open, but has something to do with (Shelly Hartley's two films). Not only does the film show a very narrow narrative, hyper-stylized and excessive characters illuminate the strange human emotion. Although this film is generally hearty (thanks to God), the small and subtle styles of the pepper's fragrance point to bitter truths in love and loss. A soundtrack of beautiful movies and lovers, "I'll see you" is a great indie film that does not deal with postmodern mockery when dealing with the hearts of the people and the reality of human emotions. <BR> <BR> The film begins with Bill's life splitting. Not only did his best friend sell Ray to a beautiful country house, but his wife, Rose, abandoned him to join Ray in the shooting. All is washed, Bill's dark heart and Lucy (directed by Adrienne Shelly), bringing him all kinds of surprises: his own book and his traumatized brother's "date" <br /> <br /> For unwanted bill but Bernice's appearance on the door does not give him another choice. Undoubtedly, at the beginning of Bernice's superficial behavior and ridiculous hair reduces his ability to "retire" with him. However, her hip-hop hacking attributes give her a lot of annoyances, and she is hitting her at her first date. And Bernice, seeing that he had respected himself, forced himself to do so, suffered so much trauma. What we do not know ... maybe it's psychic. (And who can play better psychologically than Ally Sheedy?) Bill Bill knows that he wants to see despair, Bernice offers his car, but let him take it first. On the way, Bill takes his jail with his gun (a Pinkerton Detective, less). While Bill and Bernice are traveling home to Ray and Rose countries, of course, with a few stops along the way, they stop anger, laziness, accusation, passion, and violence.
