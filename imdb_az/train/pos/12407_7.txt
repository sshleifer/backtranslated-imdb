Prison institutions are not well known for their kindness and "happy vibes", battles stories, chaos, murder and, of course, extreme men's bonds! But in this film prison is a completely different animal. Fear film films are probably something new because they are talking about and exaggerating the fear of claustrophobia and their rescue ability. two of the biggest issues of horror cinema. ALIEN 3 (David Fincher, 1992) and, of course, the examples of the genre of exploitation in all Women's Prison (Waldermar Korzeniowsky, 1988), GREEN MILE (Frank Darabont, 1999), this is a creative and very entertaining one may be anything. Or at least what you think. <br /> <br /> The film, in short, was re-opened in an old prison (not good at all), not so disappointing, duh!). However, prisoners are not the prisoners and the guards who are in need of fear, but also the devil's ghost spirit, which is the only thing in the mind of something; death And boy, we're treating some awesome death scenes! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red; "> this cast. The performance is not only highly convincing, but his skill is Eastwood-esquire's character, both bad-to-the-art, and Viggo Mortensen, the star of Viggo Mortensen (and all that kind of entertaining, yes, he's naked) bone and likable (a very subtle mix). Add him a cast of "Hey-Wait-a-minute-I-know-that-guy" actors and you have a great star set yourself. The heroes themselves are three-dimensional and often do not come across stereotypically. There is a black watchman, a tough prisoner prison director, human rights activist, and many other stock symbols. But in all honesty, this "mistake" actually helps the film. In a long-term balance, instead of boring character, we move more or less in action, and there is no scene that is too early (too early). wall to the wall. Unlike the defined SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (Frank Darabont, 1994)! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All this is a bit of a horror movie and amber world, which is unhappy and unmentioned. With great cast and great special effects and more original scenes of death, this movie is highly recommended to fans of the film. Although it's made in the US in the 1980s, it is far from cheese (although it's the last one) and at the same time, though it's curly and far from reality, I do it from 5 luvs to 3.5 I divide. Very entertaining horror film with really nice touchscreen.
