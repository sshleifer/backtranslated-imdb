As a student, I've been able to watch the "Diagnosis Murder" for several years. He is basically a doctor who solves the murders by the son of his LAPD, a young doctor and a pathologist. The DM provided exceptional fun 8 seasons. Things different from many other police demonstrations are worth watching many times, and its quality and quality of writing. The main cast made good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertaining roots shine through magic, dance and humor. The DM's best features were fast pace, witty recordings, and, of course, tactile scoring. Unfortunately, this is justified by "Crime, He wrote." The DM solution and more diversity make it even more difficult. Now the past TV is a worse place. It shows night-friendly, family-friendly police. Now there are simply those who are modest.
