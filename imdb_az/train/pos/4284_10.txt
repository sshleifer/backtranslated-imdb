This film is one of the most funniest, most striking, and most accurate imagery of the mindset that has brought the Balkans together again after 45 years. All common symbols and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love, and it is not possible to decide whether to cry or laugh a more appropriate answer. The greatness of the images and the timelessness of the species has only made a great film to watch if it does not want to understand something that led to the ancient Yugoslavian madness. In fact, a diplomat interested in the region should not do anything until you see this movie, and the second is Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Did I tell you that I was one of the most funny films I've ever seen?
