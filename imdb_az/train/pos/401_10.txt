I just returned from Hong Kong with a summer vacation and saw the ZU legend. I thought I threw a * s! It was creative and unique. It's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with very little drama. If you think that some of them are very special FX (yeah!), You can not challenge the shooting. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so beautiful! Legend of Zu ..... starts a basket !!!!!!!!
