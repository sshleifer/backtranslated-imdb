The US Department of State does not want to see this movie because they have a calf with the Iranian government. Nevertheless, despite the content of the film, it is possible to show how civilized Iran is, at least, equal rights to the struggle of women: the ability to watch football matches in the stadium is restricted to only male audiences. The film is hilarious, funny, and itself is proof of the freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I'm very happy about this movie. Five girls are trying to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates at a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The next comedy is funny to describe intercession of the police from the bus and the subsequent arrests of the girls. Do not miss this classic movie. You need to see one. One of the best foreign films I've ever seen.
