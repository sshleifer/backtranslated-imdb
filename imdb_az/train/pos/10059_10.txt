This movie is the best film. I do not remember a movie last time I went to my tears. With a tear in my eyes, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that should be a good film: Perfect Dialogs, Music, Actress, Story / Plot. The story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a King of the Mosques and a Street known for a little girl selling in the Serf market as a boy. The little girl liked to be a grandson, and the mask king loved a grandson. They were not traditional in reality. Every scene they were in was somewhat pricey. The camera work is flawless and takes you. The player inspires. Xu Zhu was perfect as a mask king. Renewing Zhou's "Doggie" looks very nice and has played his character very well. Zhigang Zhao was good as Liang Sao Lang. His useful and dear character played extremely well. If you have this movie, try it once, and watch it.
