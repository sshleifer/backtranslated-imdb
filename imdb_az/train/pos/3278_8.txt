This beautifully written and well-behaved psychological drama. This is really a horror that those who are looking for something like Ring or Grudge will be disappointed. It really surprised me about this movie, detailing the effort made to make the sequel to the intelligence and consistency. I'm Dr. Phil appreciated the lack of psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Instead of developing an agenda, directors talked only to stories, talked well, and let the viewer think about that. Cruising rhythms were reminiscent of the Wyeth paintings and were strange. <br /> <br /> A small budget, big studios, star actors, great directors (better than most Hitchcock films), special effects or "smart" consecutive curves.
