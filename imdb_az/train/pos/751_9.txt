This is one of the best Jodie Foster movies out there and generally ignores the public as a young flicker because of its misunderstanding. These beautiful performances, especially the battlefield between Jodie and her mother, are played by convincing Sally Kellerman. Three girls playing with Jodie's friends are some amateur, but I think it's worth seeing.
