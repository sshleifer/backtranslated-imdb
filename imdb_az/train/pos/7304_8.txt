Now and then a movie introduces itself as a fright or a terrible, but they are not usually. Many modern horror films are in this category. <br /> <br /> Sadly, there are tension and adrenaline films that make your veins worse than normal. <br /> <br /> The movie "Halloween" is a movie. Most filmmakers have a lot of risks that will help crash. But almost all of them work. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" frightens you with the simplicity and the feeling of fear. The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some babies on the Halloween night, when she goes into a madman who escapes from a mental institution after killing her older brother 15 years ago. Certainly, then, known as Michael Myers, began to kill the local young people and eventually comes after Laurie. <br /> Only a brainless slasher full of foolish teens and gobs. I think James Berardinelli puts something perfectly in Halloween's review: "Halloween is often grouped together with other splatter films covering all theaters, in the late 1970s and In the early 1980's, but Halloween is rightly considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it's not a member ... "<br /> <br /> It has a point and some reasons. First of all, it is horrible, but most of the young slasher genres are unhealthy strangers (many may claim to be the last languages, but most of them fail). Secondly, there is almost no violence (very few are bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not equal to fears, and he relies very little on him (in fact, the number of the body is quite low). In fact, this can actually claim that film is not really a scary movie, with the most deadly crammed cirks into a film that is more sinister and more sinister than ever. It is based on heartwarming thoughts and skills. Third, some of the characters can do foolish things (sometimes their destiny is sealed), but they can not see that they are dumb. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons for Halloween is that we are afraid instead of just thinking that heroes are dead because of errors. it is so intimidating that it is easy to believe that it is the truth. There is nothing to lose in this movie. There is nothing supernatural, no ridiculous creative element, or "inventive" crime or something. Instead, all set pieces and camera jobs (keeping the opening sequence) are simple. The carpenter only puts the camera on and puts it on. <br /> <br /> Heroic movies are probably the most difficult films because everything must be perfect and the ideas will not work twice to make things worse. This is a hit or miss game, so if they say good ideas from Carpenter (I'm not), they seem to be primitive (especially after a recurring recurring recurrence) <br /> <br /> It does not need to function here, because it is not important to operate here. This is a film about dramatic, contradictory characters, not a movie about scary ideas. Actors act as real people, not characters from a story. Nothing more. The only exception is that they are known to be playing casino or later Michael Myers. It is dangerous to say that a person does not say anything and simply kills them, but it is difficult to pull (and even more difficult for people to ask). </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" He directed it, co-wrote, co-authored, and he is a gleaming man, and Thing is not as afraid of Halloween, but his next film, The Thing, supports this statement, unfortunately, its success has dramatically decreased, because the great deal of money for little freedom is a " you know your potential. "It's not as good as the movie, it's not a flair, but it's not a matter of scaring, but it's not a big fear for the first part of the movie. often uses symbols to build relationships with the viewer, but it is in line with the purpose of this relationship, but we are growing up to know the characters, <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Once at the movie Halloween night After entering, Carpenter has started a high gear, and will never stop until it's over. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" can be defective, but it's a bit like that. This is a terrific movie and it should be for everyone who loves scary movies. Be aware, however, that this movie will fear the hell out of you!
