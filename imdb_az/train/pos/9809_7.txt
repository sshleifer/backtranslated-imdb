Randolph Scott went to Albuquerque to work with his cousin. But on the way, the scene is raised - they do not even carry a strong box. <br /> <br /> After a while, the beautiful lady in the city hides $ 10,000 for her and her brother's job ... <br /> <br /> Once in the city Scott stopped this. However, he soon learned that this uncle was a stranger in the West - a typical evil man. You know, the wealthy person who wants to be rich by betrayal, theft, and threat, until he has everything. And it's as if it's behind robbery. <br /> <br /> Scott requires the commodity to return the money, and then starts working with Scott's lady and her brother. It is not surprising that this is not the end of the problem, but the beginning. Still, the intrigues of different species will try to crush the uncle's opposition. A trickier is to bring a cute lady to help Scott and his partners. Unlike Randolph Scott, Scott shows a little modest man. She looks bad for a crack shot and Scott - up to so many figures that come to town. <br /> <br /> Films are often the most recent violence in the film, but in this film he offers a quick lynching proposal (and then let's go), and then it's too early to threaten his uncle. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that at the beginning of the film, it is the same old Scots expected. <br /> <br /> There is nothing particularly unusual in the course of the film. o Gabby Hayes plays an ordinary character, Scott can not be justified by a hero, baddie, and ultimately destruction and Scott gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite this very typical structure, all are well-processed and eventually worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two strange scenes in the film. First, in the film there is a slap battle between the late Scott and his uncle, No. 1, Lon Chaney, Jr. In her, Chaney drinks when he fights - I did not see anything, and how tasted I was tasted As he fell away. Second, getting a burden on the smuggled cigar scene with the whip - it was an impossible feat now!
