I've been to the same scenario conference and saw the movie. Writer Sue Smith - I thought it was very clear what the film was about. However, the film did not really need to comment. I thought the themes were very clear and inspirational. A movie with the courage and fear to face - especially the fear passed through the parents and eliminated it, and the film covering the possibilities of life is a valuable and pleasing movie. I really liked Somersault, which is very uncomfortable. I also think that Mandy62 is somewhat embarrassed for Hugo Weaving. As a block on her vintage, I must look very good! I have acknowledged that many Australian films have been invariable lately, but the "Shafi'als" cost them. I saw that I was glad.
