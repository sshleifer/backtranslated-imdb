If this film proves only one thing, Keaton will be funny in his heart even when he goes out of the bullets, heading the electrical chair and at the wrong end of a line of information in prison. <br /> <br /> But Johnny Dangerously continues to prove it. In the 80's, ZAZ boys (Zucker, Ibrahim, Zucker) were the richest in the world of charming worlds. But there were several contenders on the board. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High"), Heckerling, tests a hand through a beautiful television writer behind the script (with his hand and check). <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, this slap of slaves and "gag" films throws every kliches for a loop of slapstick spoof, and even adds a few kliches that are not available at the time. <br /> <br /> And not only the disadvantage Keaton under Johnny's name but also ordinary funny guys such as Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston, and every other actor in Hollywood immediately went around. As you know, how many hundreds of people are surprised. <br /> <br /> And I jokes? Yes, when they start, they come to you as fast and furious as a machine gun. There are so many to count from the beginning, Weird went off with the crazy theme song by Al Yankovic. But you have to watch them when you reload them. And they should reload a little more often. <br /> <br /> Everyone works, they seem to be having fun, and I often laugh. However, it's usually not the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. However, there's nothing good on TV, pop on Johnny, and get ready for some "Dangerous" serious laughter. <br /> Eight stars. Look at Johnny Dangerously ... not a "bastidge".
