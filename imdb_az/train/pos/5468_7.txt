I did not see Barbara Stanwyck restoring "Baby Face" or any version of "TCM". What a beautiful movie! In short, Lily lives in a speakeasy, she was pimped by her own Father because she was 14! Later, he was still burst and killed by Lily (Stanwyck) alone, his black maid, Chico, played very well by Theresa Harris. Lily is divided into a big city (New York), which decides to use sex to overcome it. <br /> <br /> He deceived a garbage master to enter the basement and continues to pass through men like a single candy! Relieves a fianc√© and kills her lover's father-in-law Lily, then suicidal! Lily flashes instantly! <br /> <br /> Then, in Paris, she falls to Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when she's in deep financial means, Stanwyck is terrifying as a girl who does not know what love is. bolts. Nearly half a million free with Chiko, he understands that he loves the Court! Lily is competing to find him, but will he be late? <br /> <br /> This is Hollywood's best code. Stanwyck is very large, and the film looks great and the music is perfect. This reminded me that Angelina Jolie, an immoral woman and another crazy person, who loved these films very romantic, reminded them that they would not love Loving Baby FAce, those who believe in sex, love and power. I love it. Recommend! Look!
