It was always one of the best episodes. Sean Cooper, 68, was killed in a patrol car. A convict who died in a state prison shows that after stealing, he stole a hero block from the car. <br /> <br /> As a police officer and as a human being, he exposes him to a war veteran, who is dealing with a ban on more investigations. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of love that is shy and at least hidden for keeping. <br /> <br /> It was not a kind of love that I personally supported, yet it was still a police and a human being, for this purpose he was killed. The soundtrack was perfect (I keep watching the DVR) and it was particularly attractive to use a black and white color combination to emphasize an object or give it a special feeling. I'll follow it again!
