I just ran away from watching this version of Samhain, and though I still liked it, it resembles a "rough cut" version. If you check the message board, you'll find an apology for the 79-minute version of the director. And he says he has nothing to do with the corrected edited by R-rated. Indeed, a Christian does not need to go away, since the basic elements are still upright, though they stand upright. This is a shame, because it has the potential to be one of the best and best films in these years. There are still porn stars and inbreds and some extreme gore can be seen at least partly. I'm glad you're just a "rough cut", because for me, it's the author of any stock library. Christian Viel has absolute skills and vision to deliver the goods, and hopefully his next project will be better produced. The Stavits were a classic in their hands and bowed to everyone. <br /> <br /> Samhain can be one of the most controversial and terrifying films in the world, and an evil author has not seen what the director is saying. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** So you know what you missed, it's "<BR> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > The film runs a little over 90 minutes and does not stop at all, definitely does not have music and some scenes do not have any sound because I think they will be looped later. However, most of the film is sound-affected and if the scene is ineffectual or incomplete , it appears as an indicator to add a message when the movie is complete, and say that it's a "Crisp Cut", but you see the only unbreakable version of "Samhain." The reason is because of strange graphics, even more than an NC-17 Yes, there are a few porn stars, but they have to add just one sugar and spice to kill.The story is pretty standard, the American tourists on a vacation in Ireland and the forest The folklore is home to the ancient Druids and Samhain celebrations, or it is called Halloween. (spooky) <br /> <br /> As a camping partner is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants, the film begins with a large dose. This is a great guy, because the boy is crying to help a girl. Everything he sees depends on his head, his arm and shoulders, and when he pulls it, he is completely sliced. Here's what I called EXTREME GORE, cut off all parts of the inside, blood and hands. Here, people in the Herschell Gordon Lewis area seem to be more realistic, with no effect. <br /> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <span style = "font-size: (TCM-2 products) and a table This geek then cuts off all the signs (from the camera to add a scene) and then we see his body in a barbecue pit, slowly turns to the fire and I believe a torso is a heavy). <br /> <br /> then, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body, and all of it is cut off from her neck to mouth, and therefore you find very good taste, expensive, terrible, true, all the densities are drawn in the graph and the blood turns into a pot. <br /> <br /> But there is a scene of the best in the house, and I should not admit that it is one of the best scenes I've ever seen, and this guy keeps a pile of horses in the pit and then puts his hand n goes to hell, which survives the children inside, the intestines and the evil, which goes FOREVER, the boy shouting and placing more trenching from the bath. It's so extreme, and I also laughed at hell. <br /> <br /> So you will not see this scene with the vast majority of the most dignified scenes on the respective DVD, IMO, really. Well, first and foremost, this "Rough Cut" is a rare piece of jewelry for my fianc√©, although I'm not sure if this film will be released in this absolutely uninterrupted presentation. Well, at first it's a bit challenging, no soundtrack, still a few scenes to access and loans that are missing from all places. But this is a rare thing and I will not trade for anything now. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme. This "Haute Tension" looks like Disney movie.
