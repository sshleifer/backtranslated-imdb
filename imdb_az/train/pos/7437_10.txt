Recently, as a friend and I grew up in the 1950s, we discussed the educational and ethical effects. She spoke of The Ancient Mariner The Rime in 1798, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Both of us were required to read a portion of the epic poem at secondary school and English Literature courses. My friend said, "His messages can be called metaphysics in today's context." <br /> <br /> We tried to read this and remembered the bits and pieces. (Dr. Seuss has problems I can remember). I get two copies of the poem, and everybody can read it. It was easy enough, but I was surprised to find that it turned into a movie. We were watching the film to see how the film was interpreted. For all this, the Rime of Ancient Mariner is not a complete reading. After reading each poem, we watched the film together. <br /> <br /> Before the film, before the Ken Burns Effect, in the 1970s, "Before the special effects, compensation was often paid for the absence of substance, and it is particularly noteworthy that the 19th and 20th The paintings of the century were polished by "little known artists", such as Hollywood's first designer Willy Pogany. <br /> <br /> The film was taught by poet Sir Sir Michael Redgrave when he was the school principal. <br /> <br /> His mastery on the sophisticated message line, "instructed" or as a pressure and ambiguity of morality.We find a refreshing change in our "facial expression" today, and the majority of today's moral messages are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder, and betrayal. The bad is really bad, good and super hero Ancient Mariner's Rime is an identity, a characteristic celebration to celebrate the entire lifetime of the richness of humanity in a wider context of humanity. <br /> <br /> After being proud of ourselves because we found this "incomplete" stone, he won the top prize at six times in the international film festivals. Another surprise film director, Raul daSilva, is a well-known organization in early animation and learned that he wrote six prize-winning books on the film. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie, as it is today, is not so much, but Coleridge wrote an original epic poem and Raul daSilva translated it to the film. If I've been teaching secondary school for five years, I'll take it and show it to all my students. <br /> <br /> Here, in the years 1798, 1978 or today, indeed, when there is a spiritual component of humanity, there is a level of wealth that deals with the great and important issues. <br /> <br /> We recommend.
