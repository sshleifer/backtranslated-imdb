A great story about a young black man and a true story about all the difficulties along the way. This was Denzel Washington's first film, regardless of whether he was directing himself or not, but who was it? But still, he is a great actor with years of experience, and the result has come to an end. The story tells you in a beautiful way to see yourself in these situations where you are experiencing difficulties during childhood and in young adults. Thus, He will put you in difficulty and will not let you know the only one passing through hell. Generally speaking, a touching story of a young man who wants to do so in this chapter. (Based on the story of Antwone Fisher, born August 3, 1959, the film's author, Cleveland, Ohio, USA) was strongly recommended. 8/10
