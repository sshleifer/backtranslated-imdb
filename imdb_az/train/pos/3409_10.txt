Looking for the meaning of life in a small Arab city on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman and a beautiful Trappist monk who escapes the crisis of faith. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> They will meet together and passions will accelerate, but Sand Diviner will not be able to find happiness or sorrow in God's Sacrifice. yet great fun and beautiful look. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are perfect pair of pairs. He simply puts something perfect and Boyer gives his most sensitive face the most effective, simpler performance that allows him to play a great role. <br /> <br /> It is good that Basil Rathbone plays a sympathetic role in a number of lovers of the outside; Joseph Schildkraut is a friendly, talkative guide (all "Arab" and others talking in the movie) is pure gibberish; Lucile Watson, like the subtle Home Superior; Alan Marshall as a glorious young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henri Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as the Hidden Sand Diviner; and the magnificent Sir C.
