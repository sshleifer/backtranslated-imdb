One reason I knew the Midnight Cowboy was because he was Top 100 at AFI Critics. For Top 100, this is a very good movie; Indeed, I have to look very hard to find a copy, I got the DVD version for about half price. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will warn this view (as a comment). So I'll give you some brief information. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the most striking films I've ever seen, sometimes using montage, artistic photography, and unusual topics. <br /> <br /> The film shoots and the players were very good and it was very good. I still do not understand (twice I've seen) This movie is more memorable than the life symbols. The main character is a Texas cowboy, Joe Buck, who runs to New York to become a prostitute. She gets acquainted with the disability Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, of course, they become friends through the usual running. <br /> <br /> Film shooting is very interesting. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie did not make any real emotional contact between the Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience. of course, it is very sad and tragic. <br /> <br /> I personally think that the film explores the main topics in a beautiful and tough manner. The deprivation of humanity (the darkness of the city streets, the places of breaking). Most of the characters in the movie are out of law (a conman, giggolo.etc), but you can not help them to love them. <br /> <br /> In the next film, Ratso was shot at a very high level. Because he was very strange. his cycle. At that time (And even now) it was not necessarily a typical movie (quite a craft house). <br /> <br /> A movie with an unusual theme, like Midnight Cowboy, opens a movie in a tired western world, with music and dramas. <br /> <br /> At the personal level, I liked the movie pretty much. The description has brought about a similar quality of sleep. Especially in the party, the scene, music, pictures and so on. It was long considered after waiting. However, as a film for fun, it's a bit lacking in excitement (not really my movie style). <br /> <br /> Although I find it hard to analyze the film, the characters and their motives were quite interesting. As I understand from the thoughts, Joe Buck is still sexually exploited by his grandmother, though he still does not seem to be related to the story. She is a happy, successful young studio who sows dark memories. The religious sects in the film are also striking. Some people have suggested homosexual relationships between Buck and Ratso. <br /> <br /> In the United States, homosexuality is much more than touches, and then Joe Buck is facing a single old man, but there is little to do with the main story. Of course, from a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (more than 70 in 70) is touching on topics that dare to revolutionize a few other films. Although a simple, synthesis story (covered with a rigid edge), the beauty of the film is strange, often in psychedelic sequence.
