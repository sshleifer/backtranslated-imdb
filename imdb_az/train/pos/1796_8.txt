I filmed the evening with my lady friend. In the evening, it's a bare whistle without any excuse for being so kind, but I can say with ease that it is painful to watch a man with a red-haired person, not estrogen. Until the end of the film, except for one example, I watched with interest and did not turn away, or do not compel my melodrama to watch. <br /> <br /> Ann Lord, the elderly, is bedridden and spends her last two days with her two daughters in the world as comfortable as possible in her home. its side. Concerned about her past memories, Ann suddenly called on the name of one of the girls: Harris. Even though both of her daughters always think of this mysterious man as her own, she always feels strongly to recall and restore this ill-treatment, and Ann goes to the day of death to meet Harris and her mother and her two daughter - one married with children, successive "accusation" of one - the struggle with the central issue - also lost the youth's optimism for the future. True love really exists, and maybe even more important, if true love can endure the trial of time. Will one day die for our understanding that your love will never last forever? Because we are imperfect, this is the only real solution to the solution. <br /> <br /> The elderly Anne does not care about the two girls, who answer these questions, still wrestle with an answer on her death. <br /> <br /> Evening kinematography is interesting - most of the film remembers Ann's past, and I think that the film was shot like everyone else, and we can give everyone a glimmerity (and that's why all this is not true, ). Claire Danes is attracted to a climactic stage on which she has been tested (in fact, only 5 '5'), and strange talents finally come to the test. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close it fills in other big and small roles in the movie: You can not really talk about garbage that goes out with Claire Danes, and does not leave the place, and I can not say anything negative about this movie as Hugh Dancy's struggle for a dimension of character is ending. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Lastly, gentlemen, my friend, of course, do not worry, do not worry, you're almost impressed, you will not necessarily waste your time on the evening even if you want to accompany Die Hard 4 or upcoming Rambo flick view. Buy it in theaters as a hire for trade, or catch it, and it will be a little secret that it does not really cost you anything.
