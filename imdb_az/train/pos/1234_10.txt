I grew up watching this movie and still love it so much since I am a kid. Do not listen to the critics. Eddie Murphy really shines in her role. You will sit with your whole family and everyone will love you. I'm coming to see this movie everybody. It's a comedy with fantasy. A little bald kid with God like demons, dragons and powers. This movie takes you to Tibet from LA for a wonderful view of the mountains from the magnificent mountains of Tibet. Just a beautiful look! So do kindness yourself and do not do it! Sorry
