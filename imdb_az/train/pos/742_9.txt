The appearance of old films in these days is quite commonplace. Since 1980, "Foxes" really means. Jodie Foster performs his character straightforward. Four years ago, he was a "taxi driver" and has a stronger character in this film. It looks like Jeanie and many other high school pupils who are in paradise go out of the situation. Scott Baio plays Chachi's pre-Brad road on "Happy Days". She was not considered competent by other girls. Cherie Currie, Annie, is hanging in the wrong crowd, followed by the police's father. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild as long as they are hired by a party. Life on the other side of the road can be fun or dangerous. Whenever Annie goes, he is always rescued by Jeanie and Brad. Where a car crash occurs, the reality is severe. And she is married to many elderly people. It's not easy to get around, and sometimes we have to look at how life is. In fact, people around you need to be careful. For me, I am myself, and I tend to stay in this way too! Great music, great structure, this movie is a stone! 4 out of 5 stars!
