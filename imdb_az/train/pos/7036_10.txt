<br /> <br /> For Cusak, Tomei and all supporting actors, we must be one of the best political satellites ever seen. <br /> <br /> Perfect area, very well placed and very well to bend at an unexpected end. Event scenes are well-drawn and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Generally, I'm giving this movie a great glimmer. The US military intervention in the Middle East is extremely critical and, therefore, can only get bad views from politically ignorant people who do not share the same political ideas or evaluate the dark and depressing humor. Indeed, in places the comedy was close to the truth, it was a boundary between comic and tragic.
