It was simple and still beautiful. I think that all the feelings of the sexual segment in society can be painful and very elegant. There was a bit of a hummer in it. Most of the actors were not professional but made the film more accurate and realistic. The film also had a "documentary" side. The best scenes, all the girls who were forbidden to watch, listened to the game and listened to the soldier who needed attention. If you're an Iranian, if you get cheerful and dancing on the streets after a game, you'll be filled with National Pride! If you are not an Iranian, you will love the same thing again!
