I saw the film's International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam, and gave the privilege to meet with the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom were vivid and clear New Yorkers. The title of the film in Amsterdam has created the sensational aspect of lesser known cannibalism, keeping your tea on your right. Tobias Schneebaum, anthropologist, was a lover and a gay friend with members of the groups he read. His nearly 80-year-old merger and inevitable departure were very moving. I can recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story, not just walking.
