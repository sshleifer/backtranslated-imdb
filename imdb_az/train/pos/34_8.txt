What a fun movie! If you are a Giallo admirer, the Red Queen kills 7 times, it is a real victory. First of all, it is difficult to go wrong with Giallo and Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti. Both are beautiful - especially the innocent Bouchet, full of eyes, is a guilty woman who fears her life. The kill scenes in the Red Queen are killed 7 times, especially beautiful and give enough blood to make fans happy. One of the first crimes comes in an unexpected way and takes a movie for a really good start. The murderer, the red hero, is one of the most overlapping and intriguing murderers I have ever seen in the Italian film. The sets and styles of the 70s are beautiful. In fact, one of the favorite moments of the movie, all the visuals are interesting with the Red Hero, who flies along the bridge overnight. I was interested in a bilateral meeting. Finally, Bruno Nicola's account may be the best I've heard from the composer. <br /> <br /> <strong> The red hero has been in the final for more than 7 days, with only two issues in the final. First, the location of the person responsible for the crimes is very easy. If you've seen more than a few Gialli, you will not have a problem identifying who is behind the offenses. Second, the finish feels a bit frustrated and eventually a bit confused. I'm not in need of any plot points written to me, but I'll admit that it's damaging to tell them all. A second tracking can be so clear.
