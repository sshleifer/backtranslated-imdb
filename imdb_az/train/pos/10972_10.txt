I just saw it recently, but had been aware of it for a few years and was always interested in its title. Now one of my favorite films is mine. It's hard to describe the incredible subject, which is found on the Maids, but everything here works fine. There are many memorable pictures and moments in the feelings you attack on a very special world. I fell in love with this movie and the characters in it. The screenwriters resemble a magic of the audience, and have drawn us to the strange world of the genuine aristocratic family of the eccentric Beale. It has a material atmosphere and I wish I could be there, eating my corn on the table in my bedroom. There is an extremely sad air. Do not despise this one time for a respected family. The money went, but their air and the mirrors were their beauty. He pulled me from the first frame and soon after the end of the movie I found myself wondering about my fate. Although I go for a ride along the East Hampton beach, I can hear the voices of old Edie at night, and wonder if the Little Edie silhouette will dance in the window behind a thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.
