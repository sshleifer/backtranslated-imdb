The famous British journalist Joe Strauss (Ian McShane) recalls how much his colleagues and friends were confident when looking for a bucket. Deathly, Joe, explains the identity of the serial killer of London's Tarot Card. He cheats Reaper and appears to an American student of the Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) magazine on the stage in the midst of a magical show called Sydney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and the murderer is aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra is trying to prove that he is a killer, dragging Sidon's investigation. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great Woody Allen comedy outside Manhattan, indeed in London. His mockery and intelligent lines are simply fantastic, and people in a country that goes to the wrong side laughed at the hero's hero. Sid Waterman is very funny and is in an excellent form as Woody Allen comedian. However, his great admirer, Scarlett Johansson, is often an actor who is often annoyed, changing his emphasis on histrionic pronunciation. His character is totally illogical and magnificent, and I was disappointed in his performance (probably for the first time in his filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a fun and valuable entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
