The book, How to Eliminate Friends and Alienate People, is the adaptation of Toby Young's same name. This is also a great name to help you fill in the IMDb line in the reviews! Some of the major trends are identical to a dramatic book, but a romantic plot is added and the latter is certainly Hollywooded. Though Simon Pegg is an irritating person, he is a very joyous and funny person, and he has a pretty film. A few years ago, he was just a TV sitcom boy, and now he is kidding the shoulders with Hollywood titles. There is a good helper player and this is an entertaining, easy watch type called 'Ugly Betty', but funnier.
