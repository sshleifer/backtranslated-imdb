I liked this movie very much and saw the audience in Los Angeles. After the film many people cried and said that the film affected them. I can see how great a hit to my homeland, Sweden. The film is primarily oriented and bright with every character that will eventually know and care for these people. Music is very natural, and the main song in the film is quite heartwarming, but inspirational. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone to watch the movie - even people who are not usually in movies. Daily people and a small city community without claiming to be featured on the film's deep subjects were awarded the Oscar nominee. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human soul. A SACRIFICE BIBLE!
