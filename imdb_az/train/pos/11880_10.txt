<br /> <br /> <strong> Twenty-two years after Scarface's release, there is a great cul-de-sac. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Extensively criticized as too closed, unmanaged, top-up and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to Godfather films. <br /> <br /> A woman in the Caucasus is a filmmaker, a filmmaker, a blatant approach to gangsters. In this film, Latino pirates appear more dangerous and realistic than the other Italian or Irish bandits polished from other gangster classics such as "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas". This is one of the key points in Scarface, and I believe this truth is written as "tackiness" by critics! I've seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I have to say that these films are very different and should be regarded as two different films instead of praising the original "repeat"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized for loud and overlapping this film. But you think filmmakers want Tony Montana's character! She is an angry young man who makes hasty decisions and adapts tantrums every minute! Here is calm Michael Corleone. <br /> <br /> Tony Montana is a very flawless, uneducated person who really does not think much and is always angry! <br /> <br /> This movie has about 80 feelings. Soundtrack all 80s! <br /> <br /> I love some songs, including the theme "Gina and Elvira's Theme", "Pull Border" and a musical instrument. <br /> <br /> There are a series of memorable and well-drawn sequences, including the famous chain scene, hitting Reben, the first interview with Sosa and Tony's mother, and visited her mother's mother. <br /> <br /> About performance: Al Pacino is brilliant as an angry Cuban refugee. He was the most played in all of Tony Montana's career. And it really looks like it's all in all scenes! Without a Pacino, "Scarface" will be a wonder. <br /> <br /> Tony Montana could not imagine anyone who described it in all probability, and the film would not be effective with it! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines like Tony's friend Manny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> F. Murray plays a minor role in Ibrahim (like Omar). <br /> <br /> Then there is an eye candy in the form of Elvira, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> According to Basbug, she is beautiful and adequately qualified. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and best gangster films. exercise. What's more, enjoy the raw images of drug lords and their bunch!
