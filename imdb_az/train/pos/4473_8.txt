In my opinion, this is one of the lesser musical albums of Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Kathryn Grayson and director George Sidney, less than anyone else in this line, and the line-up is coming together. <br /> <br /> Sinatra and Kelly Clarence Doolittle and Joseph Brady, respectively, are two Denizli men. The film is being shot in Los Angeles, just as it was launched, for a very handy vacation. Brady is planning to visit a girl named Lola. Doolittle is still somewhat moist with enough ears and personal Brady advises women (in the public, scenario writer Isobel Lennart and Sidney, exaggerating the delicacy of all women). Brady promised to help Doolittle shut down, but Doolittle would not let him go otherwise. When a local police force is forced to help them with a young man who is dissatisfied with the Navy, they have a plan. The police will not provide any information about who they are or where they live. Brady helps her and she and Doolittle bring the boy home. The boy's guardian Susan Abbott (Grayson), finally, goes to Doolittle for him. Brady tries to convince him not to forget; Brady just wants to go back to Lola. However, they continue to return to Abbott's home, resulting in a form of a love triangle. When he was introduced to the famous musician Jose Iturbi sitting in the movie studio about Brady Doolittle, things became more complicated and claimed that he set up a audition for Abbott, a singer and actress in front of Doolittle Iturby. Due to the story, music is a strange combination of militaristic music - Due to its maritime fleet, obviously the Broadway pop stars have more informal conditions, such as the opera Abbott's characteristic advantage, the popular classic of Liberace - What did Iturbi and Mexican Music - As Abbott frequently visits a Mexican restaurant in Mexican Mexico, the combination does not work either. Good songs are good and everyone involved is, of course, talented as a singer or musician, but jumping genre tries to lose consistency. It is even worse that there are several showcases for Iturbi, which is actually a big star, that it stays in an effective way and looks a little hockey at this point. I only watched Robert Altman's film in the state of Kansas (1996), but stopped on a regular basis to become a concert movie. Anchors Aweigh is a similar tactic. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is music, but there is a difference between the content of the contractual commitment and the songs that integrate the show show. Why Brady's Doolittle's opposite to Abbott is not a good thing. Brady thinks Doolittle can care for a child and that he is relatively "straightforward" and traditional, but Brady says Doolittle is not the same. Brady gives her acknowledgment of her confession. Abbott looks like a good fit for Doolittle, and Lennart Brady's just trying to get Doolittle out of his hair and want to meet Lola - Brady's character must soon be Doolittle on any candidate, whether it is in good condition. It might seem like a small detail, but in fact it is a hinge for about half of the area. Story is also drawn up a bit. Length is a problem. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the above, that I often complain about the film, just two hours and twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> That's why it's very important for me. <br /> <br /> In the conversation, separately and together. They turn good and interesting speeches. Sinatra looks and works very young since 29 years? 30 shooting times. He plays an unusual naive, virginal character - it is quite different from most of the roles he will later be seen and different from his public appearance as another crooner. For Kelly, this was his breakthrough movie and rightly so. His choreography is varied and effective, like his actor. Grayson is charming, his performance is intricate, and he's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> Along with this, it helps to eliminate the flaws created by the violin and the pacing. <br /> <br /> Because Sidney has allowed it to spread to a broader mood, there's even a very interesting element. dreams of a sad fantasy sequence with the sad Kelly Jerry Mouse ("Tom and Jerry"). This is one of the earliest examples of animation and animation, and as long as you are a fan of fantasy it is very good and pleasant. Fantasy sequence is the best film. Brady, perfectly danced with Jerry the Mouse, is a long song and dance song by Kelly and Grayson, described by Abbott on a scene from a one-time film. He encourages himself, and has to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach him physically. it stands on a balcony. <br /> <br /> As film is inaccurate and defective, it's mostly fun and fun to watch. The admirer of classical music, of course, should not miss the Anchors Aweigh, and the fan of the Sinatra will be hit hard by his character.
