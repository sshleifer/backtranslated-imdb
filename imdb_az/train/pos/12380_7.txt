NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents a room in an old coffee that meets several strange neighbors and is subject to some creepy hallucinations. As his lawyer, Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) went to inquire on his behalf, he strives to maintain his health, taking into account his experience affecting his physical, mental and emotional health. /> <br /> I do not want to destroy better moments in this psychological horror movie. The story is fascinating and fun, but the film does not really offer much in terms of fear. Or any atmosphere in this regard. It's quiet in a quiet, but not like a traditional fear film. It is an event of a troubled woman's attempt to deal with increasing inequality in her life. <br /> <br /> The Sentinel * proposal is a bunch of spectators (especially a fascinating, incredibly creepy heart and Beverly D'Angelo's scene, which can be convinced). There is something to be seen, but not many. <br /> <br /> No theory of this film will be completed without the assessing of such great players for the ensemble of film artists. Some can not do a lot, but it's pretty effective to see them all together. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith are, in turn, the biggest impression of a hard-nosed detective and a willing neighbor. Other legendary names include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum make short speeches, and other familiar faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. The director of this film is worthy of some kind. <br /> <br /> Written by Michael Winner, the author is likely to be known for his series of Death Requests with Charles Bronson. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
