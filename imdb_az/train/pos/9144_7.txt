Okay, so the award-winning "movie" movie (except for the brilliant soundtrack I thought was awards), but "The Kid" (Prince / Minneapolis events and his music, O (take your choice) Music is absolutely superior, In my opinion you must have this soundtrack, it's really classic and it sounds like the 80s, and the movie itself is playing a beautiful field, of course, like the Prince / O (I've done).
