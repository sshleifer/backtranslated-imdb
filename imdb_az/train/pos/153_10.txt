This film is, in a word, kinematic work. The film moves sharply with powerful images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War and a group of children wants to take revenge on another child. In fact, they carry out a version of what they are witnessing in the world of adults. Then we will get three kids to visit as an adult in a sanatorium. Here we see what each of us can do in life. Someone is subject to sexual harassment. Another man is sick hustler. The third child, a young lady, a nurse, serves at a sanatorium. This film is about an effect of violence on psychology. <br /> <br /> This film has a profound sense not only for the sharp members of the audience watching it, but also with deep-rooted behavior. The actor is excellent and the script is well written. There is a musical score scary throughout this movie. It's not a movie for those excited, but a movie for a thoughtful audience.
