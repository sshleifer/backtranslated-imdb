I grew up in this movie when the music was popular. What a beautiful time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was a little young to go to USO and nightclubs. I sound like I've lived in the past (I have some nice memories), so what's wrong? !!? The Second World War was a terrible time than music. Glenn Miller's death made us very sad. This movie will be my favorite one. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I do not know how I miss this movie. The main reason for this comment is to inform the contemporary generation of being "an insult to me" as an alternative to "Rap and New Age." Follow this movie and give it a chance!
