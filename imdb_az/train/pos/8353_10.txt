In 1977 or 1978, I was able to remember this movie as a child. The HBO would have shown late in the night when they were the only movie channel to pay. Until then it was UNRATED and in no way was the only film shown on the payout television ... especially back. Now I would like to see now that we'll be a better place to understand the adult theme. It was probably the best I looked at pornography at the age of 7 or 8. Fortunately, in the evening I had fool babysitters and parents who came to the party. The majority of this movie was a mistake of these two boys. The men walked apart when entering the houses, burning inner clothes, feeding on a stranger's breast milk, and entering into the cabin at the request of one of the women. Terrible film in the early 70's. Until I checked the IMDb, I did not know that this movie was such a thing. Most of the people I talked did not hear.
