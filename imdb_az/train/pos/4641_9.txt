Eyton Fox has done so: follow a humble story that is going on in the heart of the audience in a severe mess. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago, and all of them are: lifestyle, relationships, heart. We strongly advise that it's heart and is a journey for the mind, an interesting perspective. Israel-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Nota Bene: The film has a gay gay space. You do not think you are gay-friendly, be ready to challenge, and eventually you see him as "lonely love." (and do not worry: chick is very hot!)
