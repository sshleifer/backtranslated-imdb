I just saw this movie in a hidden front view and almost ... "What did I watch?" I also said good and bad. <br /> <br /> The solution is simple. Styles and Black friends / neighbors. Stiller is in the foreground of a black dreamer. Black invented this idea to create a spray from the poos. The idea is very popular and Black is very rich. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Black and Stiller is trying to be the best friend, because Stiller is a lifetime of many lifestyles. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's simple. Everything else is something else. No steadily strange, strange spinning sequence, without any rotating opening shot. Dialouge and player are very strange; a strange one in the way. <br /> <br /> So the real question is ... it's strange funny? It depends entirely on the individual. The film's curvy strangeness. After the screening, people called it heartbreaking and glad that they were free. Strangely enough, I understood their point. There is no joke, so if you are not related to its uniqueness, you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie will cost a lot of money in the cash register and become a DVD culinary classic. If you laugh in a movie without any real joke like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, I suggest you see it. If not, avoid this movie. Only you are crazy.
