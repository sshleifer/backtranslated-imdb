The film was not reviewed by the TCM in the near future, and they found this story about Poland and a small town in which the local cities of this country settled in the Nazi occupation, as many European cities as Norway. The First World War ended, and people in that city suffered from the wounded soldiers who were still missing and the war's always. Alexander Knox (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returned to the war with a missing leg and was a former schoolteacher in the city. He raised Germany and was not happy with the Polish people, and they did not fully accept it. After the Hitler party came to power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a natsi to return and punish this small Polish town for treatment. Marsha Hunt (Marja Pacierkowski), Chloe's Prayer, played a prominent role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically engaged with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and many real facts about the Nazi people's destruction of their families and their lives. In this picture, black cars are shown along with Jews traveling to Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie and have taken this time on this subject; this movie is a story that has fallen to the ground for the 1944 movie and will not forget it very quickly.
