This drama is different from Sex and City, where women have several drinks and share sex with each other. It is more personal and people can be related to it. <br /> <br /> More attractive and emotional than other dramas that draw attention to women and their lives: "Sex and City, lipstick Jungle ....". Katie Roden is a psychologist with a dark mystery, more likely to be more depressed than the rest of his friend. She also deals with her son's adventures, as well as with her old lover, who is ill. His cloaked clothes and empty and cold houses convey it to emotions. <br /> <br /> A widow struggles with problems that cause her husband to "go" since 11/11. It's a wonderful strange, when Richard is interested in him, he has to make a reality check by his comrades who suddenly offer to return to recruitment. The ridiculous and embarrassing scene scenes between Richard and Trudy are absolutely funny! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard is eager to ask her from her birthday on the day she gets millions from the 9/11 podium. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> SIYOBAN DÄ°LLON only falls in love with her husband, who is dealing with "making babies" (when his problem is aggravated) and his colleague who offers his "services" soon and does not hesitate for a long time. it is something that interests her or her husband (Raza Jeffrey will be playing). Jessica, a real estate business, is unmatched until the woman is single and has nothing to do with a single female marriage and one of them. Her character was shown as a seductive and provocative woman, whose lesbian encounter with her predecessor, the "married man". <br /> <br /> The beauty of this drama shows us four different women with different scenarios that show their ambitions and inhibitions. It is also a good thing that the dram will sometimes lie to be "safe" for each other!
