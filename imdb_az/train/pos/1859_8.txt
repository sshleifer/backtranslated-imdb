In his first speech at the Washington-based conference, Denzel draws a real story that is a very difficult event and brings us to the screen with honesty that we are talking about in Washington's efforts, but now we see this tone as a director. <br /> <br /> We have seen some catastrophic consequences of children who have recently fallen victim to social defenses. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, just a few days ago, these scenes make up, but it is impossible to simplify the simplicity of other scenes for the implementation of this kind of project. <br /> <br /> If the Academy looks at this movie, it will be a transvestite. This film does not strike any fist and goes to the cold hard facts of the story and usually goes from a novel to a purity that does not appear on the screen. This, of course, is a respect for the Director. <br /> <br /> Now, let's see if it's such a dandy, and let your friends see it too!
