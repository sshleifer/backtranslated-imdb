One thing is clear to me that the majority of Hollywood showers are obviously correcting me, and more especially, the pages of comic books with double characters. Why? <br /> <br /> Dear No.1, 'These days there are lots of dollars to escape the superhero cries' he said. <br /> <br /> Implementation # 2 'Good point, then let's do it hurriedly! ?? We'll make a successful diver on a hat and pick a random super hero based on a movie! "<br /> <br /> Do you have any feedback? <br /> <br /> Do you have any questions? <br /> <br /> Who is this big boxster now? ' <br /> <br /> The executive number 1 '* is the big actor's name * within the week.' <br /> <br /> Implementation # 2 ', but is it really in line with its role? That is, it does not look like a character. "<br /> <br /> Executive power # 1 was a great name; We'll do it together with the movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Implementation number: 2 'You are right! we will walk around the movies, because nobody is really glamorous with special effects to shatter the moronic masses that will never question him. "<br /> <br /> Above all, the above scenarios, in general, avoid the most up-to-date superhero movies. All styles, no substance and just stunning evidence. Of course, there are exceptions in the above order to be fair; Hollywood right? Superman the original (and yet easily the best) cast; Christopher Reeve and more recently Sir Ian McKellen in Patrick Stewart and X-Men films. <br /> <br /> But today, Hollywood returns to the common negative features. managers always have to choose actors that are relevant to their roles? Yes, less than an ideal world, it leaves the actors on the basis of similarity to a film maker, who believes it or not, but is against their comic books. His name is Sandy Collora. Unfortunately, although Hollywood has yet to focus Tolora on a full-length movie, she has, however, given surprising ideas that for us, the resulting outcome will appear in two (still) popular forms. short features of the super hero. <strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> The winner of the Mr. Universe and the male model, Michael O'Hearn (the most awesome but barbarous Barbarian), is the perfect choice, playing the iconic man of Steel, in fact, in terms of physical resemblance, <br /> <br /> This Clark Bartrama is fresh from the striking description of Dark Knight in Batman. <br /> <br /> What does it mean? Only this is really true, full long movie! How to do it! <br /> <br /> As a last resort, I have once again been interested in the short-lived reactions that you have mentioned about these fans Tellingly, the most acerbic and strange negative reactions are even younger, less cinematic than experienced audiences (Batman: the same as Dead End), their grammatically elementary rank and betrayal of the liberal use of the main diction. Even though the above-mentioned studio leaders in Hollywood are not pleased at all, this unfortunate situation is a closed idea. All of this is exactly the same as those of a pop-horn that is exposed to CGI's dependency on CGI, which is likely to be a controversial phenomenon that most of Hollywood's controversy is about today's collapse.
