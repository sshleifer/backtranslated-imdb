It was a top-notch movie with top notch cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyed, have played this charming film about real life angels helping the Angels baseball team. You do not know, maybe. I liked this role of Lloyd. She was cheerful. This story helped the children to turn around Glover, the angry, fastened and respected manager of the Angels, about turning around life. The film was well designed and meant to see the best of people and reach your dreams. It was funny, attractive, touched, and sad, all was beautiful. You love it (or you like it). <br /> <br /> ***
