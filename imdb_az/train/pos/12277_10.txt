Perhaps in the best Isabel Allende book, the House of Spirits describes an alternative Chilean history, full of magic, mystical cover, and a kind of sadness. This movie collects a great cast, and also a great artistic aspect, and with a script that can not hold the quality of this book. It is not uncommon for a country that is almost unknown to Chile as it is an unusual thing that perhaps only sin is attaining a very high purpose, and therefore little understood to the illiterate community.
