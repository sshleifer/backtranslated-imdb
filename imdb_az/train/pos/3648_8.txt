"Pandora's Clock" is a flammable tension / tension between a virus movie and a disaster film. The two-part film, NBC, was shown in 1996, one of the passengers on board an infected airplane while carrying this disease. The US government is discussing whether the plane should be destroyed, a pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to think something out of disaster. I'm not really a big fan of television movies and miniatures, but I liked the "Pandora's Clock". It's a heck of excitement. <br /> <br /> Jane Leeves (TV's Frasier), Robert Logji and Edward Herrmann (as President)
