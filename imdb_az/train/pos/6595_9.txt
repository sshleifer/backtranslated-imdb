I borrowed this movie from a friend without knowing it and became a famous documentary about a journey on an ancient ship along the vast ocean boundaries. Thor Heyerdahl says that based on some of the oldest known types of ancient vessels found on the basis of some ancient remains of the Incirus in Peru, he prepared a theory capable of traveling thousands of miles along the ocean through the ocean, analyzing the ocean and wind currents, and that inaccessible, no knowledge of travel. <strong> </ font> <br /> <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ p> <p style His theory, like much about ancient history, can not be proven by 100% reliability, but the scope of their journey is that it's true, and the film is a truth about the 100+ daytime expedition, This is a very detailed description of what they are and of the trials and challenges they face, and I often wish that it would be easier to find Oscar-winning documentary films, and as I was sure it was released for more than 50 years ago, informative.
