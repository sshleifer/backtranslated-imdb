I just watched this movie in the Turner Classical Movies, the first time I saw it last night, and I liked it. Especially, I do not like all the bad films and most of the current films are over-violent, nudity and sex, and I love many movies. And I think it's been made very well (in all cases) very well. Jimmy Stewart is a special occasion for me. I just thought it was a lot of fun to watch this movie and I loved it thoroughly. If you think the same thing about old movies, I do not think it's going wrong with it. I believe that "Got Mail" is a movie (although quite different, though it is very unpleasant). For a casual evening with a movie, it is not necessary to be ashamed that your children or everyone is walking in your footage, capturing or capturing one of the classic movie channels.
