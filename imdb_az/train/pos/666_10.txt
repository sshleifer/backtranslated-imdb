<br /> <br /> A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) just killed her daughter. <br /> <br /> The second part of the first season is love, betrayal is a bad story, and a father is on the eve of Christmas for life insurance. <br /> <br /> Starting as a perfect offense, psychopathic clothes (Santa Claus, perfectly superior), poses a danger to his life and protects his precious young daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is even remembered by people who accidentally met the program. By the way, this is a regular review of all the magnificent reviews. It is most remarkable for its growing tension and narrative stories, and across all of Crypt's best Tales through Houst.
