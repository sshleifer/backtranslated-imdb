This film is one of the most feared geriatric diseases in the aging process. As one of the few people facing Alzheimer's potential or facing a stage of formation, I would recommend that every healthcare service recommend this film for any family that is facing the disease. The film is intended primarily to talk to the patient's family and to reach the heart of the struggle. Casting is excellent with a very fierce line, with excellent and dramatic depiction.
