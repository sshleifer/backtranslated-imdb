They may have made a mistake in the episode, but do not remember, but at least every week. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend and I were on the trailer, but both of us are a great fan of the normal American series. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew it was a special thing. <br /> <br /> We missed a few episodes, and for a week we were putting you off.
