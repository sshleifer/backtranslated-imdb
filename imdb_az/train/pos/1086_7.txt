This film has a very subtle place that is a bit unusual and the film itself is very slow and slow. Although this is different from the average Grant movie, it is still outstanding at the highest level and entertaining. Like somebody, "let's go around Cary and see when all the minor problems that arise when you get home are angry." The film is a fun actor and, given the great support received from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. Despite the fact that the film is so modest, it makes up the majority of the material. A great movie for Cary Grant fans or the whole family.
