Stargate, the best show. All actors are perfect for roles there. I love the relationship between the characters. If you do not see this show, it is very high. Although this application is comparable to Star Trek, it can not be long because it is not actually different. I'm a fan of a star trek, but I would definitely appreciate this show from any of the star tracks at a high level. Unfortunately, we live in New Zealand, and we can not get Stargate on our TV, but I have to get my DVDs and I'm here at season 10, so it's been a while). However, this program is very good and needs to be seen, but being warned is very addictive. So in the summer I love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
