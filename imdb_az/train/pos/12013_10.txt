Having read and commented on this movie, I'll add ten speeches to the movie, not just in visual beauty, writing, music score, acting and directorship, but because of the difficulty to believe that Joseph Smith and the road story put God's way and know and cruelty passed. I am very glad that there was a small part to tell the story of this remarkable man. Whenever I present the opportunity to myself, I recommend that regardless of whether it is on any religious path, it is only the Savior who makes us more determined to live in order to live with the true values ​​of love and forgiveness that we teach.
