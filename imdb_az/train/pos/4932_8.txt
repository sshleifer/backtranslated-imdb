In the Panik on the street, Richard Widmark plays a US Navy doctor who cut his week with a deadly body. Paul Douglas died almost as a result of two police bullets. <br /> <br /> According to several cases of several people, according to the director, there are reluctant partners to find criminals and anyone who is ill. Elia Kazan was worried about pulling small pieces out of Louisiana. Personally, I can confirm this as New Orleans arrives in life. <br /> <br /> If the US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Barbara Bel Geddes and her husband, Barbara Bel Geddes, are hiding in secret, New Orleans PD opens the hospitable land of the city. The dead man took a boat from Europe and he had underground passages. The New Orleans intelligent son, played by Jack Palance, makes all the mistakes of mistake and puts pressure on the body of the dead man, who begins to show signs of traumas. <br /> <br /> In this movie I have Zero Mostel who is my favorite person. It happened before Mostel's blacklisting, and at that time he had created a specialty that would be really proud of children. Humphrey plays the same role as The Enforcer in Bogart. Unfortunately, I can identify with Mostell on the latter discovery scene, which was followed by Pallesin Widmark, Douglas and half the New Orleans Police. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <<< <br /> <br /> The winning acted in a good clip, down in this movie. It would have been Indiana Jones movie though it was a bit smaller. Panik on the streets, won the Oscars for the best Original Script that year. <br /> <br /> The boiler also benefited from the New Orleans coast and the French Quarter. Some of the same types of shots are used in the Gulf of Water. In fact, the panic in the streets is not really the case when they need to be in line with their interests. <br /> <br /> Those who panic in the peace are proud of everyone. Now Elia Kazan could not get a little decent New Orleans who sang people in small roles.
