I watched this movie a couple of times on DVD, the first time, after watching the second half, and then back to the first hour. an entertaining fun movie, thankfully that no kiera is updated inside the knightley, and it gives a true idea of ​​what is happening in the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the challenging options she has to make. There is nothing bad about the film, not a real bad language or anything of sexual nature that insulting the family. Kids queen victoria himself and possibly little known characters Conroy and Lord Melbourne
