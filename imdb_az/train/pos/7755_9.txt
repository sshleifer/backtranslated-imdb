"Written on the Wind," just as director Circus can do, it is an irresistible, beautiful kinky movie. The film remains in a bucket filled with Freud's characters, strange melodrama and colorful contrasts. The link between financial success and moral degradation is the main theme of the film. Circus hypothesis is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I would like to see the movie as the best example of what you can do with kitschy material. The color palette is particularly effective. The film is very large. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall manage to keep the movie hot at the film, giving Robert Gordon and Dorothy Malone (who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar), which is a pretty glamorous and delicate film of elegance. By Frank Skinner's pulsator, Kudos is Russell Metty's gorgeous camera work (each stroke is a masterpiece) and production design department. Also, the title is a beauty. An unforgettable movie.
