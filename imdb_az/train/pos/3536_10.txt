EA showed us that they can do the classic 007 agent and feel the 60s. The game's graphics are superior and sound recordings are very professional. I bought this game in April 2007 (two years after the release) and still affected by the gameplay. <br /> <br /> EA is a shame that will make the game 007 longer. <br /> <br /> In this game, I'll give 10/10 levels, especially the level of "consular". I would recommend this game to anyone over the age of 13. The only thing I did not like in the game was the level of the Russian boat, it was a lot of pressure. Generally I love the game!
