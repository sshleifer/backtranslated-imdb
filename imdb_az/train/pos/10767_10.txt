Of course, from 10 to 10 of my film, my uncle would be able to present as a genuine scenario writer. Rodolfo Sonego wrote scenarios for over 50 years in Italy. He was a great story, and suggested that someone put their stories down. Rodolfo Sonego did it. If you look at his biography, you can see the number of films in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my hometown in 1968 to check out places for "a girl in Australia" and create a great movie about the proxy bride after the Second World War. You can see his humor in all films. Recently, I found a copy of this movie on the DVD. GREAT
