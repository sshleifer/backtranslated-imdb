Branagh and Fishburne present excellent performances in this version of Shakespeare classic. Branches play better than the character they are playing in the movie or on the stage. Some movies may say that this movie is very yoga-oriented, but I do not agree. Fishburne, the first black othello in the history of the film, ironically, provides a strong performance. Fishburne has always been a good player, but this performance like Venice's Moor may be the best. <br /> <br /> One problem with this film is a simple collection of some important scenes. Desdemona's character is less deeper than the game. It should not be added in this movie. One of the worst people ever created by Branag was a conversation about the beginning of a bilateral meeting between Iago and Desdemona. This part of the game may not be the innocent child Desdemona described in this film. There was a series of subtraction that could damage the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> But if you do not read the game, or if you first see the Othello movie version, I'm coming to this movie. Story is incredibly admired, whether it's cut or not. Moving as we have said before, is very good. If some important scenes are added and Desdemona's character is a little too big, this will be a great movie. It's still an original version of the stands that stands. I give it a marginal recommendation.
