I recently watched this movie, lazy Sunday afternoon, with some friends and we have a lot of fun! This movie is a trash can. Try to watch it for this purpose! Of course, it was unexpected, but the performance given by actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely fine), poor scripts and low-cost budgets have created incredible flaws. Tomba retired from the Alpine Skiing Championships where he was a technical skier at the end of the 1980s and late 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two World Championships and nine World Cup titles. Seriously about the director: No one knows why Damiano Damiani signed the film. All other Damiani directions are important.
