Peter Ustinov is only a compulsory player when he starts filming. As soon as he leaves his doors, he immediately starts working on a scheme and prepares a bunch of theft once again, although this time his places are quite high. This is actually one of the weakest points on the film, because it does not know anything about computers (returning back in 1968), but it's capable of becoming a full-fledged genius overnight! Yes, it's true. In any case, it comes with a scheme to imitate a computer expert and work with a large American corporation, resulting in one ton of cash. Given his knowledge of computers, he is surprised to learn how to apply a brilliant plan and infiltrate the computer system and its defenders. But this is a movie, so I succeeded in stopping the blasphemy. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) are able to run a million pounds. However, at the end of the day, it was a lot of confusion, and Smith was able to actually invest more than two million dollars by investing in companies that Ustinov started. (although they were all the companies). This ultimately means that these shares are worthless. They (and here I can think wrong) can say that Ustinov and his new partners quickly dumped the information in shares and the shares would then be worthless. In any way, the film looks like a magic ending, it does not hurt anyone and everyone is happy, and it just did not mean much. In fact, most of the writing was moving. Carl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just amazing. <br /> <br /> As for the latter details, let me know that the film is over at the end.
