First, I would like to say that I know about my star wars and I'm not fanatical. do not know a Wamp Rat couple chromosome or TK427 expanded family. This is what I know: Star Wars captured all the movies (though the episode 2), something magical. It is difficult to say what Lucas found and bravely bothered, but he works. Star Wars is more than a movie. is an idea. <br /> <br /> What can you ask? I will explain. star wars are the best stereotypes, good and bad touches. above all, we can understand any person from any environment. The Episode VI dramatically improves the epic struggle between his son and his manipulated father, and the story of a precedent adds more sign. suddenly there is Darth Vader on the front and the audience understands that this is Anakin's story, not just Luke. but before 1-3, there was a good depth for all of these. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is definitely something above normal, and I must admit that it's a capsule of Lucas's era, and when I see them, I feel particularly small. I entered into a world where the good and the evil are clearly defined. When I see them, I get a feeling of darkness, something more than anything that can be hoped for by a physical person.
