This is the best movie I have ever met. Not just that kind of movie (school filming), it was nice that I decided to film Ben Coccio (director). He has also shot a film using young people who are still in high school. He pulled the players in their rooms and actors used their true parents as their parents in the movie. Also, actors pulled video cameras that seemed to be a lot of video footage. But this is almost silly (though this is really a word) There are a few slips, but for example, a rover of rover in a series of Cal brads (?), (Or ​​vice versa, because I saw a bit)
