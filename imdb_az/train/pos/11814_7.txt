Usually, when we use the word "escapist", I think it's negative; Warren Beatty's big-screen version of Dick Tracy proves that "escapist" can be good. This is really a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Beatty creates a detective with everything: ready for action, but without weakness. <br /> <br /> The remaining characters are almost a world for themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as expecting any criminals to be herbs; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is probably the most striking person ever imagined; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is a moderate boredom: ruthless but cool. Among other faces are Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), a multilingual 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates are also stars. <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. I have not even explained the plan! The field is being tested by Tracy - and so far you can find a way to Big Boy - failure. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie is that it's fun. Although there are many striking events in the city, If Warren Beatty is having difficulty with his age, then he's been using it well. "Dick Tracy" is a cool movie.
