I always say people are not a "Enchanted April" adult film, no cussing, sex or violence. One might think of "the last strawberry bite," but there are some or two obvious men who like it too. Do not invite children. <br /> <br /> "Magic April" is a very healing experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> "Saturday Night Live" I will describe one line and I will say that my two favorite films are "The Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
