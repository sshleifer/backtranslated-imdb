The second part of Hit Danish television series (true episode 4-8) is a bit lower than the first, but very laughing and scared. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts as a monster baby and his father, Satan. On the other hand, this time Søren Pilmark's doctor Krogşoyu, Dr. Helmer's terrible revenge, and again, Mrs. Drusse, tries to solve the mysteries of the Miss Marple style. After the death of leading actor Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Ms Drusse), you are surprised at how you can do the 3rd episode, but Von Trier is a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, Down Syndrome Dishwasher # 2, died shortly afterwards. Search Stellan Skarsgard in a community. ***
