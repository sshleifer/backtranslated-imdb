The film was a success for the low budget project. The story is interesting and the actors are convincing. Eva Longoria, now on TV show Dragnet, is more sexy than ever. The places were ideal for the area and the director showed his talent by taking many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget movie can use more special effects for better correction transitions and weapons scenes, but the music continues to move this script. Although this film has a share of problems like sustainability, I have to say that I'll rent the next movie of the director. If you have a student, you can learn a few things from the director's statement.
