Eddie Robinson's 101th film and the end, and nine days after his death, he died of cancer. <br /> <br /> Although some hairstyles and costumes are a little dated (watch the video game shown in the film), but the subject is really inevitable. <br /> <br /> Heston said he wanted to shoot the movie for some time. Because he really believed in the dangers of the population. <br /> <br /> Several things make this movie classic. <br /> <br /> Dear Cotten and Peters, both are beautiful interactions between Heston and Robinson. <br /> <br /> Music is absolutely perfect. . The combination of Bethoven, Griegin and Tchaikovsky combined with idyllic visual elements creates some really moving scenes. <br /> <br /> The subject of the movie (or "point") is a significant event. Yes, this is a very populous film, but in a more significant note, there is a clever tale that man can go wrong with the Earth's rulership. There is a subtitle you found in the movie's actual message. Let's talk about the "old days" of the past (which is today), and note that Tornun can not understand what Solin says. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorite films of all time.
