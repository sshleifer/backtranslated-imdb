This work draws attention to the correct picture of teenage life during its execution. Although this was a generalized summarization, parents were often drawn to become real parents, and homesickers worried about the real problems facing their children. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us how to go, though painful, and this leads us to a sweet, melancholic but informative style that talks about Foster's feelings of the pain of philosophical life. I liked that scene. In fact, it was my favorite scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> The transition from the wedding to the wedding was intended to show that life is going on and we should. <br /> <br /> Baio's scoop walked through a bunch and dumped them out to show that they were going through a troubled period, and we were planning to spend a bit more time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I love this movie, though I often do not watch it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This should not be considered by young children, and maybe they want to be lifted in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10.
