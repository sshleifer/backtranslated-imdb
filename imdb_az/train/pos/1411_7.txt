Greetings from the darkness again. Stunning photography emphasizes this Disney documentary and gives some insight into the stiffness of some of the wildlife living in the desert. For those who are over 40 years old, we have looked at wild animals since my childhood, when there is no channel dedicated to Disney and the Omaha Wildlife Interaction, National Geography, or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What is always admired shows how difficult it is for most of these glorious creatures. The elephants have been watching for days long, and they are nearly overwhelmed with water deficiency. <br /> <br /> Some underwater shots are breathtaking. Mom and baby screams are beautiful and watch all kinds of big white shark attacks, like the "jaws" of her predators. The most beautiful scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the Himalayas. <br /> <br /> Some young people do not think they are so excited today, but of course, they are one of the best documentary films. i saw
