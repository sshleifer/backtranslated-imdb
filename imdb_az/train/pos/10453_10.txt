While traveling by train in Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) know each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning Jesse returns to the United States and Celine in Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romances "before the sun" is one of the really coolest stories I've ever seen. It's a low budget movie with a very simple and real story, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is stunning and dialogues are striking. Direction Celine and Jesse are good to watch. I was reviewing my 1,000 number in IMDb and I would choose this many "before the sun" because it's a very special movie for me. Why this film is not an Oscara nominee, it is not understood by such a spectacular scenario, direction and performance. Yesterday, probably, I was watching this movie for the third or fourth time, and still love it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">
