I remember seeing it on television in the late 70s - it was with me! This attractive, high, colorful - a great kid's movie. <br /> <br /> Recently, we joined a party and put it on some layers - of course, I was crazy and thought that the puppets "respond to the illnesses." <br /> If you like banana splitting and you're 30 years old, it will be re-created during your childhood. VIDEO! <br /> <br /> Even though I realize now that Puf was a bit wrapped up - all his work was captured and escaped! Quality TV movie - like me, if you enter the death metal, I love it!
