Judy Davis tells us why one of Australia's most respected and loved actors is here - the description of the individual, oriented displacement is first degree. Claudia Caravan, a teenager, gives us something to combine with future roles in BIG STEAL, THE HEART BREAK KID, DREAM, RISK, and the popular television series, one of the country's most popular actors in the years to come. THE SECRET US LIFE. (In the meantime, Caravan, like a child, Panda was a young girl stolen from a chemist's store in GOING DOWN by Tracey Mann in 1983). If these movies come to you, make sure you see it! Rating: 79/100. Also see: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANT POSSESSION, LANTANA.
