I was expecting something different: more passion, drama ... Again, another failure of attempts of self-identification. I'm sorry for the movie's falling into the old clich√© of "cheesiness." 15-year-old teens can appreciate it though. is not very convincing and the absence of any reason is common lines. The movie soundtrack is still good and well adapted. People watch it but can not say that the film is a flop because they do not meet public expectations. To keep you up to date, it's about an hour and a half to keep you in front of the TV. This is also important.
