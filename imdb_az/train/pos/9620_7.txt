Now there are many Hollywood films that are not tortured to watch, but also have no effect on anyone's lives. If we offer, films are not always of a deep meaning, but there are those who take care of the story of "human" stories. I will not give the start of this sparkling movie, but the scenario is one of the more complicated and memorable I've ever seen in my life, and I'm a 32-year-old movie! Bug is among the top ten in my list: Sufront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, just a few names. This "action" movie should also be one of your favorites, if you have a heart!
