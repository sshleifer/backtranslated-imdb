The film was foggy in Romania in 18 days, with a very tough budget, although the main story would take place in Morocco. But their cards can be broken, and the actors and crew play with them with great skill and commitment, and eventually I find both touch and elegance. Nicholas Coaster-Waldou presents a strange performance as a bad man. The scenario and management give some stones. You will not want the movie, but it will probably depend on your lead role in Alexandra Staden. Other reviewers have described Stade's inadequacy as Modesty Blaise. They may have a point, but I like his interpretation and have seen it very well. Fashion, discipline, native talent and courage try to overcome the terrible possibilities. Staden looks the same way.
