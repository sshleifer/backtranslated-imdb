Moonwalker is a true adventure film for the whole family by Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> Before starting the film's true story, we get a performance from the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror) and begins a great movie. From then on we get a kind of collage with Michael Carrier as Moonwalker came out until 1988. After a few Music Videos, the story begins (Speed ​​Demon, Just Me, and so on). <br /> <br /> The suicide is largely followed by Michael and his three friends (the children) are being persecuted by Mr. Big, the bad guy of the story, because they have been buying drugs all over the world and discovering their evil plans to buy children. During the exploration we see fantastic segments, fx. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Mikaels, Smooth Crime video, with a totally fantastic sequence dance and so on. But then one of the kids get kidnapped by Mr. Big and Michael, /> The film is not only beautiful for today, but we also see the special effects that are effective today. For example, look at a robot / spaceship to protect Michael's friends! <br /> <br /> The film ends with the performance "Coming Together" (later published by HIStory's Michaels double album) and releases the movie with a magical feeling. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I offer this to every family who wants to have a nice night together with a candy and pop-up kitchen in front of the TV. Now some parents say: "But Michael Jackson is a child alleged child!" Yes, he really is, but come, we all know that this is not true! Look and see ..
