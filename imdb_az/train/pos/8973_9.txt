<br /> <br /> When I was a young boy on a Canadian TV channel for Trnka Bratislav Pojar, I saw this movie (thanks to the Canadian Channel Broadcast Corporation) the best animators of the National Film Council. Pozar, in turn, was a teacher and colleague for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka, you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> Symbolism is clear, but it does not. Beauty and life opposition (plant) are put in opposition by the secrecy of the gloves. The rich puppet hero, despite the absence of political agenda condemns. <br /> <br /> I remembered most of all that it was a kind of oppression. The small space in which the action took place is the whole world of the character. Ali's occupation is a complete violation of the world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and angry movie. I found Trnka a copy of this and other beautiful shorts in the public library and showed it to the kids myself. A must see.
