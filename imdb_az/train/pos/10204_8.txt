<br /> <br /> Although I'm never the best Anime I've ever seen, I enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I have never read a comic book and saw it at the video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was okay, and I got an 80 anime feeling that I put on for me. <br /> <br /> Character development was good. I love the way I brought Lady to the Death Pass. He did not pay attention to those who did not love you. <br /> <br /> Klimmer was a good trainer / soldier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone can say about everyone's favorite anime Vampire Hunter D,
