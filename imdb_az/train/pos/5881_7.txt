This movie was a fantastic comedy. Rimi Sen was good at playing with Akshay Kumars' wife and all air hostesses were: Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. Two fashion photographers like Mrs. Maggie (Neha Dupia), Mr Serge, like Mr. Hot (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) as Mac. When John Abraham betrayed his work, he became the head of Akshay Kumars and Akshay Kumar was really jealous because he would be given to John Abraham, and Neha Dupia would love John more. Akshay Kumar wants John to be better than Abraham, and she finds a flat and comes out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
