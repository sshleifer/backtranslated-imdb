Was Al Pacino in a bad movie? His name appears as an impromptu for the top gravel cinema. This is a good performance as it is. Pacino American Olivier. It's a good political tension like that. There are no good guys and bad guys. But the system has an ineffective effect on people who think it is. Only Pacino's performance is not compelling - what happened in the dead funeral of the dead is extremely powerful - there is a strong realism that enhances the speed of the movie and enhances its performance without gymmies. This prominent portrait of the great city politics is also ready to watch a two-hour movie without the need for extraordinary violence, excessive sex or language. There is a crime. There are bad guys. However, they are effectively encountered without crossing the line. Such a film restores my beloved faith in Hollywood. I do not reward more than ten people. It is very rich!
