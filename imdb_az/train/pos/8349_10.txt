Depardieu's most popular movie (1974) is Bertrand Blier. Jules and Jim's are two very talented French hippies (Depardieu and Deware) to manage a trois, Jeanne Moreau is one of the many high-sex scenes giving an X-rating with a version of the 1970s. There is nothing like a sacred land in this movie; Everything is a fair game. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that Americans do not like this movie very much, but many French people think of it as classic. <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two slut rifles who have been subjected to many sexual offenses, cunning executions, wandering around cunning women and committing minor offenses. . They start out and implement the anti-capitalist, euro-commie, slacker 's freedom. Blier sells these two boys' paradises, but the bourgeois society itself may seem extremely laughable. The best of all is to show that the beautiful Stephane Grappelli account is a terrifying spirit of drifters, a deeper subconscious consciousness or a "higher ideal."
