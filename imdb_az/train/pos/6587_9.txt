Master Blackmailer, based on a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "Charles Augustus Milverton Adventures," is the story of the first length Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett I've ever seen. The story is interesting and dark. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holms and Dr. Watson tried to uncover the identity of a betrayal. The looters who destroyed some of Britain's most prominent families have, in one or more ways, disseminated special messages. Finally, after several disastrous consequences of self-sacrificing victims, Charles Augustus Milverton knows that he is a "merchant of art." Our heroes should then help Lady Eva Blackwell, who will have to pay an extra sum or her future marriage will be most definitely thrown out. The incident that Holmes and Watson Milverton's house stolen are tense. Though the film is basically a happy end, the tone is repentant and sad. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Bret and Edward Hardwicke (as always) and Robert Hardy's prominent performances as Cornelius Fudge with Harry Potter today), Serena Gordon Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West Lady Swinstead and Sophie Agatha like Thomson (his and Holmes-related scenes are an upgrade). Give me a *** 1/2 *****. My only complaint is no, no, no. (I would add that at the end of the short story, he would add a description of two thieves, one of them faces Watson.)
