In 1988, I watched the PBS presentation in the United States when released (?). If DVDs had miniseries, last year I bought the first editions of all three books. Since then, I've been watching the series on internet movie sites. Today I found this web site. <br /> <br /> I would also like to buy this full - 26 episodes - miniseries. After reading DVDs I would watch the episodes of the book after buying a DVD. This is what John LeCarre's Carla trilogy and Larry McMurty's do with the Texas Ranger trilogy. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any good TV program or movie series for a great book or book series now? Is there a DVD?
