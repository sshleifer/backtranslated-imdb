I do not consider myself to be a great admirer of fairy tales; Stardust was interested in me as Michelle Pfeifferi was one of the refugees (especially I would see him as Hairspray's teacher, Velma Von Tussle). With the ugly makeup of the head, the head and the end, it is very convincing here as a magician! Robert De Niro is as big as a pirate captain who is forced to hide in the "secret" place to protect his "glory"! All actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and others do great work here. Although Danes and Pfeiffer have classic beauty, Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (like Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan are also striking faces especially when they first met. Newcomer Charlie Cox was as beautiful as the lead Tristan and he looked like a young man Dunstan as a young man, and I thought it was early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many of the comments were compared to this Princess Bride and I see some similarities, the main difference was that PB was always an imaginary fairy tale as it told an older man's grandson. Stardust believes that what you see and hear can happen even with all the amazing things that actually happen. So, I would highly recommend Stardust in the note.
