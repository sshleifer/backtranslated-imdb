This is one of those films when you wake up next morning. <br /> <br /> Of course, we talk about typical stereotypes and stories, but this is a trick: Entertainment. <br /> <br /> How funny it is to come out of Sweden and live in the United States for a while now. "The deadly husband will kill him", "He will go to die (Gabriella), and there will be a heart deficit greater than the next life." We know how they work, and everything comes together at the end.

Maybe a little too nice. <br /> <br /> But most of the film feels like this, and this is the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, hate and define. I do not tell you guys, but it does not happen often.
