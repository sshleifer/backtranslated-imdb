A few years ago she was released on a DVD in France - I wish she would be re-released with English subtitles. Do not confuse by making a mistake with Penelope Cruz. Gerard Phillippe is a villager given by a praise to be married to the king's daughter. He will join the army and go to war. His love is an early film for Gina Lollabrigida. I'm going to spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later.
