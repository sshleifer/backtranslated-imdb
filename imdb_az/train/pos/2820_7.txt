This movie should be watched properly. First, the mother-to-child relationship film is designed as a prequel, not Wong Fei Hung's "Drunken Master" (the film's repetitions are replicated in Drunken Master II) and "Young Master". Chan withdrew from this plan and changed the name of the characters, indicating that he was not convinced that he had come together financially, and in fact, the film was missing, for example, half of the half of the romantic relationships remained entirely dependent on the end of the movie "Young Master" but at least all the central ropes cling to each other. This film wrestled with the plot with Chan and <br /> <br /> Probably, the film is just a cautious one, which is an important turning point in Chan's career, , Because he is the only one to grow, above all the other central issues - so there is no kung fu throughout the film. Chan wants to make a romantic comedy of history, just kung fuun. But it is smaller than the historical element, as well as the elements of the romantic element. <br /> <br /> He's leaving us with comedy. Chan's discomfort is characteristic development, because the comedy has been characterized primarily by character - a dispute over a girl, like in the conflict between her character and her best friend. But there are many rifles. Certainly, I find the comedy fun enough to compensate for the lack of the plot. <br /> <br /> This film makes an effort to find an existing formula that Can be used and developed over time. It does not work, and after Chan left only the historical elements of the previous films, the Police Story would find this formula together with a modern action comedy. But to go back to see this movie, Chan is well aware of how he left and perhaps left the historical genre.
