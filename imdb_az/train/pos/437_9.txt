Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, conveying a message in a few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite movies ever since I went out. Although I'm more patient to appear on DVD, I keep going. As you can see, I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If the parent company is right on Amazon's lists, there are many people who want to name it in DVD format. Many people want to cast this and go to Italy with this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. The cast is magnificent, kinematography and direction is flawless. The film is a certain goalkeeper. Many have already asked. Please include the names in the list.
