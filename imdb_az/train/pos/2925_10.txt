eddie murphy, a woman from Eddie's audience stood up and said that one of the audience was answering. What is said, women - MR ROB DO (this is a character on a Saturday night), the guy responds with BUTCH BUTCH. Unlike the previous article, saying that women are shouting, this is wrong, saying there is post-erin, there is a hearing problem! Although DVDs really do hear DVD-DO MR ROB, they say DVDs do not have this DVD. I hope everyone in this exploits will win an exciting outburst !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
