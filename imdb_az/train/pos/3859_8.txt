Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most impressive works I've ever seen. It was a really pleasant surprise. The story is related to the bi-genre writer Jerard (Jeroen Krabbe) because he has been contacted by Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but the story might be more of a twisted mind of Gerard. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and intimate atmosphere full of surrealistic and heartwarming scenes, which really draws you on the story, you do not want to watch, but you can not turn yourself away. This is Verhoevé's best film (maybe just the second for Robocop). True The Fourth Man is not free for everyone, but some sex scenes are quite free (just do not see them, but if you trust me, you will be dedicated to at least ten minutes). <br /> <br /> <strong Hezbollah
