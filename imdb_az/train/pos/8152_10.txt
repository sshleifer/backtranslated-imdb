I just read the latest comments about this movie and would like to reply. we will probably not get acquainted with the true story of the rap group. In 1989, the group left in the ice cubes in 1989, and eventually, in 1991, when Dr.Dre left, the group was broken. <br /> <br /> This film was a funny confusion of 90 minutes. they were surprised that the bootie juice song was a political statement. it is impossible to say that it does not taste the "love song". </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ u> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ it is my opinion
