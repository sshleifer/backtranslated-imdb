Paul Verhoeven (genius and master film producer) is a "dirty old man type" in Hollow Mana, still less than fun. The first two moves are very good, so the slasher's last movement is frustrating. However, I recommend this movie for a couple of dance performances by promoted special effects (perhaps the best around) and the potential. Verhoev√©'s moral questions, of course, create provocation and, although many of the film's films are extinguished, this film is too soft for the former Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two major flaws: the entire deal with Josh Brolin (aka walking liquid) and Lift. If there were an entrance ladder, why were they trapped in the laboratory? <br /> <br /> An entertaining horror movie for Saturday night.
