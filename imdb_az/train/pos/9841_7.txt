I love cartoons. They can show 'true' actors and movies with scenes - computer effects are even more varied. They can push the line ("The Simpsons"), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples in the "Ice Age", for example, when they see a herd of mammals who have migrated in rural areas, chatting as old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, but at the same time we get a familiar and strange feeling, usually in a laughable way. Ice Age is not as good as the best cartoons of all time, it's really fun movie. <br /> <br /> Dear Manfred, esteemed mammoth, Sid, a quarrel with a charity, and Diego a sabretooth tiger, the human baby returned to his people - for a very different reason. On the way, naturally, there are many problems. Scrat along the journey, as well as the most undesirable vessel in history, is desperately trying to throw a pelican for winter: in the iceberg, on the dead trees, in the ice squares. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and looks good. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <strong> br /> 7/10
