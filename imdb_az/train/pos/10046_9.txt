I was afraid to watch this movie for a long time. Even before I was released, I denied him as a very extravagant, blurred, overly romantic Hollywood schmaltz, and I did not want to do anything at all. I never saw it in theater. I do not believe in the 11th Academy Award - I was shocked, though never before. Then he wanted to become a judge in a public speaking race. One of the girls talked about this movie. "That was so great," he said. "You really felt like you were in the boat." "Nonsense," I thought. I shared my feelings with my friends. Someone looked at me and said, "You can be right, but if he liked the movie very much, maybe he wanted to learn more about the real Titanic, and the film did something so interesting." "Maybe, maybe," I thought. Finally, it appeared on Pay TV. "Okay," I thought, "I'll take a look at it." I did not want to love it - I did not. I loved it! <br /> <br /> What should I start? The first is leadership. The high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a great job of creating an almost "existent" atmosphere. The happiness of life on the most delicate ships in the world. Uncertainty as the news of Aysberg'e spreads first; then rising in the sense of panic. Just do not watch it; you really feel it. Then - speeches. Leading performances by Kate Winslet (like Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack) are very good - I thought Winslet was superior, but both were good. They thought they were a rich girl / poor boy characters, a perfect "t". In my opinion, it was Frances Fisher, the mother of Gul, to steal this show. He was perfect as a snobby aristocrat, and he could feel the fear and hate he felt every time he looked at Jack. Then - details. I do not have any experts on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a general knowledge and this movie is doing a superb job to straighten the history details and then direct it around the so-called romanticism. Very impressive, really. Then - a song. Who can watch this movie, and Celine Dion will not be filmed with "My Heart Towards Him". <br /> <br /> Problems. Yes, romanticism was perhaps flawless, and I do not think that Jack could be so confused with the first class. (I know it was invitations for the first time, but it continued to enter the first class without stopping for a while.) The facts of the separation of public classes were more realistic, and I thought that when the ship was hit by the iceberg, steering passengers would lock here, and the people enjoyed half the empty sparrows. <br /> <br /> Even though it's a small word. This is really a great movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
