I have lived in those times and I think the program has taken the time. I think that he is more interested in the Afro-American issue, but there are many things in the program. He was afraid to tell them that he would not go to the family home and not to be burned at the T. V disorders. I thought Jerry O'Connell was a great job describing a returning war veteran. I went back to school with children. Some have changed much more than others, and others are not. Someone is disturbed when you do not have enough issues or do not have enough entertainment. Live it and then comment on it. I thought the movie was great and everyone inside had done a remarkable job. Thanks for a memorable journey of lane (sad and good).
