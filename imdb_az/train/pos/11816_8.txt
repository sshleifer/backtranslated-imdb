It was very entertaining! I have never read this Chester-Gould novel, but I do not know. Maybe there were some jokes in it, I realized, but it was upset not to see the heart of the eye. This is such an ironic, colorful movie, and all actors respect each other. The setting is like the Batman movie, but it's not as dark or gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there's something (it's not open) and there's more or less surprising ending. <br /> <br /> You can play an interesting game with this movie watching with your friends. Do not look at the credits at the outset and look for the fastest ones to find out who the famous actors are under their makeup!
