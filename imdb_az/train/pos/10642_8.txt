I was waiting for arrest yesterday evening and loved what I saw. It was a cool fun movie. It looked pretty good on this movie compared to its other recent films at Delph Bike.He also has a beautiful shape. Now it's a pretty good shape. The story was ok and other actors were also passable <br /> <br /> I would not call this movie the best, but still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But this has also been a problem. First, the bullet blew everywhere, and even when the targets were thrown to the point where they had been abducted. They showed a ppl that escaped bullets in a better way. Another problem with me was the students drank. I do not know in which school teachers can swear in front of teachers and even in class. The third problem was the number of bad guys. Worse people were supposed to be. The last problem is a certain aspect of the gang looking at cheese, but it was dependent on small budgeting. In general, the film is a good movie. I loved it. I recommend watching others. P.S. Now he beat the DEAD police. (Some liners were also cool) <br /> <br />
