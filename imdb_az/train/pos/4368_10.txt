It's a very interesting and romantic movie. I have seen it several times and have never been bored with it. Everything is realistic and a good plot. The alliances are perfect by Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie Braveheart. There are many exciting scenes - see the Scen scene and the latest fencing scene. These are really good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> Music is beautiful ... This movie is really compatible. The setting is incredible.
