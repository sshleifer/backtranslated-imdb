De Palma's technique, unfortunately, has been a great demonstration of his classic technique, as well as many films written by De Palma, the story of a film that emotionally compels a talisman. <br /> <br /> The story opens with a CRAZY scene where Angie Dickton's husband looks at her husband in a shower. When he later disappears, he is captured and exposed to aggression, and it turns out that everything is Angie's dreams because he lies in bed while lying in bed. There is a short scene with her son, a deadly call to Harry Potter. He results in a joke "he will tell his grandmother that he plays with his peter". Later his therapist went to the therapy session where he complained about his dead marriage before attempting to deceive Michael Caine. He refuses and feels hurt and feel, and has not been fulfilled. <br /> <br /> Then bravura starts with an almost no-nonsense 22 minute, perhaps the purpose of the film. Among many things from Hiccock, De Palma is the concept of the film as an only visual tool for telling stories? and with the typical De Palma fashion, she turns a way to show this gigantic skill. The problem is for me, in this case, that the scenes simply begin to feel as if they are moving away to demonstrate the director's abilities. <br /> <br /> Sequence starts with Angie in an art museum. He is watching his or her side, engaging in sex or family activities, and then joining a man sitting next to him. De Palma explains a very complicated story without mentioning Angie's involvement, embarrassment, retreat, and finally a staggering account of Pino Donaggio's strange find and behind a taxi boat. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence, Angie slept with the boy and rose to return to her husband. Again, De Palma, Angie, lost her face, as she understood that she was not her panties and that her husband had already been at home and wondered where she was likely to be infected with a poisonous illness. Everything is very strange, but a little bit. Because we have to do things like going up a seven-story elevator, and then again in almost real-time. The spoilers here! When Angie reaches the seventh floor, she is killed by a large blonde woman. When the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there, she pulls her away until she reaches the basement. When Nancy reached the elevator, there is a nice slow-moving sequence, Angie reaches him and the knife's knife is prepared to knock Nancy's hands. As seen, Nancy is watching a charming shooting and killing the lifts on the iron mirror. It's all right, and after a while we have a dialogue again, you think; "Woah, it's just a 22-minute visual narrative!" <br /> <br /> Or, no, but I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> Young Dennis Franz is a big part of a small and harsh New York detector who does not want anyone to do his job. He interviewed Michael Caine, who had an ugly effect, even though he wanted to kill Angie (though he had done it in the ordinary way). Angie's son also got in touch with Nancy and they began to spy Caine's therapist and find out who the murderer was. <br /> Once a Hitchcock film has a strong garden, Psycho (Obsession Vertigo re-runs) in this case. There is a woman we understand is a secret prostitute, she is killed in a closed space in the first 30 minutes, in which case there is a lift instead of a shower. The relatives of the deceased are conducting a study showing that they are dressed as a woman to kill a murderer. De Palma puts a doctor who explains everything psychology. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting, but at the same time it may feel a bit shaken around a viewer, and this is my first movie. Some of De Palma's biggest setpieces look and show, but the story feels that De Palma is still a third of the show to show, and his slightly flawless fantasy fantasy makes it difficult to come back. <br /> <br /> On my website, see bad and cheeky movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com.
