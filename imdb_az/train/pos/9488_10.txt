Henri Verneuil, one of the true geniuses of the French cinema, is a very memorable, intelligent and suspense film. The plot is parallel to the JFK assassination and occurs in a non-descriptive, fictional country. The film is slim and sly. Procuror Henri Volnay, who takes it to the finish line with a sensitivity, follows. In many ways, this is a very troubling movie, at least for the cold and analytical accuracy of the commentary on the domestic affairs of the so-called modern state. Atmosphere and character are absolutely convincing, and Verneuil has left nothing in its dense structure. At a different level, this relatively little-known film has just started the 15-year-old Oliver Stone, which is famous for its low-credibility film, in just a few areas of the "JFK" movie ... <br /> <br /> This is a masterpiece The work of any movie lover should be seen in the original French version.
