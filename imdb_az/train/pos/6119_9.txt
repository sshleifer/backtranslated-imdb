Okay, but straight straight. Not bad for horror / comedy movie. People were reading about how Michael changed his version, and this is a good game in my opinion, because some adults hate horror and when they see it, they may be interested in such films, or maybe (never seen) comedy Sam (unlikely to comedy) I have to rent or buy a movie, but 2 is better, but I purchased this one at the Amazon VHS and received it on Thanksgiving Day on November 21th. Four dollars worth, l.o.l. in this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
