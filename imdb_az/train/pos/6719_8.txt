I love this movie because it is a cinema art and it's a wonderful work done by people who care enough to make home movies. Super-surfer draws amateur videos from Greg Noll's home movies and others dedicated for 50 years passion. Nevertheless, it has expanded to aesthetic fame. It is full of art talent and athletic talent, but you can think of surfing as athletic. Surfer is not astronaut and pilot. What surgeons (maybe), or Ph.D. (maybe). Surfer believes in quest. Believes in the beauty of man's thirst. It believes in the great threat of peace from the cessation of war. Surfers marks the end of the war on the north coast of Hawaiian Island, which has been attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. It celebrates with the efforts of a country struggling with the Cold War - with Russian socialists - instead of a hot war. Surfing is the latest ladder. Dangerous, but just a bit of history. I doubt that Iskander will not be celebrated by surfing. He had to go out and conquer a few countries in order to obtain a favorable press. There is no military hero in this movie. No weapons. There is a beer stand and a surfboard shop just to conquer the beach surfers. This is not a problem. Peace is not hopeless. This is the joy of exhalation.
