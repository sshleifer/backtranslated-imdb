This movie has a special place in my heart, when I first caught up with adult literacy. It was a very realistic thing to me and even a great student I had ever seen. There are scenes that give you a smile on your face with accurate description of the ones that are full of emotions and the characters and their situations. <br /> <br /> The perfect performance by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, a great ranking by a young Martha Plimpton, the best job, an exciting storyline and thrilling musician, is the most enjoyable experience.
