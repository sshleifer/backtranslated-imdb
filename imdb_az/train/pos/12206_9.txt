One of the movies in the 1940s and 1950s has to be ranked as one of the most surprising and fun to watch. I'm saying four major actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but it was the last two which made this movie very entertaining for me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the most delicate people I've ever seen. Some of his voice and what he says should be heard to believe. Slaone is not in the "strange" category. Hayworth, short, is not glamorous with blonde hair, but still means Hayworth, that is, a lot to be a man. Welles' charming as always. One tip: If you have a DVD, open English subtitles. In this movie, you need subtitles to understand her character Irish and everything she says. Welles also directed the movie, meaning you have great camera angles and nice facial closeups. You also have the ability to see a shot at home in the mirrors. Great things! As I was strangely in this movie, I still thought that the atmosphere of the carnival was mixed up in the close court process and took the scene seriously. In addition, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is a great entertainment, the name of the game.
