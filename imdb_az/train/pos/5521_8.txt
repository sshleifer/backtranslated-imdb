Immediately after leaving the part of the story, the second half explains the inevitable loss of human legacy and the most terrible part. Unlike the first feature, the second is that Che passes from the pride and glory of a revolutionary country to Che, the savior of a country without past ties. Change of setting is not only aesthetic; the tone and the heart change from the fall and summer grays of the forest lands to the optimism of the seed, replacing it with a fierce, cunning and ridiculous reality. But, like Che, he wanted to say that it was a struggle that was the best way of fighting. In Part One, of course, when the revolutionary guerrilla is only the first wave of power gained in this way, Part 2 takes a much nicer, weak and painful part of China's life and longing, and it creates a troublesome and tragic idea <br / > <br /> In some cases, the sound of the film is different and differs from the first part, but a month ago the same documentary approach is still melodrama and fitting as far as possible. A slightly distant, cold approach to explaining Che's story and struggle will undoubtedly close some viewers; in fact, I still maintain that a feature is a person's name, and if anything, Che, as a whole, gives a story just beyond the biography and, instead, a human being who fights him on the road. Soderbergh Hirschbiegel does not try to portray a sensitive portrait of what he does with Der Untergang half a decade ago (instead of irony contrast); <br /> <br /> A slow, moving, and meditative approach to describe a history lesson that is probably narrated by a person who performs all things. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the landscape of Cuba and the return of the ugly, collapsing backdrop for two parts of Bolivia, in contrast, make the opposite to the contrary, in contrast to its predecessor, but enough to give its own reference points. Here the main structure of the first section is back. The first fight, battles, fallen comrades and those who have come to take their place, but we see some of the people behind the movement. However, as part of the character can be understood by everyone who is the most delicate idea of ​​true history, Part II is going to end up with a much more groundless and nonsensical note. This difference, combined with the similarities to the First Part, is an attractive and memorable whole; <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Undoubtedly, something that treats a portion before a part is still where a slow building from a central find is still clear from the realistic performances of realistic structured combat scenes. but also indefinite and indefinite, but with such a feature, the second part proves once again that avoiding such elements does not harm a film and should be reflected in other elements to ensure that the spectrum is engaged. In fact, when I wrote this review, I would have thought that I had a direct look to add or review a paragraph or two at the first look of the Paragraph, but it would be merely to serve it <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Even though I'm working, at least every one of the two segments I can only confirm that the section can do so. Contrary to the picture, a complicated scenario is extremely attractive and rewarding as the Che Part II predecessor, with fairly spectacular photography and fairy-tale characters, with unobserved indicators, but this time tragic, but heartfelt, - Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net).
