When I first watched "Gray Gardens" a few years ago, I remember laughing and found a sad prison. A few years later, I still laugh with a loud voice, but after a few visits, I came to see the beauty of the strange, wrapped relationship between the "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. <br /> <br /> His mother and daughter add a new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic", living together with a 28-room East Hampton cottage. The lady and Jackie O., the only hospitable cats, raccoons, and opossums, filmmakers, Albert and David Mayslillers, entered their homes to bring their lives up. As a result, there is a cheerful, beautiful, sad and moving account of true love and anarchy. <br /> <br /> Relationships with big and small Edie are a sign of unbreakable love. An example of the driving, determination and freedom of their lives. The lyrics of this movie are more than recommended. <br /> <br /> It is a rare experience you have to see yourself. <br /> <br />
