Austen's films have become more popular than ever since the 1990s, and even more like the "Hebrew", which is translated into Austrian. I had seen two previous versions before seeing this Emma, ​​but Emma seemed more mistaken, like Lady Thazle, and in the other, she seemed to be a nasty mischief, so she seemed to be a potential prosecutor, where she looked right, young, and foolish and stubborn. In general, the attitude and atmosphere of production conveyed the novel's appeal in a very good way. Indeed, it's one of the sweetest, tasteful things I've ever seen, but in the nature of a Christmas treat. The scenario is unusually well developed, and Harriet's add-ons, such as a light bulb transmitting Emily to the church, are intact. Mark Strong, as Knightley, is not what I expect, but I liked it: Unlike Emma's manifestations, he is straightforward, practical, and the devious errors against Frank Churchill are very funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of almost Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton, as Emma's protégé, is gentle and full of it. It is noteworthy that the same producers, in some cases, rarely believed in the possible combination of symbols such as "Pride and Prejudice". For me, this product has been a pleasure and remains.
