Since I watched for the first time, "Piedras" is one of my favorite pictures and several pictures I can watch over and over again. The great scenario reflects a deep understanding and sensitivity of a group of women (all of them directly). Ramon Salazar signed a film for the first time in directing and confirmed himself as the director of effective actors. <br /> <br /> Although all the speeches are good. All middle ladies (Najwa Nimri) are very good (Vicky Peña), but should be directed to the newcomer Mónica Cervera, who is convincingly convinced of his late daughter Antonia San Juan's late mother. Enrique Alcides, irresistibly attractive as the girl's male nurse, and Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself have beautiful little turns from Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> Piedras was beautifully written and filmed as I watched as I had not thought of it for days. I highly recommend this.
