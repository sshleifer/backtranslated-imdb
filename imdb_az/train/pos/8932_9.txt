The film is not stunning in the traditional sense. It does not offer some nice pictures. Instead, it is a visionary film. This forces the viewers to constantly work or imagine the context of different shots. It's easy to try something like that, but it's hard to succeed. The film refuses to use the genre of a genre to help those who are less than full spectators. Instead, the film touches one another in different genres. The plot to love the movie can take on the pleasure of this playfulness. Undoubtedly, 99% of North American viewers will not be able to get it. It is a film or philosophical message, or a symbolic structure, and so on. If you try to shorten your hype, you will not miss your time. None of these are available. The film just blends on these genres and others. The sole merger in the film is that Claire Denis coincided with each other. There is only a handful of what the cant has to do with the description of the art, that is, instead of just substituting the concepts under the concepts, enough to approach the creation itself. The film is usually easy to navigate and chooses a simple taste to understand what's happening. Most movies are not art. Most movies are not close to art. A movie, like this, is still enjoyable by many viewers, and whenever, it is a miracle. One of my negative ideas is that sometimes it is to buy the movie in various simple signs that are very simple. Tahiti's father-son narrative, although not fully understood, ends to make things clear and simple. This is very superior.
