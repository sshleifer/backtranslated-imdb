It was a little young for that, but I had to see it. Many people have mentioned that there are some excellent music, but no one is expecting a very rare appearance by Angel, but now it's a mostly unprecedented but very popular music piece. The trademark combines white suits with the "Foxes of the 20th Century", and it seems that they all go into the field of vision of the camera. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria's bands remain highlights, and no hair cut has ever been seen! Cherie Currie (former Runaways singer) here begins a short but outstanding career, and with Jodie Foster is incredibly memorable and the rest. (Topless 3-D scenes from Parasite and his UFO mark on the "Wave Length" watched us for some time). <br /> <br /> It is not a work, but a part of the era, due to all its excitement and surprise.
