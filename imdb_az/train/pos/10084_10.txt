This magnificent movie is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. I believe that I have never seen or imagined a Chinese, and I believe in the most realistic light seen in a movie in China in the 1930s. It is often heartbreaking that you see how difficult life is for characters, and still the story and the end are extremely happy. In this film you really see the depth and wisdom of human existence. Actors feel like you're really into a different world. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie at a fairly high level. As you can see, it can only change you forever.
