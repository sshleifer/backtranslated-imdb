Viewing movies is very funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After a few years of performing the duties of the 58-year-old Berlinale jury, "managerial emotions" and "emotional gangs" just give superiority over emotions <br /> <br /> No, to get the Yamadan Kebe. <br /> <br /> After the presentation, I was waiting for the public from the theater, men, women and reviewers. Of course, the director of the Berlinale cinema, firmly acknowledged that the cinema watchman was suddenly caught and cried to this unassumingly sensual experience of the three-month path. <br /> <br /> But I was really surprised that it came later. Despite the inactivity of the film, many reviewers chose not to accept their writing modestly and emotionally. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <p style = "text-align: justify; The Kabei story set up in Japan before the war, a writer around the family, and the imperial will to be described as "thoughtful crimes."

Everyone started crying with little or no inhibitions. /> <br /> "My word!" Thanksgiving in my breath. It seems to me that in the recent analysis, "Kabe" was more than a film about a family that was broken by an empire on the eve of the war. <br /> <br /> Now, one of the most common criticisms of the film was how we protected our hidden feelings from the nearest people. technically strong, no innovation. The reviewers think with their own words that it will happen. She knew that Yoji had fooled Yama for trying to touch a unique feature of humanity. He is a bad old game that is used in the Tora-san series and then in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After making the audience a narrative comfort zone, she turns us into an emotional story <br /> <br /> This is the most effective kinematic tool for me. But it is one who is deeply impressed by what's being discovered. <br /> <br /> Now, if only some of the reviewers are able to resist being clever, it's a piece of Kleenex that proves its effectiveness. because they forgot what the movie really was. Human feelings. Clean and simple.
