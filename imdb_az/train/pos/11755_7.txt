I like this movie very much, but the music of all the graduates is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The 1972 winning game graduated in 1972. But almost all music dances and so on. Starting in the 1950s and early 1960s. <br /> <br /> After joining my 30th high school, I can assure you that the last music will be merged and danced in a past secondary school. <br /> <br /> <strong> I understand the difficulty of finding music of the 1970s - we know how aggressive it is for musicians. But this was completely empty and filmmakers should be more careful. <br /> <br /> In the rest of this movie I thought I was very sad about these dance scenes.
