Loners is a comedy with all the elements you expect in modern Hollywood production. From the Bravo to the Czechs, their once powerful film industry seems to wake up from post-communist dreams. Over the last few years, it seems to be related to a part of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story consists of several sub-stories that are actually contradictory and overlapping, first of all, a collage of victories, children, desires ... Different situations that change from day to day and entertainment to career and obsessions through a group of urban youths, one to thirty years old. And that is hillarious. In fact, the whole movie theater (100 people in the small art gallery) really laughed at about 40-50 seconds in the movie. <br /> <br /> Although the main castle is very good (especially with the coming Macedonian star, Labina Mitevska, the role of an immigrant who is facing all the familiar challenges) <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> For Yiri Machacek, for an incredible description of Jakub, Deliver them! There are many things to offer.
