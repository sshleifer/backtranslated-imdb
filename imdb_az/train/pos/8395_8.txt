*** ALLEGATIONS *** *** ALLEGATIONS *** Undoubtedly, the best film, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, was created even by the magnificent scenario developed by Hanna Shigulla, a great performance. The film begins with Mariya (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch), as bombs continue to fall and were shipped with the days of Hermann's battle, and now Maria and her mother and sister have to win to survive. Maria decides to go to work as a dancer / prostitute in a club that serves American GI and meets a black soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and starts to see each other continuously. Maria has heard that her husband, Hermann, has lost his life in war, so Bill is a very serious thing. But one day, when they approached Bill, they saw Hermann at the door. He did not die and when it came into the room, a mess broke out, and Maria Billin broke a bottle at her head and she died. Hermann takes away his guilt and is sentenced to a long prison term, so he tells him that he can do something and bring it out. The war has ended, and Germany must be rebuilt and one day on the train, Maria gets acquainted with successful businessman Carl Oswald (Ivan Desny) in the textile industry and uses her charms to get her job done. Maria is committed to doing well and jumped off the corporate ladder and becomes Carl's lady. She says she will never marry her, but she is in love with her. <br /> <br /> Hermann leaves the prison, but after lock-up he will go to Canada to try and get everything Maria has done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One day Karl will die and Maria writes about everything with her will, and Maria gets her own home. Hermann finally comes home with his wife, and although they are married for a while, both are ready to get married. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> </ STRONG> to big lengths. The use of colors, like all Fassbinder films, is used in a very interesting way. After the film's opening, the tones are red and gray, the war represents a prey German, but when Maria starts to succeed, she turns into a bright, red and white color. The rebuilding of Germany's sounds is used as a background only, and the film focuses on Maria's exploits. Fassbinder wanted to remind us of the rebuilt voices, then the events in Germany. Hannah was never good at Shoghul and his performance is the key to the success of this film. With a small actress, this would be another interesting film, but with his powerful performance, she is making her movie elite. Schygulla shows that Maria is very decent and smart, but also uses beauty and femininity to get what she wants. He is not embarrassed and does not feel guilty about it, and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman selling her soul to save her life. Schygulla was not a candidate for the Academy Award, but had a great performance that could stop the time test. Fassbinder himself is a seller in the film and his mother, Lilo Pempeit Frau Ehkke. I've heard a lot about the end of the movie, and Maria should make deliberate gas. In the bathroom later, the wrist draws water and it looks sad. This is just speculation and please email me if you think I'm wrong. I think that Hermann is at home and she is very excited by her accident (do not forget to wear clothes for no reason). At that time, Hermann and Carl learned that he had been in love without his knowledge, and he thought that everything he did was nothing. The reason for the bath scene. So let home break up with an accident. But Fassbinder's reason for such a conclusion is that everyone who sells his soul has no business life. Fassbinder, surprised by the survivors, was incredibly passionate. According to her, Maria can not have both ways. Great movie.
