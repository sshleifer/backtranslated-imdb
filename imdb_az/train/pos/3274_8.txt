It just came about from time to time and, unfortunately, I still did not think it was one of 80 films. Others were Clownhouse driven by Victor Salva, fearing a film because of Salva's legal / sexual problems. Something else will be Cameron's Closet that I hit - not great, but the views I've seen are not as bad. The Paper House is worth your time and I think it's one of the coolest movies in the world that will stay in your brain for a very long time. I would like to say that I've seen it for 10 years, and I've been protesting something 6 months ago, to give it a break.
