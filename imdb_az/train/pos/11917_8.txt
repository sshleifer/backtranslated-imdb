Yes, a simple but inspiring movie archetype. When the whole mass of the stadium is lifted and the people lift their hands, it's cold when I see it. Just brilliant. Joseph is as beautiful as a single and sad child who has ever been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. She encourages her to interact with Danny Glover and believe in her magic, and the angels are funny and exciting. A very nice family movie - I agree - a very happy happy birthday. But hey, not really important, the film maintains its main quality by good players and inspirational themes.
