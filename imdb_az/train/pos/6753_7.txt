Otto Preminger's Noir classic works almost as a part of LAURA ... the film is strange and has a high noisy Clifton Webb, the film is a seamer. Dana Andrews is less than a good cop, who accidentally murdered a man, who, potentially, linked the father of her favorite girl. The previewer moves with a moving clip so that the actions can not be ignored easily. Andrews is incredibly beautiful (little wooden than in the past) and the strikingly beautiful Gene Tierney is strikingly striking! Creepy Craig Stevens plays a failed victim. SIDEWALK is a great companion piece for WHIRLPOOL (also Tierney's leading role) where you need to see where one is and Preminger is equally equal.
