White man + progression + industrialization = BAD. First peoples + nature + animals = GOOD. Simple formula. In fact, in the past, the same propaganda propaganda was used to defend the status quo; It is now used for attack. However, in this regard, the film succeeds in eliminating hackneyed politics because it acts in a way that addresses everyone in the issues of freedom and originality. You will not be confronted with the dirty revisionism of the film by the West. However, everyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when the Horses can be free on the Western plains. (The film does its best not to have horses in America before bringing them to a white-white man). Anyway, I liked it. The animation quality - especially the opening shot - is incredible.
