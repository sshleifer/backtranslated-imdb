DiG could not find anyone to watch! No one knew me because he was a fan of one of the bands. Of course, if you love Dandy Warhol or Brian Jonestown Massacre music, you will enjoy this movie only, but it is far from the truth. The only requirement is your interest in music and / or pop culture. The way to keep the two teams in parallel is a great way to present the paths that the group can take and to browse the public and pour Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> I was told that Dandys's BJM (despite their absence or non-interaction ) and Anton (despite his wrong conduct). Dandy Warhols respects the art produced by the band, even though the band hates everything, even now Dandy Warhol (though this is controversial). The best line, Dandy's drummer, says, "I will not give them anywhere yet again," and the guitarist definitely says, "I'll still get their notes." For me, how strong is this good music? <br /> <br /> I see this movie even though you know it. This is a subject of rock music and more interested in how it is developing. It is rare to follow a group so closely.
