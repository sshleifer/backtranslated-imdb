This film is incredibly realistic and fair to the crime that many people do not understand because of lack of experience. Many people who think of the victim's mind may be proud. According to the victim, I have done a fantastic job in the role of Dawson Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave film. This is a different, more realistic view of rape than any movie I have ever seen. It has been drifted for a while, but I know that many victims have this kind of justice because they have about 1% chance of sending an attacker to prison. It's good to see a movie that is approaching the reality most.
