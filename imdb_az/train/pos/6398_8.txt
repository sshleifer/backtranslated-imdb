The inspirational "tales" about the "victory of the human soul" are great for me. The most surprising thing about my personality is how much I liked myself. The film is perceived as acceptable and attracted, but it works. Most loans continue to deliver both potentials. Cuban Gooding, Jr., is a perfect role that is fine here in a limited way. We came to expect much from De Niro and he did not disappoint. Creates a dark funny portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr., sets out to make an old style flick and comes with the winner.
