Australian Fred Schepisi (Black Blend) sets this comedy / romance fun, relaxed and in the summer. You'll be laughing while watching this movie. Ed Robbins, Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic colleagues, Nathan, Kurt and Boris, who are highly appreciated by IQ's auto mechanic, Ed Walters. You can tell them with preppie shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, You Have a Mail) Einstein is Catherine Boyd, a skilled, but not reliable mathematician. Perhaps he is surrounded by all the genius. According to her, if she marries someone with high IQ. his children will be high IQ. he does not know what he wants. This is a fresh movie between Tim Robbins' favorite laugh and Meg's incision. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should use this movie. Catherine deals with animal behavior, but Jerk is very excited about James Moreland. This is primarily a condition between mechanics and mathematicians. Smart lines and subliminal lines! Cinematography is beautiful. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in Spring. Ed, Nathan, Kurt and Boris, are the favorite scenes with Einstein's multiple choice tests. Ed and Einstein slip over the motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris released all the research animals! <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote: Albert Einstein: "Do not interfere with your brain." Ed Walters: "The last time you said Wahoo?" Catherine Boyd: "No, I do not know." This is a non-renewable movie, I recommend it, and I have a tape every time and watch a little more.
