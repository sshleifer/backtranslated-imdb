This film is famous for its musical sequence, as Gene Kelly's record (as Astaire's ROYAL WEDDING - as shown on the Turner Classical Network last night): Dancing with a set of clothes like Fred Astaire, and then the walls and ceiling of the room, Gene Kelly danced in an animated film with Jerry Mouse. Consistency is done in a good way. Forgetful, Kelly explains the story behind Dean Stockwell and her stepchildren in the afternoon and tells Stockwell and others how to play the scene for the scene. pastoral type background. Kelly even changes the navy blues wearing the white "Pomeranian" seafront, with the shadow strip. Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene. He is actually negotiating - first, he did not repeat for many decades. <br /> <br /> However, he put Tom Cat on his own - Tom seems to be Jerry's cocktail shortly, trying to encourage him with a cheese cheese. <br /> <br /> However, the animated film shot by Kelly took about seven minutes. movie Most of this feature film is made up of a 4-day furlough missing by Hollywood and featuring Kelly Katherine Grayson and Frank Sinatra in the MGM movie studio, Hollywood Bowl and Iturby's own home. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> Kelly saved Sinatra's life in the Pacific and eventually won a medal. Both of them are on a four-day vacancy in California, where they are taking a vacation. But scribblers (a short film - Kelly, an unprecedented good girl in Hollywood), plans to spend four days with Frank, a sibling Gen and a Lola. <br /> <br /> Francis is one of those idiots in the film after filmmaking, particularly in the musical comedy, requiring "instruction" to meet socially less and girls. characters women). Frank insisted that Gene helped her "teach her" a girl. Only a cop leads them to their headquarters (and police will not give her real name and address) to help the police with a small boy (Stokwell) who insists on joining the fleet. If Kelly, who is the objectioner, can get this information out of Stokweller, asking him directly questions (the police can not ask), Kelly insists his son to go home with Aunt (Grayson). While still objecting, Kelly is becoming increasingly sophisticated (mainly due to Sympathetic Symptoms). Lola misses herself on the next night by sleep - Sinatra is so awkward that she did not wake her up. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> <strong> Life is a comrade. AWEIGH, but I find this kind of annoying story. Although Kelly, Sinatra, Grayson, and Iturby are the first to perform and dance and concert music, it is uncomfortable to be tempted to get a human being's deception similar to Sinatra's character. Indeed, at the beginning of four days, Kelly would have beaten hell in the beginning to follow him (like Sinatra), how should this day help a man who survives his life? <br /> <br /> This kind of unhappy always destroys the general impression of a music for me - the musical numbers are not good for me to forget this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Iturbi's stalking is also unhappy. Kelly works for Grayson to love Sinatra, Sinatra says she can get a chance to choose singing ability with Jose Iturbi. Sinatra and Kelly are trying to do so in the rest of the film (on the one hand - there's really no good reason - Grayson himself is interviewed by Kelly's MGM interview with Iturbi). This is simply a chance (Iturby, grateful to Grayson) gives her the opportunity to listen to her talent. <br /> <br /> Kelly ends with Grayson in this way. When Sinatra's conscience could not help her, Iturbi is ashamed to annoy her (but Kelly is not surprised at that), and then suddenly strives to meet a waitress from the native Brooklyn (Pamela Britton). And, of course, without the help of Kelly, Sinatra and Britton fall in love. Oh, "consistency"! Your name does not necessarily "write a script"!
