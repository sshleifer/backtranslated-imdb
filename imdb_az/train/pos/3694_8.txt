<br /> <br /> What would be expected from this movie, given the beautiful collection of stars and directors, but at the end it did not fail. <br /> <br /> One of the most important moments for me was the latest episode with an American tourist <br /> <br /> There was also a story about Paramedic and the victim of a knife. Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi for action and comedy. <strong> Tom Tykwer </ font> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie has a strong finish. <br /> <br /> Sitting with your spouse is not very painful - they only last for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
