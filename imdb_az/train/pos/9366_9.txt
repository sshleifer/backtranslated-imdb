This movie was featured at the Austin Paramount Theater yesterday evening as part of the SXSW Film Festival. Following the film, we asked questions to the audience after film director Mike Binder and star Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. This is a beautiful and powerful movie if you start losing yourself and getting your way back. The performances are extraordinary and the story is rarely able to be tragic and funny. (The romance of the film is a bit challenging to emphasize romantic aspects). <br /> <br /> This is a breaking role for Adam Sandler. With Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish, this role is a step forward for him as a dramatic actor. He deserves Oscar nomination while continuing to play more dramatic roles like Tom Hanks and Jim Carrey. In this role Dustin tried to link Hoffman with the Rain Man. Although an autistic man is very different from Sandler's traumatic character, for the different reasons, both characters are squeezed in their own world as insulation and confusion. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle's performance is less surprising, but it's just okay. After the Hotel Rwanda and the Crash, we have come to expect noteworthy nuclear performances by the Cheadle. It has sincerity and honesty in its role. Although not as deep as the nature of the sand, it is broken and fights. Cheadle struggles with dental problems, both in marriage and in professional life. Together, characters played by Cheadle and Sandler are fighting for their true friends often to heal each other (Matt Damon and Robin Williams's Good Will Hunting). <br /> <br /> The victory of the Alliance is once more proven. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> The beach is almost a different character. Shooting in the streets of New York, a city that is exposed to a great tragedy and self-improvement, is quite beautiful. Jada Pinkett Smith, Liv Tyler, Safron Burrows (in a very strange role), Donald Sutherland and Mike Binder's role are pretty good. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director Mike Binder is a story that can really connect to many levels. It is a story about sorrow, family, healing, men's friendship, mental health and love. It is not disappointing to judge me. The film is just hypnotic because it draws you to the life of her characters. Hollywood would have made Hollywood a better fame, making more attractive movies.
