While walking around the TV, HBO was incredibly terrifying of medical conditions, so I came to my twin brother and said, "Hey, this is like a fun" - I really love documentary films - we started watching it. At first, I thought Johnny Kennedy was a young man, but then, in the case of his condition, he never had puberty, hence loud and small body. There was a crusade to collect money for his work. With a beautiful spiritual understanding, I had the most beautiful sense of humor ... We cried, looked a little more, laughed, climbed up to buy another Kleenex, then cried. When Jonny Kennedy's "time passed," he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was ready; he learned lessons from this life and was free. I highly recommend this. You do not have a heart or heart for this boy.
