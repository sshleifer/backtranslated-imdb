Master Ching Siu Tungun is perhaps the most famous achievement in this series, Chinese Ghost Story 1-3. Chinese Ghost Story stars Leslie Cheung is in some distant past in China as a tax collector forced to spend a night during a "stroll ride" in some mysterious fortress fought and met by some strange old warriors. The beautiful actress Joey Wang / Wong is a wood devil, who lives in the castle and who is under the dominion of a powerful demon, gathering himself for himself with his beautiful spirits. Leslie and Joey are in love, and although ghosts are not allowed to live with people, they decide to break down and live in a happy place for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> This film is not something that the devil is thinking of, and our heroes have to fight for their lives and happiness. <br /> <br /> This film is less magic than other films shot by Ching Siu Tung. Her masterpieces include Duel (1983) and heroes series, all of which have incredible visual and kinetic power in the field of action. Ghost Story is full of bright lightning and dark atmosphere, which is facilitated by the strong presence of a beautiful and well-intentioned soul. Impressions will only work greatly on the big screen by breathing. The camera always moves and bends and adds to the tale of this movie. There are some movies, some are thinking, and when used in movies, they seem to be empty or foolish, and I think they can give action pictures to magic, freedom, and creativity. . When people fly in these films, films describe not only our world but life even bigger in life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Leslie and Joey are more careful in writing, and the characters have to be even hotter, deeper and more original in giving the story a bigger power and making the film even more remarkable and important. In addition, the message about love and power is emphasized at one point and must be interpreted and found in the audience's mind. There is also some other negative aspect of the dialogue, and people are talking without any reason. This is very irritating and, unfortunately, many writers are protesting when writing their films. People are just talking and talking and doing everything to make it easier to understand, and so the film is not that difficult or convincing because it's a difficult element. Think of only the Japanese filmmaker Takeshi Kitano; his films have very little dialogue, and it is very important for him to talk about other things in cinema with other means of talking or not talking or talking to other characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the Chinese Ghost Story is a very nice and sleek breath taking part of the East Cinema, and the movie is very nice and hopefully won some Hong Kong film awards. Despite the Chinese Ghost Story 7/10 and the above-mentioned shortcomings, this is undoubtedly a great piece of fantasy genre.
