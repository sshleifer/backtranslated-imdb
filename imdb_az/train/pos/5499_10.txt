I had no idea of ​​the facts presented by this film. As I remember this situation, I received the information presented in the press: a confusion around the suspicious personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is about revealing many facts, and I'm surprised that some of this quality is never prepared. The protagonist was Mr Chavez, but it was important when everyone came to the picture and eventually became the reality of this entelec- tion: there were many people. <br /> <br /> Thank you to Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
