This is probably the best imaginable fighter - an English, better than that Spinal Tap. The heroes are convincing, the plot is great, and you can soothe some events, for example, by placing a Ray problem in the group. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is excellent. Even in the real time, on the same basis, you will be tempting in a couple of days. I liked some similar purple, my favorite home names. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The film will never slip, it's just going to the right and there are some really comic sections. <br /> <br /> This is a secret diamond.
