I spent a long time in Berlin on a special video tape and found a version of the Dutchman with an English version. I think this is one of the best horrormovies. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie a black comedy. I must admit that when I first saw it (and it was the same for the second time) I could not smile. On the one hand, Trekkovski appears so beautiful and even cute in his shy behavior, but on the other hand, this guy throws the playground and there is no explanation for that. But most of all, of course, does not really know who Simone Choule is and who he really is, it's his transformation. This is the most horrible event in the film. Of course, all this is noticeable, but it's an apartment that reveals this woman's face, or even before relocating - it's an interesting question. It is difficult to understand his schizophrenic behavior, and it is terrible to see his two sides and their fighting identities. As a result, she cut her hand for the first time and then threw it off the window. But this terrible crying means that everyone will repeat it again ... is that spirit in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian products? The real thing that seems to be a mummy at the hospital is not an event, but a tip from my point of view.
