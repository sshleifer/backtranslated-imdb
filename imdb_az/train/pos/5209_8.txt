I saw this important movie this evening. Richard Gere and Claire Dane's most important and best work. He deserves Oscar for a beautiful image of a man who is forced to give early retirement as an accountant for having committed sexual crimes. Claire Danes is replaced by a woman who replaces her as a gloves - Gere's character tries to teach all the while examining a recent case where a young girl is satisfied with one of the undercover detainees. The subject is shocking, sex offenders and their followers, but this movie will soon be forgotten. I am aware that Gere will describe it for a long time. Since the description of Anthony Hopkins's serial killer screen shots are terrifying and, therefore, it deals with me. The film opens with shocking statistics and do not miss your opening credits. Intensive and memorable. Richard Gere may have the best role to prove to man. Denmark can be both, and both are doing extraordinary good work in this often difficult movie. <br /> <br /> This is a gutsy movie, and Gere gives a very layered deep part. Now give him an Oscar ... he deserves!
