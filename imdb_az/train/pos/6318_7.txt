I often tried to rent it, but in general, as a general rule, the stories of the story and the ensemble comedy are "Uhm ... but I'm not in my mood for this movie." So the "Powerful Solo Movie Night" enters! Anyway, welcome to Collinwood, I found a nice movie. Finally, though, it's pretty memorable but there are fun moments and laughs at a few loud voices. I repeat it, and as a rule, I'm not ashamed of watching and watching all of the movies you watch. George Clooney puts a humorous and short cabbage like a safe cracker, and most of the things were of interest to me ... 1. If Mr Clooney had left a strange 5-minute crowd, would not each comedy be better? and 2. How are old and pale fake tattoos built and how easy is it? Casting, you've got an impression that all the great players themselves have made a great job and work in a very important place in this film. I will not say that as planned in this film, everything is not planned, both are trickery and wisdom, but I have been reviewing specific features and forced to watch the original, so I think it's a lucky one! Hire this for a good time, maybe a few friends and pizza. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the singer is magnificent in the recording. It was a great pleasure to hear Paolo Conte as perfect as it used to be, and after making the credits, he put me crystal pieces.
