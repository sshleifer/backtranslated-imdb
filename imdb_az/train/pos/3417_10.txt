Before I see it, I'm on the topic, but it's not a common victory over a story like a trick. This technique is about Mt. Everest, there's more to it. This film shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two outstanding adult adults who manage their children, Erik and Sabria. Eric american is a blind climber / athlete, and Sabriye Lhasa is a German German academician who started a school in Tibet. These are exceptions to themselves and do not agree with the belief that they have children. When Erik wants to reach the summit, she wants to use Sabriye Erikin as a model and enjoy it. The nuances are complex, and it is not really clear who's right or if the whole climb is wrong or big. The deepest scenes are the Tibetan children themselves and the challenges they face before they go to school. The story of Tashi, a teenage teenager who grew up in the streets after his abandonment, was the most actor for me. I can watch a movie for her life and she is happy to learn thanks to the school, and now she works with some of her friends in a successful small business. If you love Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love it.
