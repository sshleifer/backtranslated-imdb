I love this movie. It's a ridiculous, funny, fierce, surreal, crazy one and is not necessarily your ordinary comedy. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the movie fun, then it's not so much your taste, so it's hard to write. Some of the comedies I love are Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (it's just the second time around me). There are others, but my tastes are unusual and I'm ready to accept that many people will not love these things. <br /> <br /> The scenes and heroes of this movie are put in a good place, the words are fun, the situation is interesting, the player is very good (as you would expect from casting), on the contrary, the player's demands from scripts are not particularly high. The overall package is for fun, funny, watchable and fierce fun.
