"Surreal", released immediately after the description of the classic genre "Real", "Malta Sahin", "Voluntary Compensation" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Welles should not be judged against others. He played with different rules. Actually, he was playing. Other femme fatale films begin from where they were released, and thus unusual functioning of the miraculous logic (but interesting) whodunit Wellesian scenes (typical rapid fire style), dialogue ("boiling hot" philosophy) (well, Hayworth is probably one-dimensional) . The Welles "genre" could mean "formula", but used it as "secrets" for "fun".
