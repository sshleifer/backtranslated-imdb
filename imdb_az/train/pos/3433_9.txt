I first saw it at the foreign film festival. Estonia is a beautiful paced pillar on a plot to free the treasure of a billion or more gold. Hollywood is rarely used in a curly, horrible style, but it captures the atmosphere of the newly released Baltic states (let's note that Tallinn was very scared when I arrived in 2003). There are many humor and romance too. I do not want to spoil a number of surprising, irrational surprises, so only one story movie begins with a large script, and the lead and speeches are the top bumper. DARKNESS in TALLING is simply an example of the fastest and most nervous of its genre. I was against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it did not (though) be bright, but still remained until the 11th OCEAN. Buy or Sell.
