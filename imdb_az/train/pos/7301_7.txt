I heard that "Hammerhead" was published on the DVD and finally found that my local DVD store, "I also thought it was another cheap monster movie on the Nu Image". Boys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have pulled out many disappointing films in the past few months, with cheap but very entertaining B - Pictures. So, especially after a few days ago, watching the "Shark Zone", which was pretty disappointing, I did not expect much. But Hammerhead became the perfect revival of monster films in the 1950s. There are a group of people in danger, we shout at women and girls in danger, eat plants and, of course, we have a great mutant mix between a man and a hammer shark. Everything you need for an entertaining monster movie. In such films, you can only imagine why these scenes are missing because the scenes you expect and the only thing that is missing are nudity, but for television. And the "Hammerhead" movement and the terrific entertainment are the best. At first, the wolf can not be seen very often and it is a very fast and weak work that results in the destruction of vitality, and secondly, William Forsythe is not the right person for the "hero" part and is in love with the magnificent Hunter Tylo. Moreover, I recommend this movie for any monster movie fan there. Make yourself a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
