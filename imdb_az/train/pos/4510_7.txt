Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit, not only in American civil liberties, but also in everybody's heart and mind, claims that Danish Helmer Niels Arden Oplev conveys this belief to the Danish middle school in 1969. More specifically, a young man named Fritz (Janus Dissing Rathke) is struggling against pressure by a tough and sly insulting teacher, Svendsen (Bent Mejding). The performances they are accustomed to from a true story are accompanied by certain aplomb and an order that is renewed on its various symbols is also involved. An ideological battle between a 13-year-old and a demented disciplinist, despite the quietness of the same path as the "Dead Poets Society" rather than "Matilda", leads to spectacular humor, but gives rise to hesitant changes in mood disorders. This is a familiar way to manage a rousing family movie with the right nook on the movie nose, including a personal subplot off off the Frits, as a young, young, young, constantly and accurately serve to become a daughter.
