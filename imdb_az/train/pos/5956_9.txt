Yes, this is an ultra-low budget movie. Thus, the actor is not an award-winning material, and sometimes film shoots are slow, as filmmakers draw a lot longer than one million, making it a movie. This film is prepared for this with a striking scenario that seriously draws, explains, and develops a vampire. In addition to the vampire story, we get detailed genetic information, legal and law enforcement, combat activities, philosophical ideas, and some good metal music. Kudos will go to Dylan O'Leary, the director / writer / main actor. This man does not know how to fulfill all of these roles and that he can do very well. I think that you can appreciate this movie, you need to be well-informed on every subject to see if the writer is doing a lot of research and knows all this. Interesting camera work and an underwater vampire attack - I have not seen it before, but there is something that falls under the submarine zombie attack in Fulci's Zombi. Casting is good, the sexy woman is really sexy. The main vampire is perfect for the role. The female victim seems sensitive. My only complaint was to have more nudity to bring down the budget scarcity. If you want to see the original vampire movie with a great story, this flick is for you. I hope to see future projects by Mr. O'Leary.
