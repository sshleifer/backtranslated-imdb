1939 is considered to be the first of Hollywood's history and is more liberal than any of the classic films, and John Ford is best known for its three "Stagecoach", "Drums with Mohawk" and frontier days and worldwide. Despite the fact that America was in a state of fear, Abraham Lincoln knew that he would be in a lot of things. In 1939, people's thoughts, like a person who is facing the same dilemma in his life and has won. Broadway, played by Robert E. Sherwood's "Illinois Abe Lincoln" award-winning home, filled with Raymond Massey's physical assault paintings (to be filmed in 1940). Carl Sandburun published his epic biography "Abraham Lincoln: War of the Year" and was soon the best seller. President Roosevelt often remembers Lincoln in his speech and became the most popular place in the city, in Lincoln Memorial, Washington, DC (a fact that Frank Capra used in his work "Mr. Smith goes to Washington"). /> <br /> All these were lost in the 20th century at Fox at Darryl F. Zanuck; <br /> <br /> As Lamar Trotti reads a script as a lawyer in Lincoln's early days, he set up 'prestige' and set John Ford to directive and became the star of Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> We want to play in Fonda, Lincoln; he felt that he could not justify the 'Big Emancipator' and was afraid of a bad performance that would damage his career. Even a film-shoot test that was astonishingly surprised by the Lincoln movie did not change his mind. According to Fondan, John Ford, who has never worked, has bribed him at his first meeting and explained that he did not describe Legend's Lincoln, but the young jakanap lawyer, who is in charge of the first murder trial. Humbled, took part in Fonda. <br /> <br /> John Ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the result was the same!) Of course, they found a chemistry they work because almost all the couples would produce 'classics'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fun, melancholy-racked Lincoln, Lincoln's "Abe Lincoln's Illinois Province," missed her mother who lost her friendship and lost her embarrassment (a pioneer with her mom). Fairness gives him a blow, and he speaks "common sense" to contradict each other with humor doses. Both production plays in connection with Lincoln (unlicensed) Ann Rutledge; In Ford's version, the couple is really love and loyal to each other. After his death, Lincoln would frequently visit his grave, to share his life with his 'soul' (one theme would continue in the "O Yellow Ribbon" in Ford). <br /> <br /> The criminal justice court shows the talent talents of the film, the star and the director. Describes Lincoln's inexperience in the background, but deserves justice for a good deal of justice, and the gap between Ford's "intellectuals" of the Great City (Mr. DA Donald Meek and his slick's advisor Stephen Douglas, Milburn Stone) and Lincoln's informal, rule sense of bending country. <br /> <br /> As a key witness to Ford's "regular" Ward Bond, the trial is neither unconventional, nor riveting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> an incredible year!
