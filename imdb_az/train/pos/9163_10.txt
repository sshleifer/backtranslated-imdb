When my college-aged daughter's preschool aged, these miniseries appeared on A & E at 8-9 every morning. My neighbor and I, Jane Eyre, made a pact not to miss a minute, and the kids were late for school every morning for school all week long. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I've forgotten how much I liked this movie until recently, with the release of an old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very nice, but still as perfect as Rochester. A dark, dark face, humor and sensitivity were modest in the pages of the book. Dalton ate a little bit of scene, though I could not sit down with William Hurt or Ciaran Hinds, who did not look like me. The magic here is that the woman loves Dalton and gets romantic. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what Zelah Clark is. He died quietly, formally, as he says, but with a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives the audience a powerful and inspirational nature that helps her get rid of the ill-treatment of paradise. His criticism of his activities as "wooden" is incorrect. An Englishman in the English family kept such a behavior, but spoke emotionally with passion. Unlike many other screens, Janes seems fairly flat for Jane, but enough to get the audience involved with Rochester. <br /> <br /> Bronte's dialogue, his collapse. Dalton and Clarke have intelligent and quiet intensity and have a relationship of Jane and Rochester. Although Jane looks straight and sweet as vanilla butter, she is cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. Both goals play well with each other. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect match of the best romance novel.
