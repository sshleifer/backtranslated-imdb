Che: The first part was not a very interesting event, but an interesting experience that they were trying to do something different from the "biopic" genre. Much: Part 2 is the best point of this practice. <br /> <br /> This film presents one of the same features, without forgetting the intentions of Steven Soderberg's unique intentions (especially Benicio del Toron) to break the traditional rules of biological methods. <br /> <br /> What Soderberg's experiences are ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they often succeed. <br /> <br /> The last message from this film is perfect, and this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> "Che": is a long-awaited recommendation for the "Party Alliance" "Che Guervara" First, this is a brave and interesting experience that makes the viewer a difficult image and leaves us thinking.
