It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is 10 years old. I'm a black comedy darling. It can not help the lines with a cast, including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben's Brass Balls London), but may be dry. The supporting castle is about a dead center. Finding the smallest flaws in the film: Ellen Barkin's makeup face gave a washable face; Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor had several gimme visits that did not serve any purpose, and Michael J. Pollard's screen was too short. For all this, the pressure was incredible without the egos to write a good script. If you've seen the film, Larry Bishop (writer, director), underneath the movie Underworld, you will enjoy this suddenly. His next visit (writer, director, actor) Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
