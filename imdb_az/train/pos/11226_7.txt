Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, this is just a web-based fan, and Mickey & Judy, as once put into a program, reflects mostly friends and neighbors with computer programs and home cameras and sewing machines. Here are definitely friends and neighbors. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you see, or are the smallest or the most delicate? Some run away from their lines like marble? some have a strong emphasis or simply do not seem to speak in a good way, and it was not possible to understand the single word they want to cook. We still have to admit that these friends and neighbors are somewhere, really fun. Yes, some of the dialogue is hockey. Yes, although a little weird (admittedly a bit cool), look at two Starfleet male kisses (though it seems to go some of the kissing scenes though). Yes, they obviously have a ST crash: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear the theme from Galaxy Quest at the start and end of each show. Okay That's why we can get it. Why? Graphs are the first degree. Better than anything you see. And sometimes, is a show or two really telling storytelling? <br /> <br /> The Secret Frontier is a common sinful pleasure in every sense of the word? but you need to lend to the people you are lending. It puts much effort into putting the force on it. People, sets, dresses, graphs? a great effort on the part of many people. We look back, we're back and thank them.
