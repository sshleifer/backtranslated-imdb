And for a tour of the very unexpected plot line: There is Plague in New Orleans and only Richard Widmark can stop it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Elya Kazan's trade brand theme: water pipes, men working, crowds, refugees, blue colorful people, violence in a scissors - was seen here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is a bit miscast of Dom Delouise, as Zero Mostel, but certainly can be viewed as his go-fer. I loved Barbara Bel Geddes as my sweetheart, my cool spouse - and Widmark was a convincing couple. <br /> <br /> He always reminds me of Sinatra - because of it and silently silent. It means a compliment if anything. I have never heard of this movie, and yes you should love the performance of Widmark. I was very pleased with Paul Douglas - playing this role several times, they created a tough, but effective team. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good. *** outta ****
