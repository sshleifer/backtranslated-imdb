This Academy Award, short film winner, can be ranked among the largest genres. Without a dialogue we talked about going to school after a young boy's lover who bought a golden honey goes to school, the golden honey is unprotected and leaves a window without care. After a while the envy around the adjacent orange tabby comes, goes through the window and starts slowly for the coffin. The fish knows what's happening and is very excited. As the cat approaches the coarse pit, the fish is thrown away. The cat catches the fish, puts it back in the bowl and leaves the window where it comes as a returning boy without knowing what happened. It was strange with real animals; Cousteo notes how these animals should behave in this way. I only wish this movie could be seen for people; I just saw it once, it was released for the first time in 1959, but it was unforgettable.
