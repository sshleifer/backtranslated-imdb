Michelle Rodriguez plays a high school girl Diana who has a treacherous spoon and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She is ready to fight for her father, who is paying his brother's boxing lessons. <br /> <br /> Diana would be a good way to pay attention to boxing's anger. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. See how they shape their emotions with each other in a square circle.
