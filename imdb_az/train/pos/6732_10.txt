This was the best document I've ever seen! I just saw Dogtown Lords and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta and she was happy to find one of her films. Big Business Stacy! I returned to work last week, I got it * & ^% less and came to this movie. As I grew up in Orange County in the 1980s, I went above the local beaches and my dad made it when I was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every week, my body surfed, boogeyboarded and then got up there. This movie just attracted me. It was a long way ago, but it was awesome to see what these kids had ... QUALITY MARKETS! This movie is a collection item.
