I have not heard about this movie until I've seen a rental DVD with a bit of doubt, a movie that has a lot of movies with a good ensemble in the past can not make a bad script and in some cases it does not seem to care. <br /> <br /> It's good that there's no reason for this movie not to let theater freedom just look good. As the genre is the most likely story, sometimes it may seem a bit difficult, but there are also many realisms that make it fast to accelerate. Well, Justin Timberlake, a good worker, was so happy to be here with such a big role, OK, he's still not Oscar's material, but he's going to learn each role and show many words to come here. <br /> <br /> Dylan McDermott was also strangely good in an unexpected role and is definitely the product of the product. <br /> <br /> Finally, just give way. you will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, in fact, I think you will be very happy with the end result.
