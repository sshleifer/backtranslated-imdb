For the past three to four years as a great princess, I do not believe I'm just round to watch the "Purple Rain." The new 2-D driven Special Edition made me buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to it, but in fact, we were not ready for electricity. The performance of the Prince during the movie is not surprising - it's really a move. I'm very familiar with the classic "Purple Rain" album and all of its songs, but it changes the perception of melodies and words to see them in the context of the movie - COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONE, BURAX LOVE AND TWO YEARS. There is something hypnotized about the scenes of the Prince and the Revolution. POWERFULLY PRESENTS THE DIFFERENT USE OF THE SATISFACTION OF THE SAME ONE ONLY ONLY BEFORE ANOTHER EXPLOITATION! (He is flooded! <br /> <br /> The Prince shows how your dreams can win his daughter - Take it to the lake, skip it, and then leave - completely <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Starts seeing the day and Jerome Benton illuminates the Minneapolis funk style - I love dance at this point <br /> <br /> Benton provides Morris with mirror performance. <br /> <br /> I will not wait to watch again, can not really do! The extras are intriguing - especially to Eddie Murphy's hill of Beverly Hills acknowledged that the "prince group" is the minister.
