The only reason I have given this movie from 10 to 8, in my opinion, is a few films that are perfect. This small B picture is a story story, it was not good. I have always been interested in Alexander Knox, but I have seen him very little. Here is a sad little man Wilhelm Grimm who turns into a monster. He is betraying everything and everyone with an abomination. Performance is one of the most exciting performances I've ever seen. In World War II, actors with fascist or other bad habits sometimes nominated for Oscars. Imagine that after the war, the Academy felt like thanking such honor that it would be like honoring the evil. However, Knox has started this kind of activity - a painful and sinful man does not think that others will suffer. <br /> <br /> Probably one of the best ever performances ever played is Marley Hunt, Filbert Gibbet or Social Butterfly. Perhaps Oscar is not worthy, but the best of his career. There is nothing against him; She loved her often in "small" roles she performed. But here he proves to the point of heavy drama. <br /> <br /> If I resemble stories about the stories of human drama or the fate of the Fascists, the film.
