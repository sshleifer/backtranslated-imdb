Everyone from Suqiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is a person we know in everyday life. They were very natural, and the transformation of Sugiyama was incredible. The score is very moving and brought me to tears. Choreography was nice without athletic appearance. Mai's elegant dance and charm gave me a nut boom. Tamako is such a beautiful character. Recalling to see King and I, you see a charming schoolgirl. The character of Aokinin is both cheerful and miserable. <br/> <br /> <br /> This movie is really a goalkeeper. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;
