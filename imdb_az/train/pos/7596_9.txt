The first episode gave a good impression on what to expect from the series immediately! Mysteries are waiting for the solution and a very good drama! I just love to gradually bring stories about symbols! Explain enough to stay excited! Of course, this show has some drawbacks! In the first two series, there are some characters that are invisible for the third season! Many cartoonists have set off a good deal, but there are not a few of them! Like Rose and her husband! Where is hell? What happened to them? Maybe they will return in the next episodes! But a little inconsistent! It tells you that every episode "Lost" (especially the first two seasons) will excite! It is a very difficult thing to do! I think that in the third season, despite the mysterious aspects of the show, attention is paid to character development! This is not a bad thing! It's also possible to keep drilling some episodes! One of the elements that can be considered as a demonstration is also beautiful faces! You will grow to love these symbols! Good or bad! But eventually I wanted to solve some of the secrets and shut down! Due to the downgrade rating, the "Lost" threatens to close! And that would be devastating!
