This is the beginning of a match between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe bet shows that the man can not spend a whole night in a creepy castle. Yes, of course, maybe, but will he get out of the wound? It's difficult to say with all these strange people that all the icy Barbara Steele does not need to wander around, including. The presentation is both French and English and is progressing several times. Perhaps this is because of the loss of dialogue dialogues? It is also very dark and claustrophobic that one does not see a candle and a small circle that creates like this, and there is always a feeling of great fear and a coming judgment. This version (about Synapse) is also censored and I wondered what would be the censorship of the movie until I saw the topless scene in 1964. In general, it's pretty good and black-and-white. Barbara Steele is also a movie. 10 to 8.
