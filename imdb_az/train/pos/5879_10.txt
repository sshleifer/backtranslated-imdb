One of the more sensitive comedies that hit Indian movie screens. <br /> <br /> <p> Akyam Kumar again appealed to the Anti-Crime Organization in India. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> proved to be one of the best super stars in Indian cinema that can make comedy. He was well aligned with the new Prophet John Abraham. <br /> <br /> John is still in the shadow of Akshaya and will not rise up to this day. <br /> <br /> New gals are cute and play a complete role. <br /> <br /> Need to watch the comedy. Release your brain and laugh for 2 hours! All the laughter after the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
