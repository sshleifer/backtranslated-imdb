Predominantly LOVE - Outstanding French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (I think The Rabid Sheep), the American title, which is almost an incorrect one, is such an original film, the truth that stretches until 1974 is even more striking. This movie was time consuming; even doing what is rich and new in line with today's highest standards. The film, shot by Michel Deville, is a great but subtle surprise to show all of this until the end of the film, in the form of a genuine mix of comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire. was suddenly sad and clearer. It focuses on cast, writing, and subject. But this is a delicious tune of Deville, it always keeps this balance, but it really pushes the "lost" movie to a very high level. (Written interview with the director in the DVD's "Special Features" section is worth reading if you have time.)
