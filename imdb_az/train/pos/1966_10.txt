I am not an ordinary commentator on this site, but I see how this movie is being evaluated, helping me write some comments and notes on this subject. I would watch this movie, maybe Cat is everything I can do, because I'm thinking of spoiler or fields, but there is really something incredible in manipulating people so divine. It's a very unfounded movie, I'm not here to argue, usually enjoying it, and then talking little, when I go to the cinema I am really in the dark room. will be repeated over and over again until you get away from the taste. Let's not be too critical about it. Thank you for reading.
