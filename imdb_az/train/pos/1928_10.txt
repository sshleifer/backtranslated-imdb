It was either released on a DVD or broadcasted on a cable channel like the Amer. Life TV network. I was watching as another beloved, "Traveling to the bottom of the sea", "Space" and "Giants Land". They showed it to be eternal, but did not accept offers to other shows. my father and I have been a big fan of electronics / nuts, and my father was Nader's old school, both of whom were with Oxy. I still had only nine memories of several episodes. I think that after the "Bonanza" TV was broadcasted in SAT. Some of the episodes I mentioned were taking experimental medication that slowed down the movements or surfing the body, I did it either, explains how he uses intelligence to slow down his breathing. I would like to show once again that in a show I am the original "External Restrictions" and "Sci-Fi Theater"
