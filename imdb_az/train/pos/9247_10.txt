I was expecting this movie to be romantic in the 1930s. The boy gets acquainted with the girl, is full of love, the girl loses her, and the boy is behind the child. This is not so. Clark Gable plays the esteemed artist Eddie, with all the usual charisma and embarrassment of the brow. When he entered the apartment of Ruby (Jean Harlow), he hid from the police to cover the bubbles inside the bathtub. Immediately chemistry. She works hard for a while, but a girl can only resist her heart for a long time. The heat between them is clear and there are definitely some scenes that are pre-production code! When the case of blackmail worsens and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for "unhappy girls", she is deplorable and hospitable with her, Eddie begins to believe that she will never come to her. Harlow plays Ruby perfectly, hard-nosed, fast. Gable never lets you get all the good lines! In particular, there is a moving scene that plays "their song" on a piano that works perfectly. For the last fifteen minutes, she cries me every time. Very romanticism.
