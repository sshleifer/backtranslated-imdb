Undoubtedly, Full Moon High, which is regarded as a full-fledged joke, teaches Tony Walker (Adam Arkin), accompanied by his father, Ed McMahon, in Romania in the 1950s. Of course, Tony is over, fur and teeth when it's a full month. <br /> <br /> A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that he can not survive while he is being cursed, and for twenty years, the movie is straightforward when it goes. The character of Ed McMahon's great patriotism, yahoo (everyone listens to Joe McCarthy) believes that Kenneth Mars's coach / director is tense and weaker then. One of the most popular members, Demond Wilson, is the best surprise for "bus driver" in Sanford and Son, as Lamont. But probably the funniest scene means the change of presidents; then gag with Gerald Ford really financed it! In any case, this is a real treat. Alan Arkin, who won an Oscar on an unhappy night and thanking his sons, thinks that this movie (or Son's son, son Anthony) also plays a role with both of them in this movie? a small role). Very funny. He also plays the lead role of Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: Director Larry Cohen, probably killer baby flick is known for "Alive".
