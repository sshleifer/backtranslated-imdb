Generally, this movie was great for the time and will be of interest to future generations. Though the solution is not 100% accurate, many things are true. The film will not go too far and miss some important parts. I found the book and got ready and immediately took a movie (because I did not give the film yet), but then I found the movie in a bargain shop in Wal-Mart and decided to buy it. It was what I expected. Generally, these movies give you 10 to 7 (relative accuracy and general sense) and bad portions (big time jumps and small but noticeable inaccuracies) for good portions.
