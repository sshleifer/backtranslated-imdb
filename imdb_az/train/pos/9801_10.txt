The original animation Dark Knight returns this ace adventure movie, which competitors at Phantasm Mask in its coolness. <br /> <br /> There is a new criminal fighter on the streets of Gotham, Batman Forever, or Batwoman Mystery more than Batman and Robin has many styles and explorations. She is a bat, but she is not a Batgirl who is not competent. And Batman denies any connection with her. In the meantime, Bruce Wayne should engage in ordinary romances and detective activities. <br /> <br /> <strong> Penguin, Bain and local Mob make things even more complicated. <Strong> Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn 'here too!) But I'm delighted with the creative and exciting set pieces, intelligent field and soft humor concept. This is definitely not a movie that Batman does not have any admirers. <br /> <br /> Open your ears to a really exciting song called "Betcha Neva" where DVDs do not feel so great embarrassment. There are some features (short "Chase Me" is terrific) and have a very nice Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but do not get me wrong ... movie Pan and Scandale are presented. Batman: The Batman Mystery is shot and pulled at 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented at 1.33: 1 in comparison to the larger screen clips on both sides. I think it's extremely boring, given that this Phantasm Mask is presented on the anamorphic wide screen. Warner had to repeat dozens of DVDs because people complained about the lack of Original Aspect in some subjects. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of OAR lowers the overall score to 4/5. This is a shame after completing a large DVD package.
