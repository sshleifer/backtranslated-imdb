Aardman does it again. <br /> <br /> Next to Pixar, Aardman Animation once again proves how to properly animate the animation. <br /> <br /> I had a great time following the first episode of Creation Comforts. I thought it was a good translation for American audiences. <br /> <br /> Because I was one of the fans of some television versions and short films, I knew why. When I sit down to watch it. The animators did a great job matching the pre-recorded sounds to a perfect animal. <br /> <br /> Look at the first episode with goat, sounds stoned and dogs on the street, continuing to call each other "dawg". <br /> Is it for everyone? It's not a long shot. In fact, the show would be happy to see the end for a full season. But as I said earlier, viewers do not want to get it.
