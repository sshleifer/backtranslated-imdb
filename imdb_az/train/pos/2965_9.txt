Perhaps one of the most fun films in the world. Oscar outfit. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and I suggest you to see one of the funniest cartoons created by South Park before seeing it. Take it, you'll always laugh when you see it. Gorgeous stroke. You do not think it's funny, you have no sense of humor, it's a sense of humor. From 10 to 10.
