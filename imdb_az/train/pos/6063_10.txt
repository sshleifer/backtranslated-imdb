The mysteries of the former Kingdom are a film about a young prince (Simon) who was expelled from his kingdom on the grounds that his father (king) was killed by a clich√© "bad consultant". This movie is about Simon's adventures. Special effects, plot, moving, and in general, everything about this movie is BAD. But it's so bad that it's funny. You will not watch this movie simply because it's funny, and it's good, as the film's other review.
