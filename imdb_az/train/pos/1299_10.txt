I've had a little on this television concert and I have to do it. The guys in Royal Albert are delighted to give everyone a wonderful, often intriguing performance. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a clean, no synth, no smoke-shaven lasers and strobes, no spectacular entry (and leave their home at their bottle missiles, all, unburned, serious and grateful viewers). <br /> <br /> A fan of a cream (or only if you hear them); if you have a blues fan; If you're a rock 'n' roll fan; when you look at this DVD and you listen, you will not be disappointed. And you will never miss this DVD because you will not lend anyone. (This DVD protects your self - esteem! Inform them them!) It is very good and very replayable; you need to keep it for ease.
