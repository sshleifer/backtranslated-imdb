Hitchcock shows this concept of visionary development in this early silent film. The structure of the film covering two boxers fighting on a girl is a straight forward drama without much advice. Despite Hitchcock's talent, his stunning looks are used. Approximately every shot is full of visual symbols. Especially for a memorable boxer is a jewelry given to a girl before getting married to another boxer. He slides his arm almost as if in a sexual way, and with a simple action, Hitch showed everything we needed to know. Boxing scenes review some of the exciting moments that Hitchcock has before his time. The film also provides insight into the future treatment of women. The goal of boxers' desires is not money or lust, but cause or love. The other women in the movie are beautiful girls who offer open suggestions for sex or old crones, who help to destroy happy relationships. All this is a Ring for everyone who is interested in Hitchcock's early work and develops as a visual storyteller.
