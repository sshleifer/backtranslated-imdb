In Frank Sinatra's first three films, he was a totally special actress: playing in a visible way, he shows up in a movie in another's movie during a nightclub sequence up to a song croon. In the fourth film, very unpleasant "High and High", Young Blue Eyes plays an active role in acting career ... a task is easier because he plays himself in a fictional story, because he is a croon <br /> <br /> Sinatra 's entrance is quite funny. Michele Morgan knocks on the door and asks who he is. A Hoboken tone sound 'Frank Sinatra' from abroad. Of course, I'm sure ... <br /> <br /> High and Ali's opening credits can surprise some viewers because the names of songwriters Rodgers and Hart are well known. In fact, they just wrote a song to this song: "I'm Debutante", which gives you access to each other as a presentation of a completely different song. Interestingly, the Rodgers & Hart song is one of their weakest, perhaps the least unpleasant song in the film's account; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this film, but would do better work (and read better material elsewhere). The 'High and Ali' true essence is a happy queue of some performers who rarely feature filmmakers. Paul and Grace Hartman were a very famous couple-dance team performing several Broadway performances: they were really delicate ball dances, plenty of physical comedy on dance. Grace Hartman, 48, died of cancer, almost no movie, so this film gives us a unique chance. to hear his close reading, to hear the beautiful sound and to feel how he feels sexy in his servant. After Grace Hartman's death, his wife had a long career as a character who once danced solo. (Or a memorable episode of Mayberry RFD, as Ken Berry.) <br /> <br /> Here's also 'High and Ali' here is a young live singer Marcy McGuire, who is attractive in the form of a servant. Why did not this talented girl draw more films? Perhaps he was a bit like Betty Hutton. I am very pleased with Hutton's performances, but Marcy McGuire is better. There's a funny thing to look at McGuire and Mery Wickes near the 'High and Ali' end, taking some shifts from a table club to a table at a nightclub. The short McGuire and the tall Wickes alternate are strangely fun! Unfortunately, Leon Errol plays a big role in the role of "Ali and Ali", but no comedy is done: once he does not dance his famous rubber legs. <br /> <br /> <BR> <strong> As Rector of Qafqaz University, Wilson studied his songs, but his key role as 'As Time Goes By' was wrong. (In real life, Wilson did not play piano.) Here 'High and Ali' reads happily and gives some fun reactions to other players. Less unpleasant Mel Odious, say Mel Torme. <br /> <br /> Viktor Borge never gives a rare performance in any of the comedy scenarios, where he is engaged in a dialogue scene but later on. Forget it. 'High and Ali' is a 'great' musical idea of ​​anybody, but it is a pleasure and I value it from 10 to 8. Director Tim Whelan, who works in England and Hollywood, is well-deservedly well-known.
