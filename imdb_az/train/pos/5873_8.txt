If they chose John Abraham for a MORE WORD, this would be a fire classic. This guy is a terrific player. Comedy, drama, tear, and so on. Let it be. <br /> <br /> The pawnshop was different at this point and it was pretty much jumping as a monkey to make his solo scenes a little laughable. <br /> <br /> It's just a noteworthy negative. on the contrary, the more annoying tid-bits), undoubtedly, a funny movie. Hungama is the best comedy from Bollywood since IMO. Like Hungama, a bright scenario on the shoulders and, of course, Akshay Kumar's situational comedy. This is probably the best performance ever. The best comedian for shoes is better for each prize. The EC was always good at comedy, but it's a different level here. Body language, facial expressions and the way it communicates to each line. This is a genius performance. The packed theater goes nuts for the entire length of the film and I do not think I've seen such an atmosphere for the Bollywood movie in the United States. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala is a "leading" hero. These 3 stars are incredibly HOT + Beautiful girls I think are doing a pretty good job. From the very beginning I am sure that all of them make their debut. Paresh Rawal is in an ordinary position, although his term lasts for some time. Rajpal Yadav is a typically boring self (a patient who moves in every movie). <br /> <br /> Rimi has nothing to do with it. <br /> Generally, it's definitely worth a deco. I say that it is more than entering FUNNIER, which means a lot. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
