It was a movie I heard about the growth of my whole life, but I have not seen it a few years ago. Glory has really continued. I knew Michael Myers, I saw a mask, saw ads for all the little sequels that followed. But Jason and Freddi grew up with a deadly grip in the horror game for over ten years, and I never thought of the Halloween franchise. Boy, how cheap did I get cheated? <br /> <br /> Halloween is really a terrific movie. Now, according to today's standards, this is not graphic or visceral, but this film brings the horror films to all other levels that are not yet available. The fact that John Carpenter was created in such a creepy and strange, mid-western city of creative atmosphere is a testament to his ability. Lighting effects are horrific, the "Shape" disappears in the visible and visible shadows. <br /> <br /> All performances are good, Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are shouting. Ms. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode, because she is so loyal and sensitive. <br /> <br /> <strong> Like Dr. Donald Pleasance Plays like Loomis. a man on a mission and works well. <br /> <br /> Dear Mr. Hellouin, this is not just a kindhearted movie, but a great film. It works on many levels and attracts viewers and never allows them. This should be a standard review for anyone who really wants to shoot a scary movie. For a more intense time, follow the lights one by one. Do not be surprised if you think of "Shelf" hiding around shades!
