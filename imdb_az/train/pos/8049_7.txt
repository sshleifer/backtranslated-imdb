In general, I say that I liked the movie. Some battlefields are really good. Fight with Leung Ka-Yan especially. One point I really worried about was the use of an Asian to play the black people. I want to say. Talk about delicate taste. On the battlefield, one of the warriors on the ground laughs. Otherwise, Sammo's copies make Bruce Lee's fight perfect. 10 out of 10 stars.
