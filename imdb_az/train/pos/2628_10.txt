I think Lion King is not one of the best 1 1/2 albums ever, and it's better than three Lion King movies! Tell us what Timon and Pumbaa have come to us from the movie, and others who are tailor-made with other Meercats tunnels such as Timon! Timon and Pumbaa find and find their dreams and soon find it, and they are also approaching Simba, but soon they have to choose between their sleeping places and Simba faces his worst Uncle Scar and prays the King as King of the Lords Rock! Timon is filled with beautiful new characters like Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). My most beloved character was Uncle Max because he was very entertaining and played by funny comedian Jerry Stiller, the father of Ben Stiller. Disney was clever to win Stiller in this role! Lion King 1 1/2 full of beautiful characters, animation, and stories and music, is better than any subsequent, and is better than Simba's dignity, but I really like it! Lion King is a great Disney surprise for all 1 1/2 family can do! There is a good story and very entertaining! 10 to 10!
