I love this movie, but I do not want to believe what will happen in this movie. People who do not like this movie should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I do not believe that Mr. Carrey is behind this makeup. I am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the film have already made a film. There is a new face in the movie. Cindy Lou Who plays Taylor Momsen. As it is opened, Grinch (Jim Carrey) disappears. And Whoville is a little fun for whom. Sicne we know who loves Christmas. Although the Grinch is not like the christmas. And Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is the daughter of the postmaster of the city (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. Anthony Hopkins makes the sound of nartering. And Jeffrey Tambor (Space From Muppets), whoville is thrown as mayor. Who does the talking about Grinch near the magnificent time.
