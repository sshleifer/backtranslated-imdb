This is a sorcerer who wants to create a half-hinged island, and then invites all his old jobs and academic friends to come and see his creation (a bad laugh), but in fact he wants to kill his sharks !! <br /> <br /> These monster films look like all of them, but it ends with a little humor (I guarantee that those who do it are planted on solid cheeks). But these sexy babes - a few hot babes, in a tight T-shirt, very sweating. At the beginning of one and the other at the end. Thank you, those who make bad movies! Hell is full of picnics, a man moves inside a jeep, slams into a tree, and then proposes to fly from the island to the helicopter. Yes, I hope we will think for a while. we will be back to you. Sharkman is not hilarious - either a terrific CGI or an equal comedian in a rubber suit. The crazy scientist gives a pretty good performance; <br /> <br /> According to some reports, she is motivated by her, she does not apologize. <br /> <br /> Generally, if you want a stupid FUN B-movie, you have to do it.
