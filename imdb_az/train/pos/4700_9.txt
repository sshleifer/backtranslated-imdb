I did not believe a low 5.6 rating on IMDb about Johnny at the time I wrote this review and I thought this comedy was something to do as I could until this memorable piece. Seriously, in order to have a low rating, people who vote should have a very limited sense of humor to note that they do not have a very profitable mind. If you do not like humorous sticks, do not see them! Combining the humorous, humorous, very good story and combining a great theme given by more than one gags, this movie has been added to my DVD collection. Here, of course, using "clinical tools" and "stereotypes", based on our favorite favorite films, of course, without mentioning the visual assumptions placed there. <br /> <br /> I have shown this movie to many people and have met with no specific expectations (possibly watching comedy) - as I thought you had to watch for any movie - I liked it all. Well, watching is not long and there is no slowdown in the evolution of the story, in my opinion, this is true. Of course, this is not perfect, some gags are a bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially considering that you have other ideas. That's why I've rated this movie from 10 to 9. This movie is in my opinion absurd, but in the field of well-thought-out comedies, it is a pioneer of "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs". Those who are more absurd in our day when cutting off thinking and cooking. Sometimes, gags need more civilization than many people, they should be completely understood. I would like to say the last word: explain it to yourself, and if you do not like Middle Joe's words and you do not like it, then you know that the truth is not good for your taste. in my opinion it is not possible.
