Last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival I was delighted to have attended a show of the Pacific Ocean and Eddy. When I shouted in an article about this in the Jalouse magazine, this movie was a little bit more focused on me. It was interesting at that time, but something very interesting. Anyway, I saw it in the festival program and decided to check it out. Everyone can say that the ending loans have begun to shoot. This is one of the most beautiful and fresh movies I have ever seen. Photography, art direction, moving, and especially directed, were flawless and flawless. There is nothing written "for you" in this movie, and you actually think. Most of the movies are just the contrary today. <br /> <br /> This dialogue has been carefully designed, and although the script does not talk about the wall, the words are very intentional and meaningful. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the movies that is definitely worthy of a second movie and you see more and more. This is a very layered and smart movie. I'm not sure when it's playing or where it is, but it should be set for movie enthusiasts.
