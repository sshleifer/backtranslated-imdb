The well-balanced mini-series between the 60's of historical facts and a good plot. In the four deliveries, we are watching a North American family with 3 members. But we just do not see them. We also see a number of symbols as a black rank, an extremist student leader, and a soldier in Vietnam. Filmography is simply supernatural. In the first chapters we see some of the scenes of the Vietnam War. The next chapter does not start at the end of the end, but after a while, gives a little mystery to the happenings. Generally, the 60th mini series should be for everyone, not just for hippie fanatics, with little interest in the subject.
