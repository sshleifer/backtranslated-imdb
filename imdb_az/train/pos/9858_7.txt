I will not go so far as to recommend this movie, because the problems I have with it are extremely sensitive to the device devices used in the film. <br /> <br /> It's a little jerky, so it's almost for everyone who's looking for something that's a bit more elegant for almost any part of it. <br /> <br /> However, When the mouse (in one of all trailers) is on the screen, all goes out of the window. His time is limited, but seems to have been wise to teach those who decide to "put a little more squirrel on the kids"? each time becomes irresistibly boring. It does not save the movie, but you can leave it saying "there was a place where at least I could not stop laughing." <br /> Of course, it did not break this dream in a skilful way, but it is almost given by a Pixar flicks. From all of the things I put it down ... but that's not bad at all.
