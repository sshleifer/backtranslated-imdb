The music of the 1940s is usually in a certain form - if you are studying movies, you know what I'm talking about - it's a place where there's a lot of great "demonstrations" on earth, but in reality, characters and so on. <br /> <br /> THIS IS ONE DIFFERENT - Lightweight years are worthy of a nomination for a better and best picture - 1945 (though there is no chance to beat the last victory - Lost Weekend). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was the best form of her career - yes, I know about "America in Paris" and "Reading song in the rain". This is different. She really looks like the "sea worm", thinking of the idea of ​​"taking away any daughter." It is nothing more than a raven. And if he had to prepare a story to get him - so - so. Listen as a musician when he "seizes his leg." The gigantic surprise of the film comes from his attempt to make a "story" of his and her new pagan (Sinatra) "awesome" story "for a truly delightful" daughter. <br /> <br /> What does it mean for me to see the film? However, there are many other elements in this film, this is a classic friendship story, a nostalgia during the Second World War (a war has ended after one month since the release of films), a really great boy laughing in life is a man, great songs and a few other elements of classic films. <br /> Why is a 10? Close to the end - about 2 1/2 hours a bit. Gene Kelly has a small number of ballets in 1945, which is a sensation, but looks and feels as if it were added a few minutes. But in general, they are a definite victory at every level.
