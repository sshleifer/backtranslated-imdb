I love this movie and I'm not dependent on watching it. Riff calls himself a young lobotomy, but everything else is perfect. I've never been an admirer of PJ Soles, and she did not help to hear that Ramone did not know who she was until the film was shot, but most of her could ignore her strange little face. The majority of people who have been watching for a while are Ramones admirers and really .. that's a very good reason. I did not see DeeDee mixing pizza lines or Joey's teacher's name again and again. One of the best parts of the film, you see your reading, you do not want to dance in the halls of the high school. I love it. The specially released DVD has a good retrospective, not surprisingly, that PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe she was working on another project * laugh * Anyway, a great movie, a Ramone admirer would be better.
