This movie is very good! Although it's Carmen Electra, this should be one of the better movies I've seen a bit. Jamie Kennedy is simply surprising, and Loren Dean plays a very good, painfully spoiled movie star. The area is also great. Everything that is scared is very real. They say that this is a drama, but this is one of the funniest comic dramas I've ever seen. Check him out.
