Once inside a castle ...... Two little girls are playing in the gardens' castle. They are sisters. One blond little girl (Kitty) and one in fear (Evelyn). Evelyn plays Kitty's puppet. Kitty follows Evelyn. Passing through the long corridors, he reads a newspaper in a sitting room sitting on a chair. Kitty complains about Evelyn, Evelyn is interested in a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn repeatedly says, "I am a red lady and a black lady." Suddenly, Evelyn holds a lady nearby and slams Kitty's puppet and then pushes her puppet. There is a fight. And Evelyn uses a lady against Kitty. They say that they are interfering and avoiding the worst ways. <br /> <br /> Then their fathers tell a legend about their hanging pattern on the wall, stabbing a woman to stab a black woman with a red dress: <br /> <br /> "Long ago a red lady and a black woman the same qala lived. He was a brother and hated each other. A night lady came into the red lady's room because of jealousy and stabbed seven times, after a year the red lady left her grave, killed six innocent people and her seven victims were black lady. Every hundred years later, the events are repeated in this castle. <br /> <br /> According to the legend, sixteen years later, the red queen tells her to come back and kill seven times: <br /> <br /> Let's note that this is the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sixteen years are passed ..... <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of this movie.
