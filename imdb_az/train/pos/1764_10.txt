Steve Carell, 40-year-old Virgin, first of all, played a part in supporting Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and the Daily Show, with only a small taste. Carell is really his comedy. We can say that Will Ferrell influences the "comedy air", but Carell takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, beloved and funny. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin laughs for two hours (or twice for four hours), and I'm not afraid to say that Steve Carell is one of our greatest comedies. as I did), the perfect supporting player and the whole movie attractive to the audience. The scenario was perfect for the movie to look better. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great tune and you can tell what the director knows. <br /> <br /> If you like Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, or any movie, you will love the 40-year-old Virgin absolutely for everyone, but not for sex jokes, some nudity and many other languages.
