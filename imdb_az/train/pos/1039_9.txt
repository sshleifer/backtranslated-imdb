I've seen this movie a few times and just looked at Geraldine Fitzgerald today (about TCM). He's a very small number of actresses and I've seen him for the first time (probably 40 years ago or "Wuthering Heights"). But in this film, the true star is Paul Lukas and he deserves all the praise he has received. It is clear that it is the last means, whether we want it or not. Naziism should be stopped and something good helped. He gave his children a bad line, and they were not bad, but when he spoke with adults, he would do such things without hesitation. <br /> <br /> Some people think it's a victim, but I've never seen this. I think that he was only after the money. Nazi partners knew it and therefore did not use it too much. <br /> <br /> An interesting point in the film and possibly Muller (Lucas) is German. While the WWI anti-German hysteria was not repeated in the Second World War, the anti-German encounter was significant, and some Germans were similar to those in Japan with the events in California. Hellman had a good time to write a good game about the Germans (maybe they signed the Nazi-Soviet pact). Because of this, the US and British air forces bombed German cities and had no idea of ​​killing innocent civilians. I think the Drezden bomb and fireworks take place after being released in "Rhine View". <br /> <br /> "Headline" is one of the words because "watch" looks west, from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army song used in a WWII, but the Nazis also had a walk-in song. But Muller is in Germany and is dealing with his Wach am Rhein. <br /> <br /> All other actors have done a great job here. Although Bodo is a lot, there are some guys like him. I was surprised that she did not give her mystery. In real life, he may have done very well.
