Perhaps, as one of the Canadians who did not read books at secondary school, I thought I would add my comments. They did not know the movie in any way without knowing the story beforehand. The heroes have a lot of complexity, everyone has their own. The glimmer of harmony is not everyone's idea of ​​spoon feeding, but is allowed to design their perceptions in the lives of characters. You can either love them or not, and feel the emotional impact of the movie. The beautiful demonstrations performed by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I would highly recommend it.
