This film is a strange dissatisfaction for me, even though this film puts Davis on the map for its brilliant performance like the guttersnipe waiter / prostitute Mildred Rogers. Those who move are very good. I will not be disastrous for my life, Phillip is a sensitive, well-trained young man, aware that this tramp will always use abusive foodstuffs against him. His na√Øve tolerance is somewhat ridiculous in some ways. Yes, I know he is a foot-and-coming, intellectual club of a sensitive club. But Davis is such a poisonous cadet that cultured ones can not tolerate and convince his attitudes and actions. Davis is surprised by his role: yes, he can now and then get off from his histrionics, but this is a living creature that you look at. He did not play a very bad gangster mullah. His character would be absolutely convincing, like a tramp between low life styles!
