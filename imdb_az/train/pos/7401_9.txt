In fact, it is interesting that the film was able to transfer the gap between my American culture and the Chinese. It's a story about these values ​​and reassesses the viewer in their choice of lifestyles and remains committed to the enterprise. Surprisingly, he was able to perform miraculously in a gentle, gentle way, with retrospective sessions threatening someone's status quo. I was very pleased with the movie and would do my best.
