The most delightful thing about Dan in Real Life shows that relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is logical and realistic. The fall of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche, who was interested in Dan's love, was a great decision; he is very talented, clever, natural, charming and compassionate, partly fit aged! If this film was prepared with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, that would be a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another nice feature called "Dan in Real Life" is a perfect movie for adults who are interested in it. an adult comedy that left the three pillars of the "frat pack": barefoot, chauvinist guys and sleazy jokes for calm. "Life in Life" is amazing and entertaining, smart laughs. The other comedies are based on jokes or laughing shocking audiences, and jokes from Dan in Real Life are more natural and clever and focus on a part of the audience. <br /> <br /> <br / "My problem with Dan is a very strange way by rebel, middle-aged actress Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to say whether there is a choice of a particular person or a director's choice. In either case, his character is unreal and boring. <br /> <br /> Here's a little flaw in the film and it does not go away from a story. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, "Dan in Real Life" is a great run. attack and loss of comedies. Writing, guiding, moving and (especially) cinematography are very good. It's just a nice, light hearted comedy.
