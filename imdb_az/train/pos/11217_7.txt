Since being a robot since days, I still can say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite moments of all time. Given what has been done, the animation has outstanding quality. There is no loops and sequences in the quality of art. Although the final episode is black and white, he does not enjoy watching the movie. Although it has been described as "gratifying," it should be borne in mind that women do not react in the same way. Since the main character is a woman, it must be understood that it is essential for her peers to resort to "man-made" tactics. For Seiko Noriko, he also plays Akane at Ranma 1/2. Noriko can get a 3-dimensional cartoon; his personality is essentially the essence of a spiritual girl, who seemed completely unsuccessful, but eventually succeeded in his will. The only complaint I received was a little teddy bear. Even Gunbuster uses quite a suspicious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (this is actually something that pushes a great velvety outfit around Dracula's style). I do not doubt that the scene is going to be funny, but it broke me. Despite all this, I would sort Gunbuster with the best 20 anime of all time.
