Watching the movie was very moody, and this movie is lightweight, but the end of the movie is unexpected. <br /> <br /> The film, starting with Abhay, witnessed the registration. Soha comes to marry, and his wife has just left the Soho alone and can not afford to go home, and there is nothing to live in. Abahy is a helper for her <br /> <br /> The rest are just beautiful and the end of the story is Abhay's It's a dessert that keeps it on its edge. Dialogue and music is a good song, a good direction in the best direction, and the scenario is as good as you are watching the story but slowing down the story. <br /> <br /> Especially in the mood I enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts. It's 8/10 for that
