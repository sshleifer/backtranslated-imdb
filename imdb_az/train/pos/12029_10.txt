I love the movie. Twisted Desire, Jeremy Jordan, was one of my favorite and one of the most sharp players. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I saw most of his films, but all of Jeremy Jordan's. Something unpleasant about Twisted Desire was when Nick was arrested and "Jennifer" dropped him out of the rash. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
