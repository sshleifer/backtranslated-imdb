Only this early Bugs Bunny (called here for the first time) and followed by the Elmer Fudd cartoon from YouTube on ThrBlog. This was the first time Chuck Jones was directed to "overwhelmingly mad" and eventually had a different voice than the Brooklyn / Bronx presented by Bugs Mel Blanc. In fact, according to Thad, Jimmy directed Stewart (his "shy boy" type personality). In any case, after buying Elmer's pets, Bugs behaves like a dead man after a rider's frequent throw-in and "Stop these lights!" When Elmer holds her in bed. Even with various sounds, Bugs definitely lauded her noble self and I laughed blue all the time! According to Thad, Elmer was eventually an extramarital-giving scene from the house he went after just hell, but it was probably too sad, because he suffered from a mental disorder at this point, as well as lost the scene. In any case, I love Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
