Boris and Bela are not facing each other in this movie, or they are better off with the same boat. I saw it in 1972 and bought it from the border this year. This time, while watching my kids, I drew attention to 2 things: attracted the attention of the 3, 4, and 5 year olds; and while I was watching for the first time, I did a few things. Very quickly the story is an unexpected end. A necessity for movie enthusiasts!
