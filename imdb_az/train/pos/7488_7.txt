Nobody (or something ..) leaves traces of bumps until blood relatives and victims are killed. Police Detective Karl Bretznayder (Melvyn Douglas, B-film before leaving the height above the horror genre) is behind these malicious crimes. The town is overtaken by the hysteria and Carl is linked to Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill, a more effective crazy scientist) to give some feedback that can lead to the death of the innocent. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also, her lover was afraid of Ruth's safety (Niemann's assistant "Doctor X" and "The Secret of the Angel Museum"> Dwight Frye draws the picture as a village idiot with a demented behavior that collects bats and moves everywhere ... The local paranoid has become a suspect for being in a firefighter. Eburne describes the film's humor as a very naive (sick and impetuous) patient who thinks that he believes in the illness that he has read in the laboratory, which he has worked in. It is a pity, and von Niemann often humiliates himself and his strange so-called fatal illnesses. Lionel Belmore returns once more fearful, lucky Burgerman <br /> <br /> Serious, static, but funny because of the hook, as the movie is probably a little budget, but it's not a big deal because of the fact that film director Frank R. Strayer and his crew are in a very good shape. I'm sure, though, that the movie's recordings are a good day. This is a B-horror item that you can find with 50 other casual cheesefests and programmers with poverty levels. The film's intentions ... to intensify a synthetically-designed biological life ... Frankenstein's formula provides a different way. Most of the film's subsequent outcomes may be disappointing because the real cause of the murder is not a real fairy tale about the vampire killer.
