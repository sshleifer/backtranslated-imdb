Unfortunately, the SpaceCamp came out simultaneously with the Challenger Explosion. Whatever you really want to pull it out or even put a curling on it if you need it. With their pleasure. I first watched SpaceCamp in a drive-in movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard about Leigh Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I did not hear others in the movie. So it was a great shock for me to find all the young people who are acting and do what is right! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also very good. <br /> <br /> Particularly, I liked the scenes in which these children act as a team. The scenes of children prepared for a trip can only hope. The true launch of a spacecraft is certainly an old story. But that was different. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is one of my most precious films. Maybe it could be a smuggler, but it was fantastic for a place like me. Perhaps we rent it 30-40 times. Finally, I found it in a certain store and bought it. Now it's just a DVD. Maybe I'll stay forever. This movie comes from 10 to 9.
