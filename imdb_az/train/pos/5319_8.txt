You forgot that this is a "B" movie. You've forgotten that it's outdated in many ways. Instead, the writer, Ida Lupino, receives a very worthy loan to touch a topic that is taboo in Hollywood (1950). In my opinion, this is the first film that focuses on the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects of this crime on victims. Most outsiders are the best in the world, Mala Powers is performing well as a traumatized young woman, who is then eighteen or nineteenth, Ann, trying to escape her "shame." Based on his work in this movie, I was surprised that he was not a more successful actor career. <br /> <strong> One of the sponsors, Tod Andrews, has some nice moments as the minister reaches to help her. <br /> Of course, Ms. Lupino, who worked on a limited budget, could still create memorable scenes. There are street and avenues leading to rape and police officers behind it. And Ann ended up bittersweet, who left me thinking that it would still be a normal life yet.
