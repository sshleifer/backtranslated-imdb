This movie liked me so much that I watched it at least once a year. Sometimes I'm worried. Sometimes it strengthens it. I always find human and real characters. This is a movie that shows the bizarre reality of life in LA, starting with the recurring helicopter search lamps for the dangers that approach the ordinary lives of those characters. This is a movie that allows a stranger kindness to change your life and make a difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action, whether or not intended, has strong drawbacks. I found this movie in many ways in Robert Alto's Short Cuts. Both of them had a magnificent cast of actors and actresses, and both movies allowed you to gradually track how the characters are interconnected and how they affect each other for better or worse. Grand Canyon has done a better job of direct message (hoping for the hopelessness of reality), even though they find a way to get more out of Altman's film. This movie should definitely see !!!
