This movie is one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances, a actor playing a dictator, and convincingly convincingly not detecting this accusation. Also, this movie is a fun, yet serious thing. What is especially interesting about this film is the Madonna, the dictator's guest, but ultimately becomes the country's leader. Transformation from Madonna's metaphor to political leader has been greatly enhanced by the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the film. And at the beginning of the film is an actor struggling at the beginning of the film and a slightly flawed character that develops and develops respect for the movie. I liked this movie.
