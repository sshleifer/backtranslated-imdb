Well, a funny, simple story, a great Nicole Kidman (almost always like me). This is a good "tool" for someone skilled in the comedy and drama because they are both elements. A romantic comedy has closed two major criminal offenses, a major breakthrough. Chaplin, here's a good, good good, but a popular romantic comedy ("The Truth About Cats & Dogs"). Maybe they're not so incredible. Ebert did not even consider it for that. The spectacular "civilizational" comedies were not clearly understood ("bring a baby", etc.). Have you seen a complicated comedy, have you seen them all? Perhaps people are ready to move from the 1930s. It's strange. Birthday Girl is a movie that I love a few times. Nicole Kidman can be the "killer app" for home video.
