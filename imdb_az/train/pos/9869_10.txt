I have to say that this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it for the first time but really appreciated the second look a few weeks ago. We can see why the sample works so well at the cash register. As you can see, many people are happy with this movie. <br /> <br /> It is a great winner in a perfect color palette (human looks, it looks good) and a very good adult (but clean) humor. The 3-4 minute opening with Scat is as great as the next intervention with it. Along with that, "Sid" (called by John Leguizano) provides silence for the movie in humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ray Romano, The baby is a beautiful, amazing story that laughs a few difficult characters. <br /> <br /> There are many songs, either brief acquaintance, or offensive, language-smart. <br /> <br /> If this is the best animated film, I've got more.
