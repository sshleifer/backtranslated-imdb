Morgan Freeman is a great, funny, funny movie, introduced to a Spanish girl called Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small store while exploring a potentially independent film. I was somewhat suspicious about the movie in the first ten minutes, but I love the movie as it's inside the store. This shows that positive attitudes can change everything. There is no complex area and it is easy to pursue, but it raises the mood of the soul and laughs all the way without the need for little clich√© romance. It covers several scenes, which allows you to laugh with your sides. Very rare work!
