The movie "I did not do" was fantastic. In the past, Rob Estes was watching "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place", as well as Josie Bissett on "Melrose Place", and liked to see them again in the form of "I did not." In the film they both become widows with both children and careers, and are exposed to love, and try to mix chaotic families together, without falling into the trap. They have great chemistry together (helps me get married in my life!). Of course, they stumble, but keep a family together with the growth and enlargement. Many people talk about this movie - well! - and left us a film that wants more. This will be a great series that will be involved in many ages! - It would be great to see the real life in a local world, because today's family show, which reflects the reality of most of our lives, is that many stations are replaced by Reality TV, which replaces us with these works. Someone told the ABC Family to start a new series of people!
