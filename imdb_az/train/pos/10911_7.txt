The 1936 film was filled with many veteran classic actors, and especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), with Mr Roberts, a physician and detective. Dr. Bradford once married Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), Shane, and had a divorce and was able to live with each other and always fight. Paula wanted to investigate her husband's murder and did her best to convince her that it was very important. Jean Arthur is a very flawed type and has more comedy since 1936, and his method of murder is something you do not believe in a jockey, especially on the California Race Track. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) "King Kong" played a great role as a bookie assistant with James Gleason, a detective who needed Dr Bradford's help to solve this strange crime. If you see this movie, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936, and today's audience thinks it's a great fun, and it really was just about these days!
