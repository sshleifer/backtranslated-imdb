I love Ralph Bakshi films ("Wizards", "Cool World" and underrated animation "Lord of the Rings") and Frank Frazetta collector and admirer. <br /> <br /> I missed the "Fire and Ice" theater release in 1983 and was a sword and magician who loves Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard's world because I was expecting to see him. video or some time since then. That's why 2005's freedom was a dream for me. But I bought it with a bit of fear, because I hoped that I would not just be watching for a single time, and then to die for a "collective" gathering powder. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and I made a good impression on this movie. <br /> <br /> Like the Frazetta art, it is a charming movie that has a hard physical and sexual nature to find in many fantasy / sword and magic films without cheese or dirty. Art is good and you see the best of Frazetti's ideas. Even my youngest boys are watching me and they want to watch it again. However, my wife has some objections due to the poorly dressed prince (Frazetta-esquire too). <br /> <br /> It is my opinion that this is convincing and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> ROTO-scale is used, but personally I cover the roto. <br /> <br /> Despite some persistence problems, I recommend this movie to all Fans, Frazetta, Conan and swords and magic fans. Enjoy!
