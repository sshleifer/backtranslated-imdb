The "Last Hard Men" is a typical western 70. Most of them seem to have inspired Sam Peckinpah. And this is one, but director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford Student, and this can be shown on a quite obvious scene. The IMO start is very good. Thus McLaglan, in a certain way, has attempted to drive viewers from civilization to shores. The third part contains some illogical shortcomings, and I'm a little concerned about Charlton Heston. He is forced to play an old old lawyer called Sam Burgade, but in a fantastic physical shape. There is no problem with throwing or rock climbing. For me it was not as motivated as most of the episode films. She is going to the beautiful Barbara Hershey, the daughter of the sheriff. Perhaps both of them had problems with the director or were not happy with their role. Hershey and Coburn do not show good, but are still good. If the screenwriter considered John Wayne as a Sam Bourgeze? The role of Michael Parks, as well as modern sheriff, is slightly used. On the other hand, Mr Coburn has as refugee Zach Provo. Coburn is one of the really big villain. He describes a bad man between mania and hatred. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (pbuh) states: The scenes of shooting are bloody and violence appears to be real. Zach Provo and his band had some strange and fierce scenes. It's a typical western move in the middle of my film. I would consider a bank robbery or something similar. In general, an entertaining western flick. A great movie, not a great Coburn, is a very good start and above average due to some mighty and violent scenes.
