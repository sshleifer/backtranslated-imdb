This film is about acquainting Carrie with Heavy Metal. This is about a schoolboy boy who gets selected a lot and gets revenge with the help of a Heavy Metal ghost. such a classic. Soundtrack is A ++++. There are live legends living in metal. Marc Price was great in this movie. It should be for metal fans.
