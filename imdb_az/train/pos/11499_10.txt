Since this show was only for one time, I came to DVD and did not want to have more episodes. This show was about 70 versions of the pop-ups in the 90's "X-Files" series. But with a little more comedic / light hearted approach. <br /> <br /> But I'm not mistaken, some of these episodes are full of horror, some of them have very complicated areas (of course, they were imagined - television in the 70s). <br /> <br /> Some areas operate as a little silly, but it is charm and attraction. Whether you like mysterious crime dramas, comedies or fantasy / horror issues, this series has brought all this together. Each episode is about 50 minutes or so (with 1 hour of advertising) and 50 minutes goes away, always leaving me wanting more. Great classic show in my book!
