My favorite "Imperialism" movie and one of the best action-adventure flair of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks prefer the screen to appeal to most of the movie makers with "chic" and "smart" cracks. There are many unforgettable scenes - 3 sergeants and 20 of them are fighting with hundreds Thugs; MacChesney & Cutter, giving Bobby Coote a pin of fists ("save some for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I'm an Expedition"; With a difficult cut, Diner ("I wanted to break down with me?") And the incredible temple scene along with Cutter, then brave as brass "<br /> <br /> In some cases, it's enough to just say that I'm trying to capture this movie. For adventures and generals it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours.
