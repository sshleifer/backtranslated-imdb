This movie was just absolutly brilliant. Actually, he thought to me. Throughout the whole film I was involved in hell. I liked everything about it ... it was so mixed and very wrapped and strange, it was hard to dislike it. All actors were phenomenal and nobody had done a better job ... One of the most favorite of this year ... is the right of an ocar.
