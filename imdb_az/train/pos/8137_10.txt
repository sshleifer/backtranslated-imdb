If you love CB4, you have no idea if you have not yet seen this movie. This movie is naked and more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie ... The failure to broadcast this movie on the DVD is unsuccessful, because it is a movie that loves and wants a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you love hip hop, and you get acquainted with some old school performers, definitley rents this movie. There are not many video rental locations available, but if you come across one, you will not be disappointed.
