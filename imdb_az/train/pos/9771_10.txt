Attractive and innovative! In the face of this criminally humiliated Whoopi Goldberg flick, the writers draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and the 1941 Orson Welles classic "Citizen Kane." Writers have been motivated by such a parallelism, but the audience has begun to see the most sensitive Hollywood shock to evaluate the subtle similarities between these two films. Charles Foster Kane at Citizen Kane is surprised and admired by many colleagues and physicians like Whoopi Goldberg in that film. This movie is a love for everyone. This is the epic test of the fear of annulment and the necessity of love and acceptance in a society that is capable of hanging and hanging. Coupled with Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex, for centuries, have prepared a dyad with a substantiated comparison like Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy, and Hall and Oates. You want to follow a celluloid philosophical investigation of an attack from some of the deepest human leaders; Bergman-eske, but not surprising, Theodore Rex should be immediately considered!
