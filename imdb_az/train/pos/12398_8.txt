What was missing at the Matrix story was always how it really happened in the real world. Do not say more, because this part of the story covered most of the basics. What was really interesting, how politically it was, and perhaps even a cheap shot in the presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things that they could think of in order to combat the robotic army, which was not meant to be anything but human servants. I also found it interesting to know how to survive with the use of fear and the idea of ​​uncertainty. People are often forced to fall into this trap, because they negatively treat people's logic and thinking because they do not believe in the opposite. It represents and brings together, it is a fact of how unthinkable people can be.
