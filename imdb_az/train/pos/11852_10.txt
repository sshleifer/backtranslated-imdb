The spirit is a unique and original look in terms of the united horse and the Americans in the western world. The film focuses on the excitement of the horse, the friendships and the dangers facing the Spirit's life. <br /> <br /> The presentation has done a great deal of work to use today's technology and realism to present stunning images that breathe in their depth. Music music has been featured by Bryan Adams and by music from Hans Zimmer, who was responsible for the popular music of The Lion King, from Disney hit in 1994. <br /> <br /> The story is not too deep, but some films are, in my opinion, not usually deprived of the film, but the lack of depth. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie made me happy and fit for the whole family. One should not be released. (10/10)
