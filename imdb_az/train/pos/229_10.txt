There is not a single computer capable of replacing actors and writers in today's digital world. Unfortunately, this kind of "character directed" is very rare these days. Duvall's performance is also remarkable for the high expectations of James Earl Jones audiences. Am I surprised that this movie is prepared for TV? Povaya has a "close" personality. All the performances mean that they are superior. The only thing that protects Masterpiece from being a movie is the lack of great cinematograph, but beautiful pictures are not everything. How can Jones and Duvall continue to produce such a beautiful artwork at a time when actors for digital digitization have been created?
