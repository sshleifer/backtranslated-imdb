This is really a comic show, which is a creepy way similar to the movie Tim Burton. It looks like an eye because it's more creative than most of the season. The best of all is not a "reality" show. <br /> <br /> Please note that the following community is ready to accept such kind of non-creative shows and do not see such beautiful shows? <br /> <br /> It's really unusual. Better than Ghost Whisperer and Medium. <br /> <br /> I think the tube is the most fun thing since "My Steps Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and the story and music are beautiful. If I take pleasure in shows that are just a bit of a beat, I recommend it. It's not as strange as the Twin Peaks, but it's a serious kink for it.
