I do not believe anyone's ideas about the film. This also applies to critics. Of course, if you look good, it's good and good, but I hate most of the movies. Why did you like this movie for a fun movie? Catherine Trammell takes you for a few hours from your life and a fictional character. Sharon Stone was awesome as it was in the first place. Everyone who voices horrible in this movie should first feel like the first thing he does when he acts in the same way as his instally. 1. Catherine plays with herself and excellence. Its a liner is very good, as is the first one. Who can forget about the first film while telling the cops: "If you arrest me, bring it somewhere else!" Great scenery and believe me, and he does it again. I love her. With her clothes, she smokes cigarettes, believes in me, she deserves to see only the performance of the Stone. It is not possible to wait for this movie to be released on DVD, because I can only imagine how good it will be. And yes, there are many twists, as in the latter, including the latter!
