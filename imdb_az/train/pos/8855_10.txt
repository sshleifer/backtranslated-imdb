Sidney Lumet still has one of the oldest active players yet! A few years ago, he said, "Find me guilty," and Vin Diesel's opportunity and right-handed director proved to everyone who could really move. If he retired after this movie (a real masterpiece in my eyes), no one would blame him. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <strong> The cast list is incredible, the performance is top notch. Small nuances in the performances, the "real" dialogue and / or situations that develop throughout the film are simply striking. The timeliness of the film keeps your feet all the time, as it blends lines when it looks natural / flawless. The story would be the best film (Dram / Thriller) even though it was a "normal" time structure. I just can recommend it at a high level, the rest is yours! : o)
