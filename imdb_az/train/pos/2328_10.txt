Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite films tend to be flawed - Sometimes a little stagey in the back window, the character of Chris Elliot on the Groundhog Day, The Music Stage in Our Life is very unattractive, the beginning of the night of Cabiria Nights is very slow - but this movie is perfectly executed from start to finish are. <br /> <br /> The scenario is brilliant, the player is superior everywhere (though Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are beautiful, all the coins shine), directorship and photography are inspired, and music scores are interrupted (like some Miramax scores that are very manipulative). Every sad moment really moves, every moment of light is smiling at me. This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and I wish to have similar films. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon is strangely surprised by this movie, but I'm sorry to see that the latest films are more refugee and clever than this serious movie about real people, real feelings and real challenges. Brilliant! Must be A.
