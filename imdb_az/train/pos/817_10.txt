I thought ROTJ was the best of three Star Wars movies. It is striking that ROTJ is considered the weakest payment in Trilogy. The ROTJ was the best I was because the deepest trick, the most shooting, the surprises, the most emotional (especially the ending) and most definitely the episodic movie. I personally like Empire Strikes Like it, but I think it was less than a little good at ROTJ and I did not feel like it felt like it was just like my third because it was slow-moving, not episodic. <br /> <br /> The reasons for the ROTJ after reading these surprising comments for me are just heartbreaking reasons for just two of them, and they are simply unimportant in comparison to excellence. as a whole movie. I heard many strange reasons: a) Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died, c) Because the Little Ewoks lost a stormtroopers team because d) Darth Vader was found out I want to be debunk completely believe in their own souls. First, WHEN THE BABY FUTE IS DEATH WHEN George Lucas wanted to die, he wanted to die. Do not make me wrong. I became Bobba Fett's admirer, but he made several kereo appearances and Lucas's Star Wars supporters did not intend to give a central character in his films. His name was never mentioned in the movie ... You have to go to the credits to find the name Bobba Fettin! Against ROTJ, I think a little character is dead ... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda's death. Of course, it was an important period in the film. I was not happy to kill him, but he made the film more realistic. All good guys will not survive in a real movie, you know. Otherwise all the good guys lived and all the bad guys were dead, this movie would be a joyful Saturday morning cartoon. Another point of view about people who do not like Yoda's death. No one complained when Darth Vader hit Obi Wan Kenobi in a New Hope. Why do Obi Wan's death was good, but not Yoda's ... hmmmmmmmmmmmm .... I could not believe it was another reason, because people were able to storm stormy Ewoks does not happen. This is absolutely funny! I do not believe that! First, Ewoks live in Endor, on their native planet, because they live there because they are aware of their homes. If you watch a lot of tactics carefully, the Ewoks used to defeat the stormers very well in the field of home use. (I hope you have lived in the woods all your life, and we've learned to use it to your advantage). They shook the magazines created to carry grapes, ropes, busts, and other traps. Stormtroopers were quite disadvantaged because they were numerous and did not know the advantages of forests. Only one thing was their blaster. To add, the Ewoks did not resemble the stormmen themselves, they were heavily supported by the rebels in the conquest. It would be a great disappointment if Stormtroopers were defeated by a large tribe of Ewoks with a great acquaintance of the Star Wars Heros, the rebels and their homes. Finally, this scene is still unbelievable for you .. Indeed, in the Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, there were only SELECTION scenes of the group consisting of Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess, while the full view of the ten stormtopers and all blasters heos !! And only, heroes, of course, always shot Stormtroopers with their blasters. ARMs should be very, very bad! At least the Empire Strikes Back, the Endor War was more credible because the two armies struck each other against one legion of stormtroopers each with 3 heroes. Do not believe me? Follow our fight in Cloud City when our heroes escape the Lando base. <br /> <br /> Hanno Solo and Luka Death Star tried to get out. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the discussion is that it's not funny for me to spend my time just for others.) Darth Vader is a person who does not like the disclosure! Well, in many ways, it was a big part of the movie. Luke Darth Wader's father tried to find out whether Annakin was Skywalker. After the film was over, the film's disappointment came to an end when he saw his father's face. With Annakinin's revelation Darth Vader had a good personality by the dark side (in his helmet) and Annakin Skywalker (helmet removal). Here, Annakin has become a lightweight and what is the meaning of the helmet scene. In fact, even if I were the father of Lucas, that is what I will do on that stage ... Is not that what you want to see with your own eyes before you kill the assassin and connect with you? <br /> <br /> In another note, I think that a subconscious or conscious expectation of the majority of people deserves a lot of ROTJ's prize (even better) than the previous films, even worse than previous films. I'll never go into this deceptive movie, I do not always want to go into a movie: "Well, better or worse, it might be original ... But I do not know. Let's see." "<br/> <br /> < Many college students and adults with their favorite Star Wars movie and all tell me (one exception that says a new hope is their favorite) The ROTJ: I think the results of these surveys are terrible and very wrong. <br /> <br /> The bottom line was that Jedi's return was the best of Trilogy, and it's one of three people who keeps me completely 135 minutes Each stage was suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or uplifting because there was no boredom, for example, the romantic light between Ruth and Luke, a better battle than the Empire Strikes <br /> <br /> Finally, if the people are starting to split the film, because the fans are nitpicky, little important details (or "just the next one") because Phantom Menace is open minded, "This movie is wrong because Luke <br /> <br /> <strong> Another spectacular film, such as ROTJ, is, unfortunately, a victim. <br /> <br />
