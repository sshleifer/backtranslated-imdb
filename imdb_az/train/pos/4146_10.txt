Nerds and anyone who lives in the Girlpower Revenge, appreciate this movie. One of the movies that offers everything you want in "Spring Break". Amy Pohler, Rachel Dratch, Sophie Monk, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch, Amber Tamblyn, Missi Pyle!) And it's guaranteed to rely on a loud voice. Writer / actor Rachel Dratch is a funny genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OH, MY GOD! (Now I'm just repeating myself ...) Miranda will live with girls who love July but claim to be ice cream and dumb.
