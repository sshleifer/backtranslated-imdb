Whether this film is a propaganda or not (I do not believe in), it really shows the power of Media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good Chavez was. It's really Chavez's way of seeing what the Bolivarians really are. Supporting the film may be wrong and wrong, though I think it's completely legal from the point of view of the film. Through the Venezuelan special media structure, the Venezuelan people only saw the prospect of a coup on the Neo-Liberal side. This film shows us that bolivars see it. Call for propaganda, I call it a court case from you.
