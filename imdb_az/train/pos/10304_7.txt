"Bruce Almighty" appears incredibly stupid and sounds especially from trailers. Nevertheless, I found a deeper message that made me more into this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and gives divine authority to be with God to see a week that he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man like God here, and is no better than his ordinary movie type or one of his best roles, but is good after work. Although sometimes in the film, Bruce has a lot of laughs, which, like the Red Sea, reduces his hut as the Red Sea, and along with the reactions of customers, has been returned by Freeman's appearance and reflects God's clever appearance. Sometimes it is over-exaggerated and has some humorous humor, but in general it is so funny. There are always worthy supporters like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who help. The end of the film is very romantic and tearful, and the message is clear that we have to call on God to call us "miracles." <br /> <br /> Although the film is perfect, it is still unpleasant and if you see a deep message from the movie, it would be expected from me and many people. <br /> <br /> ***
