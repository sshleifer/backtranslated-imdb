I just saw this movie TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Halle fans will be disappointed! If you're not familiar with the director's work, it's worthless. This film can definitely make itself whole. I have to go to the second choice ... it was nice not to see it again - and fast! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. Dialogue is very clever and Parker Posey's performance looks like Faye Grim's star role. Fay Grim is the latest feature of Henry Fool (2000), which reveals the world and characters. According to his vision, the most popular feature is the usual use of the most talented (or Dutch) angle that Hartley has in his various works: Hal Hartley's 1994-2004 collection, <br /> <br /> I watched this movie the best way on September 11. In the article, Fay Grimm's story adventure is facing the changing world after September 11, 2001. Without a big insult, this business and story world is a portrait of a genuine political and genuine geographical policy, if it is preceded by a major so-called cinema in 911 (Syria, Syria: Mark Cuban Exec, say less). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those who are closely related to Henry Fool, Simone, Fay, and Henry heroes, this film is self-conscious and self-referential. The character of Fay Grimm begins in the movie, Henry Fool was where he was, but until the end of the movie ... The knowledge and experience of the fault changed and expanded in the story. What can happen to the future and the future of the Family? I will not wait for the third part of this story!
