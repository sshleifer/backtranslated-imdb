Now I've watched this movie twice and I think it's pretty good for limited equipment used to create this movie. (Published in 1947) Heyerdahl put his theory on the relocation of present-day Hindus to the Polynesian islands in the southern columbia. This documentary, Dr. Heyerdahl and his crew follow the balsam trees in Equidor, as they swim along with the calming tea for their meeting in Peru. The 101-day marine adventure tests the primitive salvage power available to the indigenous population of that era by means of existing means. Look at yourself, a real adventure!
