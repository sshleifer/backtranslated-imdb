I know I'm not entirely sure to sit with everything for the first 20 minutes or a part of this movie. Like many people, I found it extremely boring and did not wait for an hour and a half to watch and bind the bites of this man completely. However, if you are sitting in the first case for a long time to see the finished product, you think the rest of the film is impressive. I really think that many people find it impossible to be bored or find other craftsmen stopping ideas. <br /> <br /> Rivers and Tides are a quiet work of Andy Goldsworthy's some of the artistic works and techniques that make up his art entirely of nature. entropy process. Slowly moving and unglamorous, but not many points in the film that show that Goldsworthy does not need any escort to appreciate its art. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are a lot of people who say that, apart from talking to nature and art, I always talk about the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, he complains about the discs that come from people. Many musicians say everything that musicians want to say without the musician's full-time musician, and I believe that I want to know what your artist is doing. perform with his works.

As a result, she finds that she has lost her mind and can not explain her work several times, but if you do not want Goldsworthy to talk about the art, watch out the sound. <br /> <br /> In short, it does not want to know if a musician reads it, and if you comment on the lyrics, it's not like reading lyrics. <br /> <br /> I think that Andy Goldsworthy had no idea before me. this movie is incredibly impressive, and I am glad that this film is being prepared for demonstration. In fact, his work is not the only one that can be brought to the studio, but photography is the only means of expressing a film, and I can only see things that are in the art and really only use things from nature. Whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how the film is presented, Goldsworthy's work is enough to look at the film because it's a star, it's the art of Goldsworthy. Thomas Riedelsheimer, director of this movie, knows me as long as there is no music or even the slightest special effects and the slow nature of the film.
