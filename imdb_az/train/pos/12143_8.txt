Brilliant movie, The best film for The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). Recently, I bought it in the original VHS and did not see this movie for 15 years, but it was still so good. The player was awful and dubbed it was worse, but the features of this movie (and many other old fashioned Chinese kung-fu movies) are great. Choreography is a masterpiece and story. I have never seen Shaol's 36 chambers, but I know it's the same movie, but Gordon Liu San Te plays, Th Te Te Te Te is the return to the 36th room of the Theater. There's a lot of comedy cost and a brilliant kung-fu.
