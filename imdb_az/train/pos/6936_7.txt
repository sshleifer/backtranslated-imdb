Winchester 73 receives credit from many critics to return to the West after the Second World War. Director Anthony Mann should get many credits for the perfect direction. Jimmy Stewart is doing great, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire are playing the movie with the images of two bad guys who have been in the high-stakes poker game with the precious Winchester 73 winning. It is a good script with a few stories going on at the same time. Look for the first look of Rock Hudson, like the young Bull. For a few years, thank God that we will allow them to play in western films. The film is black-and-white and is shot in Tucson, Arizona. I will not place the Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but it comes with an average offer from me. <br /> <br />
