One of the greatest hits of 1926, Harvard Brown, was a spectacular comedy / drama with rejuvenation and soccer scenes giving William Haines a great star. Haines is patented in all ways: clever cleverly discredited by anyone who will be rejected and turned into a male / hero and does not get anything as great as he can not win. No one has worked like this Heyness. A spectacular comic actor (with Mary Peakford and Little Annie Rooney, show people with Marion Davies), Haines could return to tragedy with a change in face expression. It is a joy in this film as it is with the Seas (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (along with Joan Crawford). Mary Brian is as good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good as a guest room in the illness, Ralph Bushman is a rival. Edvard Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and Grady Sutton. This film is now focused on Homoerotic relationships between Haines and Pickford and John Wayne's movie debut as a Yale player (but never seen it). Haines was the top-five box office star, starting with 1932. She is a shame that she has been largely forgotten and lost most of her films. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
