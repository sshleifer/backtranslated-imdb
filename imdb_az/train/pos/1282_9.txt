A few years ago I saw several times on the Sundance Channel and got a nice kinematic blow to the system. One semi-surreal but still challenging, paying attention to modern mass culture (or not), is paying attention to the extraneous residents of Hollywood on the roadside, some of which have been defeated. There was some memorable cinematography from the DP that made Mark Ruffalo's fun early performance and Polish Brothers films. There is an unhappy, hopeless humor and a strange original feeling, which is absolutely different. There was a classic classic in each of these films, and I was not surprised at the DVD yet. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon.
