<br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s AT & T and Bell Sciences, in the middle of the 1950s, came together with Hollywood director Frank Capra about the universe about CBS television movie films met for information. Often young scholars were far away from the terrible black-and-white feed, Capra films would be instructed by live scripts and vizier visuals at Technicolor. Four films - OUR MR. <br /> <br /> SUN (1956), COSMIC RACES (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE UNCHAINED GODDESS (1958) - quickly became school-friendly favorites. The star of the series is a bad English professor at the University of Southern California. It was Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982). These avuncular educators were a perfect movie trainer, who sometimes transmitted to spectators the incomplete and dull incomprehensible truths. Baxter, who won Peabody for his achievements after the Capra quartet, continued to develop high-level instructional films. <br /> <br /> HEMO The Magnificent, written and directed by Capra, is a story of the human heart and blood circulation system using animation and subtle humor. Film star Richard Carlson looks like Fiction Writer, who helps Baxter to talk to Hemo's fairy tales. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The Devotional Book, starting with the film, is entirely in line with tenor & tone production.
