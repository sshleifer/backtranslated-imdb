I saw the show 3-4 years ago. This clause was Funny! I've seen it for the first time on ETV (Estonian Television) and I liked it. This show is a bad time for me, so bad. Hyde, like a cool guy who loves Frank Sinatra! And he comes to foolish thoughts. He took these glasses with brown eyes. I like it. And there's FeZ. Pervert group. We all know what they are doing ... He wants to put something bad. There was even an episode with his boss. And Michael, the stupid boy on the whole group, is probably fool in the city and his police! I remember such a fool, Hyde says: Did he call the police? - No Michael comes and says. Everyone knows how to extinguish the sirens? He is a city playboy. Then comes Michael's old girlfriend Jackie and then Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric Kim, son of Kitty, grumpy war veteran and pets. He's a big cat. But she loves friend Donna who is planning to marry. Donna is a girl. Hmm what forgot? ah Hyde lives in a cellar.
