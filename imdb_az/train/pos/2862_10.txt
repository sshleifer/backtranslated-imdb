<br /> <br /> My idea is that the first season is limited to 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This superior series was one of the first to give color TV, and the Americans, in 1959, a color TV set of about $ 800, is so far more than 3,000 US dollars so far. How many of us will pay the privilege to watch a show transmitted through a 17-inch screen with a cathode ray picture tube? <br /> <br /> I was 11 years old at the start of the series, and I was watching it earlier. <br /> <br /> Now, after 50 years, many things come to mind. First, most of the story lines cover the summit of the Silver Mine coinciding with Comstock Lode and 1859. The weapons and clothes for 1859 are basically not original. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Ben also came to Lake Tahoe in 1839 and in the next twenty years of 100 square kilometers. The pioneers sought to solve the problem of Sierra Nevada no later than 1847, and Gold Rush did not start in two years. Indians do not play by local American actors. John Ford used native American actors in the 1920s. Bonanza manufacturers could easily do so in thirty years. <br /> <br /> It is a great nitpic for me. <br /> <br /> Other times have problems. Season 1 shows Mark Twain appearing as a middle-aged man. In 1859 Mark Twain was 24 years old. Stories from 1859 to 1860 (pre-civil war) and stories dating to 1880 are also important. Sustainability problems exist and are repeated. <br /> <br /> There are many murders in the first season. Time to kill decreased. <br /> <br /> Many episodes have a socially liberal tendency that is hard to believe of the time, but lends credit to the writers for seismic changes. <br /> <br /> Behavior of people starting in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> By saying all this, the move is good and I've been told that in my later years I have been better prepared than any of Adam's character. I do not think that Pernell Roberts deserves the credit. Also, Season 1 Dan Blocker (Hoss) reinforces the fact that he is a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many of the stories are followed by real historical events. The guest star was interesting. <br /> <br /> This was a great family fun and the series is very good with any event.
