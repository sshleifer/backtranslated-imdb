Back at my high school days in Salina, Kansas, they filmed a local film, Weinberg Brave Young Men, and their film shootings were outstanding during the weeks. Finally, it was learned that the film was "up to the Academy" and was a little ummm, "lower eyebrows" were more than we believed. <br /> <br /> I had to see it since I was there, and the local audience was glad to see it. I was 17 years old, and it was an indispensable attempt on the comedy-type legendary jokes. <br /> <br /> Looks many times from today and my idea is a bit mellowed. it is dumb, but sometimes at least "Mad TV" is at least the "proof" magazine. Ron Liebman can hate it, but he is perfect and unforgettable. The moment I love it, it would be a short scene on Santa Fe street, I parked my car, buy some guitar strips. The short look of my Pinto looks very bad, usually for the television. I did not see a new DVD, but if there were old pinto, there were sales.
