One of the funnest mario I've ever played. levels are creative, fluid control and good graphics for the time. There are also many boss and enemies that are crazy to fight. Sometimes the levels are frustrating and if you get out of some tough levels and still have more success in fighting a boss, it can be frustrating. Another complaint is the camera angle; Often it works well enough, but in some cases it can be painful. if you have a great time mario fan; this is for you. I would still recommend this one, even if he is not a big fan of his. a great game and it can take some time but it is very satisfying. Best of playing short bursts of time. it will almost catch up with your interests; I'm sure mine is mine!
