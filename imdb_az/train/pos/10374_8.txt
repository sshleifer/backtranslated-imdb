<br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> I was not satisfied with ROLL's speeding up to 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> Roll is a sporty guy, a game (Toby Malone), a Scary Star. Mat goes to the city and is taken by his uncle George (Damien Robertson). Yes, that was a plan. George is engaged in a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and delivers it for him. Of course, it is drifting into the world of Mat George. <br /> <br /> I knew well how George George taught some morality and respect. Toby and Damien stayed in a good place and did a great job. <br /> <br /> Each character in the film was very good, and two police officers were better. David Ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie. <br /> <br /> The little one was a joyful gangster who recalled one of my favorite characters, Pando. <br /> <br /> One of the things I like about rolls is that I grew up in Perth and Fremantle for 20 years. <br /> <br /> Together with the Rocks 'n' Rolls, I was seeing the oldest Ferris wheels, especially when I saw the sights and sights.
