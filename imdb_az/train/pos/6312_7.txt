George Clooney played together in this film before directing at the first debut ceremony called "Confession of the Dangerous Mind" led by Sam Rockwell. George Clooney also shows that they really believe in this project along with producer and producer Steven Soderbergh. Potentially, this looks like a beautiful and fun project in the same line as the movie 'Ocean Eleven' and 'The Italian Job', but in some ways this movie succeeds, or at least it does not <br /> <br /> The character of the movie is played by several well-known actors, but a shame that the characters really do not have enough space to grow. Despite their potential, they may have been transformed into entertaining and entertaining characters, but now they are talking about most of the series that are more interested in the film. <br /> <br /> Their victory does not lead to any change that prevents their heroes from becoming unhappy or even becoming weaker or something similar. <br /> <br /> Of course, according to the articles that are not used for the full potential of characters. I'm just a real Italian movie "I Soliti Ignati" which works better than this movie. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the film is still very fun to talk about simplicity. It's just a small, harmless movie, not to worry about the story. In this regard, "welcome to Collinwood" is still a working movie and simply serves its purpose well. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie you will not regret after finishing this movie <br /> <br /> 7/10
