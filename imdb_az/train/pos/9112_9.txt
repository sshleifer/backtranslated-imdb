Being Portuguese is not half-blind (half-prejudiced) when discussing portraiture films. Probably, I'll do it often. But this movie was adrenaline in such a hurry! Yes, that's right - it could not go past the history, but it did not hit any of the Portuguese films to get out of the area: using real space in the center of compressed Lissabon, about 30 years ago to stand for a real crowd. And they were right by God! Okay, to sum it up: If you have lived in a very exciting way, you will only look at small improvements as well as land needs. If you just watch it in random order, you have a good history from the past history and some of the more thoughtful ones. Even by European standards, yes.
