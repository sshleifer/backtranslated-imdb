Personally I find the film in a very good time. This reflects the true state of the triad in Hong Kong and gives the viewer the idea of ​​how the trio is organized. <br /> <br /> Along with this, however, is how the Hong Kong police managed to control the triad situation and why. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film is quite violent due to murder and torture. Nevertheless, the film remains true to the world, and violence on the screen is just something that is reflected in the truth. <br /> I recommend this movie to an admirer of any Triad / Mafia movie. Another good watch would be the Dragon Squad. There are more guns in this movie because this movie has more knives than weapon (in fact, I do not remember to see a weapon).
