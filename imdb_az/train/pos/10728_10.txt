Perfect cosmic fantasy movie. a group of children accidentally come out of space and have to come back, but they are definitely protesting. This would not have been a family movie when all of them died. Then all this will grieve. Kate Capsaw, the leading lady, does not want the Golden Globe performance, but unfortunately, she also won a Lea Thompson. It's so bad. I can not say enough, this movie is so great, a perfect girl for this movie, Lea Thompson. This is the best film in the world. <br /> <br /> Sorry, it's better than Star Wars. Star Wars is far superior, and so little spacecraft. <br /> <br /> <strong> May be 10/10- 0r, maybe 11/10. I'm not good in math
