I first saw this movie as a kid in the old Rialto Theater, on a Saturday afternoon matinée triple project called Vincent Price "Earth On Last Man" and Mario Bava's "Nightmare Castle". After a week I had nightmares about shouting ghosts! Although I do not know, all three films could have been the genre classics. I'm so scared that I'm so scared! As all three films scared me, it was the most impressive Blood Castle. <br /> <br /> This was the first in the bill. After missing the first 20 minutes of the movie, I did not see him before. It's a lot to escape from the print run just about 79 minutes (unedited runs 87minutes). But despite this, the dark creepy atmosphere (completed with castle castle, fog cemetery, shadows, and cobwebs), the Gothic set design, strongly moved and stopped bejeepers (especially the last 20 minutes) and made a lasting impression Finally, I got a copy of the movie for my collection I took several years to get it. Since there was French - Italian import, Winnipeg had no late movie. I did not see the beginning of the movie, and I remembered that I could not remember the title very much, and in order to worsen the film, the film was full of a variety of film titles (aka Danze Macabre Terror Castle, Long Terror Night, etc.) and the US Blood Tower The job title is similar to many other "b" horror and regression movies. illusory But finally, thanks to the internet and perseverance! How to watch the whole movie in the long run! When I was a boy I could have had a very bad time, but the home cinema is getting better, and the iconic films of the time are a wonderful early effort of the Italian director Antonio Margherti, "Haunting", "The Innocents" or "Black Bazaar" The 60s screaming queen symbol plays with a good written script by Barbara Steele and Sergio Corbucci, and undoubtedly carries nightly night in a haunted house, about a writer (Georges Riviere), and, undoubtedly, turns out to be an annoying story every year. <Br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> leaking door, smoke, .) is forced to appear on a stereo for a modern audience, but they are more intelligent and colorful in black. Instead of using counts and special effects, the movie is a good story, stylish direction,  r məhsula, maraqlı kamera işinə və güclü fəaliyyət göstərməyə əsaslanan köhnə moda ürəkaçandırır. <br /> <br /> Margheriti, bu elementləri alaraq gözəl bir iş görür və filmin həyəcanını artırır, evin dəhşətli paranormal sirri tədricən özünü bilməyən yazıçıya özünü göstərir. <br /> <br /> There are no mistakes in the movie. The show is drifting at the beginning of the movie (ironically, I missed the first 20 minutes). This can worsen with the efforts of Sinapse films to restore the original length of the movie. Although the fans were likely to see the fans re-installing the film, it could have been a barrier to entry - more than a help. English voice boards are only passive, and on reverse scenes, the language is translated from English into French (English subtitles) and some viewers worry. <br /> <br /> However, Synapse Films deserves the best of its print quality. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty glad to see this movie and I recommend to everyone who owns the 60th Italian Goth movie or a good dream story. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom Winnipeg, MB Canada
