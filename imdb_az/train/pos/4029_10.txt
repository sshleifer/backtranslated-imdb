I have no words to describe how good this movie is. A genius, such as Amrita Pritam, could have written such a realistic description of the division. Urmila played the role of her life in this film. He lived in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai was less like Rashid. It is difficult to imagine those involved in Puroo and Rashid's role apart from these two men. The Punjabi suits looked like Urmila and Manoj naturally looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha was an incredible job like Lajjo and Suri Ramchand. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job like Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some scenes can not be ignored. Puroo first tears your eyes when you meet Lajjo. Boredom is only murderous. <br /> <br /> This film is about Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras and others. It is divided into the same category. Not to be missed.
