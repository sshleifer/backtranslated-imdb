Only I would like to have Jedi's return, which is almost entirely unnecessary, with many other ewok scenes. <br /> <br /> This time, our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia is now fighting with Solo, Luke is boring, Darth Vader is not as bad as before, and Yoda dies. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <3> Emperor (now bad) 4 - The drivers follow the endorse tree. 5-The last battle. 6-Black boots scene. 7-The return of Anak to the good side of power. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Someone is so good that they can tear your eyes. If some scenes were cut off and another director was hired, it would be perfect as the episodes 4 and 5, but it is still unusual. 10 to 9 o'clock.
