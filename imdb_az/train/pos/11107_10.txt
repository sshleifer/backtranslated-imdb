Sopranos (now ready to sing) is the peak of adult television and drama. When it hit the Sopranos brand, it really does. Using great writing and great actors (many of which are additions from Goodfellas), the series is heartwarming, with unexpected and exceptional advancement. James Gandolfini, who began to shed, was Tony Soprano for all intense purposes and, of course, holding himself Edie Falco. The series also has a great collection of tools to maintain consistency with the necessary tools (usually violence and bad language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are the second major characters in every episode. <br /> <br /> Sopranos also includes names like Steve Buscemi (great!), Joe Pantoliano (big!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. despite the great family drama and rare story lines, is a realistic interpretation of modern mafia societies that have managed to become a rare television. Symbolism and simple story lines, dreams, shooting and many other things create stories and relationships that are similar to each other at the end of each season, when they are set up to create another perfect HBO package.
