Jim Carrey is as good as the usual and although there are several Jim Carrey moments, this is not necessarily a Jim Carrey movie. <br /> <br /> This is mainly targeted at children, like this movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In Israel, another Jim Carrey film was put forward. I can not say this movie LOVE, but I'm not yet a target audience!
