Top notch Columbo from start to finish. Especially I love the relationship between Columbo and murderer Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As an admirer of Columbo, I do not remember anyone else in other episodes. This, at last, looks at the correct sequence of boxes and trying to identify the "message" behind the brother. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is also very good, as others do.
