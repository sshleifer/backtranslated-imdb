I will always have a gentle spot for this Disney flick, the other part is trying to create the "Mary Poppins" success and the live action / part animated entries that you never want to do. When I was at school at school, we would have a classroom all the time, the whole school would be in the cafeteria, and a movie would be an old way, a lot of wheels, and a projection of each one. At that time, it seemed like an event and Bedknobs and Broomsticks were one of those movies I could ever remember. <br /> <br /> And it's very attractive since I remembered. Angela Lansbury did not name anything she was not at least authorized to, and she could attract her in a magical bedroom (boy, may be wrong, could not?) And she could take some young people. children in magical adventures in remote places. Come on, what does a child want for a bed? <br /> Level: A
