The biggest surprise in this film was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Usually, she plays a street-clever, clever, world-weary character, not usually playing stereotypic ditzy blonde roles. Although he does not have a big role, though, it's a great job depicting Lois Harlan as a tired woman, although she is covering for her boss indiscretions, although she is used.
