Yesterday I saw "The Grudge" and wow ... I was so scared, a good thing. I love horror movies and I really liked it. There were many 'surprise' scenes (what's the English word?) That you jumped to your seat. Although it was difficult to laugh out of the audience, it was difficult to laugh. I think the most scary scenery ... on the bus, when the face is on the window, or when Yoko goes to the crap. Makeup is also very good. Sometimes you could actually see that there, but it was still strange to the stage. The boy was really very good, very scary and so afraid of scaring. The next time I heard a crackling noise, I'm afraid of it.
