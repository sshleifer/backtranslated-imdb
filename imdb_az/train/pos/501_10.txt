That's the best Star Trek series, and I'm saying POTENTIAL .. we all know that they have a chance to leave the ball and avoid ideas ... But I hope! For those who do not see! Yes! Everyone could have been so cool without any annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" that they encountered in any race they encountered ... and Scott Bakula was a great choice for Captain without any doubt and Vulcan Babe was hot ( see decontamination area) I gave it full 10 ... throws all other series openers .. I hope this is more than 7 years ...
