"Moonstruck" is a movie I've watched for the first time. I liked it for the second time. I liked it for the third time. <br /> <br /> Dear, but really good. The film presents a very warm humor. The story takes place in NYC's old school Italian neighborhood. Cherine likes to look for love. This film made Nicholas Cage the best work. The old man's symbol is fantastic. It illuminates the screen without speaking a word. The scene with fantastic dogs was fantastic every month. But the best character is played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The rise of the film is the scene where the main symbols are put on the olive table in the family cuisine. Emergency direction and imprint.
