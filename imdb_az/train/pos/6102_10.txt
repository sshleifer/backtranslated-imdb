I have to give this movie to only one of the 10 people, because it did not make many films shot in a black audience. This movie did not escape from all the video prostitutes and jumped into gangsters, rappers and bad language. The physicians examined many relationships between the African Americans and African American men / women romantic relationships at a completely new and fresh level. With a tough mix of films with very difficult and difficult issues, I was impressed by the slightest humor. The film also feels happy and sad. I also saw the Boston Film Festival. I've featured AMC Loews in Boston, and I hope this movie is a bigger audience. Black nations (and anyone else) would be LOVE a movie like this - if the industry is just enough to put them there SMART <br /> <br /> Additionally, if a doctor, a resident, a medical student is a premedical student, married to a doctor, a doctor has a brother, a family has a doctor, or a great doctor's time - they love this movie as well. This is highly appreciated by resident physicians, residents, and medical students in the film. Dennis Cooper is in the inner medicine clinic - as he definitely applies his knowledge / experience to the film and looks very clear.
