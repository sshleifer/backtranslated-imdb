Wrestlemania was in need of a rescuer as WWE was around 14 events. The separation of Brett Hart and subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation did not stop Vile D-Generation X at WWE. Their respected leader, Shawn Michaels, stole Hart's title through Vince McMahon's intervention and helped everyone who challenged his systematic superiority with the help of H and Chyna. But a new contender appeared in Royal Rumble. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated by McMahonagement, Austin DX was worried. In fact, they were helped by Mike Tyson's special assistant, "The Unfortunate Planet on the Planet." <br /> <br /> Firstly, at the start of the Legion of Doom, there were NO.1 participants for the "Royal" tag names after the unforgettable 15 team battles. I forgot the existence of this match until I denied the PPV. It was very good and in fact, at that time there was no depth in the division section. <br /> <br /> In the next match, the name of the Lightweight Athletics defended by Aguila against Champion Taka Michonoku was shown. WWE WCW has set up a Light Heavyweight Title to compete with a powerful Cruiserweight division. It did not succeed, and it was the only time in Wrestlemania where the address was never defended. The short match lasts about five minutes and is too short to be too short. <br /> <strong> <strong> <strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Shewn Michaelsin in December RAW's extreme fashion and Owen Hart ' did not defend PPV against. Triple H achieved a great deal with the DX group to fulfill the theme song. Triple H to China accompanied his wife, but then confiscated the WWE Commissioner, Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a nice little match, Chyna led to a down strike that led to Triple H, which holds Hart's lead guarantees. <br /> <br /> Of course, we want to get away from the next match in real life with Marc Mero and Sable and Goldust in real life and Luna Wagon is the first mixed match in Wrestlemania for 8 years. And all honesty was not worth the wait. Though not terrific, the match was not memorable. <br/> <br /> <br /> We have later evaluated Ken Shamrock's Intercontinental Championships as a refugee and self-esteem. He destroyed the IC champion, but did not want his leg to be locked, so the judge declined. <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team saw the first good night of the night as New Age Outlaws, Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie lost their names. fun dumpster game. <br /> <br /> Unlike the player used in the match, "Cactus" and "Chainsaw" had thrown "Splinters" into the trash, but it was still a fun game. <br /> <br /> For the first of the first anticipated first meeting between Kane and his brother, Alttachi. Kane said that Undertaker had "knocked down" the WWE Championship at Royal Rumble and then locked Shawn Michaels in a coffin she was shot and that his parents had burned his house and had previously committed a treacherous year before. <br /> <br /> This was a good game, and Underataker said a wonderful event as he could beat him with three gravestones to throw him to Kane everything and then finish the match. WWE faced with Steve Austin, Champion Mike Tyson, leaving only the main event I saw. Michaels had a poor injury during a match with Undertaker at Royal Rumble and drew attention to this match, despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were exiled back in the early stages after intervention. The match ends with Austin's Sweet Chin Music initiative and hit Stone Cold Stunner. TYson then marked the victory with Austin and then hit the ring for three score, beat Michaels after the match. <br /> <br /> This was the final PPV game for Shawn Michaels for the fourth and half year. He founded Austin as the biggest star in wrestling, and Tyson's main clearance was an important turning point in WWE's fight with WCW. Austin would continue to be the biggest star in WWE history, and along with Rock, Mick Foley, Undertaker, and Triple H managed WWE throughout the period at which they could reach the highest level of cultural communication. All this has started here on Wrestlemania 14.
