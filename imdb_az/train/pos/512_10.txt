It is a remarkable invention of "Stairway to Heaven", probably never repeats. I agree with the "African Wizard of the Wizard" and "African Queen", although this is a different film from the "African Hero". "Stairway to Heaven" uses psycho-drama, executive concepts and technical effects that are completely unique to my knowledge. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of B & W and color images - there is nothing but a simple, but beautiful effect, as well as Oz, as opposed to Oz. In Stairway, the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be strongly described. <br /> <br /> Another striking aspect of Stairway is "time" and how it is used here. Could it have been better for anyone to stop the time? just what? And then it's the Stairway itself! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination you will agree with me. "The Staircase to Paradise" is a real gem.
