I first saw this movie on British TV 25 years ago and last week bought a DVD copy on ebay. I recalled music sequences, colors and bright fashion plaques and dresses, but the area was previously weaker than Anne Neagle / Michael Wilding in Park Lane, and did not look good until the Mayan years passed. But Michael Wilding is joyful, seductive, funny, debonair, great fun, and looks like on the form. Only you have to watch it. Anna Neagle looks slightly alongside her and plays a little bit, but to the public until the end of the 1940s. Spring Lane Park, a great deal of money in 1947 and earned a great deal of money. In her biography Wilding wrote her great honor to Herbert Wilcox, the director and founder of these London films.
