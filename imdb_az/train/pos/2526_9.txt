This is awesome! In Story mode, you will go from punk to pro. We have to complete the ski slopes covering skating, driving, and hiking. Create your own skater and name it and you can look stupid or real. Until you betray your bet, you'll play with your friend Eric until you start a skateboard team (you can choose a team) and then start your own team! Tony Hawk Pro has many levels like Skater 2 from New Jersey, Manhattan and even the Second School (not even part of the story mode). You can unlock hidden skateboards like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals such as SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can write down the purpose of creating infantry and talking. If you do so, you can do premade purposes in premade parks. I did not like this game, and sometimes it was difficult to drive. 9/10.
