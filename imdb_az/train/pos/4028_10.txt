Unlike most of the other reviewers here, I come to Pinchar. I am newer than Bollywood films and grew up and grew up in the United States. I do not have a broad basis to compare Pinjar with other Indian movies. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> Movies to quit any studio anywhere. * Crouching Tiger could be the Indian equivalent of the Hidden Dragon, when it was widely advertised in the United States on massive scale scale. It was a film that Bollywood put on the American map. There is a long-lasting love affair with American film-makers Gone With the Wind, and Pinjar has some similarities that are not borrowed from this area. <br /> <br /> In 1947-48, a young man's drama, which fronts the indefatigable background of the Indian-Pakistani region. He was arrested for the sake of the circumstances and created no difficulty in creating a woman. <br /> <br /> If the story is in no way incomprehensible, it is in the exposition. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: As a person, the growth of Puro (hero) will be better described - at least for the western audience, who does not know Indian culture - back story ", but it took 3 1/2 hours or perhaps more than three hours of film, and it's really a waste of time without a minute's fading and editing it. <br /> <br /> I can use many words to describe Panahan: "severe," "uncomfortable," "attractive," "heartbreaking" immediately comes to mind, but "uplifting" maybe followed by any of the following: it should be regarded as any story that has the worst attitude toward the warranty, and Cuban's victory is perhaps not surprising for those around you. I can not recommend it at a high level. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about Urmila Matondkar's Cigar portrait. Urmila, a young man, is often seen in the shooting of new actresses, and has a unique ability to play a completely reliable role in his role. It is not just a cigar but a breath of life. Rashid inspired Manoj Bajpai's choice. Indian movie heroes manage very little thing: subtle. It is important for the role of expression and nuance command. <br /> <br /> You only see a Bollywood movie in your life, make Pinjar. The first part of the film creates more danger.
