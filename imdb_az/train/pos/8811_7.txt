11 different filmmakers from different parts of the world gathered in this movie to present their views and ideas on the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you can see in any movie. Such films are rarely made and appreciated. This film tries to touch every possible part of the WTC. <br /> <br /> Some of the most important stories from the film's film make this movie rare. <br /> <br /> There is a story of Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran), who is preparing for America's attacks on a site in Iran. A teacher tries to teach his students about the innocent people killed in the WTC massacre. Then comes a story from Yosef Chahine (Egypt) as a Dead-Hard Core Terrorist who deals with a Deadly Soldier and a WTC attack on a Film Maker WTC attack. Then we see a story called Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), Five innocent children, see a group of Osama Bin Laden and plan to abduct him and win the American Prize. Then you see a story called Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico), where you see a Black Screen and you will see the real images of WTC buildings slowly. People in the building are jumping off to save their lives. Another most important story is Mira Nair (India), her mother, struggles to honor the Dead End, which is fake in the WTC massacre! After the September 11 attack, when we hear two names in any part of the world, our heart begins to pumps automatically. The first is the World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This film completely changes our perception and gives it a strong point by claiming something more. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone who loves this kind of Home DVD Collection. Make sure you pay every penny you spend. But do not expect anything else in this DVD on Movies. Of course, filmmakers have Filmography, but there is no Extra feature.
