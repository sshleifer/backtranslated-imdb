Entertainment is very entertaining and excellent as Chip Hardesty, playing a good role by Jimmy Stewart, Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, has been constantly violated, and has been closely monitored and monitored by J. Edgar Hoover as he was dressed in all aspects of the film. J. Edgar Hoover did not have any pride. Since 1924 the Bureau's management has been based on the world's best investigative services until its death. However, by 1959, Hoover was worried about the violence and began to gather people on strong people to secure and retain his small kingdom. And he was determined not to show any movie because he did not show any picture on the office. Films show only the successes and shimmers due to the failures, and the bureau takes part in witch hunts in the early 1950s. Take pleasure in the story, but with a tongue absolutely cheek.
