Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) goes out of the reform school and returns to the summit. Her sister, Ann Sheridan, does everything she can to get rid of trouble, but she is just following her. In addition to bringing the ship to Termit's network, Gabala is being followed by real-life gangsters who build a scheme to cover it with accidental buildings. He needs a guilty soul, and that's Gabe. <br /> <br /> The scene that offers dead ends is really good. The boys walked around the street on the streets of the new residents and they continue to do so. They talk to each other in accent on the background and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap on the podium. <br /> <br /> Children start fighting with a new boy, but ask themselves to join her club after being a good warrior. <br /> <br /> Starting scene is very good, <br /> <br /> Billy Halop later dreamed about being a mayor of the school. <br /> <br /> Angels wash their faces is a great name, because these angels escape the success of the Dirty Faces, and really tells their children what they are doing. It's bad for bad guys in the group, these guys are beautiful in this movie. But it does not seem unsuccessful, it makes some great laughs. Many of these children are a front view of something in The Bowery Boys series. We can still get some terrible words from Leo Gorcey.
