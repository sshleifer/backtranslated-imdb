The feeling of this movie was beautiful. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. As he played a very desperate and fragile character, he succeeded so far and played a really real role. His character was really interesting. I've read the script for this movie, and Sandler does not see me in the half-created section. For somebody who is mainly playing comedy roles, he has taken a serious role in what appears to be its quirks and input. In particular, Adam and Dawn's characters appeared on the motor scooter around the city. I met him because Adam seemed to be out of the question because he had seen Done as a witness. His video seemed to escape from his thoughts by playing his scooter with his ears so as not to think of the past, with games, music, and other things. This movie is definitely worth the watch.
