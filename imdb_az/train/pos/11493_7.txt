Unborn is a terrific film of pretty good budget that exploits pregnancy-related fears. It's always a very good move by Brooke Adams and b-movie stalwart James Karen, though the supporting player is quite average for the b-grade student. The music of all people by Gary Numan is also very good. The writing of Henry Dominic is quite elegant for such a thing, although there is an idea about it. Rodman Fender's direction is just enough and there are some unnecessary cheap fears. The film's career is not as popular as it is, if you're a fan of Adams, check it out; as always.
