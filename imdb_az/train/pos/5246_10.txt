This film is worthy of the world's brilliant description of how it is in a playboy mind. When I saw that I was modest in the world, it was important for me to write what story to do, and that's what we will never experience. Tim Meadows describes Leon Phelps in a very convincing way, and this story drew me to the perfect world of Leon, and for a moment I forgot that he was watching a parody of the playboy world and was forced to rebel against it. The big and courageous success in the fight with wisdom comes at the price of its success, because it is against the film. When I understand that most cinematographers will only respond to the story of this movie and reject the story, I avoid them misunderstood and admit that I love it. I liked it not only for the entertaining description of the sex drive's deception, but also for the courage to explore the fearlessness of the heterosexual shadow, for the fascinating ideas of the playboy's deceptive mind. Besides, it's just funny.
