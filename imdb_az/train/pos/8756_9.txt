I took this movie in the middle of the newspaper with cables and I leased it to see its fullness and I was glad. I immediately drafted the story and took care of the attracted girls. Naive high school graduates, the best friends since childhood, are riding a school and face serious difficulties by serious people called Nick. They are used as sacrificial mules in a ring of heroin smuggling. The girls they are taken into custody learn to fight with prisons while trying to overcome their concerns. When the criminal justice system in Thailand shows shortcomings and girls are more concerned, and their American lawyer Yankee Hank loses credibility. Hank attempts to defend them after betraying Alice (Claire Dane). However, Hankly, a native Thai woman, discovered the scent of rats and investigated some footprints and found the girls in a really bad condition. When Alice made a selfless act to get Darlene (Beckinsale), the end of the movie cried. I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it.
