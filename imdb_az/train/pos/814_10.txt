Thanks to Kevin Smith, a group of geeks runs, saying that Jedi's return is no good, because it's really fun. And oh no! Muppets Attend! This is bad! Everyone liked the Jedi return whenever someone in Kevin Smith did not make a negative comment on this subject. Now, if suddenly you notice how much a person loves you, you have some sort of illness. This movie is better than Kevin Smith, even though I even thought that a person would even deny it. This movie is good fun! It's awesome, as I remember when I was six people! Stop this movie and Kevin Smith's ideas stealing! Its not right! <br /> <br /> And the Ewok song ruled the end! Do not even enjoy the "Ewoks: battle for Endor"! I'll put you in the fire!
