"Atlantis" is a new and correct step for the Disney feature. Filming with a mysterious legend like "Atlantis" is a good choice. We did not have any expectations for this movie, but after watching it, I do not understand why this film causes bad reviews. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is not a perfect movie, though it is still one of Disney's biggest doubts, and I doubt that this movie would ever have a "Disney classic" reputation. Yes, this is another situation. It is not fun to think that this fantastic movie is directed by Beauty and the Beast and Hunchback (same as Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, who are trying to get away from their monster movie glory), yes, enough "Atlantis" is a beautiful, exciting, and very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> Even this movie is a PG-rated action feature, which I think is appropriate for children (instead, parents do not kill me to write it). The story can be a little predictable, but it does not destroy the movie The animated series of comic book inspired by the film goes from the usual Disney style.The colorful, dark and detailed The Deep Canvas sequence is quite impressive, (SPOILERS) The characters in this movie are also delighted, but unfortunately, get acquainted with everyone There are not enough time for the screen, so some characters remain behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It is attractive and exotic. (SPOILER) The most influential of this film is the Atlantic language voices that are very natural, ethnic and stubborn. This is really awesome (CLAIMS) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> So, do not listen to your craftsmen and watch Atlantis because you are waiting for you ...
