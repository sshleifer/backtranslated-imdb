It's better than a mid-silent movie, and it's worth seeing if it's a fan of the silent. But if you're still not an admirer of the genre, I suggest you try a few movies before watching it. Because the area is just too old and hard to believe in stains. But still, this is still a good movie and it has kept my interests. <br /> <br /> A good lady, unfortunately, tied up with the wrong guy and fled to get married. The film begins five years after it realizes that it is a cruel thief. Nevertheless, he tries to do his best, and does not pay attention to how good a life has been before this excitement. But it is rentable and there is no money, so she has to look at the job. His family becomes a personal seamstress for a rich woman trying to break a business deal. Unfortunately, lady who is trying to shut down a potential customer with a dinner feast can not do that, and the merchant is paying for the convenience of having a date. Well, like Cinderella, it is so well cleaned and the person is full of it! What will we do now that he is married and his new friend wants to marry her? Well, see for yourself how the movie is solved. She did not know how she missed her husband, because it seemed to have been very premature and stupid. But after leaving, I was surprised how the film did not give a few pieces and left the film with a few empty spots. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's a good movie to see, but certainly not great.
