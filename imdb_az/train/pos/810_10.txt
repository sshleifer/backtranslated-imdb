This is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. The starting point of the film was almost the episode IV - the cave of cabaret music and the cabaret Jabba Hutt's thoughts on a cabaret site that further aggravated the seriousness. Luca Lukan ordered that Banta be killed in a basement hole by bone-dimming teeth, which seemed to be a cross between a mirror and a shark. Luke's Jedi powers finally finish his monster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Star Wars "good guys", especially the R2-D2, had other ideas ... and other ideas influenced Luka's performance; In the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died and could use the power of drowning the death of Princess Leia Jabba. <br /> <br /> Like the episode IV, it looks like the Death Star in Episode VI. While analyzing the rebel fleet that attacked emperor warriors around the Death Star, the Star Imperial Commission, I thought, used the emperor's warriors as a provocation, accelerating the main laser armament. The consistent 20-25 Star Distributor was ready to attack, but the laser gun on Death Star was surprised. After the shooting, the only hope of the rebel fleet was the Death Star deflector shield was destroyed and it was impressed that Lando wanted to destroy the Death Star, but it did not work until it got out of the shield. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> </ font> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> span> </ span> </ div> <div> An unusual way to fight them. For example, Chewbacca was able to reach the order of one of the other Ewok-like marchers (and indeed used to destroy one after another), while other Ewoks were logs used to demolish the other two broadcasters. <br /> <br /> Luka is part of a bicycle piece of things that Jaber can do with his power and Saber's outbursts, as is the case with Endor at his Seven Saber, for example, when Luke was losing shots from a Storm Trooper speed bike. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After Sif Wader and Saber's battle, use Saber at a peak to break his father's arm. <br /> <br /> You know that Ewoks is celebrated after the Death Star, fireworks show, triumph (eg Storm Trooper masks), and Luka finally met with Leia after the nemesis with Luke - Drumming, now dead, burned on a pyre. Ewoks was reading at the feast, but Lucas did not take it - even with the respect of John Williams, the composer. <br /> <br /> I think that in the home cinema version, Lucas wants to end another. Along with the Endor holiday, she also wanted to celebrate a few surviving planets, including a holiday laser shooting destruction of the Sith statue. The song Ewoks was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted additional things to prove that the Death was restored to the rebel galaxy along with the destruction of the Star.
