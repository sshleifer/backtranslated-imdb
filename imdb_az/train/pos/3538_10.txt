The purpose of any James Bond game is to feel as if the player is fulfilling the ultimate fantasy: Step into Agent 007 shoes. "FRWL" is closer to this goal than any game because this time you really are James Bond. There was no attack on Pierce Brosnan, who introduced sound and similarity to "EON", but Sean Connery was the original James Bond, and no one would approach her cool level. <br /> <br /> At this point, say, Sean's 70-year-old voice does not fit the 30-year-old look on the screen, and this continues to get some, but that's certainly worth it. He repeats the limit like "Bond", "James Bond" and "Shaken", "Re-mix". However, Bond said in Octopussy that it was "just the end of the bag" to control the Sir Sean, as the bad organization known as OCTOPUS. The awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel. There is an original barrel coming from the movies. Then, taking the first job, the Prime Minister's daughter's daughter gets her daughter out of the terrorists in Parliament and everything from car to clothes is a perfect retro. The world of the game is really the original James Bond world of the theme of James Bond's classic rock-and-roll theme, which is really played in late Bond's secret factory. <br /> <br /> After the opening of the game, the film is in line with the fidelity of "FRWL". James Bond is sent to Turkey to buy a Lector device from the Russian printer, because he has a crush on it. Bond groups in Turkey with loved sidekick Kerim Bey. The Bond should take the device, protect it with fear, and both return safely to London. In the Bond film studio, writer Bruce Feirstein worked on the script, and though the game was different from the same movie, he did a good job. The characters in the movie are well-designed, but some are better than others. Impersonators unanimously voiced their prowess to Roza Klebb and the Red Grant. <br /> <br /> What does this game do to the shaft? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sir Siran has two different features in front of other Bond games, except for sound and similarity. One is focused on Bond. Just pressing a key and killing each other, you can send the liars, pressing an additional button will allow you to get closer to one goal and choose between Bond spots, such as a grenade launcher. an enemy and a few friends or a belt that will send a rappel cord will drown in a deadly enemy. Another noteworthy feature is that the secret and masculine kill. <br /> <br /> We pressed a button to knock down an enemy of Sean Connery's Bond as well. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery's Bond is basically a raw material talent and talent, so there are only a few gadgets, but they are good. Q-copter is a remote control helicopter capable of self-harming and researching areas that can not reach a better place than the Q-spider in Bond EON. The classic laser watch is useful not only for accessing stamped rooms, but also for sending enemies when you have no other weapons. Playing with Sonic cuff links and a serum pistol is very fun, but you need to live it for yourself. In addition to the gadgets, you can wear a series of retro costumes found during the game, including a gray suit from the movie, a standard black tuxedo, a retro secret suit and a classic white tuxedo. Sir Sean did not do it when he wore them in the movie. Take Aston Martin DB5 out of "Goldfinger" when you shoot in the game. It can not be turned into invisible, but there's a way to create wheels as it's in the movie. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And when you fly in the streets of Istanbul, Goldinger car inside the "Thunderball" fly in the jet pack. <br /> <br /> Then there are many players. Of course, this should be compared to the standard of the GoldenEye game and it is unsuccessful. Also, you can only play Bond villains instead of Bond itself or other heroes of the game. But many players value a decent bonus game for a fun and exciting single player campaign. There are other shortcomings in the main game. The most exciting moments of the film, especially the Gypsy camp shootings, the Bond case with Red Grant in Orient Express and Bond and Rosa Klebb's blade shoes are not justified in the form of a game. And the game is a fast game even in difficult difficulty. But in general, this game is the best James Bond experience ever.
