An NASCAR Maniac viewer like me is interested in the movie. You can see many racing cars since 1983. Even challenging, racing scenes are not very realistic. But I have to admit that before 1995, I have never seen any races before because of the NASCAR race in Germany). <br /> <br /> Like a Burt Reynolds fan I used to film Reynolds in the 80s What we use: Avoid a speedy car behind the wheel as in Bandit movies. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie has become a must-see. If you only love one of two things, I'm coming to watch it. If you do not want NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you still have to give a chance, but remember that this film was far from winning the Oscar Academy Award. <br /> <br /> It's a typical humor of 80s. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you will love it as well.
