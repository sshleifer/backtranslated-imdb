I really enjoyed it - with a lot of questions and ideas to worsen and discuss your thoughts, I am a great fan of films that you have left and this was a great example. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Terry Gilliam is always good (good, almost always.) Let's not forget about Jabberwocky and Brothers Grimm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was really aesthetically good - the direction of art was really great, and I wish I could see it on the big screen. Future scenes have come to be very similar to Brazil in many ways, and even these scenes are often very realistic. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most striking thing is that those who do not like it, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, have both made excellent speeches here. Especially Pitt - I did not see one or two films that understood that I could act in fact (contrary to what I thought), but it really did. In fact, at one point I asked my friends, "Are you sure that Brad Pitt is?" This is probably the most memorable performance of your career (usually you can not say much).
