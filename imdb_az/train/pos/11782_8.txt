<br /> <br /> Military operations in the Caucasus continue with terrorists. </ P> <p> Steel * is like "politically correct" and "neo-marksist". <br /> <br /> The book * I * did not imagine the history of European colonialism in America and South Africa. Even though Europeans are often successful, I have never seen anything in the series that describe Europeans as bad luck - there is nothing fancy. I did not see the indigenous peoples depicted as a poor little innocent. If anything, Inca was very arrogant - if any world leader was dealing with foreign countries, if his country had not been conquered by the memory of another world power. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have never seen anything that can be interpreted as Marxist or Neo-Marxist, except that the most incredible elasticity of imaginations. <br /> Otherwise, many African nations are immune to other tropical diseases, such as Malaria and Europeans. At that time, they were at the height of the success of Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations; they were developed and rich in the world as any other; sometimes more. Aboriginal Americans and the population of Xoi-San have been severely damaged by flower illnesses and other diseases of the Europeans; As a colony of Europe, it was killed by tropical diseases such as malaria. (NOTE: Peoples of Xoi-San are completely different from other sub-Saharan African nations). <br /> <br /> So, I do not see some other commentators complaining. I found something to complain that the series did not say anything I did not know when I finished the seventh grade. There is nothing really new in this movie's history. Nevertheless, he presents some beautiful dramatizations of events such as the Conquest of Congregation; production values ​​are very high; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to the deputy chairman of the Caucasus Muslims Board, I will not learn something new in elementary and / or high school education, but you When you hit high school, you will have fun and enjoyable time watching what you have learned (or not learning).
