It's a shocking, shocking piece of clever work from the extreme English writer Hanif Kurechi, "My Beautiful Laundrette" (which is the best thing ever since). About intelligent people who do not add much to their life. They were given large quantities of empty boats. The only display on the screen is the mother of the character, but a rude employer feels a little bit sympathetic to her and feels as if she is awakened to the joy of her sex. He has motives, but Kureishi treats him with kindness. This is a movie where people and places are acquainted with where they are beyond the screen's limitations. In some cases this is a bit of a tough job, though it is a bit like a "bazaar, bloody market." Director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to instinct. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Kureishi does not even include his shadows in his character. If the film opens a note that exposes it, perhaps it may be a mischievous girl's character, her mother's miscarriage (or another way), and even messier's life, but that's what she plays so well, Cathryn Bradshaw. The look of the film (DoP Alwin Kuchler) is very beautiful and unhesitatingly listed as the best British film of the year.
