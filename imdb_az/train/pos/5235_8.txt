The plot begins to describe: a man writes a movie, but rather * this movie. It is completely self-referential to the point where you believe it will build itself as a black hole. <br /> <br /> The writer writes something and happens or something happens and writes about it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this philosophy, like Waking Life, is more Zen oriented and better. At one point, you personally have street interviews, and then you see the shootings of these people, and then you see their responses are scripted when you slide their lines. There are beautiful scenery and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope the DVD will follow it more closely. 2/25/2002 at Cinequest (San Jose, CA film festival).
