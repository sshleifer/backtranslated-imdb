This is FUNNY film. As the "Antz" and "Egyptian Price" say, less commonly known actors have all the usual Disney components (music, great characters, story, appeal) that are entertained with great animation and perfect sound. /> <br /> Heroes are really good at work and have a strong appeal, and humor is directed to a large extent that prevents worldwide generations. The film is also presented in super cinemascope format, which adds a movie experience. <br /> <br /> Make me naked, but I've seen the movie three times and intend to take more friends to see this weekend. . Many suspects have seen this movie on my recommendation and have not been disappointed. <br /> <br /> I'm dealing with a very prominent job and I'm honest, I say no one left this movie without any sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> See it and turn it off because it animates it. Make sure you enjoy this movie and stay up to date with the latest credits! In the end, the funniest part of the bloopers and out-getting movies, filled with laughter.
