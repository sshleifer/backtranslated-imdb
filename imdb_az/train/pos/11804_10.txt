Hired the movie as a joke. My friends and I was so laughing that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. Now, when all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunters. There is a rule that makes the film better, though it should be said. Words are not allowed when the movie is opened when Sasquatch does not repeat in a single song. At the end of the movie I liked the loan very much. "Thank you for jeep, Tom!" I'm thankful for who Tom is, because no movie was made without Jeep. In short, a great movie, if you are looking for something to laugh. If you want a good movie, you can look at something else, but if you do not laugh at a person's account in a monkey suit, keep a copy of yourself.
