During his visit to the Great Charton Hester after his past, this movie is not the same. <br /> <br /> This film shot in 1973 tried to propagate in 2022. The human scorpion was manipulated by the authorities to eat the universal production product Soylent Green, produced by the human body. <br /> <br /> This strange and incredible movie was ridiculous at the time it was released as it is now, and India's population is likely to be about 2 billion at this stage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Thank God. <br /> <br /> <strong> Cannibalism was applied 40 years before the film was filmed by local people living in New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo, but as long as human civilization was abandoned for a long time. <br /> <br /> Another ridiculous prologue in the film, the film turned into scenarios by turning the tension of radical feminism raised in 1972. <br /> <br /> This film was foolish, and now it was like a stupid, but extremely endless film, although it was not a real reason to watch the movie again by night and by Edward G. Robinson, but for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This film is a dull and even will not be advised by baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. <br /> <br /> All the other theories of this film, a rational theme, I have read all the sounds of a dystopic society in the future that the United States faces only in the ecological disaster. <br /> <br /> The film is merely a dignified fact that there are many people on earth.
