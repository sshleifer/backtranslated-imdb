Giallo fans, look for this rare movie. Well-written and full of all kinds of ordinary low life that covers these films. I do not want to give anything, so I can not say anything about trickery. The entire film creates a strange atmosphere and you do not know what you expect and who can doubt it. Recommended! The only place I've ever seen to buy this movie in English is the $ 15 US Garbage Films.
