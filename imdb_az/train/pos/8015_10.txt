When I was 8 years old, I saw this movie in the theater and still tired me. The Muppets are very cool and they approach the show business in a naive way. The most favorite scene is when the rats launch a whispering campaign on the kermit's fancy restaurant. It is the same and clever movie for children and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the castle gang.
