Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels the way God lives. God welcomes him and shows Bruce's mistakes. Of course, someone may become worse by giving God's authority. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first degree and looks right at home and brings together the castle together. Sugars are almost always targeted, and sometimes Carre√≠n's facial expressions are a little too much. The film really describes God, not just that, but also as a black man. Especially I thought good with the brilliant Freeman. There are some cheerful scenes, for example, the opening cookie scene, some less targeted, but still a good movie. 10 to 6/7
