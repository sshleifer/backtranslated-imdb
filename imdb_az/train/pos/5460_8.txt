Lily Powers is engaged in a job before his father dies. Then he goes to New York to work in an office building. If he wants to get any higher, he should give the men what they want. Alfred E.Green's Baby Face (1933) is a high-definition film. For a film of that era, it was probably one of the latest Pre-Code films. Barkara Stanwyck presents a very sexy performance like Lily. Other actors include George Brent, Donald Cook, Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henri Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) Theresa Harris (Chico). Young John Wayne looks like Jimmy McCoy Jr. This movie deals with a bold theme and is good. The Baby Face is a historically important movie and is therefore good to watch.
