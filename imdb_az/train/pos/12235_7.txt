"The Incredible Ergonomic Man" is a fabulous, terrifying, and energetic Z-grade production that everyone respects the camp-horror strangeness they just have to look at! This is an ideal way to describe the low-budget 70's, a shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... just a thousand times harmless! Astronaut Steve West is a survivor of a catastrophic space mission, even removing the carrier of a terrible disease that radiates and protects it ... causes it to dissolve! After seeing his face in the mirror, shock (do you blame him?), Steve brings a bust from his illness, leaves a trace of a sticky arc and goes back to the body parts. Dr. Ted Nelson must find it urgently, and Steve has put an endless appetite on human flesh. The stage may sound stupid, but this flick is very entertaining and has great makeup effects from Rick Baker's hand. Her friend's face looks like a rotten pizza and her heavy breath sounds like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is that William Sachs does not spend any time in scenarios, tedious scientific comments or emotional conversations. Invincibility begins immediately and continues until the last moment of the film. Just enjoy this horrible horror cruise and start thinking about a lot of stupidity in the scenario, avoiding all the fun of the camp, as you try to extinguish your brains as much as possible!
