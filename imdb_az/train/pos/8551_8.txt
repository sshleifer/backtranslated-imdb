It feels a bit like Porkys for the 2000s. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise for me, with some great funny characters combining some great things. <br /> <br /> Although it was outside of one of the original films, this movie was really fun. Do not let too much excitement, the accuser should get it for the comedy, but why it is superior.

Do not wait for the classic American Pie, but wait one hour or more to laugh and draw attention.
