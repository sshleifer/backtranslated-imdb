This film is a little bit of the sun in a dark season. It marks the best quality described as plain old friendship. Morgan Freeman loves himself as Freeman - a successful player up to 70. He traveled to a small, very scary grocery store that was going to explore a section where he could play as a manager of a place. <br /> <br /> Soon, the cranked, young woman (Paz Vega) crew and its customers, especially charming, are presiding over the pay line, "10 products or less." <br /> <br /> There is a great comment to make 10 items or less, and does not claim to have done so. Freeman and Vega are friends after they have been friends, and when the old man offers his advice, instead of traveling home, he never shows a movie company, which he intended to take, and Freeman could not help his phone number. In New York, gray Sunday afternoon, the blues had a bit of a claim and this flick made things worrying about me.
