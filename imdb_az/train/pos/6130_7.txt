Surprisingly good. The actor was entertaining, the scenario was fun, fun was fun, the plot was entertaining. It was a fun movie to watch and relax for your brain. The pieces of the site and quotes I saw was very creative. 10 out of 7. In fact, this is worth 10 out of 10. You do not need to compare this to a movie movie or bloody slasher.
