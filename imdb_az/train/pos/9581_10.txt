This film belongs to the eighteenth century Harlem ball period. Though Palazzo is much more fun than Volpi, this film is a true crux of smoking. Heroes can not help because of their stupidity. The only purpose of the middle class intellectuals is to document the garbage and glits phenomena. Here, the most genius in the garbage is a very well-documented and necessary glamor. The words of the heroes for all the idolatry, which is glamorous, cause the characters to be more fond of themselves, part of the viewer, who creates a "phenomenon of phenomenon" that creates the art of this film.
