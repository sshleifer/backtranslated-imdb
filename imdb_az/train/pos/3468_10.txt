I absolutely loved this movie! I hesitated to watch first because I thought it would be very painful. I remember how difficult John was when he was shot. But when I was waiting for "Two People", she was happy when she was still alive, and she had hopes and expectations. I think the writer did an incredible job that he describes as "may be." Aidan Quinn liked Pavel and became acquainted with the coach. I was amazed at his accent and behavior. Jared Harris was also very talented and quite convincing as John. My favorite part was a scene in the park and it was on the bed - it was very scary. The film has left me with embarrassment and pleasure, both in terms of circumstances and from the feelings I like.
