So, a group will come together for a reunion concert, but they can not just come together. It is not here. This gig is just brilliant, from start to finish. These three musicians have come together in advance and have planned and planned what is needed to ensure that no one is a nostalgic bash to satisfy one's ego. Even before you go to the stage, it is clear from the beginning. When these people performed for the first time, many faces of the crowd were not born. From their first song, they make the name of the green magic, Creme, 3 men, 3 tools. Clapton admitted that he had to extend himself for this concert, because he was a keyboard, a synthesizer, and so on. We will be able to see the best of it because it is not. Ginger Baker, why today many drummers speak of some kind of drumming guru? Jack Bruce is just great. They have really collected a magic piece that has been tested for years in the future. It's 10 for me.
