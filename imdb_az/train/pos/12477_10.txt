My family and I have often watched this movie for years. It is clean, efficient, hearty and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> To show compassion through thousands of kilometers from the two families of the two countries and most accidentally coincidentally, it was almost a matter of God's hand. <br /> <br /> Five-year-old Jodelle Micah Ferland <br /> <br /> Generally, 10-year-olds are 10. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the little girl, who suffers from heart failure, does a great job performing her part. This is a sweet human story. Children of all ages will look tearfully, then watch with joy and bring their followers smiling and good feelings.
