<br /> <br /> My and my girlfriend Annette watched it together and we will comment on it. <br /> <br /> Although Dicken's case had some freedom, we both watched it. Dicken's works are somewhat dark and frightening (including Oliver Twist), but this movie has changed all that. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> ANNETTE: It really says more than Travis. I do not emphasize how good the dance numbers are. POLICY: Three actors have attracted IMO attention; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Adam, Oliver Reed can really do a good deed. A scene from your eyes in the mailbox caused me to sneeze behind the back ... AWESOME. And this kid Jack Wild was a perfectly polite Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (the man felt bad when he was killed). She can read so much! Kudos makes choices for the casting unit there. I hated Oliver Twist boy. It was so luxurious for my taste. <br /> <br /> <strong> One MP living in the Caucasus </ strong> <br /> <br /> Besides Travis who spoke three stars, Ron Moody (Fagin) also did a great job. He was very funny and at the same time very bad. Supporting actors were also very large. Harry Secombe, Mr Bumble, had a very good role. And he has a beautiful sound. I saw Mr. Secombe perform in another film called "Davy", where he played a happy opera singer. Talented Garry Secombe should be in more movies. TRAVIS: As mentioned earlier, this story is quite true for the book, but IMO is stronger. As with some musical pieces, this movie was not so rich. And you've acted together with the symbols of sustainability. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <P> <p> And this is truly a rare finding. It's a very easy-to-follow product that ends up watching in an extremely comfortable and pleasing way. <br /> <br /> All the films were an interlude that was refreshing on a day when the effects were tense. <br /> <br /> Their overall rating was 8.5. (We will finish up to 9 in this case). TRAVIS: I appreciated this at 7 because I was being tortured by the Oliver Twist boy (Mark L.) and irritated me with the extreme sensitive ears of his songs. Otherwise, it was a great movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is not much better. It was a really hard job for everyone involved in this production ... you can say a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please do not miss out here ... Normally, even if music is not. This is really a rare treat.
