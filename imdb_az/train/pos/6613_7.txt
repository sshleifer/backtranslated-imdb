A very unique Sci-Fi animated film and, frankly, I love the uniqueness, no matter where you are or better. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This French movie watching is quite interesting, the technique part is innovative, I recently watched as "Waking Life". <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to get used to the strange white style, but in the end I love it, sketchy pictures are really fancy! The future world is a symbol of the ultimate goal of human race. I love him very much. <br /> <br /> The whole area is good for Sci-Fi, but not as interesting as some of Hollywood <br /> <br /> So I'm a great mischief of humanity eternity, a little clich√©, It is not very convincing, some developments are very straightforward and unusual. As for the eternity of life, I think that most people have come to unity that we do not want eternity because it limits the meaning and meaning of life because it is limited and meaningful if everyone lives forever, the world is a disaster and will be chaos. It is difficult and heartfelt to leave a loved one, but only one way to show the truths of our lives, and all the emotions fulfill their lives and make the world colorful and alive.
