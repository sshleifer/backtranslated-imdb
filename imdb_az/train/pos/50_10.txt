My kids stopped the night in this movie and I was interested in what started. I had to take the lead in the bowling league, so I celebrated them in DVR because I could watch the rest. Yes, I just succeeded in watching him, and my shirt was soaked in front of the slippers. Although I could almost feel the pain and anger of these girls, it was a perfect movie. And for a million years, Alissia will never find the cause of this beautiful girl going to an anti-social gothic. It probably moistened my jacket because Alissia had the same pain I felt. I did not call this movie, but I was convinced that I was glad. Very moving, very touching. It's great for those who love a good drama or tearful girl.
