In the old trademark label for empty voice cassettes "Is Real or Memorex?" The same may be the case for events in this episode - the design and remix of the first pilot of the Star Trek, The Cage. Mr. Spock, the first captain of the ship, burned and disaster, Capt Christopher ordered the ship to take him to the Talos IV summit, which was banned to return to Picasso. Why Finish? Talos invokes a death sentence because he has nothing to do with IV. Why such a thing is not explained - I was very disturbed - but if nothing else, this story adds. After leaving the boat for Talos IV, Spock was imprisoned for his arrest. McCoy (plus Captain Kirk on board) says, "I'm never charged." Let's see how the Talosans - Capt Pike, whatever the risk of the death of Mr Spok (paralysis is a clear cause). The illusions, background music and all the story lines created by the Tales are fantastic. And Keeper (Chief Talosian) like Meg Wyllie is beautiful. Call me a sexist, but to have a woman in this role never happened to me, but she was perfect! Talos are both indifferent, almost completely abstaining from the physical activity and the power of illusion; you can not really say that you are a woman or a woman, and it is not really important. This episode is more than any other episode in the series hoping for me and praying that there are other worlds and there are so-called civilizations so far! If this is so, what a bad thing! This is one of my favorite episodes, and although I have seen it many times (even if I have a video), it will not love me. Meg Wyllie sees as an alien and does not mean it's a trifle.
