When you see the cover of the DVD, this B class B cheesy cheapie made sure that you prepared a $ 1,000 movie in the back yard. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is a good material and is really good. This is a comedy and a clever thing. And spots, kindness touches a beautiful place. The production values ​​are very good (it looks amazing), actors are known, the film's orientation and sets are very good. This is amazing. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasus> Billy Connolly, "Fido" is as great as the awesome awesome zombie; Tim Blake Nelson ("Theopolis") should not be overlooked too much young K'Sun Ray "Timmy Robinson," a Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker (check) as a hoot sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy" with heroes like Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker. In fact, the film has more lines than anyone else. <br /> <br /> If you tell this story, I sound so stupid that a few can watch it. Here you just have to take the words of your favorite people and find it a very, very pleasant surprise. Although you need a mixed humor concept; Evaluation of absurdity.
