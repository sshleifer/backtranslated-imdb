"Outfield Fields Angels" was the first film from the Ted Turner library in 1951; Disney was also using the California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) team in 1994 (as used by Disney this and Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey team), well, use words well, huh ???? <br /> <br /> This film was about a few orphans who want a family. A man promised his sons a family, only the angels won the flames. So he called God about it one night. The boy praying could see the help from the road (and only that boy); When the first angel came, for example, a player was not so difficult to hit the ball, he was defeated, the ball made it !!!!! For the post-All Star season of 1994, Angels AL West (one of my home team Rangers was and still) was on top. But the boy lost a game after staying in the court instead of White Sox / Angels (there was no central division in Baseball, so he stayed in Chicago in Chicago) and no angel would help. So a new rule was created: no angel can play in the championship. But wait! In the final championship game, Angels won !!!!! This was really a miracle! <br /> <br /> What's nice about this movie: It's a good movie. I would like to say that in the last few years I prayed every night to ask for help to school and things; now see me! My job was good !!!!! So, if you believe in one of these, God can send angels to help you with any difficulty in your life. And secondly, this is always an exciting family baseball movie. It's also an old Disney movie; <br /> <br /> The new contest was featured on the New Disney Channel. <br /> <br /> 10/10
