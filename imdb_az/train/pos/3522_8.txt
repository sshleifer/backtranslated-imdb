This can not be the best memorable film of the Noir era, but it presents some great performances from a great mystery structure, a shared noir atmosphere and less well-known players. Robert Siodmak, the lead film director of the mysterious / terrific classic "The Spiral Staircase," focuses on the above film two years ago and has shown his true ability to create a dark and dark atmosphere. the audience delights. Phantom Lady, over Scott Henderson; married a woman who did not like a man. She chooses a lady in a big hat for one night, and both are enjoying the "no extra line" night. However, he returns home to find an apartment full of police officers, and he knows the reason he is there soon is that his wife is drowning in one of the necklaces! Imagine that nobody meeting with a mysterious woman can remember her, and, naturally, sent the jury for her husband's murder. But, fortunately, she becomes a beautiful woman worker ... <br /> <br /> The plot moves in a beautiful way and is more interesting than most well-known. In fact, if he had been forty years old and had not been stuck in black and white, Phantom Lady was an Italian Giallo! Intermediate characters are quite interesting, Alan Curtis provides a good illustration of the failed victim and Ella Raines is as effective as a surprise detective. The real picture of the movie is Fran√ßo Tone, who delivers a memorable performance as a crazy creature. The film also plays a role in supporting Elisha Cook Jr, a featured actor playing drums in the most memorable part of the film. If I criticized this film, I would say that the identity of the killer is a little too early - though Phantom Lady deserves a few credits on this frontline although it is the original way to go. The summary is satisfactory and everything is meaningless (possibly considering this line), and Phantom Lady, of course, is one of the largest and least common nuances!
