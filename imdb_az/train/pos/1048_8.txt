The society does not explicitly approve of such conducts, and equally equally it can not be ready to see it as a punishment, of course, to continue. Fortunately, the Cameroon's law promises equality to all, and this documentary follows the real-life experiences of various female practitioners in the Cameroon's Law system because they are trying to ensure justice for a number of women and children. Despite the fact that the outstanding (apart from the rising central story), despite their registration, the courts are practically practically progressing. This program also gives an interesting insight into the lifestyle of Cameroon.
