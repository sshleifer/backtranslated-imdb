I have never seen a lot of German comedy, but if I have something to go on, I have to see more! A simple but effective story takes two different people from Germany to Italy after the two unemployed mother Eva, and the artist determines that her husband has a relationship with a rich lawyer. I will not reveal anything more, but the results are a very comic series with a perfect result. The interest to international cinema has grown since I first saw this movie. I advise everyone (not to encourage anyone to believe that juvenile children are included in a family movie).
