The Ossessione was loose in style (or I'm not sure if Joze M. Cain's Postman is Always Rings Twice and Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange twice or not), for the first time by director Luchino Visconti, The scene is far superior to music (both diegetic and non-diegetic) and with the use of actors. When I saw Visconti seeing La Terra Trema and sometimes seeing his political motives a little scattered, I did not know what to do with his materialistic approach. However, this is a completely characteristic and emotionally-based drama limited to melodrama (but without the conventions that conceal little ones) and visconti, like any other neo-realist movie, in the best way of the movie's noir movement. Neo-realism can also be claimed to be justified, as well as with a father who follows the war (De Sica's Children Behaves Us). Although love and romance are more than just the most popular neo-realistic efforts here, it is handled by a bare-bones story and is full of other topics that are familiar to neo-realism (sub-class, death) <br /> As described on this site, Visconti captures and then objects them (shadows and darkness, which tend to overcome the feelings of the Italian streets in most of the subsequent scenes (usually on Gian and Giovanna) and many scenes in the shawl in the Gino Costa profile .Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti Rossellini and Fellini are part of the lens) Ossessione helps to describe the look, usually moves on a single character, then interrupts his faces, voices and behaviors with great emotions, ugly, sad, and dark and romantic.I am only afraid of the future of two films like elephant Thousands of souls think of how they make me move.Mary 2 (Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai) describes all the compelling, realistic, and close-acting feelings and the main supporting actors without their own features. <br /> <br /> It's a striking, shocking adaptation and a striking sign for what's going on in Career for Visconti.
