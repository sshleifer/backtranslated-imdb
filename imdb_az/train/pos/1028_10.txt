Perhaps from the beginning of the film, I did not watch the Stargate movie, or something like a science fiction in the middle, or something else, such as Star Wars or other fantastic films, such as aliens, if he was fanatical, he would accept one of the two names, but I'm not as a hardcore fan of some people, I remember one of these films, I'm not a big fan of star disasters, you actually see me look at you as an average person, My point is not to have a difficult basic science philosophy to love this great series, unfortunately, ending with the end of 2006, ended with 10 beautiful seasons without falling in quality. <br /> <br /> Although I did not like the first season in 1997, I told myself that only one of the special effects was interesting things about the series, the chemistry between symbols bled me out of special effects, better than most scientific shows today If not, it was good. I have to admit that I have never been refugees but when I am 6 years old, I will never go through my father's knowledge, and I'm glad that I've seen glorious demonstrations like SG1, now in my opinion, defines criteria for nearly all philosophy classes and films, it's not worth watching whether a new lantern is better or better than SG1. basically the best knowledge show ever and if you do not watch it, you have no idea that you are missing!
