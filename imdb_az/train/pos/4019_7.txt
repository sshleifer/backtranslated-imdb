I'm not an admirer of Snoop Doggy, as an actor, was even more concerned about checking meekness. I remember talking about "Jay Leno" and said that he was dropping out of the role of "The Most Helped" in the big budget Adam Sandler comedy. Thus, Snoop is a serious mission to prove that its canvases operate. I will not overpraise Snoop for the performance shown in "Tenants". Of course, there are better reper / actors, such as Mos Def. However, Snoop did a "good" job. His brand can not seem to shake some of the body movements and vocal entertainments, but Jack Nicholson has such a problem. Here, I find tension between his role and praise of Dylan McDermott's character. In this regard, McDermott gives the best performance in the movie, even though his exquisite player will remain in the shadow of Snoop's unusual player. As a great reader and a talented writer I could not help but have found the characters and the attractive portions of each other. Snoop's character was always asking McDermott to read the case and annul it for its criticism. But what do you know? I am sure that many writers are like this. His character, like McDermott, was defective in his own way. The only soft criticism of the film will be its end. For some reason, I fled for quite some time, the resolution was definitely logical and motivated by symbols rather than plotting.
