Andy says: "No one will hurt, everyone will win". Before saying this, we know the opposite: Everyone is injured and nobody can win. This is a new yarn in American movies, or perhaps an old thread. Think of "East Promises," "Blood," "No country for the elderly." These films are dark, serious, well-designed and do not pay attention to happy endings. I love them. "Before You Know The Devil's Death" is in line with the general description, but it creates an atmosphere. Kelly Masterson's starring film, Hollywood movie, approaches the Greek tragedy. In the wealth of the brother-in-law, Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet turns his story into a dramatic, old-school drama, in an experienced and patient way. The opening shots are an image of a Dutch masters, though an obese bookkeeper encourages her ex-spouse. On the contrary, the condom of the drug dealer is more like the Mondrian figure. Great speeches all around. The character of Albert Finney, Charles, moves slightly, his eyes wide and his mouth almost always white. But then it is more difficult, deeper, deeper, more difficult than most. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is very hot. Of course, I do not need to say that. Why did his character want to be with a guy like Gina Andy, we were never told, but it was not good. Movement, of course, is characteristic. The sophisticated and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music is a masterpiece of this delicate film. Do not miss it.
