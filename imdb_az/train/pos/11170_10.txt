I have never felt anywhere about Pet Sematari. Perhaps this experience was very memorable because I was a kid while watching for the first time. But still watching her again will never be old, and I'm never bored. There is something crazy, sad, and intimidating at the same time, with a very chaotic ending with a creepy opening song, and keeps your head off: sometimes dead is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be helpful to re-integrate the entire story. All of your knowledge starts with point A (the perfect state for a happy American family) and goes step by step (I believe it is the end of all joy). Music is perfect, tells the story, the special effects are cool, and Pet Sematari is the last place on the floor. As I said, sometimes dead is better!
