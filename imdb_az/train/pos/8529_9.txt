I met this movie and could not close it. Peter Sellers plays a challenging friend that falls very hot and cute Goldie Hawn (who does not?). Goldie's character is a very unusual way of catching up to the end of the film. This movie gave me a different attitude to human relationships and I found it very funny. The role of Peter Sellers was a difficult sale, but I think he has done well.
