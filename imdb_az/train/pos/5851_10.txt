* ALLEGATIONS * This is the second payment source that I just gave the perfect 10 out of the Royal Rumble in 1991. It was full of exciting, exciting, exciting, fun games. <br /> <br /> Opening matches between Razor and DiBiase, Ludvig Borge and Marty Jannetty were just low points. They were OK, but DiBiase is worth the final payment for the match better. These days, such a match would give impetus to Razor's first major baby belt and would be a bigger summit. And with an intercontinental title, Jannetty could have had a better match with Borga. But I do not think anyone really is good. <br /> <br /> IRS and Kid were great as Michaels and Perfect. If he had earned a great deal, Michaels was lying to no one else. Pay attention to the next situation, leaving WWF, and Razor would not be the case. Brett Hart's two great bouts with Doink (pay attention to the fact that everyone's best match against Hit-Man) and then Lawler. Their competition was classic; Therefore, there was no disappointment on the anniversary of the year. <br /> <br /> The Steiners-Heavenly Codies match was one of the best in the year. <br /> <br /> Many say that Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez is a waste of time. But I liked it. Keep in mind that the older WWF's (previously WWE) breathing was athletic and a strange show blend. <br /> Is there anyone who does not love Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event is not bad if it is nowhere else. They put Lex Luger in a good shape, but made a clever choice when keeping the Yokozuna belt. Superstar Graham was the first ball to hold the pipeline for more than two months. Currently, heels are always champions. <br /> <br /> Like the first school wrestler, this is SummerSlam '88 and my favorites. But WWWF was blinked at the start of the 90s at WWF.
