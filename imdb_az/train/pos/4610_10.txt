On the winter day, on December 28, 1986, a two-drawn 14-year-old film shoots. "Hmmmm, Police Story is Interesting", "Who is Jackie Chan?", "I have never heard of it". After watching the movie two hours later, we want to know more about horror. After 16 years (and came out of the pocket of JC movies!) The movie still does not hold me like anything else. Okay, maybe my "first" (not Cannonball Run!) JC movie, but this is a perfect movie. All classic JC Elements, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and Action! Some comments said that it was dated, that it was made in 1985, of course, dated! But then it should be Jaws, Casablanca, Singin's Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Were the films like the Story of a Police Were the Hollywood Movement today? PS standards are defined, many scenes have been stolen to use in other films. You really need to see it on the widescreen to really appreciate it, but you will not miss most of the movie (yes, it really falls off the bus in the corner!). If it were not for now, THIS IS NOT THE FILM !!!! <br />
