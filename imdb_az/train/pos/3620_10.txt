I saw this night, which opened the night. It was excellent !! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and that's one of my favorites. Dennis Qaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, live here ... and once you have to get a drink ... well ... she stopped you ... but he did not want to say: C) [no one believes it will not believe ...]) Everything is a great movie. Everyone who loves a good sports movie must go out and see! C)
