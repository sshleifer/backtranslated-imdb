Halloween is one of the deepest movies in the world! In my opinion, it is the scary movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman! He was terrible! What's special about Halloween does not have a specific effect on how the computer animated it, it was down to a budget and had a score point, yet it managed to scare the hell out of people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Mayers, author of the article, kills her 6-year-old sister and escapes from the spiritual body many years later. Dr. Sam Loomis is behind him and he does everything to get him back because he describes Michael as "the darkest of the evil devil, the devil's eye." Michael is playing a new role to kill another brother Lauri, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. Her friends come to Halloween and, of course, know the rules and take it! But Laurie can not have a sister because she is not. ; D <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Halloween pays a lot of compliments to Psycho, Halloween is an absolutely horrible film that breaks the boundaries and locks the doors, bolts your windows and extinguishes the lights! "They'll pick you up, they'll pick you up!" Halloween is the ultimate fright movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
