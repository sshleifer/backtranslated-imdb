************** Possible spoilers ********** I saw this movie and I had a great crush because of Richard Belzer because there is only one reason. (I did not know much about humor) Barbie and Ken Spoof had a funny part as dealers and president skit. Sometimes it is ridiculous (Dare, I say?) Sometimes it was funny, but it would have been better. Perhaps, if they spend more time in humor and less women, they will be entertaining. Some skates want to be confused, and others may think laughing and strangely. Unfortunately, this movie is historic. If you have an evidence of Richard Belzer (such worth), it is worth checking it out and chevy follow-up.
