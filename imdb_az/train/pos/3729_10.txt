I think the movie can be regarded as anti-Vietnam, although I did not feel the prospect of a film just for the sake of the young guys who were training for a battle, the public did not support ... ... showed fear, despair, they were open, naked. As many soldiers in military service, my soldiers, especially my luggage companion, lived up to the truth. Generally, this film is great, looks great, and is perfectly functioning and direct, though it is shot in a very small budget. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
