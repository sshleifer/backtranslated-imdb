I found the movie "The Hole" that these guys and adults get into the story and not the typical Disney. Peoples, let me tell you not to betray me. The "Holes" follow the story of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who was sent to a strange nest in the desert, based on Louis Sachar's novel. He is a friend of a nickname named Zero, and sets out on an adventure that changes their lives together. It was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I did not know what to expect while watching. It was interesting to bring together the story as part of a story. All boys who played juvenile criminals were very laughable and John Voight was loyal to Mr Sir. Now I have to read a book that I have seen in the movie. Most Recommended!
