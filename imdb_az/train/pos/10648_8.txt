What can I say about Haunting? There is everything you can take a great picture. Magnificent sets, moody music and sound mode were all places to die for. The scenario sometimes hinders your mind in such a strange, surrealist way. The whole team forgot to read it, perhaps because they are too busy to create gothic sets to create cg effects and feel how vulnerable they are. Each member of the stomach gives a decent performance even though it is less condemned to the material in the hands. Most of Lili Taylor has done most of the time when most responded to him. But that's about it. I can say that it was a bit unpleasant for two hours, but you would definitely want more. A lot more.
