One of the most beautiful films! Why is only 7.6 degrees of mystery. This film is a window to the world of black practice. All white people and all children over the age of 10 should be considered compulsory. I recommend that you look at the "Long Walking House" as a form of companionship. If you think about the work of Whoopi Goldberg's "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares," think again. Do not miss this Oscar-winning movie. (And read the book too!)
