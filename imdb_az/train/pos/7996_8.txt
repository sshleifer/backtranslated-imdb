Challenge, ugly, bad retro-motion tension, find a bodyguard who will assign (and destroy!) The murder of the girl she needs to protect. This film is anachronism in the right atmosphere in today's political sense. Director Scott does not want to apologize for the immorality behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is not aware of social alerts for 30 years. Undoubtedly, I will not think that sooner or later you will see a more fierce film, so it's good to go and see it. Despite his ruthless fear, the film is a powerful example of the worst, exploitative and effective cinema. Scott has something to sell, but I think he's a buyer. It is very effective for me to avoid the extraordinary technical aspects of this movie. Scottin's directorial selection is simply stunning, and Denzel draws a great deal out of Washington. Sensitive spirits should stay away from this place, but I recommend it for those who are looking for a great, action-packed movie.
