Wonderful! What do you want? - Have you taken the suburban zone, have your zombies, have family issues, have social problems, eat yourself in a good Retro-1950 style, eat at the dishes that worry about Bay. <br /> <br /> Absolute improvement as Carrie Ann Moss is a debutant social climbing housewife. He is both a rebellious and a criminal. The desire of every human being. As K'sun's son, he is trying to be as normal as possible in the midst of this nightmare and achieves a bit of success. It is the true display presence. Very photogenic and natural. Most of the rest are beautiful, without mentioning all of them. Henry Czerny, as a person on the agenda, as if instincts and a slightly suspicious police officer. Pleasant as Billy Connolly Fido. A beautiful actor: I want to see that Gibson has played the leading role of Braveheart. I feel that William Wallace would be closer to the actual character. His Fido is still available. A nice touch. <br /> <br /> In short, morals, values, social pinnings, feelings, growth, fighting for indefinite periods, and compensation adjustments to impossible conditions are great and beautiful. The real truth show.
