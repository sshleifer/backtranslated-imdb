Do not wave by Naysayers. This is a beautiful spooky movie. It was a quick project for the writer / director JT Petty. He did a great job to catch me on the edge of my seat. She really did not know what to expect and Nirvana for a horrible movie! The film is about an old man living in a cabin isolated in the woods. One day, while looking for his cats in the woods, he witnessed the killing of a child, or is it? The rest of the film is agonizing about it. The most unusual thing about this film is that there is no dialogue until the last few stages. I found it interesting. The printer is able to make an effort to get your feelings and gives them a brave belt. Go to this movie and you will not be disappointed.
