I waited for a while to review this documentary because I would like to think carefully about what I want to write when I see it 10 years ago. <br /> <br /> From a documentary sight I saw that this is a brave document. What he did to do this, I did not show anything to me, and he took something that interests me in this world. I did not know anything about the world of boots, and I got information about them and the Balls was just spectacular for me. This nation was very talented to compete with what they did and what they did. The cat folk, the complainant (even one of whom told Judge that the garment was dragged on the coat) is not dresses, but jealous, as everything is in other races. It's like a similar competition. <br /> <br /> As you know, there was an old drag queen talking about how Balls's "used" balls were exchanged and how to compare new dragons with more competitive categories. Those who looked at the Balls will know the future will change even more when they are ready to walk the pist work. Some of the participants in the competition lived in the street only two minutes later, but were eager to hear that they were competing, it was important for them! Then there were stories of sad stories, "home" and "mother of the house", which produced the best and most brilliant competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Ten years have passed since I've seen this movie, and I've been mad at Madonna. I ended up with Madonna at the Vogue stage and rightly watched a few familiar faces from this documentary. If it were not for those individuals, Madonna did not have HAD at the Vogue stage, and now I know. Credit should be provided if available. If everyone else, except America, is watching this documentary, they are wondering if they are "basically" as they think.
