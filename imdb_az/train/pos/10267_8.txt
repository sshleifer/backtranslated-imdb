Mamet's "Game House" was written abundantly; Most of them are good. I decided to look at the flicker to see how it was done in 17 years and I was very pleased to look at it again. The success and durability of the film is likely to be very relevant to the two main components that are always fun in the film; a good story and a good deception. Mamet is able to capture the image of the film and clear histrionics when it frightens us, the audience, and also the brand. Then, when constructing the story, you just have to skip the sketch and so on. Explained. Now it is worth the value for the "House of the House", which is "free in the cabin", for the first timers and a complete repertoire for Mamet fans. (B +)
