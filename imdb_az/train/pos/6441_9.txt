{SPOILER WARNING} as in Hell This was a great human tragedy that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is an example of a reconsideration of Christ's life and death. Daniel is a gift musician who must be physically and mentally exhausted, and he must give it. When a church choir goes into a relationship, Jesus makes a change in his life as he did to the Palestinian society in the first century. They laugh, talk openly and truthfully, open their sins openly, love each other, fall in love with each other, become an important society. Tore, a mentally handicapped person in the past. In the past, Stig had the authority to put a bad morality on the community, and it was gradually denied by the shepherds. When Stig dismissed Daniel, there was an uprising and Stig was crushed. <br /> <br /> Stig Jesus represents the Jewish government of the day, and is a fresh manifestation of the new life with the Golden Rule, brought by Jesus, who accuses the Jewish law of obedience. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone says, "The church has invented the sin". In the film all this is the difference between the spiritual and life-giving (existence). <br /> <br /> Daniel, the story of Christ, leaves him to drown when he hit him when he was killed by Johnny. in the river. Daniel's (resurrected!) Body is difficult to believe next stage when the body is dragged into a dwelling room (tomb) with three sheets of white sheets (shrouded in silence at the foot of three women) <br /> <br /> Daniel is betrayed by a loved one and whom it is better to know (Jesus Mary Magdalen-Lena - probably a high-level court / whore). Through Lena, Daniel loves, learns, and cares for something he loves. <br /> <br /> The solo singing by Gabriella, written by Daniel, differs from all others and is morally justified, leading to the worry of sin and the right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows the chorus, which unites all audiences, showing harmony and harmony in mantra-like harmony, showing the true harmony of the true man and the related connection.
