Hello everyone My names Larissa I was watching curly suits when I was 13 years old when I was about 4 years old and broke my cliffs, in fact I was watching this movie for about 30 minutes. Alisan Porter is a really good actor and I love that movie. Whenever I look at the end of this film, I know that I was only 13 years old, but Alice's now a 25-year-old touch story is really strange. Everyone I'm watching a movie is always young, and after a year of film making it, he learns when he's watching and when he learns how he can learn how to make a person's age. Like Harry Potter. This movie was great, but still Daniel was 12 years old and I was about 11 years old. Why she can go between 4 and 12 and 16 and I'm only 13. Now I think he's 16 years old, but when he's looking at a movie, and when he's 4 years old, he was almost 18 when he was only the last one. Imagine and I want to accuse him. I am a computer person, but many kids want to do things as well. I'm as clever as a crooked movie, but the thing I do not like in the movie is that he calls the house that protects me and says that if the sulfur is put to a question and if he realizes it, he will kill it. I'm going to stop writing, and sometimes I know how to write something, but there are a lot of kids there, but if the kids do not learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
