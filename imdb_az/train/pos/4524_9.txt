This is a very rare example of a film about transvestism (heterosexuals). The film looks at nature because the general audience, who does not have a transvestite, even sincerely meets its main character. Adrian Pasdar is as convincing as Gerald / Geraldine, and it will not be forgotten to act honestly. Christopher Monger's director is so sensitive that he treats such a challenging issue in a very good way, and turns into a good story. Great movie, not a "craft" movie, but a little nice movie!
