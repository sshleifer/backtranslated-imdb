Who voted in these ratings? Actors on the "Jacknife" game, especially Ed Harris and unforgettable Robert DeNiro (Marlon Brando is not in the same breath as that person, but "Taxi drivers" to confirm this point). Is it a "secular" film, although it does not have sex / senseless motion / nakedness? This movie is about the complexity of the characters. Ed Harris feels at every moment with her, and the emotional explosion toward the end is very heartwarming. In order to unleash the uniform of the army, a young man who ordered a young man in a bar observes how fashion and movies are using tragic situations and how he should feel as if to see a horseman-in-arms young beginner sporting uniform. While we are in this regard, "Casino" is from 10 to 7.8? One of the greatest films of all time, one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, is just the middle class with the worst movie psychic gangster? Come on !!!!!
