This movie is one of my favorites. This is a genre mix of Action / / Horror / Romantic / / Comedygenre. Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards. This small flaw is not easily considered. There is a lot to this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so painful. The visuals are very beautiful. The action is not a surprise but comes from Honkong, the world's best action films. Humor is sometimes a bit silly, but it looks good. In any way, this film is able to balance different moods and continue to be good. Completely recommended.
