I took this movie with my interest in American history and, in particular, with a strange story of the Mormons. This film seeks to make sense that Joseph Smith can transform "vision" into a great world religion. At first, Navuoo, the Mormons, focuses on the difficulties experienced in Illinois. This reflects Joseph Smith's experiments. During the trial, Brigham Young expressed his belief in the belief in Mormonism and Smitten's moral message. Then Smith is murdered and has to deal with his doubts about whether he is selected to take Young Mormons to a new land. Despite his great doubts, he has a steady vision, and finally has a vision of trustworthiness of his leadership (Utah is a place for his colony). <br /> <br /> Later, when the slaughterers were destroyed by the whistles, he was skeptical of the fact that he was really selected, but there was a miracle that made his place bone in history. <br /> <br /> I have found the actions of the actions and the story is convincing and interesting. I would like to know if Mormons do not believe this is a clear description. Polygamy is part of the story, but this is the reason why the causes of the LDS center have not been removed. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> Attention!
