Despite the low level of freedom in this country and unexpectedly seen in other countries (the 'R' rating in the US can not help - honestly uses the HBC C-statement!), This is actually a piece of work. <br /> <br /> This is just because you play physical or mental crippling (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.) and Helena Bonham-Carter MND will not be able to get enough physical degradation , but his vocal stretching and relentless emotional drive are fully compensated. In fact, almost all his work is done with his eyes (and what his eyes!). This is a clever turn from an actress, who quickly abolishes the reputation of the English Rose and emerges as a few years old figure. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Branag, the best of the film (except "Hamlet") and his play, big cast. Here, though, he does surpass other images that have never been demonstrated and play a boy who is extremely unattractive, who exhibits his intelligence and depth, hates sensitive hate. In short, we believe in 'The Proprietor' as 'The Gingerbread Man' and 'Peter Friends' as we do not believe in Frankenstein like Andrey. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, it looks more like a television suggestion, and it's likely that without its stars. But this couple was happy to do this, and I was more than happy to have them (although not Love's Labor Lost). 10 to 8, but Branagh and HBC go from 10 to 10.
