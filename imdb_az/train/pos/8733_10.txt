When I got the Toy Story tape, after watching the movie, I saw a trailer for what Toy Story creators said after leaving the video. As I have seen, I knew this would be a good feature! I was right! A Bug's Life, like Toy Story, is a great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim Rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich by Caterpillar, voiced by Dim Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. One of my favorite scenes is to slash Smit (David Hyde Pierce) when Hem≈üe and Hamilich raise you to Hemed, who wants to encourage you as Mr. Early Bird. How can I make a good taste victim and Slim in a bar! I'll keep going! I just laughed at the stage. Thinking I'm a great admirer of insects, but I think it's my favorite Pixar in a Bug's Life, although many people think it's the worst Pixar movie ever! You do not know how to hate the Pixar movie! I think they are all good movies! PIXAR good job!
