This movie was one of the best films I've ever seen. I have not seen any people in the film, but it's still very good. It looks like Anchorman in the humor department, but I think it's a good way to put this movie down. In fact there is a point. If you see a whole team of T & A, you will be disappointed. Just put together a good movie !!!! If you do not have anything to do during the day or if you need a lot of humor, this will be a really good movie. I think that Ebert and Roeper have been reviewing this movie. That is, Ebert does not like me in many films, but this is a movie I agree with. There is a fairly good story in the film that it is really convincing that this person is there. There is something definitely discussed in this film about how they treat the virginity. Unfortunately, when you learn about it, you will laugh, but it still shows you what you expect. Steve did a great job of describing his man in this movie and is still funny.
