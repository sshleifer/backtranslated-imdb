This is a great Canadian comedy series. In the film, stars Jean Paul Tremblay- (Julian) and the show's chief writer and his friends Rickie and Bubbles explain how to play in romantic parks and satirical images in the real life of these stupid hoodies residents. The film will cause Rickie and Julia to launch a more advanced attack on the crime scene. WHY and behind all else would be spoiler, and I will not give them real reasons behind the more brilliant escapades. Their buddy and often the partner (bubbles) are brilliant. The whole show is brilliant and incomplete, the movie will not affect your seeing a bit of sitcom. Little Catch Time Scams with a gorgeous satire and little time ideas, but with great time dreams, living in comedy and trailer parks with C capital C. If you ever have the opportunity to watch - steal this program - play it. You'll be glad you did. And with my American friends - it's breaking you. From 9 to 10. Brilliant. How should the TV look like?
