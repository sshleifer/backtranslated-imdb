<br /> <br /> Freddy, in the 6th part of this movie, was scary at the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> In 2001, this film has been for 2 years since 2001. John Doe (Jacobb Part 5, even with whom he points to the movie) used to bring more children to Science Street. Only FREDDY takes his dreams, but it also happens Rachel Talalay said that he has become one of many countries in the United States. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has been involved in a long nightmare series. Many hate this movie, but I love it. He tried to reveal what FREDDY did with his foolishness ... COMDEY and the scary array make the arranger more funny. <br /> <br /> This film is a wound to really talk about. This is not a horror in this series, but the second part still remains. <br /> <br />
