It's a good show and I think it's funny. Finally the strange Latin stereo types are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show and only three months ago I could watch it. The whole concept about the Latin Family TV program truly surprised me. I was amazed that it was a good shot for the Latin to be on TV. This show is probably the best I've ever seen - it's funny, cheerful, touching, and beautiful.
