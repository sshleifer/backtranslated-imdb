But I've seen this movie at least four times, though I have not watched it. The visuals are very good and this movie is frustrating with music that's totally awesome and perfectly suited. <br /> <br /> CGIs are pretty bad IMHO, but all the visuals that have a black and white feel and an inner look that's completely sterile ... Only one genius is perfect for such a movie. <br /> <br /> But the movie had little flaws, for example. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought the movie was a bit slow, but I do not want to say it with the scenes, I love them all. <br /> <br /> I too, too, with a very complicated story - He talks to the person in there as if he was in a place similar to that of the digikorbsin where he stored all the information ... but that could be: D And Finally, it should be emphasized that they should merge the back-to-memory part slightly longer and higher, but then the movie would have been better without all these shortcomings that would never have to be repeated. .
