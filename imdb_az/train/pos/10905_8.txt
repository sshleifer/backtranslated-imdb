In September 2003, Jonny Kennedy, 36, died. Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) had a terrible genetic condition. He stated that his skin had fallen slightly in the touch and covered his body with painful wounds and led to the fight with skin cancer. In recent months, Jonny has decided to work with director Patrick Collerton for documenting his life and death, and the first is a film released in March, which is a humorous story of a single person, a joyful, mixed and provocative. He did not go away from the strange reality of the EB, and the film was a life feast. The film "Who's Leather Mountain", directed and directed by Patrick Collerton and first released in March 2004, talked about the documentary film of that year. It has attracted nearly five million viewers and the public has donated nearly half a million pounds to DEBRA for Jonny's charity. Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund is set up to raise half a million dollars to ensure Jonny Kennedy's legacy of a million pounds.
