As with many series pilots, Dark Angel's key shows a great deal of potential and a problem with its own foot. This is not unusual in any way, but there is a feeling that the story is a bit worse and can work better. <br /> <br /> In the world of the day, when it was necessary to cancel something immediately or otherwise, the series, with at least half the center, was a little offended, burning with all weapons. <br /> <br /> The ninety-minute pilot really feels as if the two episodes are stuck together, and both episodes have a problem in the spotlight. In the first half, we were presented to Max and filled it with the managers. We also gain Max's ability to earn a few interesting routines, get in touch with the PI, or use employee's ability to distinguish between internal problems. The problem here is not a normal gene set, nor is it normal for television or anyone else. <br /> <br /> When we hit the second half, aim and attention. For more than two and a half years, Max finds himself in the spotlight of a pirate who thinks he is a mission in life to expose a dirty vendor at a time. In the second half, the result is with him, and Max eliminates the result of recklessness. It builds and works the rest of the array, but if you get my meaning it is not enough. As with most of the pieces here, there is only one pair that has a complete description. Perhaps they are full of next episodes, but next to this point. In fact, the content of this episode can easily be explained in twenty-eight minutes. <br /> <br /> The last negative is that most of the support packages are completely upset. Particularly Original Cindy is an anxiety and I doubt that over the next twenty episodes. The player is not as bad as daytime soap, though I appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but shorter because she's convinced that the story needs at least. <br /> <br /> Good news, premise and production values ​​are all top notch. In fact, this series was quite expensive to produce, and it was a pity that it was canceled to replace it with another show that did not last throughout the season. If there were enough time for both shows, they could only eliminate one of the damaged rubbish pieces that the reality was thrown under the banner of the TV. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, I gave him seven out of seven for Dark Angel pilot. It never raises the level of non-shocking TV, and it did not allow it to suit its potential in the course of its operation. But there is potential, and it happens often where pilots are concerned.
