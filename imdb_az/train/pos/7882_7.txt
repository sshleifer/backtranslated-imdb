"Ship Ahoy" was supposed to show the talent of MGM. The film is an entertaining journey on an ocean liner along San Juan's road to Puerto Rico during the country's Second World War. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Powell was seen in some music numbers in a beautiful way. where he thought we were a dancer. The Red Skelton is followed by a beautiful clowning in a flat part while watching beautiful Ms. Powell on a ship that brings Puerto Rico. Bert Lahr has good opportunities to show that he is a fun guy in the film. Also Virginia Gray is seen as an entertaining girl who is not deceived by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers reflecting Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, and among others there are some solos with incredible Buddy Rich, Mr. Dorsey and Miss Powell. A gene appears in Frank Sinatra as the lead singer of the band supported by Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic journey to the fans of this genre, which is entirely managed by the MGM.
