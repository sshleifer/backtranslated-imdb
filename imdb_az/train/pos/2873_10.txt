This is one of Disney's first five animated features in my opinion. Cinderella, a full-length feature film, was a perfect turning point (versus 40th birthday movies) and did not come back to the film with the expensive depths of the multi-plan camera. <br /> <br /> Disney liberates the story somewhat, though it takes the idea of ​​the era and gathers styles - a precise timeline of the story. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more than a white and a multi-dimensional character. In fact, all the characters are slightly better developed, except for the prince - the right one - we know it has a sense of humor and a great sense of humor, but that's all. Like Snow White, Disney has a permanent impact on the story in popular culture --- In most Cinderella versions, the steps are attractive, not as beautiful as Cinderella, and their character fades away from their beautiful appearance. <Br /> <br /> Cute Disney additions: mice! Also, she appreciates sustainability - Cinderella always loses her shoes throughout the film. Adding clothes to the house, as well as the attack on these steps were always terrible as a child - remember that the master showed it with a black shirt and a big red light on it! The trailed slipper shows bad luck of Lady Tremaine and refused to stand on Cinderella --- Audley would continue to describe the worst of all the evil witch Maleficent in Sleepwalk Beauty.
