TACHIGUI: AMAZIN LIFESTY OF FAST-FOOD GRIFTERS Japanese name: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Featuring Mamoru Oshii: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada by Koichi Yamadera - ------------------------------------- <br /> The road in 1995 <br /> <br /> Mamoru Oshii, the animated film, which will help strengthen the international adoption, Ghost In the Shell revealed the nature of the brilliant animation and Andy and Larry Wachowskinin turned the concept of the Matrix. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the film, The Innocence, was the first Japanese animated film to compete for Palme d'Or in Cannes and, despite its unforgettable plot, flee for styles and innovative impressions heads left. <br /> <br /> Always trendsetter, Oshii has now introduced us to Tachigui: Fast Food Grifters Amazing Lives? <br /> <br /> I say "superlivemation" to Oshiaki's creativity: not entirely animated, exactly alive. Instead, the castle remained somewhere around 30,000 instantly reconstructed in digital form, and reminiscent of the Bali puppet, a simple cheating paper. <br /> <br /> In his book Demir Man (1988), Shinaya Tsukamoto's stilted, stop-motion style, reflecting the experimental Tetsuo talks. <br /> <br /> <strong> Oshii Daily In a recent interview with Yomiuri. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The choice of cast is equally complicated. The famous Studio Ghibli director, Toshio Suzuki, looks like a ravenous burger fanatic, who made a great soundtrack - Kenji Kawai - while staging a spectacular watch. <br /> <br /> Kochi YamaderanÄ±n sounds like a fairy tale structure, dry NHK documentary film "The Last Vampire" and "Shinji Higuchi" - "Godzilla" films, special effects employed. "Katsuya Terada" ?? <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> various fast-food off-shoots - stove ramen stores to the gudon stand bars; McDonalds-inspiring burger chain restaurants American dogs in the heaters of convenience stores. Oshii claimed by saying, "The main roots of dining wishes." <br /> <br /> Mixed taken a new breed of consumer: fast-food grifters title, who do not like to pay for their tucker and tricks to score on a free munchies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The director of Live Motion Films (Avalon, Stray Dog) has become a part of a taboo in this country, and Oshii has often found a definition among two environments, along with the takiqui animation. Here, celluloids are put in a gray area in any format. <br /> <br /> At times, the visual experience here is exciting because it can be irritating. Do not really ask what you want to say; Cerebral and innovative films that are equally important to Oshi are often not wise. Is Osey successful, a liberal black humor dose? where you can find the world's fastest samurai burger chef, dying by hula-hoop in Kentucky Fried Rat? <br /> <br /> This is a man who has been indebted to Andrey Tarkovsky, who has been blocking the influence of filmmakers such as Godard and Truffaut, and perhaps like David Lynch. Thus, at one stage it should not be surprising that a B-52 bomber makes a Yoshinoya look flying at the same franchise. The 54-year-old writer-director thought of nature. <br /> Of course, Japan, described in the film, can not be true to reality. -------------- <br /> <br /> By Andrez Bergen
