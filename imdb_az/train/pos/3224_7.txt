I was looking forward to getting this movie: good intelligence cowboys. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Kurt Russell has done such a great deal with a very limited role. <br /> <br /> Think of trying to act under these two restrictions: not a dialogue, not a military robot, not using your facial expressions to show your emotions! How is it? Kinda, like gagged and duct-taped when a large aria output diva wants. Despite oral and expressive handwriting, Russell adds an incredible character. His robot is a man despite restrictions. Great job! As usual, Jason Isaacs would like to see a downhill and a quarter of a day as the greatest villain shown below in history. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly and sweet. I'm not sure how much my impression is based on the player and the physical beauty, but it was difficult to get him out of his eyes. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was very small and limited. <br /> <br /> Most of life is a fairly weak standard, but there is a sense of science-fiction comic book that does not seem to be wrong with a few weaknesses. At the end of the story, the good guy is winning and the grateful audience is very emotional. Yes! <br /> <br /> One who thinks Rassel will not work well, is that she missed the whole point.
