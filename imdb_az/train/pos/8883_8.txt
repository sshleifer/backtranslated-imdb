The design of the movie appears to be the alpha and omega of some of the key issues in this country (US). We see all the relationships in the film's communication. Unfortunately, the student vs. teacher is ready. But other attributes that add to the value of the film: Man vs. female, white etc. black, individual etc. society. But most important of all and direct relationship with other contacts is vss. herself <br /> <br /> How surprised my leadership was in terms of the bilateral relationship to show racist relations on the campus. Most of the films usually show the unfairness of one party and the other side's suffering. This film showed the injustice and suffering of both sides. Not only did he say that the skin was very flawed and vindictive (quite open to the end), but he did not try to show how true he was. Sexuality and harassment are also discussed in the film. In some cases, this injustice is racism, which brings together two races for a while. Lawrence Fishburne performs top-notch performance as honest Profesor Phipps. It reduces the idea of ​​racist favortism and shows the parallelism of lazy and low trauma, which is not functional and positive. Other starring stars are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives a beautiful portrayal of a furious angry young man who wants to accept it. <br /> <br /> The number of students studying in the country's higher education institutions is somewhat higher. In fact, almost a film is not a dry book like a real university at a university, and students would say a satire meant to interact with each other. This is not the text of life, the text of learning. I think that "Higher Education" depends on many universities, and in general, even on vital issues. 8/10
