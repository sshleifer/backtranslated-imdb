"Pet Sematari" succeeds in two main situations. The first is a scary Horror movie. Not only those who have not been produced these days. Secondly, it is generally an emotional, intelligent film. So if you're looking for creepy, frightening, heartwarming and visually stunning parameters, great players, dialong and terrific effects; this is the movie you are looking for. Now it's a classic and you really need to see it for a Horror fan. <br /> <br /> Probably adapting to any royal novel. The events fled slightly compared to the novel, but this filmless movie is not a complete Horror / Drama. <br /> <br /> The novel of Stephen King is also very emotional and terrible. The film feels like a great character development and at the same time it feels the affinity between the members. Everything happens (technically happy, because Pet Sematari does not propose to shake) a tragic event changes the atmosphere of the movie and is now very dark. The film has a bad feeling after opening credits, but after the murder of Gage, the movie is sad, gray, and creepy. Working with the loss of a baby is something that can destroy the entire family's life and Pet Sematari proves it dramatically. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is more than just a myth that no one else would want to live, but a father who was destroyed by sadness and despair causes him to shoot. Unfortunately, fairly, the legend is realized and baby Gage returns from the dead. The encounter with the legend of marriage was a tragedy, but this time is a lot worse. What will happen to all our American family life? Can Paskevich avoid this tragedy? What Is Surreal Nightmares? <br /> <br /> See Pet Sematari, one of the most impressive, emotional Hero movies ever. You will not be hurt. Despite the fact that I can not get an actor who describes my father, the player is very good. The events were not enough trouble when asked about his hopelessness. But that's just my idea. Denise Crosby has been a great performer and has worked perfectly as a noble, instant mom. Baby Gage was beautiful in even creepy portions. * Shivers *. Generally this is a great classic of all time and anxious movie about the deepest fears of people ... the loss of your loved one, the dead who return to the dead, and the sense of hopelessness. <br /> <br /> For sure ... I do not want to sit at home, in a room at home!
