More from Hidden Frontiers-fan fiction - a well-thought-out and survival series of Star Trek worlds. Nowadays, a well-known net from a fun little fan project; Hidden Frontiers have a bit of a fan for each star trek fan. Former Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager time lines are built. Hidden Frontier is based on topics and issues raised in other Star Trek series, using well-developed characters, fields and stories. Star Trek Hidden Frontier, Gene Roddenberry knows and loves Sci-Fi addicts for real-life events as well as exciting spatial wars and conflicts - in short-term space assignments and long-term space assignments. Designed in the "Green Screen" studio; Hidden Frontiers brings a regular rollicking cast to the screen and your heart. Players of a large ensemble of actors play well together and lovingly give time and energy to the project. The use of green screen technology, its props, preparation and suits make the Star Trek's Hidden Border world entertaining and believable. The Hidden Frontier went to the world of science fiction and went fresher when they were there. The Hidden Frontier offers an exciting bonus feature of a well thought-out web site with exciting discussion forums, creative, production and gamer staff access and fun weekly conversations. I recommend taking the time to download and watch the clock.
