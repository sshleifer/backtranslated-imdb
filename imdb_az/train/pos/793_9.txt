I really love this movie. (For some reason, I was surprised that there is such a low rating from many users of this site!) I can not say that it is a cinematic work, but it's a good way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. There is a great story of friendship and friendship that goes away from bad things that are going on for many difficult times and friends! (LOVE YOUR WOMAN, HERE IS HERE!) Bill Paterson, Reverend Gerald Marsden and Andy McDowell, a good actress when she is right, and she puts this idea on her. (And in fact, I have the best "wedding" I've seen or dreamed in this movie ... there is more courage than anyone before!) You're laughing and crying - do not see any marketing campaign and how this movie is marketing. .. this is a hidden gem that is supposed to make tonnage of the box office. (Now you have to look around to get a copy!)
