Born in Berlin in 1942, Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and is now a very important filmmaker and writer. She was described as a director, even an unfair cartoon, her commitment to bringing sensitivity on the screen to her artistic strong advantage. "Rosenstrasse" (New York Times article was one of the worst aggressive views I've ever read in this article), a mixed and even strange research, is not a perfect movie. The genocide Nazi regime of all nations by the weak German Germans who demonstrate the Union film and a Berlin street is a sign of a rare combination of successful opposition. Co-writer von Trotta <br /> <br /> The real Rosenstrasse case under the investigation of a young woman who did not disclose any information about her mother as a child in the German capital during World War II. <br /> <br /> Ruth Weinstein's (Jutta Lampe) Lieutenant Ruth is not a "shivah" (Jewish weekly mourning ceremony), but a striking return to a long-standing orthodox Jewish lifestyle, he insists on following the strict ban of his faith. The apartment in New York City reflects the wealth provided by his wife. American-born daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother Anan dropped slightly from their alleged Jewish practice, but they were cold-blooded Hannah's fianc√©e, Federa van Huet, a non-Jewish named Luis. The internal crisis may well pose a threat because Ruth warns Hannah that she will not give up her beloved Luis. <br /> Of course, there is no need to solve any problem. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Hannah intrigued - she asks her mother, who resolutely refuses to discuss part of her life. This is very realistic. I grew up with parents who escaped from Nazi Germany and knew many children who were completely rescued from the Holocaust. Those days were just discussed. <br /> <br /> For this reason, Hannah hoped that the German elderly men would still be able to breathe the Savior, learning that the woman saved Ruth's life. If it were not for that, it would be a very short film. However, Ruth, 90-year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow, now acts as a historian. <br /> <br /> Lena was a married pianist married to Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel) in 1943 (Lena, 1943) Katja Riemann. The Nazi regime was obliged to use "Israel" as the "Jewish women" had to add the names of "Jewish women" (usually IMDb, Fabian's name is given in Israel "simply by the Nazis as a sign of classification and degradation). <br /> <br /> In Germany, most of the Jewish population was deported to concentration camps, but those who were married to the Aryans were released. For a while. After 1943, the regime decided to accept them (most men, and few were Jewish non-Jews). <br /> <br /> Young Lena is trying to find her husband. All she and many women know is that they are limited to a building in Rosenstrasse. There are masses of horrific women, helping German officers who have been abandoning some of them and who also have a so-called "Jewish prostitute". Lena accepts an eight-year-old Ruth, hiding when she seized her as a sub-soil (remember, Ruth is now in Shiite in Manhattan). The child is described by Ruth, Svea Lohde. <br /> <br /> Women are eventually dominated by an increasingly angry protest. Men and a few women are released. As in the real story, the speaker, in a giant, almost unprecedented period, had acknowledged the defeat of the psychiatrist on the murderous agenda (one of them is Reich's cessation of Euthanasia campaign to get rid of mental defects and chronic illnesses, but that is another story). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta builds tension and every woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah is beginning to doubt her lover, Lena, who is slowly gathering, a relative of an ordinary historian, who needs to learn about a girl who has her mother killed. /> Contradictions between the Rosenstrasse since 1943 and the noisy, rebuilt, united Berlin street today provide a repeatable thematic element. Today, he inherits in Berlin, but not the traces of a terrible past. Von Trotta makes this point very well. <br /> <br /> The main actors are impressive. Although Lena's husband is strong, she has been completely deprived of the prisoner's imprisonment with the possible deportation (all of the characters, including all police and military offices, are clearly clarified). Old Ruth is catalytically facing the devil's drowning in the life of a happy New York. Hannah is convinced that her father's death is a young woman who has created a need to find her family's past. <br /> <br /> Von Trotas is not sure of her hand, it's not perfect. One night with Goebbels, who loves Lena's violin, is unnecessary and entertaining. The Minister of Propaganda protects the proposal that he can go to bed with the fanatical high-level Hitler temple, the magnificent fulfillment of his friends and relatives who have demonstrated to save his husband. Most German officials come from central casting and are erected by Erich von Stroxem, a "copy and paste" Teutonic nastiness school. But this is clear. <br /> <br /> The story of Rosenstrasse has been a subject of articles and articles, and some claim that more Jews are claiming a paradigm of salvation because they object to Germany. Unfortunately, this evidence is nonsense. The German women who occupied the Rosenstrasse were deeply and unwillingly interested in themselves. Most Germans are somewhere between passive and virulant antisemitism. For this reason, the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually alone. <br /> <br /> Most Germans can not be denied that the natian endemic antisemitism has led to virulent tensions since 1928, when they received or rejected the Goldenhagen thesis that they were realistic killer commitment. <br /> <br /> Elder Lena said that what the women did was bad light at a time. The majority of men and women who started their death near the war were alive. Hence, it was a "light of light" and a von Trotta's film was a light rays that saved some of the ordinary women's courage and saved them for celebration of every life. And it will always be. <br /> <br /> 9/10
