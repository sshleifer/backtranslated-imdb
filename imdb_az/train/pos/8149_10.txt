When I first appeared in 1994, I saw this movie and just watched it recently, and it was still funny. I do not know the hiphopes in the 90s, I do not know, but this helps. When the NWA and the Public Enemy were at the top level in the 1990s, there was a separate fight between groups and members (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.) inside. Also asked for the inaccurate rappers who started taking the stage (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory, etc.). This movie is fun to see as a true documentary. Kasi Lemmons, a betrayal rap group named N.W.H. Plays an interview spending a year in his life. Members of the group have an up and coming rap group that includes Ice Code, Rusty Condieff, Tasty Taste, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence), making them politically controversial. It is better than this movie that is so popular in the hypermarket industry of the 80's and behaves in a fun way. But if you know the 90s of the 80's, you know how true these things are. Hip-hop is still a funny comic film without knowledge and Spinal Tap for the first time ever, but Spinal Tap is not the first cartoon film. it is equally funny and in some ways better than the Spinal Toss. For the heavy metal like Spinal Tap, the Black Planet is afraid to become Rap and sing songs at the hook off.Video DVD music theater, like the NWH band and solo artists, by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott speeches.
