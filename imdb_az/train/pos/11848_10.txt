Well, what can I say, this movie really came to me, as many say, really I love it, though this idea seems very simple and not very boring. Above all I liked the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), really going through the movie. Secondly, the simple story and the Spirit's drama take your attention. What I love most is that the light does not make human voices to respond to another horse, does it make the film more realistic, and that many animations now seem real? but ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one of the most beautiful animations of 2002 is recommended not only for children, but for everyone. relaxed.
