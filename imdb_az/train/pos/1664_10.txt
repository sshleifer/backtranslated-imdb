I thought with this movie the absolutely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi describes Artemisia in such a beautiful, casual, but reassuring way, by portraying his hands with his imagination before moving his model. place. His passion for Artemisia's art is magnificent to watch. <br /> <br /> Although every character is obviously unbelievable, it's making the film more realistic because the face and the clothes are perfect at this point in time. <br /> <br /> Generally, I thought this movie was fantastic.
