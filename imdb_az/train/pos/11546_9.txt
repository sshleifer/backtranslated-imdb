First Review: July 21, 2008. <br /> <br /> This is a very effective screenwriter and comedy player and timing in this movie. At the age of 40, he had not lost anyone's power. Neil Simon knows how to create a real comedy from human nature and relationships, as well as from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Surprisingly, only two Academy Award nominees are: "Best Affordable Scenario" and "Best Movie Making". Hollywood rarely gives comedies a reward, no matter how good it is.
