This movie hit me home. At age 29, I remember 80 and my father worked in the factory. I was proud that if I worked hard, I would have been proud and would never give up, I could also call America a dream, a home, a few children, a car. <br /> <br /> I would also like to point out that you will not be able to go anywhere without the degree of something (in contrast to my father's departure from the ninth grade) and longing and laziness. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if anyone has a DVD or VHS movie. I was prepared for the television and saw it an hour ago. Ic can not find anywhere! I would like to show it to my friends, mates, family, and other relatives, see what they are thinking, and I'd like to remind you that Americans have to work and win! I think there is still a feeling, but a lot of things are done abroad with a very low spiral ...
