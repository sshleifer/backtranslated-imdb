It's a lot of my favorite military drama! Tom Berenger plays Tom Beckett, a killer of soldiers. This Sea asked for a kind of person who ever had a nonsense and no questioning on your face. There are Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others), the old SWAT form D.C. Richard Miller plays, works for the government, and only orders from them. Who needs the bureaucrats? It is not me! The spark must be flying when these two are matched. And how. But Beckett teaches how the young bureaucracy works. When you hit another sniper, there are ideas, ideas, cats, mice, armed and armed men. When an experienced sniper is captured, Miller is to abandon politics and save her. Who needs a producer like Beckett, comes from mutual respect for politics, not just from himself but also from the book. The film was hit directly. See it. 4 out of 5 stars.
