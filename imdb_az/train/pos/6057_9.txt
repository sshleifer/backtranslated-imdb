Of course, this is a great home cinema, "discography", for a super picture and a great sound, but this is a drama and a documentary that is touching. Parallel stories that are contradictory throughout this film are of interest to all audiences. Young, old, boys and girls will find such a deep downfall, and we're the high performance indy cars that drive our car, especially blood, sweat, tears, inventions, and perseverance. Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder are perfectly adapted to the sound and visual content. I do not want to end it, but Quincy Jones is the last drive for "Days like this", which can make you look tired. Enjoy!
