I liked this movie very much, because it's basically a lot more. <br /> <br /> Looks like a DJ playing a good job, but it reminded me of someone and reminded me of it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> I thought it was a very small ghost story for much of which was more focused on the living side. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty good because everything came up. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shorter movie, enough time was spent to tell the story. More and it started dragging.
