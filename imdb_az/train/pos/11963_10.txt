"Scoop" is easily the funniest film of Woody Allen in the 2000s. Allen is at the beginning of the game, like the low brown wizard Sydney Waterman, despite the age of the last. Its a one-liners and behavior cheerful. Do not allow criminals to violate their views. "Scoop" is the top notch "Woody-Lite". <br /> <br /> The classic music account is a great definition of activity on the screen. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in this beach suit. Jackman drowned. Cinematography shines. "Scoop" is a wonderful escapist right from the start. Only the final film is worth the admission price.
