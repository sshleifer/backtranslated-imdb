This program is so entertaining and the title song is so appealing that it can not go out of my head. As I was old, I was drawn to wrinkles in the work, and these four are excellent in their work. In some days, we think that we will not be able to do this with our PC world in real life. I always learn something from the show. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy, and a little trial, you will love this show. This reminds me of Quincy, ME in some way and Barney Miller is working in another way and interacting with each other. They are shouting many, but they are dealt with, so they are counted.
