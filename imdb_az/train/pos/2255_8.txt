Not a bad martial art movie. The scenes were good to fight. Michel Gissi did a good job of managing his first movie without Van Damme. The story was a bad language and worked without blood. There is a good line in the story that works with screenwriter Jeanette Francessca. It would be nice to see something different from the same genre. He loves his art and owns powerful women. IT was definitely worth looking at. I invite all those who love the drama and martial arts.
