Prison is often not the best of the eighties when it comes to talking about horror movies, and it's a good reason for it, because it's not the best ... but when you start with the classic movies offered by the tenth year, this is of course the least known / among the good. The film has direct links to blockades; is an early directing effort for Renny Harlin for a start; Die Hard 2, a talented director behind a series of action films, including Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; Secondly, we have an early role for the Rings Lord's star Viggo Mortensen. The movie is not entirely dependent, but the cunning line is interesting. In a few years, we are standing on a re-opened prison. It was a prison where the prison governor, Charles Forsit, was sent to the electrical department. Of course, the soul of the dead does not stand in peace; <br /> <br /> When the prisoner was killed, the soul of the deceased escaped to revenge. <br /> <br /> The film is not exactly Shawshank Redemption, but it draws attention to its various symbols. The main point of the film is always horror, the behind-the-scenes prison drama is an interesting base. This is a good job because, in addition to the main theme, there is no "structure" of the film, and we rely solely on the interconnection between the characters to keep things interesting. The horror in the film is sometimes strange, but in fact, it may be the reason for the rare occurrence of the film, and it's already ten years away. Crimes themselves are quite good and creative, and they provide some basic points. After the film has been launched, we have begun to draw more and more into the backdrop of the revenge's dream, and it is quite interesting, some things about this are not logical and it drags the film down a bit. Still, everything is up to an exciting summit and I have to say that in general, it is a film that is needed to watch the prison.
