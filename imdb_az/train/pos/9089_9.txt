Hollywood Hotel deals with many films such as "Ella Cinders" and "Merton of Cinema" on someone who has been contracted for filmmaking in Hollywood, only in Hollywood or trapped or incompetent. Actually, as I have watched this night, Hollywood Hotel may have taken some ideas from Hollywood Hotel, even though Turner Classic, and then Singing in the Rain, is an interesting example. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel in the 1930s. Among the supporting players are Louella Parsons, who plays himself (and despite some negative comments I have seen, a very pleasing personality on the screen and the natural command of his lines). The scenario is not the only real person. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the first women in the career of young Mr Ronald Reagan and plays with a radio interviewer. a premiere of a movie. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell has won the Hollywood contract. <br /> <br /> Dick Pauell, a competition and a Benny Goodman band, leaves a job as a saxophonist. At the start of this film, the band is incredibly impressive, as a driver in a truck parade to make a farewell to Powell. They are singing "The Hooray for Hollywood". An exciting article in this beautiful story has been left out of a lyric purpose. Johnny Mercer is referred to the Max Factor as a sign of Hollywood's makeup king, Rin Kalay Castle, and Tarzan. But the original song looks like lyric Tyrone Power. Obviously, Jack Warner and his brothers are not going to introduce the 20th century fox's leading man, and the name has been replaced by Donald Duck. In any case, these numbers have best shown the Goodman orchestra's singers and instruments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Leaving the PAUELELL group and her comrade (Frances Langford), she is going to Hollywood to find out that she is only a contract player. (most likely for music containing saxophonists). He is welcomed by studio publicist Allen Joslyn (owner Grant Mitchell). Joslyn is not a bad man, but he is busy and has to spoil people if he does not need to talk to them. He parks Powell in a room in the Hollywood Hotel, where he lives with the father of the temperamental star of the studio Lola Lane (Hugh Herbert), sister (Mabel Todd) and a broken assistant Glenda Farrell. Lane talks about Jean Hagen, "Reading the song in the rain", his voice is good. His "Dan Lockwood" version is a "Alexander Dupre" (Alan Mowbray, several times theft theft scene). The only difference is that Mowbray is not a good person like Gene Kelly and that Lane (when she is not twisted) is fully aware of that. He refuses to participate in the premiere of his latest film, preferring not to go for a specific role he wants. Joslyn finds a pair for her (Lola's real sister Rosemary Lane) and Rosemary will star in the premiere and chase party. But he is involved with Powell (who wants someone who does not know Jose's true Lola). This leads to the extinguishing of Powell Mowbray, and the latter destroys himself. <br /> <br /> Contact our journalist at: trend@trend.az Do you have any feedback?

Agent Ted Healey (who is really not too bad in this movie - even trying to imitate Jolson at some point), both of whom are trying to find a job, bad behavior for hamburgers Edgar Kennedy (The restaurant's broken food and the number of accompanying customers gusto with a lot of time to accomplish it). As a result, Powell begins "interrupting" by calling Dupre's "Wind With Gone". <br /> <br /> This, along with Rosemary Lane, leads Herbert and Healey to the final part of the film. <br /> <br /> Powell helps Mowbrays not to show her voice. In the worst case, the time has come. Some jokes about African Americans are unacceptable (when he comes to Hollywood to photograph, Healey accidentally draws a porter and tells Joslyn to wait, Bring Powell photos to a very dark spot?). As for fashion designer Lola Lane, Curt Bois is a bit too loud or too tolerable (we must say). Herbert's "hoo-hoo" was a bit of a lot (often) but in 1937 it was really popular. Healey is a tragic, yet mysterious endeavor of comedians in December 1937 (one of his latest films). But the majority of the film is pretty good and will not disappoint the audience in 2008.
