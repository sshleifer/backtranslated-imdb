A man in New York City was forced to live on a hustle-ramped building with a crippled man. John Schlesinger, well-run by Jon Simon and Dustin Hoffman, is a very scary-looking, extremely well-managed, modern social and moral decline. Many are played for giggling - as the "mod" drug party is - gently interfering, but "fantasy" scenes generally get punched. The relationship between the two men is moody, but the filmmakers pay attention not to feel too much, and this gives the picture aside less than Schlesinger's. Winner of the X-rated and best picture Oscar in 1969; The scriptwriter Waldo Salt (James Leo Herily's book fired) and Schlesinger also sculptured. *** From *****
