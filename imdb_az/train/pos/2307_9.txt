I say that this movie is really nice and hearty. Reese Witherspoon is very charming and Jason London is so bad! Dani loves the love of his sweet heart and breaks my heart, and also warms my heart when I watch the Court fall in love with Maureen. However, he appreciates how cared for Dani. So we want Dani to fall to the end. I did not want him to be so sweet, following his fall, that he broke his heart very badly. but the biggest tragedy I have ever seen is in this film. She began to cry for the whole day waiting for her to die. I just could not believe it. However, later, Mureen and Dani did not show much love in movies. you really can do something. Because I did not want the court to die, I gave this movie 9 but it was one of the coolest films I have ever seen.
