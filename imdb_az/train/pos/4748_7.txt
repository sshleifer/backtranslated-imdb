The story did not get any awards, but it was not about ... The script was entertaining and stopping to make space for incredibly choreographic scenes. Who needs this war? Indeed, it's just worth considering. If you have a lot of LOTs, you can handle that one ... it's fairly realistic to be difficult to look at. I gave him 7.
