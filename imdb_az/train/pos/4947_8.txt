<br /> <br /> We can hope for a strong man like Morgan Freeman to take time to help people in need. <br /> <br /> All this comes to those who love. As Will Rogers said, "I did not meet a non-personable person." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, do not you like it? Her smile is moldy. It's just as fantastic as I can look at. Freeman is the same thing. <br /> <br /> Both of us gave us a comic movie from beginning to end. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font>
