Like many people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV and I think he is very good. But I did not know that I was my sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" just like any other respectable woman. Good music, intrigue and Amanda will remain with you for a few weeks. a scene of death that covers the revenge on. I'll let her go. Kudos.
