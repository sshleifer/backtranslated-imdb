Warners Bros In the era of depression I feel that music will be more attractive over the next few years. Yes, we look economically doldrums (or living under a rock) and times dark. However, we always make our films a way to avoid our troubles. Filmmaking in the 1930s was even very popular in the economic oppression skills. "Footlight Parade (1933)" flocked to the audience. This Lloyd Bacon director's music does not miss the public issues of the time like "The Golden Traffickers" in 1933 (1933), although it is still a beautiful talent show. Until the end of the film, we have to wait until three centers for Busby Berkely's extravaganza numbers, but the boy is forced to wait for me. Yes, a small Ruby Keeler is a terrifying singer and actress and knocking it down, but with Busby's magic "Waterfall" it stabs her and turns into a turning water, like other hundred girls. Of course, Busby's numbers could not actually perform on the same stage (they oppose the boundaries of gravity for something) and compared non-musical scenes with harsh, unrealistic realism. And James Cagney at "Footlight" has his all-too-many music (really what this man can not do?). He even owns a leading man, a boat and a silver lane from Shanghai Lila (who actually has a little Chinese girl naked Ruby). He co-stars with Joan Blondell, who came together with Cagney, in favor of other women (until the last reel). As you can see, Blondell Cagney was the only woman she was separated from. You can see mutual love at every stage.
