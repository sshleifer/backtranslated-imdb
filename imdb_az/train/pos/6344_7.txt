I drowned Jim Carrey's job. I continue to put this movie in my head. Grinch's liking Martha May, Cindy Lou (very bored, sweet innocent), trying to get Milch's spirit, Grinch's childhood (very laughable!) And even worse, the ending endangered, Grinch-i Grinch. I must say that I felt a smile with a group of funny guys and guys at the theater, but this movie was a well-timed adaptation of Dr.Seuss's short film and IS for all ages.
