This show is totally worthwhile. I have the best talent I have seen so long. The show's premiere is unique and fresh (maybe ABC leaders are not used because they do not have another reality show). But this show was convincing with unpleasant characters and beautiful story lines. I'm probably not in the age group, as I am forty years old, but many of my friends like it (30s to mid-40s) and die for quality demonstrations with talented castle members. I do not think this show has been enough time to win the audience. I believe that this show would take more time. Once again ABC can not give a real show with real potential. Many shows were accidentally given after the coincidence, and it is not worth it! They show the real chance to show the quality and show the time to win and win the audience. I really like the characters and I'm going to watch each episode. I watched the episodes in the ABC video and the show continued to be better and better. Though I think I owe one more episode (number 13?). We want to see what we can do! See whether Bombard ABC with emails and letters and whether it is possible to keep this show rescue. Of course Jerico worked for it. Some things are worth saving, and this show is one of them. ABC NOTES ON ONLINE SUBJECT: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
