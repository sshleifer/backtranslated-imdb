Gung Ho is one of those films I'm not tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite thing & it's not entirely fun at this movie. Gedde Watanabe to take her a step. Both work together in a beautiful manner. Although this movie is a comedy, I also show how Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Watanabe) are struggling in their role as leaders of their groups. Both spend too much time to maintain peace, and then they finally go into a fight (whether they want to watch or not). First, we're both. Then Hunt jumped into a cafe. Kazihiro throws over the table. Hunt jumps on the table with him. The fight then goes from the office to the factory. I love it after leaving the staff, and you can say it feels bad that both of them do not do anything like that. There is also a scene in which Hunt has an impact on Kazihiro. He is at home and says that he wants to come to Japan tomorrow and visit tomorrow's factory: <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is really laughable, At the same time, people can not learn from each other and show good friends.
