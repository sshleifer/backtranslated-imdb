It was the first movie Joan Crawford and Clark Gable had come together and would continue to do a few more. Crawford stars are a young adult who is a father who has crashed into the stock market and has nothing to do with her and her brother. They had never worked before, and his brother, William Bakewell, came up with a gangster, Gable, and Bakewell thought it would be an easy job, but he got his head pretty quickly. Crawford is a reporter in a newspaper, but wants to work on big stories, but worthless things to do. Their murder is a massacre in which several Gable men were killed and all witnessed by Crawford. Not a good movie, but one of the best.
