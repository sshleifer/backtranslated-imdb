I first saw this movie in the 1980s and now this movie is one of the best films I have ever seen! I recommend everyone to watch this movie. Sorry, you will not be sorry. It's a good exercise, a realistic and never a boring moment. Acting is perfect, and the film's place looks like the movie. This film is a kind of losing your attention from the very beginning to the right. The actress is doing a great job of illustrating a girl who survived this terrible plane crash in Amazon and shows how Amazon alone is beginning to live. It is incredible that everyone is alive in such circumstances. That's why this film is very appealing. Having this real story is even more exciting, and she believes a young girl can survive this difficulty. It's something I can watch over and over again, and I'm never tired. This is really a compliment because I have hundreds of films! This is probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
