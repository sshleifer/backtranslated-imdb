*** APPEALS *** *** APPEARS *** In 1956, it was considered extremely tolerant, and Douglas Circus was still a great thing about the top candy-colored melodrama. The plot is based on Robert Stack's great brother, Kyle, who is a very tactless and poor performer and has a wealth of unhealthy Texas family, a poor, wounded and very alcoholic, and was compiled by his sister sister Marylee Dorothy Malone. Mrs. Malone's performance is telegramed to us by our eyes, but rather uses the emotions that have long been for lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen before in a room. Now do not take me wrong, at least it means something and is one of the highest camps in the 1950s. But it is also scary, because Malone is not as a very good actress, as he is eager and attractive, and he is not able to make a weak or shadow. His performance is a note. He makes a bad mambo and a huge assemble, always rolling a ladder like the unaddressed daddy playing by Robert Keith, the Circus, orgasm dance with a little fashionable Malone as she stripped off. Stack (who should have won the Oscars) & Malone (prize-winning, but not) are the real stars of the film, all hysteria, both sexes and movements. Hudson & Bacall, the "real stars" of the film, fall into gray and brown colors, mostly of suits. Hudson, a better actor, plays the role of childhood and Stack's best friend, most of the film I love Malone who hates and hates Rock. But Hudson does not want any part of it and he favors Bacall, who is married to Stack. No one is very happy and nobody is happy. Stack-Bacall has a great time after a year, and Stack is drinking too much for himself because he thinks he is sterile, and Bacally can not give a baby to prove he is a man. A very clever man, Circus completed a Hollywood career in the mid-1950s with a series of strong, vibrant "women's films" or melodramas, a long and interesting career in film and theater in Germany. Although they are adapted mainly from medicore or dirty welding material, they have become the masterpieces of the genre in the circus hands. The circus has had a beautiful color and design feeling that emits emotional lives between strange color combinations that fill the wide screen space and illumination, playing in these shaded characters and reflecting the complexity of the majority. In "Written" images, it always flips the windows, listens to the doors or is hidden around. In the end, after a series of killing, after a lot of violence, the Circus ends up with a "reborn" final and an astonishing scene, and Malone sitting on a desk revealing a miniature oil water reform, reforming a man-suit suit.
