I was angry in this series. After half a episode, I was hooked. American Gothic was a dark, bizarre series with Gary Cole, the mysterious, probably the evil Sheriff Buck who wanted to take control of his son, Caleb's illegitimate son, Lucas Black. I was impressed by the evil sheriff of Gary Cole and more regretted with Lucas Black. Lucas Black's Caleb stood up against Sheriff Bucka, one of the most feared characters for a television series. I saw rarely a child actor with much presence or talent as Lucas Black. <br /> <br /> If you're not lucky enough to see Lucas in the US city of Gothic, look at her at Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a spectacular show with a lot of uncertainty and secrets that were never disclosed in a very short time.
