Scarface, directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, is a memorable movie. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana has become a "king" in the drug world after he has been violently exploiting the criminal empire in Florida. This gangster movie is very intense and it is unpleasant to watch some scenes. This movie has 180+ F-words and it takes almost three hours. This movie is entertaining and you will never be bored. Finding happiness for the drug lord and in some scenes you will find that Montana is not as bad as other criminals. This is a work and I recommend it. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
