I thought the Ice Age was a beautiful movie! There is no child like a 30-year-old woman, and I still love these charming, charming cartoons. Sid was the best character I have ever seen in Bartol in Anastasia (although he was really joking and I did not think his character could fit or even be beaten) and Madagascar was more enthusiastic than Melman. At least 15 times I've seen the movie (obviously I own it) and quoting a movie from the workplace (in many cases ... yes, yet). My favorite scene is that Sid and Manny continue to understand what the Sidney "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game" is trying to figure out what the tigers are trying to say ... "Worms package, bear pack, pirem bags, biscuit packages, a nose pack, a skin? lie pack, difficulty pack, a wall, packing birds, flying fish pack ... "or it goes! It's the most spectacular part about the whole movie, though I also really enjoyed the "sloths on the map" and many other parts behind humor. The only animated film that can be remotely compared to the Ice Age "Brother Bear".
