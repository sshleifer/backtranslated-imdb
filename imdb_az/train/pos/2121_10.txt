This is a beautiful movie that is beautifully operated by all players. It will make you laugh and you will be weeping. The last one of my film smokes me. If you want to see a great movie, that's it. Jimmy Stewert provides a beautiful toy and Frank Morgan as Mr Matuschek is spellbinding. Morgan's character is not unbelievable. William Tracy Pepi offers a gigantic comic relief and some of the most important lines and speeches in the film. Felix Bressart offers a fantastic performance like Perowitch, a bumbling shop worker who is a stumbling block to ask for those who are longing for life. Although this is unusual, it is a simple story of how close people can be two close-knit offspring.
