Orson Welles does not have a brilliant "Citizen Kane" movie, but Charles Lawton, Jr.'s cinematography, unforgettable pieces of fragments (scene in aquarium, Rita Hayworth's "Do not Love Me" and the glory of the Mirror Summit) and a great surprise (Everett Sloane, Welles, who plays the most beautiful performance, in the most beautiful work of Miss Hayworth - Welles' spouse, who has previously been featured). The voice of the strange murder is not only incomprehensible, but also entertaining and attractive. The viewer is surprised by the twist and turns, and Welles's closing line is an unusual classic. "Satan from Shanghai" takes four stars from this impartial arbitrator.
