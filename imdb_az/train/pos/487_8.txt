Luzin Defense, an outstanding glowing movie and a strange and unusual story of love, is an eccentric genius and a dignified involvement of a woman with beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> Probably, John Turturro Emily Watson shows the richness of his experience (from the prominent background). Also, Emily Watson, so far from the best roles (thanked for the goodness of Rallf Fiennes). To achieve the torture chess master (Turturro), his symbol should show a woman's love, as well as intelligence. <br /> <br /> One of the Nationalists, Watson and Luzin, refuses to loose her at random at a chance meeting. a chess piece dropped from a pit in his dress - and then realized in the film that he came to symbolize his hopes and desires. Later, when love develops, she dances express her dignity in respect of chess (Luzin teaches to dance, but never shared); <br /> <br /> This is a story. <br /> <br /> This is a story. a person who inspires a person to his greatest achievement and thus fulfills his deepest thoughts, emotionally and intellectually (or believe we believe - in time, Natalia is a freer woman.) Italian groups are striking. The complexity of the characters and the ability to communicate are a clever movie, but the film is fairly accessible and deserving to create a major hit. Chess is a fairly respectful act to convince a chess player of the existence of characters, but chess is only emotional and is a photogenic ground to develop an emotional film, despite the tragic endangered heights of a classic author, the final arrangement is still a surprising thing.
