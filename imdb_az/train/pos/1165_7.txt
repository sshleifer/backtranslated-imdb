As mentioned by another IMDB reviewer, this movie starts a little slower, but it improves significantly. Yes, it is released by Roger Corman and yes, it is on the same thematic floor as equally higher budget predecessors, so FATAL PROPOSALS and POISON IVY. Nevertheless, his wife's career has been accompanied by a rising blues singer and his almost emotional and physical "space" or "hole" along with the minimal effects and parameters of Freudia. Using a very small number of places and symbols, using almost every scene like cleaning and drowning metaphorical symbol, this movie remembers many more fully realized routes, even though it is clear from the minuscule budget. scenario, that is, to me, at least the seemingly French movie "WRAPPING POOL" could have paid some useful ideas from the moral point of view "against AMANDA." With a small set of tools, going against AMANDA, sometimes by accident, maintains a deadly sight of being surrendered to sensual desires, but gives good or better results than other films in this genre. In the past, Amanda's (more Freudian) abusive deception of his stepfather is also unique in this genre. I agree with Amanda's other unexpected and sympathetic reaction to this aspect of the story. <br /> <br /> Thinking is good. <br /> <br />
