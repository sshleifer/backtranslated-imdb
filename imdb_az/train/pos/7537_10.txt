Unlike those who hate Christianity, 700 clubs offer realistic answers and inspiration. Also, ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS provide more reliable news, logical interpretations and a distinctive look. Unlike other social and faith-explanatory programs, those who are behind the 700 Club are helping those in need, for example, to provide transparency with Operation Blessing, provide medical care to those living in poverty societies and to give hope to those in need. There is no hate. If the 700 Club insults you, I come to the remote control and turn the channel into your television. I do the same thing when I see CNN Headline News or any biased or unfair software. What I'm attacking is the way to abstain from the views of the ABC Family's 700 Club by not reflecting the ABC Family.
