Short bulletin <br /> <br /> This film opens with men free of charge. One of them is followed by a strange scheme and the other is rejected repeatedly. Later on, they are trapped in an office building that wants to break the safety during the Christmas holidays. Enmity turns into a staggering arcade and then turns into a hopeless battle for the right drink (because they can not lose all drinking liquids, really serious). Exposed, well-constructed and well-oiled torsoids put a hole on a wall and finally managed to escape? only to learn that they have betrayed and built women. One is captured and the rest is free and is not abandoned by his wife. Last one encounter, the last light for a cigarette, adieu l'ami, screw, friend. <br /> <br /> The two main characters played by the classic he-man superstars were difficult to see hidden homosexuals - Alain Delon and Charles Bronson. Obviously, it is attracted to each other, women's treatment is disgusting and all are hateful. The whole story has a strong symbolic commitment, looks like a bit reductions. This is also very elegant. Safe if one wants to reach two people ??? for the time? ultra-modern glass and aluminum tower. The place of the presentation company, so there are plenty of posters and wall coverings. The wardrobe is also very good. Ultra stylish Citroen DS (perhaps the most up-to-date and elegant car at all times) has a great feature in this movie? <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this movie for the performances of the actor. Delon and Bronson really hit me like I did in fair and sporty. Both are a large part of the acrobatics. Bronson did not look better than this, he really works and speaks all French, buying really profitable with a heavy emphasis. Surely, we are the people we hear. (So ​​French version is highly recommended). The two police inspectors are featured on my Franch character, my favorite actor, by Bernard Fresson, the partner of Gene Hackman in French Connection II. He is the best mysterious police inspector I know. <br /> <br /> Former children's actress Brigitte Fossey is as good as her young appearance. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, this is not innocent. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> This film can be a disappointment for the classic heist film. For those who have a little patience, this is a little cruel and sadistic for me, but with romantic and original ideas and director quirks it will be a perfect experience.
