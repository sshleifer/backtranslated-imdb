Halloween is a child story misunderstood as a child. He solves the problems of his brother, who was murdered at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Former US Secretary of State Donald Pleasans plays a doctor who is continuing his education at Myers. He knows that something is different, something mysterious. <br /> <br /> After fleeing an organization, Myers follows her younger sister. If she kills her, she can end the troubles of a misunderstood boy. However, she has problems when her other sister has succeeded as she left. <br /> <br /> Therefore, she was still looking for a girl in need of a girl. <br /> <br /> There are numerous films that result in the disintegration of teenagers or the breaking down of a terrible killer. But that's all. If you think about it, most of these horror movies we have mentioned are those who are pursuing half-naked girls called Freddy Kruger or Jason. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Hellouin, these characters would not delay our dreams when we were kids <br /> <br /> Halloween director John Carpenter had received more than 50th fear films. and in the late 70's, he combines everything from a film that protects hell from many people. <br /> <br /> These films have been featured as filmmakers to watch him and have begun the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the role of a girl who has been shot by a masked murderer. <br /> This movie might look clich√© today, but then there was nothing like that. It's copy-and-obsolete, but Halloween will always remain a quintessential teenage fears movie. While another victim is being watched by this shady Michael Myers, Carpenter is still bothered by listening to exciting music.
