I did not expect much from this movie, but it was a very pleasant surprise because it was light and funny and very well observed. The center-trio of the killing bikers was surprised by the fact that they were shocked by drug-based trips to Wales. Indeed, as the three characters (as the younger lady witnessed the shopkeeper's sympathetic treatment), humor was subtle and delicate. The West Welsh atmosphere was perfectly captured and the soundtrack was very well selected. I have never seen such a realistic description of alternative culture - with a careful and careful attention, focusing on detail - I felt I was with them. Many touching and entertaining light - what to expect from the movie about bikers and medicines. While it's hard to get a taste and criticism on all fronts, I think the last two scenes are a bit nude - the movie should be finished after leaving Wales. But in general, the unexpected treasure of a movie.
