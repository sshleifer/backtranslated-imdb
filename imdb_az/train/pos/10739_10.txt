Amazing documentary film. Over the last few years, I have seen several times in the original air and on the DVD. I was shocked by the fact that the best documentary Oscars of 2002 were not even nominated for being released. <br /> <br /> Recently, I have been on TV for the 5th anniversary, but now I've missed the "now they are" segment. <br /> <br /> I was critical of drawing a documentary about several people in this list. I can not see how this can be done in a different way. It was less than six months to collect and take them to the air. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <strong> What did they do?
