I do not want everyone to win by repeating what's already said, but this is one of the best rows! It was a big shame when it was canceled and I think someone would have to take it and re-start the series. Good news DVDs !!!! I ran to the store and took a copy and was happy to say that it was as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a beautiful dark and creepy character, and all actors were very good. The network is a shameless shock. Shaun Cassidy, this is a work. Anyone who loves and does not love it should do it. You will not be disappointed. When I'm on television, my daughter (20), too young to see her, is very interested and will be a fan soon. He thinks he is "very wrapped" and enjoys the episodes he sees. <br /> <br /> This is a demonstration of rocks !!!!
