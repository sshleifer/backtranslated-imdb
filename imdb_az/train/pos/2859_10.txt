I know that someone who was born after about 15 years after the demonstration was postponed, I love this show. I do not know why, but I'm very glad to watch it. I love Adam very well. The only disappointment is that the only place the DVD found to get the season was in Germany, and that was only the first two seasons. It's a disappointment, but that's okay. I will continue to look online. If anyone has any clues to getting the second place in the 14th season, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I've already got the first one. Only downstairs, DVDs are from Germany, they only play on my portable DVD player and my computer. He is excellent. I still have myself!
