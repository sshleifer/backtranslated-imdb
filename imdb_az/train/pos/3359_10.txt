Una giornata particolare is a film that uses brilliant gaps. These viewers are in these empty, empty places, seeing the emotional turmoil and strange explosions of Ettore Scola's two leading characters. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren, we decided to come together for some of their short moments. People believe that it will be side by side with the characters near them, which is part of the sadness of the narrative. All the people really felt sorry for the character of Sophia Lor√©r. the women will cry heartily in the present condition of Marcello Mastroianni. As you can see, sexuality is also one of the main issues of this terrifying, strange film. Most characters are struggling with issues related to their gender. The giornata can not be named particolare. gay movie, although a gay woman shows a good way to get involved with women in a good way. This Italian director, Ettore Scola, has prepared a good mix of truth and fiction. In his opinion, the arrival of Hitler is to show how the victories of the usual Italian people have changed. The story of brave businessmen was performed by Marcello Mastroianni beautifully. he will not beg for regret. She happily admits her fate and reads herself to the worst of her short but meaningful life. Movie is a real masterpiece !!!
