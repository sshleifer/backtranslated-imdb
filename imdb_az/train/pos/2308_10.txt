While watching the movie store, I regard it as an argument and I was not even more pleasantly surprised! My mother and I watched this movie together and enjoyed it thoroughly. Of course, it's not a typical "chicken-flaming" story with a love story, and it's all over the tears, but it finally touches a twisted nerve. Although this is unpredictable and tragic, it is an endless loss by the overall effect of the movie. Reese Witherspoon, I think it's a great actress for the first time in this movie, and it's definitely worth watching! I did not recognize most of the actors I support, but all of them play a significant supporting role. "The man in the moon" is such a convincing story about a young teenager who is in love for the first time. Many women may be committed to everything: Witherspoon's words are not from gentle eyes and gentle emotions, but rather as a typical teenage girl. While playing a mixed character on love, he is highly regarded, unhappy and unsatisfactory, taking into account numerous films.
