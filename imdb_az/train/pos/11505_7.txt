A few years ago, two Kolchak TV films bought and enjoyed MGM dual DVD, THE NIGHT STALKER (1971) and THE NIGHT STRANGERS (1972). Whenever the next series of Universal TV series came out, I was just about to get it - but what they said about playback issues with cowardly DVD-18 forced me to add it to our collection; <br /> <br /> Recently, I made an online booking of discounted Universal Box sets and decided to buy the COLCHAK 3-Discer. <br /> <br /> Now, after looking at it, I'm safe to say that if you're sorry to get a little bit of this (if you are short) crime / horror series, this can follow a standard formula - Darren McGavin's beautiful, shady and skillful newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak is facing each other's hairstyle (flustered editor Simon Oakland, a long-lived colleague, various authoritarian people, many monsters and villains), facing imminent (and usually supernatural) danger, but eventually wrapped up his story pressure - but winning <br /> That is, quality changes from one episode to another and differs from humility. The budgets give them special results and sometimes it is not possible to mention that any of the things (for example, the worm and the last crocodile created by the dark crocodile), which is a thing of the past, are limited to 50-minute programs, it is often intended for family use, and prevent the simplified and effective demonstration of metaphysical issues (in fraudulent situations, but not for anyone who suffers, but with little foolishness just to throw people around) !! <br /> <br /> Although there is a lot to shoot one of the heroic storyline of a heroic story, there is a solid dose of comedy aid in every episode (often, but McGavin's Oakland or geeky reporter Jack Grinnage) - The reasonable atmosphere does not mean (no, most for Chicago) and suspense. <br /> <br /> Note that Kolchak's series of monsters (but not always defeated) has started to revive. Jack The Ripper, the Droppelganger, Satanist, swamp robot, apeman, witch, headless motorcyclist, succubus, himself deadly, with various cults (voodoo, indigenous America, Aztec), aliens, vampire, werewolf (this particular episode is absolutely a cruise liner!) Emmardt), Helen Of Troya (!) and crocodile, a knight armor (perhaps the best supporting actress, John Dehner, Morose, police captain Hans Conried and Robert). The same roles are played by KÃ¶nan Wynn and Ramon Bieri (both law enforcement officers), John Fiedler (as a servant in a terrible morgue) and Richard Kielin as two different nemeses (except Kolchak employees). When I click to select the best (or most entertaining) episodes, HEIGHTS HORROR (by Phil Silvers and Abraham Sofaer) and the above mentioned articles are the weakest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are no additions in the set: KOLCHAK: liked to discuss the numerous concepts discussed at STALKER at night, especially when it is tied to the place where the television was originally airing or even viewed its long-term impact. In the infinite number of appearances of the series. In fact, Kolchak itself is much younger and more visible in a dark appearance - revived in 2005; this version is available in my local DVD rental source ... but for various reasons I would like to check it out after the 1974-5 classic.
