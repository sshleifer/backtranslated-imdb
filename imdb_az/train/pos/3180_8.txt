I think a friend gave me this DVD that I received from the director at this festival. Some of the technical aspects of the film were slightly shaking and the writing was good, but not good. Probably this was my decision, but I have to admit that I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Where the actors are. Youssef Kerkor, like Ernie, was a cruel, unpleasant thing. Adam Jones (also directed by) and Justin Lane were very good as hospitable people who managed Ernie's hole. Bill's character (Justin Lane), who spent many films dressed like a panda, was my favorite; at least one dimensional, and after looking at the DVD, he recalled an old college guest room that I had called for. It's really cute and very funny. Some of the other players were good, some of them were, but none were bad. I liked the vigilante prayer very much. Careful and funny. <br /> <br /> Although there are some issues, this is a very high price. Because you've been watching the attention of these people, they decided to shoot their films. Adam Jones and the crew did well.
