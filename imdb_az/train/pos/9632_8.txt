This time Laurel & Hardy's role in chimney cleaners is quite striking. <br /> <br /> The film also has a subplot with a perfect professor working on the genealogy formula. Indeed, not just as a logical mix of story lines, but also incompatible, but both lines are perfectly matched to the memorable end. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the shooting of the film is a shooting. <br /> <br /> With regard to filming, Sam Adams is as big as a stereotypical butler, and Lucien Littlefield goes like a strange professor in a high level. <br /> <br /> The film is packed with a great timing and excitement, but all of them are delighted to follow through the way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> 8/10
