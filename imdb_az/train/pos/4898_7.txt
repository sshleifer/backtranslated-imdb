A WWII is a charming little movie in the UK about the reunion of the whole girl (almost) swing band. A great player of the elderly, Dench and Laine's great prizes awarded by the great "pipes", bring bright perspectives to this exciting tale life. Have a good time and an entertaining hour for everyone.
