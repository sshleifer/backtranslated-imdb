As for movies, I can be very selective and complain about everything you do wrong and everything else. <br /> <br /> If there were any defects in each film, the night listener was pretty low. <br /> <br /> If you read the last look (it was difficult, because half of it was written in the headlines and the film) may cause the film to think that it is not very well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 posts in the same view, if you discover the cause of the poster disappointment, the director does not seem to be gay (or the production team is cracking). So I did not, at first, consider it, though, that I thought the film was a genuine, non-sexual essence. Soon switch to a fast checklist: 1. Great plan? Completely. I will not give it a piece of it, but the plot is highly attractive and not necessarily based on ads. It's not a fever, it's a tension, and it needs to be approached like this. Because it is genuine truth, you will be amazed at the fact that the truth is true (and the plot was very loyal to actual events). <br /> <br /> 2 beautiful things? Yes. Robin Williams has long ago released comedy-type gangsters, and since then many have developed a serious role that many people have written ten years ago. </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG>> The perfect direction is certainly. Unlike the other poster I now refer to, I really know something about the direction. For 3 years, the art of management has been sutdying at school. Of course, I'm licking a different lens (I think there is something in this direction), probably I do not think, but I think that I never thought that I would justify my ideas on something important and important, for example: the director's sexual orientation ( or drugs produced by the production team, LOL). Patrick Stettner's direction was moody and dark, and it's angles and lighting, often a pile of camera work, and helping us to create more "tension and freedom" feelings that are often faster than we are today. . Some people really can tell a story through your camcorder, while others feel like making a story with a camera. <br /> <br /> I am really happy when it's a brave person to use as it's likely to use the camera these days. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great all around. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that it will take a few days from today. Especially if they are so stupid, if they know about one-fourth of the way they are doing, do not listen to people who are misguided to get rid of them. Enjoy your show! -Me
