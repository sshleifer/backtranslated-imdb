My father, Dr Gordon Warner (US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost to Japan and accepted the Sea Cross. I was amazed to learn that my dad was a technical advisor to this film and I hope he has influenced the film as I read in the different comments he wrote by the audience. this movie looked like a real life. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, including my mother for more than 40 years (ironically, Japanese), and several years ago McArthur helped them bring Japan to Kendo and Iaido after banned them and was awarded one of the highest awards of the Japanese Empire for his contributions World War II. <br /> <br /> My father was once a sea, but I know that you are always in the sea when you are in the sea. <br /> <br /> I would like anyone to watch this movie if it has a copy. I would also like to give my dad for his 94th jubilee this year!
