This show has fled the reality for the last ten years. I'll just give it away. <br /> <br /> Atlantis filled a small part of the pit, though. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (on the television anyway) worked fine. Robert wrote something close to the truth. He was probably trying to explain what happened in the show. (For a long time, everyone working closely together has the upper and lower parts, but they have become a family over the years). <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special, and time and again passed me through the throats of disbelief and admiration. Beautiful characters, stories, directors, writers. One episode was confused with me. Movement, science, drama, and especially the comedy mix have worked so well that I continued to desire more. <br /> <br /> There is no real word to fully express what this show has to me. I would like to thank only those who keep my show in a very stunning and entertaining atmosphere for many years. <br /> <br /> I'm going to wait for the films next year and I really hope they will be a number. <br /> <br /> SG1 - Stargate SG1 in the years 1997 to 2007?
