Yes right. In 1983, Sammo Hung acted as the "Magic Mountain Zu Warrios". Now, it's doing it again with Zu Warriors in 2001. But this time it's finally true. You often see it in the classic East or on a criminal rifle in wuxia. But this role is just for her! An ancient Chinese legend about Mount Zu is often not featured in films (as far as I know about western translations). Although the legend has many interesting stories and opportunities. Straight says: You have not seen the same story in a modern movie! And it's great too! And wow: all the colors plus a very deep, right-in-the-hearted story is to fall for this movie at a time. I was watching it for the first time, I had to watch it again and I did. Okay, I did not understand all this for the first time. But it just makes it even better! You know, you did not understand all this because there are so many spices there! For this, it is a pleasure to see a single person repeat. <br /> <br /> Your favorite story, the faces you are crying, and indeed: a movie you will not forget! - The editors note: well, maybe we should wait for it again: D
