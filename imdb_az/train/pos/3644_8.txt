Rookie, based on the true story of a 40+ year old school teacher at Big Lake, Texas universities. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small city secondary school teacher and baseball coach. The team loses quite a while until the team coach can play smaller leagues and discover that a pitch can throw 98 miles. <br /> <br /> After hitting a practice and a bet, Jim agrees that his team will try for the Big League if he wins a regional win. The film will play the story of Jimmy's boy, the first in the specialty. It's a great story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid reviews the film and includes Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones, giving an emotional performance. <br /> <br /> The story is a little progressive and some scenes are a bit slow, but all work well. Baseball scenes are entertaining, well drawn and perfectly illustrated. The film is not about baseball, but about seeking a man to dream. It's inspirational, it's emotional and funny. <br /> <br /> Rookie: "I love you, I hope." Player: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
