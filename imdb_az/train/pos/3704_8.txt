Generally, these cut and pastry films are difficult to evaluate. Some segments may be very good when others have lowered their overall product rating. In this case, for example, all the girls in the doctor's office were the scene ... this viewer is the best in the history of the review. Then there's a segment of Asia ... lady is always entertaining. The story that combines all this was an interesting concept. Swap scene closing down is also bad. Technically, production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
