This review takes about 30 years. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that I was watching this movie in early 2008 and looking straight for 4 months! I have to write about it! After seeing this movie, I forgot something forgotten and I forgot. How strange it is to describe the finest man in literature as the protagonist! yet a nice mock! It was perfect for me and more suited to me, as Timothy Dalton was fully justified in his role. He made a stunning and triumphant act! I have never seen anything like this! All other actors are also very good. The entire film was set in a beautiful place. I do not encourage anyone to say what they say about this movie. I just love it and love it! He made me happy and pleased. It smashes a bit to say, but I prefer the P & J of A & E from Jane Eyre in 1983, which is the latest mini-series. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyrein's letter I missed back in school. I have never read a book that knows the story line. Because of this special production, the story revived for me and turned me into an annoying fever. The scenes and the sounds of Mr. Dalton made me excited, and eventually led to my book reading seriously, of course, a work. Bravo to the whole team, and especially Mr.Dalttona! This movie is now a part of me. <br /> <br /> I give you 10/10 rating.
