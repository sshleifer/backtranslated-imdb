<br /> <br /> This film has no romantic or other imagination, but a move and intrigue to make a true man's kung-fu movie all the way. <br /> <br /> An aging master represents his youngest son, Jan Tieh, five-style old students with five poisonous animals such as marinades, snakes, scorpions, lizards and victims. Despite the word "venom," none of this student uses poison to kill his opponents. Jan Tieh told his teacher that he should find out if he had been able to form a union to defeat the other four, if there were no adaptations for the five former students. <br /> <br /> As Yan Tieh and others find each other, the good kung-fu movement has spread throughout the story. <br /> <br /> Known as the cult classic, this movie is already annals itself by kung-fu actor films. <br /> <br /> Other films refer to five styles depicting this story as being well-known. <br /> <br /> This is not an ordinary work, but with the usual bad dubbing and dark movements, but the film is the best <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > It's because of the fact that Kung Fu is paying attention to all the ingredients of the film and giving them an additional concentrated dose. <br /> <br /> A movie-movie movie fan.
