After watching the Appeal Magic, I watched this movie and was a great movie. I liked the change of lighting, makeup and clothes as Gillian's story changed. Jimmy Stewart's behavior did not do much for me in this movie, but I think he was serving to emphasize the character of Gillian. I was shot by the behavior of Nicky and Gillian - the director wanted him an effeminate and Gillian's look. Nicky showed Redlich's powers, especially when I hit. I have never thought of conservatives, so it was an interesting way to reflect these characters.
