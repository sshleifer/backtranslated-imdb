While the version of Lang is more popular, Borzage's works are not so far away: his "heavenly" rows are better. The metaphor of the train (probably the borrower with the end of Abel Gance's "roue") is ultimately higher. The sensitivity to the character of the drum shows the character of Marie and his love outside the grave is his favorite theme (the "three comrades" end). The park looks everywhere: even if we are in Marie's poor home. I do not think the groups are very cheetahs, they are stylized with one file. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > It is not a major job for the borzage (not the Langun version), or if it is interested in the great director's career.
