If you were born at the end of this movie and had a liberal / open-minded family that I was giving you, I am sure that in the early 80's, your parents were watching dirty movies or too dirty movies. You know, 100% is not a pornographic, but alchemical mixture of actual drama and pornography, or a collection of them, and you know a movie will pop in the plastic rectangle of such a film on a big dookie machine called VBR. I must be very calm and be like a ninja, but with fewer heart failure, when pressing buttons similar to the tablet, fearing the discovery of large pop noises. Whatever happens, such films have been sent behind their minds, waiting and waiting for a reunion with such a visual "art". Of course, this movie corresponds to the description above "T". Many people comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but maybe because of my desensitization, I'm more concerned about the delicacy. Our Creator spoke at a much deeper level of human trafficking or could be regarded as genuine accusation, interethnic relations, bedrobe masturbation, voyeurism or murder of social status, pedophilia / homosexuality, or the pressure of the social elite women in France in the 18th century? Who can say, but despite the fact that Mr Borowcyzk is a "norm" for his work to be genuine, I can say that this film speaks to the audience at a much deeper level with the best carnival. After learning this story, the story has been more exciting than the extreme edge of the shock cost, and should be checked before that.
