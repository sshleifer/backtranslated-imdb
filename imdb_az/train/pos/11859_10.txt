All MTV ribs and pull-outs make the Scarface classic movie out of the DVD collection. It can give an idea that Scarface is a "gangster film". Certainly, there are bandits and gangs there, but this is not the meaning of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is a Cuban refuge seeking a new lifestyle. He falls into groups of crowds and becomes a reputed drug lord. Montana was all about doing what you wanted to do with your life. Classical sentence: "Say hello to my little friend!" At Scarface. When I think about Brian DePalmas, Scarface, this word always comes to mind. This is my top 10 favorite movie. I appreciate it *** 1/2 (from ****). You need to see a definitive film. FENOMENAL.
