Cinderella's mother is a film about a young girl who died and remarried her father. After his father died, Cinderella's stepmother made a great deal of work for him and he did all the work around his house, and he was cleansed after two bad stops. One day, the King sent a message to all the children to attend a Royal Ball in honor of his son to find his wife. Certainly, Cinderella did not go, but her skills improved. Cinderella was very upset and thought that his fairy would not be able to join the Royal Ball until his mother died. So he did a magical job and turned Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but had to go back to midnight, because magic had changed. At Royal Ball, Cinderella loses time and leaves for half an hour, so she runs away from the palace and loses her glass. Then the King orders the women to find clothes with clothes. The dumber searched every home, but finally found the women belonging to Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated films in 1950. a magical fairytale. At the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant for his family, and nobody liked him, but with a little magic he changed his whole life and eventually found love. <br /> <br /> What I love is Cinderella music. When Cinderella's fairy-tale mother used her magic, she sang Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, I would love to read around my house, and I will never forget it. I also loved Cinderella and Prince when she read the song. So they love when they dance because they understand they are in love. Generally, when I was a little kid, this movie was my favorite movie because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale.
