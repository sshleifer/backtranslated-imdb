One of the best Tarzan films is one of its most popular action packages (and graphics). <br /> <br /> Come back to the elephant cemetery for a year or a few years after Tarzan Ape Man to collect an ivory friend of Niel Hamilton's Holt. Her friend also carries clothes and perfumes that Holt hopes to use in Jane from Tarzan. Holt finds out that his map was stolen before he left the country, and his opponent turned into a madman to try and seize an expedition. When they finally took the thieves, the whole party was dead and covered themselves. There is no other way to fight for them, and soon they are in the frypot and wood. <br/> <br /> <br /> Tarzan and Jane are visible and everyone else faces adventures. <br /> <br /> The blasphemy film has been subjected to severe censorship to reduce graphic violence (according to today's graph of graphics, it is likely to have a few minutes of naked swimmers to deal with all the hints of nakedness (Jane, a full-fledged frontal scene) , has just been restored recently.) The newer version is watching why this movie is down for 20 minutes while it is working on TV, and it's a great movie, as well as its restored version, a romantic, touching, action-packed and all-inclusive movie. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful film of any standard, both of which are the best of the film, as well as a unique adventure, not to be watching the first movie of a movie, but also a film that deepens the characters and themes created in the original film. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. <br /> <br /> The film If there is any deficiency, perhaps this film is not well aging, the back of the screen is often very clear, there are gorilla suits for many monkeys, and some of the other effects are more convincing, more strange. <br /> <br /> <strong> Put yourself a large popcorn bowl and curl on the sofa and just pull yourself back from a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.
