What would happen when a depressed pedestrian was running? It can be very entertaining ... This movie has set a criterion for the Argentine cinema's action / comedy genre. A speed that is a speed between the legendary characters, the likely stories and the laughs. I have been advised to have a fun time. Peretti and Luque combine efforts to combat the cold and courageous enemy at one time, when it is difficult to rely on one another. This film will surprise you, the other side of the "Analyze me" coin, but not the same, there is nothing in it. And if you want to know Bs.AS, there are several scenes from the city and the city center.
