There are many reasons to watch this movie: seeing the reality of Latin America, Latin America, kidnapping, continental level police violations, and Latin American reality amongst the many facts we live in. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, and this guy continues to be a great actor and continues in this way. Dakota Fanning has been a wonderful actress for just 10 years and I congratulate him. The rest of the film was striking, and I'm in my collection. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Hollywood producers have come to the film to shoot a film in Venezuela, so they can better show us the truth about crime, drug trafficking or political problems. <br /> <br /> "Una Mirada" song, Venezuelan lands (for example, Aranofobi, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly). I hope it is good that this noise will be abandoned. My vote is 10/10
