I saw this movie at Palm Springs International Festival in 2005, and I'm going to take the 4th place out of the 14 films I've seen there. The 900+ theater was full and eventually received an applause. It was classic Peter Falk, a fan of Falk and many chemists between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser characters. The title of the film sounded long and very strange to me. I'm surprised that I did not release it at all. It was better than some great studios throwing you. Perhaps, many adults are directed to this baby bumper and a large audience. Many people can relate to the situation in this film. Probably if people look at this movie and think of it as a kind of stone, then it will be restored for a few years now. I'm going to reduce this to 10.0 from 8.0 to 8.5 degrees, and I strongly recommend it.
