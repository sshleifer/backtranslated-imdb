It's a beautiful-looking movie with everything done in six or seven colors. When it appeared 15 years ago, it surprised audiences with a color scheme and different from what was filmed. These colors, for me at least, are such an interesting film to watch. <br /> <br /> Heroes and story do not fit the size of the photography, but they are not the size of the photo. all over the top, especially the villains. Famous actors performing here, "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles" and others. There should be a lot of fun playing. <br /> <br /> Besides, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girl friend Tess Truehart and are sweet and soft as his name. Another good addition was Charlie Korsmo, a young assassinated young boy, Dick and Tess. Other colorful characters include Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but here are many. <br /> <br /> Famous writer: "Authors of the article". <br /> <br /> The article says that nearly 10 minutes have been cut off well. All these "defects" are small, because in general this is a fun movie ... a cartoon strip that comes to life in an incredibly colorful way ..... like something you have never seen.
