Most of the films, along with Ralph Bakshi, appear as two-edged swords. Apart from that, you will get something, but if you get up with foolishness and unnecessary cheezy. The great Lord of the Rings animation division was a great adaptation of the story that could not always shine. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice - a great success in terms of animation. Rotoscopy has a much more detailed and animated look. You're still getting bored with some cells and a little background paintings, but all images since Baky's final fantasy episode have definitely improved. The animation has almost realistically-natural style and, unlike LOTR, this style is often compared to the actual content, which enhances the unique atmosphere of the film. Unfortunately, the film is a meaningful story with a simple setting and in fact most of the characters are quite blurred. Although Lorn and Tigra were in the easiest cases, the main hate was hard to chase to mention in the Necron da Guy (also known as 'O Guy') with the Furry Face Mask. <br /> <br /> Although most audio actors are compatible, there are some surprises in the audio section and Tigra sounds really shocking, especially when it is shouting. <br /> <br /> But the peculiarities of the film are unnecessary. Patient conduct of field line. Excessive cover of symbols, you will never understand, but perhaps reminds you that this film will not even be taken seriously. Still a hella cool and really funny.
