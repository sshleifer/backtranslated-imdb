I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. Despite the fact that the storyline was quite good, the storyline was pretty good, especially in season 1. Season 2 but a freak show has become more and DA's original charm lost. A story of the season was a lighter part of life in Jam Pony, a serious organization focused on the manticore that fled down the line X-series. I was expecting the new season, in fact, still. Hopefully the FOX guys and the DA production team are still waiting for you to make a comeback of DA too many ppl. Even after 2 years have been abolished, if the DA did the right thing, he could do a great job, and I think he'll give a name like James Cameron.
