This show has all the typical characters in comedy: good man, good, devious, rich girl ... but in the 70s. That's the difference with other television comedies. I do not know how you can do this show. His humor is miserable! I want to say that the jokes are versatile ... Fez: Oh, Jackie, I want to have sex with you (the audience laughs) Jackie: (The audience laughs) Fez: Yes, I like it (the audience rejoices and applaudes) "It's not funny, I think if you did not have these laughs (I do not know how to speak in English, I do not apologize) It's not an intelligent comedy, it's an insult to the public I love the majority of American comedies, but it's not good, I'll give her 10 out of 4.
