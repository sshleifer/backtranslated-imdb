The title slightly simplifies the content of this movie, which can cause some unrealized expectations. There is, of course, very few "panic in the streets" to be seen here. In fact, very few people throughout the film know that there is an empty killer who can spread to everyone and everyone you meet. Here's what we do here is a very good story, and it starts at a fairly high level (because, unlike "people in the streets", the audience knows what is happening), and Elia Kazan is very intentional. One of the more interesting things I found was because of the relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and police captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At the outset, though, both have to work together, but they really do not like each other. In the end, they have genuine respect for each other. The boiler did a good job. <br /> <br /> All the speeches here were very good. Widmark and Douglas were very nice and I was playing with Jack Palance and it would be his typical "heavy" role. I found so few to criticize here. Maybe Barbara Bel Geddes came to a somewhat plain place like Reed's wife, Nancy, but the role was not really important for the story. All this is a great piece of work. 9/10
