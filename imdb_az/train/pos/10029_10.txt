People say what this movie is about and it's not about horrible movies like The Godfather. The Titanic is the largest film of the 21st century. Great player, director, influence, music and everything at all. This film is always poured out, because one day someone said they did not like it, and most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All in all, we can say that this movie was not just the Oscar-winning film, but the most money ever and, unfortunately, was one of the few films I've ever seen. In addition, this is really the best film of all time. All Star Wars and Rings Trilogy or something masters are the only movies to be close to being like something by Hitchcock or Spilberg or Tim Burton. These are good films and directors but no one is James Cameron's Chess Titanic.
