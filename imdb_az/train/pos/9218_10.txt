First, I say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year because I knew Angelina Jolie was in love and I love her. But my love for the movie has nothing to do with my idea. In any case, no video store carried him, but he saw the local library. I watched it and I absolutely loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes but it was good and funny. <br /> <br /> Each actor and actress did a great job. The sex laughs a lot in humor. In general, I think it is worthwhile for you to find this movie. Watching is very nice and just fun. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
