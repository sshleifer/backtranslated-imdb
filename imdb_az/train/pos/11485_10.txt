The Day of Zero leads you to think, even thinking of what the two boys / young people do - to commit suicide by killing their classmates. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect film, but a strange one for two people who decide to withdraw from the general society to determine their own / mutual world, not a different film. the owner of the movie and actors are given some money / time - this is a remarkable product. Two young suicide / killer motives and motions are better than "Elephant" - in terms of being a part of our "rationalist" skin, it's almost a far cry from a movie. <br /> <br /> Rude but honest with honest honesty.
