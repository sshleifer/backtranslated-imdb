It's a great pleasure to distort the work of a similar artwork or to turn it into another without any contradiction. I had no idea of ​​being re-built as an unusual piece of literature. If you love Bulgakov's book, of course, you're afraid to see some of the more misleading comments for a feature film project rather than a story deeper into the screen. The Master and Margarita have several examples of this. There is nothing in the film as complicated and exaggerated as the story. As the filmmaker reads the work of Bulgakov, he reads the account of an orchestra chief - a missed note. Why can not we find such a talent in the United States? Now my favorite book and movie are the same tremor.
