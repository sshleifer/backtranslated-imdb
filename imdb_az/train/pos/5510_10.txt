Undoubtedly, it is one of the most striking things about Che: The second is that, as it begins to integrate with a considerable part, Che can not be sure that he chose to remain a secret from Cuba after the revolution, and that his experience is not surprising. Congo chose Bolivian why he chose a state coup therefore no clarification has been made. Walter Salles, a motorcyclist in South America, did not make any promises for political decisions he had made for a well-known young man. Extraordinary attention Chane meets volunteers accompanying her partisan faction. Nevertheless, any attempt is made for everyone to individually associate and establish relationships. He is unfounded. Che draws an untrustworthy doctrine to leave behind no wounded man. But it does not have a direct sense of deep concern with men. In Cuban Part 1, rebels were welcomed by the villagers, dining and covering, and supported as a growing win revolution. There is not much understanding in Bolivia here. The villagers are exposing her. They protect the government troops, not themselves. Speaking about the government's advanced medical system, viewers appear uninterested. If they do not want you, you can not bring the people back to the revolution. Soderbergh shows US military advisers working with Bolivia, but does not blame the US for the collapse of China. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Soderbergh " Soderbergh looks firmly at Che's harsh amusement, but there is little sporadic visceral shots, but it's not so small, but it's not the least of a suddenly unreasonable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Benicio Del Toro It is at least modest that someone performs championship performance, and is not as advanced as the most epic heroes in Cuba, Bolivia. it is difficult to distinguish between the beard and the hair, and Del Toro is not like an identity. You can think of it as too long. I think there is a real reason for its width. Guevara's work in Cuba, and especially in Bolivia, is not a series of episodes and sketches, but the power to be almost reputed. Finally, as a whole or partially, Chei is a commercial filmmaker, a commercial filmmaker who understands the limitations of commercial filmmaker's kinematic biography and has started to work with these means.
