Wrestlemania 14 can not often be regarded as one of the greatest Wrestlemania, but if I'm not personally my top 5, it's not the top 3. This is a great deal of things, and it's really the best time of the Attitude Era WWE. HBK owns a lion's heart and performs Austin as its own, a pure class of its own. He has one of the hottest groups you can ever see, and JR and the Kingdoms have been declared the best. <br /> <br /> Objectives. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? King LOUD pop in battle for team returning to L.O.D. I am not an admirer of the warrior, and it's still a moderate. Very likely, even if you see the first paragraph, you will win L.O.D. When you look at Sunny for 8 or more minutes, it definitely helps. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> It's a striking pop up at the checkout entrance. Fast, high flying and very exciting. If these two men had not spent more time, they undoubtedly destroyed the roofs with their hands. <br /> <br /> WWF European Championships. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stipulation seized Chyna here with Slaughter. A beautiful pop for Owen, a mixed reaction for your trips. In fact, in fact, in fact, it's one of my favorites for Wrestlemania. The two are well-mixed and Owen can not come to anyone. <br /> <br /> Marg Mero & Sable Vs Goldust & Luna "Garabagh". Identify the popup for Sable, not hearing the time, for the woman. Sable looks really hot and the crowd just eat her !. Fixed Sable's songs and every time they're in the ring. The mixed tag was not bad for the match, the antics were entertaining and the time was good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sable team is winning, Sable TKO ' or hitting. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2/5 WWF Intercontinental Championships. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock C | Prior to reviewing the match, I would like to note that Rock first showed great potential with an interview with Jennifer Cicek. Great time for Shamrock pop, great time for The Rock. Very disappointing, and I thought that was a bit stupid, though Samrakech's screaming antique sight was in sight, and the congregation took out a nuts for it. <br /> <br /> <strong > The Caucasian> Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws. Refugees are not over yet, unless they are so much. The crowd was actually somewhat dead for it, but I thought it was some great Hardcore bit with some great patient bumps. <br /> <br /> Cakarta and Terry will win the title in the final. <br /> <br /> 3/5. Great time ovation for The Undertaker. Better than a visit to Wrestlemania 20 and for a great man and great man match it was very good. In Hell, a patient was a great trial on the table, taking a seemingly innocent person. WWE was clever and was looking for such a strong title by defeating Kane. <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. Crowd Austin's ape sh * t, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. This is actually a special match, one of the biggest ever wrestling events in history, and you can even say JR is out of breath. HBK gives everything he needs to be his last match, and Austin rarely improves. The hostility and electricity of the meeting are unbelievable, and it's as exciting. Austin won with stunning joining Tyson and Michaels by joining 3:16. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br / <br /> 5/5 5/5 Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real. It has everything you need in Wrestlemania, and it's actually the Shootout era. It was very special to me because it was the first Wrestlemania I saw in 98. "Austin Era, it's started!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2/10
