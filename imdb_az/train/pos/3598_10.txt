Because of the fact that boxing films are not being used, they are really the only ones who focus on the shit, not the symbols themselves. Loving to see the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) go through a lot of things in a short time, it was fine for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did such a wonderful job, especially with Diana, because of her first acting experience, she demonstrated true emotion and described Diana beautifully. All actors were chemistry on the screen and made this movie even more beautiful. I am entrusting this movie to those who are not watching boxing films. 10/10
