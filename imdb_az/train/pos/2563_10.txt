I saw some comments on Brandon's South Shutter, and some felt that it was a mistake. When this film was made, racism and discrimination in the South were very powerful. The laws of Jim Crow were still in force. Civil rights were in her infancy. Maybe this is a southern man who is in love with a woman of another race? Likewise, MASH was a gentle critic of the Vietnam War? <br /> <br /> Another comment came in the interview with Myoshi Umek, who was "cold" during the interview. Anyone in Japan will understand. The Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not tend to show their emotions to foreigners. There were strict social rules for men, especially for single women. Americans in Japan were totally foreign to this culture, and bold attempts to meet women were shocked by women. A feature in Japan smiled when it was embarrassing or uncomfortable, but it was a sign of many American military service advances. Recall, at the time of the film, that Japan was defeated and remembered irresponsible of occupying forces. I think that Myoshi Umeki made a very reliable statement on what would happen. When I looked at the relationships with American actors, I remembered some of the experiences I had in my country. After being convinced of myself, I was not a typical American, and I could get acquainted with a few lovely young ladies who taught me their language and culture in my own country.
