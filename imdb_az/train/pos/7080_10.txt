Terry Gilliam gives me a great movie that delights me. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt, and Christover Plummer's little view make the film absolutely brilliant! The only thing I've seen is Terry Gilliam's movie and Twelve Monkeys are definitely on my 10's. I think this is one of the four best Bruce Willis movies; and Brad Pitt is the best. Brad Pitt presents a perfect performance. It's possible that one of the 10 best performers I've ever seen. He played a very convincing role (Geoffrey). The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite satisfactory. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt made a pretty good move. Bring back great performances with a bright story; and Terry Gilliam's superb management.
