I was accepted at birth and, of course, the film did not have problems with the Antwone fisherman, but I still share some of my emotions, and this movie really helped me get them out and deal with them. <br /> <br /> I realized that I was a missing piece for me, and now I'm going to look for my parents who are in my birthday. <br /> <br /> Just one day we cried for the first time I saw it. The conflict with Antwone's father's reaction to the sudden appearance of the family is stronger for those who do not know what to expect if we find our parents. Self-confidence and self-assertion were strong against those who accused her mother and her past. I really know it and need to say it to people "Yes, when I was born, they left my parents apart, but the other parent chose me and loved me and now I am a success!" <BR> This helped me to understand our children who had experienced tragic experiences before my wife and I came home. And it helped me to understand how it broke our social system. When you read the story "Miranda & Ashley" in the town of Oyranda last year, the foster child in Florida, SCF did not see numerous sexual complaints complaints about the man who killed them, and another incident in New Jersey this week was released by three children who were not considered by the system this week. Someone was dead, and the state thought that the house he was at home had been preserved because he was a protective worker (like a stripper) and "sometimes" used heroin! <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of problems - and Antwone Fisher is best involved with the action that must be nominated, and if you are accepted or not, it can not be seen by anyone who is concerned about children in the community.
