Some people can say "Paulie" as a child movie, but I would like to claim that this is more. Probably more than anything else, this movie was a great success for the United States of America to show the status of immigrants. The film tells a few stories about a parrot depicting a Russian migrant slot (Tony Shalhoub) about how he searches for America for his original holders. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> I usually do not expect much from such films, treatment. I, of course, recommend it. Also plays Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
