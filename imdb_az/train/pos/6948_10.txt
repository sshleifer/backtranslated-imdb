The first time I saw this episode was like a shock, for the first time I saw "24". What's going on with speed is incredible, and it's striking, exciting, and even interesting - almost as you read a book; Once you start it, it is very difficult to stop it. From the minute Richard Walsh talked Jack on the probability that he would have one in the CTU, and I was 10 hours episode 6:40 hours! (It's funny and bare, but it's not possible to stop when she's interested in me). This series is one of the best of this kind. And the way to have a few different stories connected to each other. Everything is offered!
