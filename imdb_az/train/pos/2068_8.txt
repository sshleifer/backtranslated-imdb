In 1958, the sleepless little Clarksburg city. The Evil Sheriff Roy Childress (the mighty Vic Morrow, in a dreadful form) is pushing the driver into a deadly attack on a cliff, especially on a dangerous road. Childress faces his match when she comes to the city for a suicide by escaping her brother's death from a cool, young hot stick driver Michael McCord (Martin Sheen) (Sheen's real spouse, Joe Estevez, as a rule). Directed by Richard T. Heffron, Richard Compton's more than 70 sliding films have been shot by a single guy who directed the "Welcome House, Soldier Boys," and Macon County Line books. Strong tempo creates more than 50 turnarounds and creates a sense of tension beyond the childhood and the tense game between Childress and McCord. Directly beautiful shooting helps many things: Sheen's advanced James Deanesque delivers the disgusting vibe, Morrow makes the best of her fleshy bad guy part, plus a perfectly supported support such as sweet milk waiter maggie, Stuart Margolin by Michelle Phillips, a deputy Nick Nolte, Buzz, Stafford, Budd's younger brother, Lyle, Bails, Janis Baldwin, Sissy, Carlton, Johnny, and Frederic Downs, as well as Britt Leach, JA Hooker. Conflict car collision between Childress and McCord is a real pulse-pounding white knuckle exciting doozy. Terri K. Meadi's sharp cinematography, well-drawn characters (for example, Childress's wife and child faced with busting accelerators after being killed in a deadly hit and run), by Luchi De Jesus, threaded, hearing and beautiful mountain scenery, improves overall sound quality.
