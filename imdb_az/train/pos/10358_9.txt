I remember when I saw this movie on YouTube live a few years ago and I think it's an interesting story. A few years later, I see him again and I am falling in love with this movie. The story behind the film is interesting. Casting makes it even more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely at the beginning of this game. She touches Ms. Chemberlen's behavior, his attitudes, and even looks. He shows Lindy's pain, loss, surprise, and anger that he has to endure and is not Lindy in this process. In my opinion, this performance of Meryl was better than the Oscars winning Sophie's Choice and should have taken his third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain and has not been recognized by the Academy with at least one nomination for some surprising reasons. <br /> <br /> This movie takes only one Oscar node (Streep is for the best actress). However, several Australian Oscars and nominations were nominated. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the best film: Get great performances from the entire game.
