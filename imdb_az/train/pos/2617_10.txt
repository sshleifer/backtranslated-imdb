The Arslan king had looked at us more and more times, and all my friends put on a flattery. A baby brother .. you know how. I already remember both the plot and the lines. After I left Lion King 2, I was good at reading ... the first one was so weak ... then I saw an advertisement for the lion king 1 and 1/2 .... I watched 1 1/2 after watching. All my expectations (for repetition) were broken. The really nice and original plot sticks to your seat all the time. <br /> <br /> I've found that ROFlmao is filled with many funny moments that will apply 100% here. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching the animated film.
