I recently watched Caprica again and thought I could come and review it! After seeing the final Battlestar Galactica series, I saw it first (I did not know what the universe was doing because I was a great horrible fan of the show), so I did not know what to expect ... <br /> <br /> His part begins dramatically on the caprica planet, and we we get acquainted with various interesting characters ... I will not give much, but there is a dramatic event that dictates the story, but I have to explain it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Isai Morales, .. (Located on the Battlestar Galactica's Admiral's father), I found my doll place and I believe that BSG is the father of William Adama ... <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is also fully committed to his role. ..! It was good to see Polly Walker out of Rome! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a good writing drama for those who!
