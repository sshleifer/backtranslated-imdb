<br /> <br /> Hey, before I go to my "Crisp Flick" on me. Macho Adamam, a very powerful and personality who thinks I'm one of the better films in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The player was Superb and his story was Marvelous. This is a wonderful remedy for the heart and soul. The actor could not be good or the film would be better shot. <br /> <br /> Mercedes Ruehl, Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench, is one of the greatest actresses in the film. And, of course, Cloris Leachman (also in this film), in my opinion, will actually overcome all of the different roles that have emerged over the years, in the cutting miracle of their talent. This movie was like a book you can not give and when you reach the last page ... I wish more. For my life, I do not understand why the IMDb has been rising to only 3.9 of this movie. <br /> <br /> This rating is absolutely gratifying to me here. Or maybe. Perhaps, in fact, I understand it well, and it really makes me sad. Unfortunately, such films as "American Beauty", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Hot Beast" and "Fight Club" are, in fact, at least the "R" rating for the viewers' opinions, "Bribe". Okay, I'm aware that there are so many different stories in this world for many different viewers, but this is a sad comment when it appears that this beautiful, powerful ... Unusual, Director, Active and Written movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there were also Academy Awards. And how predictable. Do you want to see a strong, happy, sad, beautiful story? watch ...... this movie is dominated by ...
