This movie works more than Hollywood films before opening credits. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and stars Jet Li. This team produced a decent Hong Kong movie production, once in Hong Kong, once in China. The action was fast and furious with beautiful wire work. I just saw two-wire cables. Apart from the action, the story itself was strong and not just used as a filler. To find another action film to compete, you should look for a Hong Kong movie outlet in your area. They really need to check and generally never disappoint.
