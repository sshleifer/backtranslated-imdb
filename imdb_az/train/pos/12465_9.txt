Before watching the movie, I strongly recommend reading books. This book was honored with the National Book Council Prize in 1978 and is very strange. Reading is not too difficult to read, so do not be afraid! The book is more passionate than the book, and the film will be more meaningful after reading a book. I could really relate to this book and movie that grew up in Melbourne. Most Australian women's writers were around 70s, so little is documented about the lifestyle of women in a city in Australia during this time or class. A precious part of Melbourne's history. 80 is a documented shame as a soft porn movie. It's too far away and you will not read the DVD case after the other reviewer does not indicate what the movie is about. According to this description, only those who rent the film will be disappointed. Just remember that this movie was remembered in 1982, so do not expect dramatization to appear as a combination of Hollywood these days. That's what I look like. Noni Hazlehurst is also beautiful in this role, he is a fantastic thing like Nora and is greatly watching his real activity. Because if you're closer to my age, you'll be well remembered for your own stands at Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew that this hides ability? This movie gives you a completely new impression. A Classic Australian Story!
