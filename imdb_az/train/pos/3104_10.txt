This movie was excellent. I did not expect to live up to all my consciousness, but it did. Moving like all Bourne films is fast paced, realistic, and tense. If you love the other two films in the Trinity, you will love it. The structure of the film is simple and there are no real killings. Okay, the character of Julia Stiles, which is evident in an Italian safe home, was very different from what happened in Supremacy, but Bourne knows that Treadstone is the only character in his life that he does not want to die, and maybe he can rely on him and direct him in the right direction. for. Action is controlled by reaction to characters and their surroundings. The only thing I like about Bourne films is that Bourne can hit the butt, but it fights when it's in line with the good people as it is in battles, and it's damaging to them. They do not act as fools to the audience. <br /> <br /> All actors were strong in their performances. I believe that Diamon Bourne can play in the dream, and gets the perfect support of Joan Allen's repetition of Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and trilogy. Nevertheless, I do not miss Franka Potente.
