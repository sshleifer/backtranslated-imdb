Orson Welles tries to knock on every picture I see. Shanghai's lady, other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Evil Touch, Court and Chimes. The lion may occasionally be in a state of despair and may sometimes move very slowly (roughly an hour after the test show has deteriorated). But this is not important. You will not be able to watch Welles's films and you will be able to pay great attention to the field. How great is its direction. It can be seen in almost any scene from which the film is directed by any scene. Check out the scene of the courtroom. In most cases these are incorrect scenes and I can not stop them. In terms of solution, try to sit down at Welles' speech, near the end of the press. Leader of the Prince of Shanghai should only pay attention to the scene level in the courtroom. We always hear the court session and wait for the penalty for the intervention. Or check out the lighting in that area. I know it's just a Venetian blind and it's always used in film-free and criminal films, but Welles gives all the beauty. Dialogue is also remarkable. Welles was an unprecedented skill and skill to make a murder movie with the greatest poetry patterns. He had the power to mix the soul when he spattered Shakespeare's mouth or sprinkled very hot lines. 10/10.
