I do not have a lot of porn, but I love porn stars. I love Gory movies. So when I heard about a porn star movie, I was really excited. Of course, this year ago, and when I heard all the difficulties of preparing and completing the film, I would actually like to see it. <br /> <br /> But I did it and I'm not ashamed of accepting it, even with all its flaws. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the drawbacks. The story is designated in Ireland and is called the Samhain, but the story that appears to be about the Sawney Beane tribe from Scotland. So why not just check it out and pass the Third-grade report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? It also violates its rules by telling you that you are safe on the roads, but then the mutant mutants start to work everywhere. No matter how far we are dealing with cannibals. There is no doubt that there is an ancient ancient big stone castle, but no one has ever seen it before. Self-conscious horror film references are frustrating and symbolic. Hero has a funny assemblage of all dead friends who have never had ASANLIQ character. <br /> <br /> What works? Protect! Of course, I liked it more, but it was refreshed to see a film that was not afraid of nothing but fear. Two murders are over and Taylor Hayes has a beautiful disgusting scene. Two desert murders are even filmed on DVD. I always thought that the mind could overcome a stupid story and that the Evil Genus was strengthening.
