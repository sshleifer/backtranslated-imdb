Ang Lee and Devil Ride, as Brokeback Mountain, are aesthetic and historical. Since filmmakers are worthy of understanding the artistic nuance, they must see it twice. <br /> <br /> A perfect work of art, a striking depth of humanity. I really do not remember another battle movie, will capture you, change the current concept of history and politics, and restore your faith in humanity. Having seen so many murders you suffer, you do not feel unhappy, and instead of treating more people. Actors' performance betrays your heart, manages your music. Some shoots, rather than some pictures, overpower themselves, become the soul's sight. The film is in the real sense of the art genre. <br /> <br /> Such a film does not need a long comment or review. Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, a cinematographer and ovation for the castle, which is a beautiful and lyrical music composer, what an achievement!
