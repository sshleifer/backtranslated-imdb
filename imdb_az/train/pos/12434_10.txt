The proposed series achieves the right balance for the first movie. With fashion and class, we show that Modesty is the beginning of the early days of asylum and the rise of power in the criminal world. I think that, as Peter O'Donnell puts it, he is a very honest and accurate description of his character. Alexandra Staden is a stunningly beautiful and excellent choice. It is very persuasive as a tough / intelligent / inexperienced challenging savior. To select an unknown actress for the dance, he puts a complete trace of Tarantino - making it even more convincing to create a new face. I'm waiting for the next movie.
