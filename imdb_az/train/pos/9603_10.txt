Here's a promise to WOW! I saw the Tribeca Film Festival "Darius West Runs". People in the theater cried. This film shows that Darius suffers from Muscular Dystrophy. The film has done a very good job and really made up a part of the movie, and I was emotionally depicted in the movie. Because we recalled that we were very lucky to be perfectly healthy, and some people in this world reminded us that we were less powerful. Sometimes we need to give them something and help them to be extremely helpful. I will give them ten stars, but when Darius was not questioned, they gave him something. Darius must know that the world did not do it for a friend's sake, and Darius went to the west.
