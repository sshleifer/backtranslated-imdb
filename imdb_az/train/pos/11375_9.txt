This film tells an incredible story with history and compassion. From the careful illustrations of the crime scenes you will be thrown to the spirit of the leading investigator. This is a must have for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relationships and interoperability between agencies are also great. Not very clear. I also advise anyone interested in Russian history. How the police works with a political party ... It's really interesting and frustrating. Settings are fine. It's been a while since I first saw this movie. It does not reduce the effect. Excessive dramatic or non-graphical, this imagination is enough, you see good.
