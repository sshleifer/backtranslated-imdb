This is always one of my favorite films, and for some it can move very slowly, and it's nice to look at it. A business lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is involved in a "city" Aboriginal, and this is not normal. Okay, a man died, but there was no normal killing. Recently, it has been more than the average rainfall, and most of the film has some claustrophobia and pressure. Aborigines kept secret and refused to shed light beans. There are many things that make white people think about the "City" and "Tribal" Aboriginal, and of course, Abo will not use the tribal roads in the big city. Uh huh Chamberlain experiences strange dreams, and she opens some sort of things for what happened, although I have not seen it many times, and I do not fully understand the exact relationship. This is a very heartwarming and creepy film, and Peter Weir is a wonderful example of creating tension. The latter is a bit complicated, but if I take it as it is, it's the easiest way and the worst. Recommended for 10 to 10 and recommended.
