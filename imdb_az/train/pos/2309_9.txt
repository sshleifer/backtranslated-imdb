Life was really changing! The Moon In The Moon is a breath-taking experience to watch. The player was incredible, the story line was great and it was a perfect start to Reese Witherspoon's career. See how anyone can love this movie. Undoubtedly, despite this approach, it is not the best movie, but it was fun to watch, and I even laughed at one of the jokes, and many other little smiles. Certainly, if you had some moments of your heart, this movie was clarified and brought to you in the daytime, though you still need some depression from the story. This movie has not won at least one award and I do not believe that this site was seen by so few people. Do not look at this movie if it is not necessarily touched.
