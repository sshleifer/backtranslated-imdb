This is the work of Neil Simon, who has a lot of praise! "Odd Couple" - one of the long-lasting vessels inside. Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hipochondrium, fussy tidy, and a huge stick on the side of Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) in his guest room; common trail. These men have a great deal of work. Felix is ​​a news writer and a sports writer at Oscar. Two of these men are divorced, Felix's wife is approaching, and Oscar is on the other side of the United States (West Coast). Yes, what can you say? It is impossible for two men living in a house without a barefoot one at a time. These are laughs and lots of fun. When I talk to two British neighbors, they are lucky after Oscar's departure from Felix, and they live with them when they refuse to eat with them at night. Felix is ​​the time to illuminate. I think it's neat to clean all the neat freaks. They may be fussy, but they must be patient. A very entertaining film and a nuevo classic. You need to see Neil Simon's classic film "The Double Couple". 5 STARS!
