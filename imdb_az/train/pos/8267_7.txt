Harvard's coffee is a hard-hitting film. These days we look forward to our films, so the audience of the 20s was a bit more innocent. William Haines is tempting as a cunning, forced to escape pain and humiliation to succeed and even win. All the relationships in the film are very strange, except for the homoerotic garden between Billy and Jack Pickford. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sport ... It's great information about how society changed in the 20th century.
