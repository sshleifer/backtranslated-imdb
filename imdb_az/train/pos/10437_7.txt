This is a slow-moving story. No activity. There is no naked tension. No sad surprises. If you do not stop to see a movie about two people who are slowly developing and talking about something about lovey-dovey romance, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's your movie, where you have a dialogue, a story telling, thoughts that lead to thoughts, and genuine love for life. Whenever you are most aware, I recommend watching this movie because it can pave the tempo, music, and the overall tone of the movie into a moody mood. This is really fantastic. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In their conversations you and your partner have a lot of ideas and conversations There are excellent comments on this subject. I thought it was so deep and varied for such young heroes, but I can lower their intelligence. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there is a reason for the film to be damaged. <br /> <br /> As you know, the shooting of the film is extremely simple. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: slow. Dialogue is interesting. The story is structured efficiently, systematically and reasonably. Finally, it is dry and ultimately rewarding.
