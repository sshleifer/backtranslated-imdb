Fabulous actors, beautiful scenery, strange reality. I will not comment on any of the other reviewers because you took a picture! But not for movie alert. Reality cuts pigs and other livestock to save them. I also gave the book of Elinore Randall Stewart's house. <br /> <br /> I read it a few years ago and had to read it again. Because I watched the new, remastered DVDs of the movie. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to buy a video for a few years, from a business video shop. But Yippee! The DVD is already sold, bought at amazon.com. Not cheap, it's worth it. This is a movie I'll watch over my days!
