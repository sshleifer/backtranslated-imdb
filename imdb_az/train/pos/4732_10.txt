I'm not a great admirer of Martial Arts, but the video store was almost empty, and Jet Li Lethal Weapon 4 was one of the other films I rented and I rented it. I absolutely love it, my bed and my (22-year-old biochemistry and accounting students) spent half an hour after the film's strange Kung Fu sounds and throwing strawberries to each other. I can not explain this (maybe a little coupleton). I did not like Bruce Lee, threw it into a big block and threw it into a big block and so on. Imagine Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
