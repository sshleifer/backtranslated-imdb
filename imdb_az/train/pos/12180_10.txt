In my opinion, A GUY THING is a cheerful, witty, sexy, romantic and absolutely beautiful chicken flick that kids enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles would have a groom-vein-to-be and look like his soon-to-sexy cousin's bride. If you ask me, they have burned the screen like magic. You may also experience the chemistry feelings among them. Before I said it, almost the performances were at a high level, the direction was impeccable, the design was beautiful, the cast was perfect and the suits were perfectly designed. As a result, I'm coming to this movie for everyone who is the admirer of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles. You are very laughing and excited, so go to the video store, rent or buy, re-pair with a friend and watch.
