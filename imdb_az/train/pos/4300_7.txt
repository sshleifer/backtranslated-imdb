This film could be one of ordinary "soaps" associated with the daytime events of a half-dozen family that connects one's life ... The discovery of the baby thrown under some shrubs near broken relationships, new friendships, street raids, accidents, hopes and dreams! What a blend of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes out of the daily routine and raises a question to ask if there is no satisfactory answer. He asks what happened in this chaotic world, when things get right or when they get a mortal look, only successes are determined for a certain time at a certain place, and thus the event and the future get a new perspective? <br /> <br /> Many of us had an extraordinary experience. <br /> Do you have a super ego that believes that it is so important? Does a character say? <br /> <br /> Looking at the Grand Canyon once, she sat outside and realized how infinitely small. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite films, but a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover plays a sympathetic role.
