George Lopez did not care about me until my comedy, and he still does not know. But this is a show work of art. The pictures are always remembered (and remembered by these jokes) that jokes do not show where you are. This show just looks at her and symbols change from an old, short drunk to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know anyone who wrote this show, but he does a great job. Only when the show continues, I am sure that it will receive a positive response from the critics of this great country. Well, if you are looking for a traditional comedy, then George Lopez is a show for you! The name is a bad thing. George Lopez? Really? Imagine being the new king of Bel-Air, Will Smith. My husband! But on the contrary, this is a show! 10/10
