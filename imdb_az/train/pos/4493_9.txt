This is a perfect film about the traditional working class family of North England. The film taken in Bolton, Cimmi Masonau, is regarded as a dominant father in his home. Or it seems. A clever, game-based movie describes the difficulty of family life. A fierce player is also terrific with a lot of familiar faces lending support.
