This is a short point. The story used for Star Trek: The Hidden Frontier is something striking. The actor is on the whole map, but for many years the main characters worked to improve their skills. <br /> <br /> This series is almost 7 years old and hard to believe it will last until mid-2007. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat what has already been said about groups and schedules. <br /> <br /> If this is ranked as a professional production, I have to give 5 but a terrible group for a good story. But as a fan-based production, I have to give it a perfect degree, except for a few other endeavors, in one league. For something very voluminous, I do not think it's heard. I congratulate your cast and crew for a very impressive effort.
