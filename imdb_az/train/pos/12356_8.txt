Unlike some men, the women in the film are not scared. They are the prostitutes living outside of the most popular tastes, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of women in a large number of Tokugawa era. I can not say that the stories are particularly clarified, but how attractive their appeal is. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased with the direction of art and my player. These topics are universal and routine: love, friendship and sacrifice. I felt as though I was looking at one place and never seen anything else. The main actors, especially the four main players, are excited to watch actors. I only recommend those who want to enjoy Japanese culture or those who use calm and emotional stories. A fine example of both.
