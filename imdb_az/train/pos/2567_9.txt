The books that James Michener read, with strange names, are probably the most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. The Tales of the South Pacific have turned into a big blockbuster Broadway hit for Rodgers & Hammerstein. It was natural that the South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and that another Michener success would suit the Sayonara film. <br /> <br /> It's been a decade after the American cinema did not show Japan during World War II with kindness. I am convinced that for those who struggle with the Easter war, it would not be easy to change their attitude overnight. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is a relevant film today. <br /> <br /> <strong> Saymona is today's film. Military personnel have always worked in the personal life of the staff in ways that no civilian can run legally through the employer. During the Sayonara period, many American states still had the laws of cadets. Today, military ghosts are a big issue. <br /> <br /> One day can be a Sayonara movie for one issue. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was in the place where he met. The South Pacific was also part of racism. <br /> <br /> <strong > "Logan" has prepared a great castle and a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith, some Western players are doing a great job. But the picture was stolen by the orientals here. Miko Taka puts a nice mark on Brando's love. <br /> <br /> Head of the Caucasus Muslims Office: He loves Katsumi with Miyoshi Umeki. They marry and military soldiers are doing their utmost to break them. They know what's best for Buttons and Umeki. <br /> <br /> Miyoshi Umek was the first to give "Oscar" to the east. Miyoshi had great interest in playing Broadway's Flower Drum Song during the Academy Award. This was the first Broadway show I've ever seen, enjoying the privilege of seeing Broadway. <br /> <br /> This Oscar symbolized something else. The war in Japan is really over and we have seen Sayonara in a great nation with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Rikardo Montalban plays Nakamura, the actor of the Kabuki theater. If Sayonara was done today, Logan would never have stayed with her. But Montalban is good. <br /> <br /> Good location photography and a great story. This film has to be more animated, it's a very good moral.
