Okay, I made a little praise for at least one replacement in this cunning point. But I liked it. I did not laugh with a loud voice, but I was interested in it and took me to the side without leaving. The story was stuck. Yes, you knew it would be a happy ending - this is always a genre. In addition, it was quirky with the eyelids that you can flee, so pay attention when watching. Stiller and Black have again conveyed the experience. Good team. They should work more. I do not know, it would be a classic classic, but it was, of course, a fun way. WHAT IS GREAT TERMS, WHAT IS THE BEST THAN THE OTHER CREATED INDUSTRY? It is worth a little effort to get and watch this movie.
