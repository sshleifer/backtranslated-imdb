While watching this movie, I was excited and enjoyed and would like to have a movie from 4 to 5 at the end. The animation was casual and I thought about the whole place and there was so much more. Even my MD could not continue. Feel like a little pickled trip. Everything looked straight, there was no measure. There were many pictures, lines, and examples. I would stop the middle line of the movie and I'd like to delete the burned copy of this movie. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> Based on a clear story of Kell's secret, I returned to the internet to read the movie and did not do some research on this movie. The original book of Kells. A small child, Brendan, is tasked with keeping the latest book of the newest book ever written. This book will give you information that will help you to "shine darkness." Brendan lives in the Kells village behind the big stone walls. In the eighth century, Brendan's uncle, Kell's president, tried to build a wall to expel the Vikings. <br /> <br /> Brenda's cousin helps her to complete the wall, but by hiding the traveler's and guardians of the book, she prepares Brendan to work on illustration skills and convinces her to complete her book and fulfill the promise. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I do not really understand what happens when watching the movie I think I'm missing. I thought I had lost some part of Ireland. A simple Google search has taught you everything you need to know about Kells' original book. After reading many articles, my ideas about the movie changed dramatically. <br /> <br /> The Kells book is a copied version of the first few books of the New Testament, translated into Latin in the 8th century by the Gaelic monks in Ireland. . Along with the paleographic and insulative works of the book, the book is also a type of early art for learning the subtlety, complexity and miniature illustrations. In the book of Kell, most of the art was a work of art, and flat and dimensioned without any prospect. <br /> <br /> The Book of Cells differs from other early art examples. <br /> <br /> Kell's secret is too colorful. I thought the first animation was straight and boring. She reminded me of an animated film, Samurai Jack, who was looking for an apartment and "amine". After learning about the art styles of the Kells Book, it is clear that many styles in the book are mimic in the film. Brendan's minds have swirls and different forms of living. As he entered his imagination, sun-like circular shapes, shades, clocks and wheels began to fill the screen. The edges of the screen are framed in decorative moving triangles or circles. Transitions are full of colors and Celtic knots. <br /> <br /> Kell's secret is a little history lesson with a little adventure within 70 minutes, and at least a calm of concern for people (perhaps only children). In my opinion, the Secret of the Kells is a half-art work, half of the history is explicitly embodied in the film. Despite its looks, animated with Adobe Illustrator, a very nice-looking movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> Based on the 20 films that Oscar gave, I do not think Mary and Max are worthy of the nomination. <br /> <br /> TheWasJunk.Blogspot.com
