George Raft is against lumbering, sentimental, Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery), careless, dancing gambler Steve Brodie, who can never abandon his courage .A soft touch for each panhandler, Connors impulsively adopts an orphan, especially avoiding waifs and strays, "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, along with kittens!) And homeless Lucy Calhoun, innocent outside the city with ambitions to become a writer. <br /> <br /> This person is in the culture of the government, communicating mainly in the form of violence (for some reason, QORXA sees Martin Scorsese as a favorite). Explosion cigars provide a fugitive stick. Swipes once threw stones thrown out of windows in Chinatown, and on the one hand builds a laundry bag. Simultaneous arrival of Brodie and Beery's volunteer fire companies leads to a battle that causes the building to burn. Beery accidentally falls into a difficult girl and struggles with an obligatory night fisted moored to restore her control of her salon, which Brodie, Brodye lost to anyone who does not agree with her, lost a bet on the Brooklyn bridge. (Brodie is leaping, but at the last moment only a cochlea occurs). <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame with the daily life of the afternoon; pupil waiters, frightened bartenders, women fleeing from the suicide bomber, entering Black Mariya, medication that swells suits that do not want to get rid of glamor and want to buy decorative items. A small but admirable little movie.
