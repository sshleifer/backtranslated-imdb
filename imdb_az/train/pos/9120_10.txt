This movie speaks a universal language; self, society, society, or the wider world. In addition to just a few questions, there is one way to find the right questions and ask questions directly to reach the accusation / ownership point. The images of stereotypes in the film should be regarded as the mutual force of repeating epoch of destruction, innovation, creativity and growth that archetypes around us. Factors that undermine the natural flow of natural things must be clear and solved. The idea is an absolutely skillful film, and it does not look like the inner voice / conscience of one of its looks, instead of just watching.
