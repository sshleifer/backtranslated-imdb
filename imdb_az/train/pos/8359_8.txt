Bertrand Blier said that the French cinema was terrible and could shock the public in the 1970s. He plays with his fave duo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and the usual sexual dose (Miou-Miou plays his typical role, and at least a decade later we know that ten years later he will be the best French actress). Initially, in Les Valseuses, for the first time, some of the smaller criminals are viewed as one of the first things to look at. The film, which was only satisfied with family life or simply did not know anything else, was a shocking one, but it's more of a film, allowing only to think of all the usual things in life (car, work restrict, etc.). Because Dewaere was a team member, he lost much of his life and, of course, Depardieu should have been frustrated with the French. No one could prove that he could defeat him. Unmatched classic and 20 years later still some shock ...
