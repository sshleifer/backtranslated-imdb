Actually, I liked this movie very much. That's because of the area, the action, jokes, no. I liked it because it's one of the worst films ever created. Very bad, very bad, very exciting. Some jokes are really cool, but the others pray for unemployment for a script writer. "White men" is terrible and stupid, you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or laugh out (beer helps :). I chose the second choice.
