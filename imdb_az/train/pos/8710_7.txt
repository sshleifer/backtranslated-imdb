I remember this show from the Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and I was afraid I believed. <br /> <br /> I'm reviewing this series and see if my tastes and requirements have changed, but I see it as perfect as I can remember. <br /> <br /> Although this is the face of a lot of alien and other cosmic excitements, it has been rooted in the 50's and is doubtful of the political climate of the 70s. When I thought of it, it was a fantastic movie, trying to discuss the scientific and political issues we are about and who we are. The sci-fi is painful after the word, and it turns out to be a term in any movie that contains space ships.
