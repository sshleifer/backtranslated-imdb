I saw this movie and loved it while still knowing who it was from the head of the murderer. I recommend this to other people. Lifetime movie network comes in many things. And because I'm close to Halloween, I think they can play more. So, if you are interested in watching it, review it. I believe Alicia Silverstone plays their part very well. I like it as an actress and a person. It is so beautiful and resembles the earth. Kevin Dillon's performance was the same for me. I do not try to hit him or something, but I believe that his brother, Matt, would be able to draw that bad bad serial killer identity. Kevin looks so sweet to me. But I thought he was good.
