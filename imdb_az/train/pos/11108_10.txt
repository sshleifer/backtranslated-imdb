Well ... easily my favorite TV series. I'm calling a picnic smash cliche, but violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, and so on. Included and earning points in my book. Combine all of those things with what you see on the small screen, add the lead to the vintage cinema and all the minds that are weakening (and some brain long way). <br /> <br /> Take two actor James Gandolfini, Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as his wife, Carmela ... As for Gandolfini, <br /> <br /> So you can not say these words in a single word. If you did not see it as a tony, you would see it now! <br /> <br /> Every feature in the show, psychological glow, scenes, etc. but it will not be able to stop me, so it's almost a show with Seinfeld, I can watch for many times over and over, more.
