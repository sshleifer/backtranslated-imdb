This movie was pleasantly surprising. Never mind your attention, never touch the light, there is a light-hearted approach. This is not an unheard of movie, but if you want a "bedroom", this is it. Great writing, production and acting. I would recommend this to an audience wanting something worthwhile. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are very surprised. Why did not he miss this movie any more?
