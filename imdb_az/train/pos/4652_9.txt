I think this movie is good and real. You use the Hollywood "action" movies as a standard to watch and evaluate this movie and you have to be disappointed. This film is closer to more than 95% of Hollywood's real-life experience, and raises it above average motion film. I have no experience in the Swedish army and therefore can not point to any mistakes they have made. But as I see "add", I am sure that there is much to do to avoid any mistake. This is a movie that will recommend to others to watch. High quality real story and movie.
