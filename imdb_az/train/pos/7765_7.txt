Douglas Circus focuses on this very moving drama on unhappy riches. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are lifelong child-friendly friends. Kyle's revitalizing son, who has earned an oil; Works for Mitch Hadley Oil Company. Lucy Moore, who is also in love with the same woman; but Kyle has the opportunity to get away from her feet and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be taking a torch for the city's nymphomaniac and Mitch, it always seems to clean Hadley's messes. Ambitious claim; a little above, but a movie to see the stars. I was very impressed with Malone. Rolling mud: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
