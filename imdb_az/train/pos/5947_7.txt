At age 50, this musical comedy fantasy can look at its age, but it is dignified. <br /> <br /> This movie is still very entertaining. Crosby did not actually have any romantic lead outfit, but provided materials with a mildly humorous edge. Bendix plays extensively in a section that plays extensively and calls for strength. Hardwicke is a joyful one for the knights of the universe - a real one - to throw himself into such skill. And the main role of Rhonda Fleming has at least showy itself. Only Murvyn Vye declares Merlin as unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not a music, the song is very good, and the "dance" accompanied by the "Busy Doing Nothing" is regular - not perfect, comic, fitting, from Crosby's music movement Having an opportunity to be fair, it has not had great power. <br /> <br /> The color is good, the sounds are somewhat mud in places. br> <br /> And the story - with some good, original, gets some freedom, but I doubt that Mr. Clemens is satisfied with the result.
