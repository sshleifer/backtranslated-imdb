I found this website based on this movie. I could not find this movie elsewhere! I'm glad we found here! We had previously seen on TV and hopelessly had several friends who wanted to find and buy and buy it. Another poster said that it was boring, but I will say NO. Especially if you're skimpy, you'll love this movie. The horses were awesome, well-trained, and the movie worked well. Of course, our home DVD library is something we can get. We will recommend it to our friends. The garden between the man and the horse in this movie was very inspirational and wanted to spend more time with your horses. This is, of course, a movie that we will watch for a couple of times.
