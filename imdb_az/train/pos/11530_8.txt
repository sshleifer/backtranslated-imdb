A group of companions decided to travel to a camp outside and find themselves stopped and killed by a mysterious killer in a black dressed truck. "Mirage" obviously Spilbergin's "Duel" and Cravenin's "The Hills Have Eyes" Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of violence and strangers. The film's fame is a sequence of a person holding a chain and a leg around a tree, and then the signs are broken when a chain is taken with a truck. also a little lull and some interesting handle-and-slash sequences.The actress is pretty bare and the script is pretty weak, but the film is fast paced and shocking. BGSteers playing a cruel player is quite dangerous. The desert places provide some atmosphere and are quite powerful. In general, if you want horrible movies for budgetary expenses, do not wait for them.
