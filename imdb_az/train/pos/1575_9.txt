Van Trotta's movie rosenstrasse is the best film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The shooting was just a scene in a new movie, and I agreed with this impression. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> German actress Katja Riemann was honored with her award. he is one of the most influential actresses I've ever seen. in the future I will watch more of his films. <br /> <br /> For me it's great success, I'm a native German speaker =) and for just one year, I'll get some riemann DVDs when I return. <br /> Never miss this movie: FEAR! I still think it would be too long to describe all that, especially it's hard to open all flash bows and keywords, but just watcxh, you'll be zesty !!!!!!!
