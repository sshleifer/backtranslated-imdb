The first movie had little passion, nothing was left on the screen. It was a bad version called "Back to the Future" with zero charm. <br /> <br /> After accepting that Bill & Ted are nitvites, jokes can take longer than just being broken by the audience. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is just a spoiler alert ... <br /> <br /> According to today's standards, this is more fun. Given that more talent was involved than it was for the first time, it survived after its release. <br /> <br /> From Burton's first job, we get a 'Face / Off' photographer 'Fugitive' editor and 'Matrix' sound designer. <br /> <br /> Writers travel with something deeper. This is because the fanbase and the public escaped, the director probably has too much of a style. This is not a financial fit. Like "His Death" and "Catch-22", he dares to be smart, but we like our movies as "simple" so we do not buy it. Perhaps this is different because only 12 manufacturers differ in how to draw them. <br /> <br /> - Show yourself in connection with Canaan; from air to Christ. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his hatred against his creativity, his hatred. The Evil B & T and the "best robot application" have the same vocabulary as their originality: fewer copies and language impairment. <br /> <br /> - The "duality" motif. There is no place above this photo style, higher and lower angles. <br /> <br /> The motto of the "Options" is to emphasize that even Roy Brooksmis uses Total Recall. I do not know where to start this genre (possibly 'Ghostbusters'), but it is very well used here. <br /> <br /> - Even showing the movie itself in the game of death. It's easier than Tarantino or Brooks. Read "Bill and Ted: Film" at the end of the premiere magazine. Death and Nomolos's 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon' sequel are also angered by the irony. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> I still have a little niyya, but nothing is compared to the original. Music and movies are different environments, so there is no reason why many scripts have become old-especially in the teen market. Carlin is a great comedian, but these films are frustrated. Also, such courageous endeavor results in even gaysome jokes that they can not kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, despite the Nickelodeon production, this is quite interesting. There are Beavis and Butt-Head in this movie. "We are in paradise and we have just killed three people." <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Midrange material
