I've seen this movie 20 years ago and have never forgotten it. It's beautifully drawn and the story has mixed up all the time. It is difficult to believe that it was made in 1946, because today it is still fresh and really thinking. I'm not very well informed about the film's technique, but it is noticeable when special effects are made in this movie. In addition, the actor is perfect, and English and American actors are quite surprising. I recently purchased my DVDs and can still watch it when I want it. I advise anyone interested in post-war English films to watch this.
