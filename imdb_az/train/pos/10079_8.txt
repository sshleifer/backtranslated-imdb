In the 1930s, I was delighted with the Chinese cinematography at this wonderful movie. The story is simple. An elderly man wants to give his art a teenager, even though he is not a living kid. The actors' faces are beautiful. The story gives loyalty and gratitude to those who show good attitude to children and to goodwill toward their kindness. The opera in the film reminded me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more complicated and complex. The story here reminds me of Dickens's tale. The site is a bit predictable and a bit sensitive to me, but it deserves time to describe heroism, humanity, and history.
