I first got this DVD, because there was a cover in SRK and Aishwarya Rai and I thought it was hey! Aishu and Shoh Ruh, another film that I knew very little, Aishwarya will only appear in an article in the last quarter of a film shared with SRK, and only 15 minutes in the movie title. Shakti is a film about mother's love and endurance. These changes are a film that explores and encompasses the harsh realities of ignorance, age, and life. SRK and Ai≈üu have nothing to do with the film. This is actually a sequence of sleep that is actually a shocking experience of SRK's drunken character. She imagines that Aishwarya Rai is a sexy street girl, showing her lover the day she likes, poorly dressed and cheating on her. The name of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (ridiculously translated as "Love is a bitch!") And only to smoke! Do not miss it.
