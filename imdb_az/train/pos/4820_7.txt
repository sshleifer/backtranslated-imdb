What else can you say? I was not astonished by a young actress since Cate Blanchett was on the stage ten years ago. Although both Blanchett and Blunt now play trophies (appear to be a criterion for actresses and for actresses), roles are full of polar opposites. <br /> <br /> If you're just looking for a high passion, and Machiavellian intrigue, this is not a movie for you. Compared to other well-known royals such as Elizabeth I, Anne Boylene, Henry VIII, Henry V, Henri II, the subject of the film did not bring much dramatic life. and Elainor from Acquitane. These are things like life, good soap operas, and whose policies and decisions have changed the English and, most of all, the history of the world. Victoria, on the contrary, had a stable government headed by competent and dynamic politicians, ruled by a nation that has become a powerful nation because of industrialization and rising up the fleet, without a throne, and it has a young, harmonious family life. <br /> <br /> The facts of his life are not Sturm und Drag. <br /> <br /> In the heart of the film, the story of a shocking thing and a shocking thing about its power is a story of love, apart from attempting to reflect on its elegant upbringing and the throne. For financial or political reasons, marriage is not an important reason for the world to be shaken, but Victorian will always be remembered as Patron Saint Marital Loyalty, Happiness and Ideal Marriage. Thus, the main center of the film is Victoria's and her prince Albert's lover. Revert was looking for "friendliness and help in the world" described by Albert, a friend of his kind, a patient, a bit brave and perhaps touchable young man. In short, he is a good-hearted man, not the most dynamic figure based on a drama surrounding him, but it's not the purpose of the story, it's not important. The character of the character is brilliant thanks to the simple but serious work of a friend. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the queen, well ... Emil Blunt is magnificent. It is impossible to deny its beauty, but it is more beautiful than anything else; The face is as quicksilver due to its expressive nature. The smallest eye of the eyebrows, the eyes of the eye or a little laugh smile. Still, these heavy words and angry pleas are not a bombastic performance, not a movie. However, Mrs. Blunt's role in this role is to show the simplest humanity of a character that is stronger. <br /> <br /> For example, we can see Joie de vivre, whom he controls by Victoria's mom (Miranda Richardson) and his planning advisor / lover, Conroey, and Victoria, who wants to convey a keen drive like Victoria. We always enjoy our eyes and enjoy the first session of Albert. When we appeal to the Parliament with his rise, we find it frustrating and confused. All in my film is my favorite scene - we find ourselves frustrated, happy and hopeful that she really does not want to do anything in the lives of women - Ask her to love her, so ridiculous When Victoria (say some) marry, "he said in a nervous laugh before he said. <br /> <br /> So, this is not a film that is superior to life's expressions, but rather a matter of subtleness in a character and tells many of the little things. <br /> Thus, in general, I've given the 7th what's the movie and what it is trying to do. 7. Some of the policies have been described in a better way and have been wasted by very little characteristic development and little features of some very good players, such as the Miranda Richardson Duchess of the City and the symbols of Conroy and Lord Peal. Again, the film should not have spent much time on these characters, but a little more exposition could help explain to the political environment. We also saw more and more marriage between Victoria and Albert, but it could have been a betrayal of more scene between Friend and Blunt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Summary, I'm going to reinforce this movie for beautiful movie shows, bright suits and d√©cor and the magnificent Emily Blunt Victoria. And when you leave everyone who is a romantic piece, you will touch it until the end of this movie. God saved the Queen.
