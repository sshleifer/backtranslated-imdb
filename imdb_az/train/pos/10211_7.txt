Narratives ?? written, visual or poetic epic? generally try to avoid the characters; Readers and viewers are drowning in the face of trying to trace exactly who they are. In the film, especially, this is just because we can not go back easily in a movie to update our memory. Those who like me, however, are talking about what we see in all DVDs or VHS movies. <br /> <br /> A year ago, I met with French actress Audrey Tautou for the first time. Amelie Poulain (2001) and later a very long badge (2004), as well as spectacular stories with great characters composed of beautifully made and sophisticated stories. The previous suggestions are more than two ways: both more characters and more complexity. Now other directors use these techniques: Robert Altman The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer, with a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, has done so with an epic proportion of comedy. The difference with this film is that the director first allows us to "see" some of the characters, and secondly, some scenes are repeated as a flip-flops story as a means to update the memory of the audience. /> <br /> Home ?? key, so to speak? The story is related to a young woman, Irene (Tautou), by a companion on a train, a true lover of the day. It takes place in the first few minutes of the film. At this point, clever irony does not know that Irene can be a "true love" for the upcoming youth (Gilbert Robin). And neither ... <br /> How do their close friends realize their potential? However, the chaos in the rest of the day are not just for the two young men, but the rest of the cleverly built and visually impaired vignettes, but not for the rest of the visible characters ... <br /> <br /> The story is merely a matter of fact, it can be boring and even too much anticipated. Is not it. The scenario and director have come up with a number of innovative scenes, which are very insidious, but have become convincing, unusual events that allow two potential lover to meet again. For example, some birds from the sky fall on a book or paper next time, look through your alternatives; The two characters are the choice Irene and her destiny should take place before meeting her again. What is a stone chip floating on the glass? <br /> <br /> So what will this be? Everyone who was more interested in me was trying to figure out whether this person was for Irene or whether he was actually a young man in the train. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
