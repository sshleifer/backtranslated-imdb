<br /> <br /> This series, produced in the most complicated time after the Second World War, is far too far from speculation for any human critique. <br /> <br /> In World War 19, about three decades of warfare, it is allowed to co-ordinate the events in an unresolved propaganda and sensitivity. Thirty years' passage allows one of the highest military and political figures to be supported by an impressive and attractive panel of people who vary from field to soldier, from resettlement to rescue and death camps. civilians continue to witness unreasonable incarceration. Most approaching or best-reaching subjects have spent enough time reflecting their experiences, and in most cases, any propaganda and emotions may have been impaired to get them back in the past, leaving only memories <br /> <br / > It enhances stories by reinforcing the information they provide, the posters and phrases they have demonstrated when explaining their parts. The names of Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) are very far from the list. <br /> <br /> Today, in the dirty price of political aspiration, those who survive this great lesson are lifelong young people who propagandize militaristic and nationalist warfare, as brought to WW2. The DVD series discussed here should form the basis of the subject of compulsory history in schools, but should not be spent in such a terrible cost at this time, but by those who did not see it first. Terrible price. <br /> <br /> When I posted a local television station 10 years ago, I saw 11 disks after seeing the majority of the series. <br /> <br /> The top-level rating may seem worthy of applying to this presentation. . I think that the value of this series is beyond the computation.
