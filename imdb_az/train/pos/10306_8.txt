Buffalo, as a person living near New York City, made this movie a story based on the story. There are even few buffalo news channels in live news ... and once you do not beat this area. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Theology-intelligent, puh-leeze !!! God still looks and thinks like humans ... and, of course, a bit of a liberal side. As light comedies, no reward is not something that can not be won, but still fun and a good way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> Some laughing noisy noisy comedy scenes and I hope watchers - atheists are Christians. Along with a few laughs. <br /> <br /> Kudos for writers who at least give theologians a good and good message. <br /> <br /> Generally, a very good movie that needs to be insulted.
