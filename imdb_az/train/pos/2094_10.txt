Of course, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's last production. But IMDB members, come on, this movie is undoubtedly one of the 30th masterpieces! <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I've ever seen in the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1970 (I'm a teenager). It's the best way for me to shoot MGM movies with so much pessimistic, skillful, often excited and always engaged in poverty scenes. <br /> <br /> Last week, those watching the Academy Award, a locust attack, a terrifying poverty, a "high-level" Oscar winner Luiza Rainer, killed a man. Therefore, he should not have won at the beginning of the previous year (Big Ziegfeld) because he was the greatest master in history, but Luiz did not blame him. Ten years ago when the debates were released, their dialogue was limited. But like his, his visual and vocal use is memorable. <br /> <br /> If you want more of a bigger and touched movie love than anything else!
