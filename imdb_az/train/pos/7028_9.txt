I saw it as a previous viewer accident, and now I was watching twice. I have no idea of ​​good music, good songs, good characters, and just a refutation of a good movie, enjoying or disclosing any movie. here. I did not realize that Rosie Alvarez played by Vanessa Williams, she was excellent and very angry. Songs like a Boy and a Last Kiss are really good at listening and listening to your feet for Jason Alexander is ans that you really are Pretty Woman ans different from her character. Tyne Daley is still like crying from Cagney and Lacey, and she still remembers her voice and accent. In general, I just love it and if it is possible, I want to get it
