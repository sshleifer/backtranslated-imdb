Television movies are usually cleaned up in many ways that you know you are filming up to five inches. From the start, I was able to focus on the unusual hood and slender, well prepared mood. Even though today's rain proves my suspicions (even if we claimed to be in California, the film was shot on a large scale by Vancouver, B.C.), perfectly finishing the perfect operation of the beautiful Olmos in the dark and pressurized outdoors.
