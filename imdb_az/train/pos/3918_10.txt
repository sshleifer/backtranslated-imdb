Flamenco's passionate, dramatic, whistle-blowing film is just as stunning. This is the music of immortal Bizet. Original music, Paco de Lucia, a musician of the same name, is written and played by one of the greatest classical guitarists, who initiates the Modern Flamenco style. The legendary Flamenco dancers and choreographer Antonio Gades wrote choreographed and choreographed this beautiful version of the famous Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée novella / opera. He plays a key role in the famous dancer / choreographer, who combines dance and rhythmic handwriting, and repeats the story of Carmen in the Flamenco style, which has a level of dynamics that is appealing to the audience at a very high level. /> <br /> The perfect and elegant Cristina Hoyos faces brilliantly conscious craftsmanship who dance in the role of technical perfection. Hoyos has been the first dancer to the Gades company for twenty years (1968-1988) and one of the three great shows by Carlos Sauran's Gades, "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" (1978) 1983) and "El Amor Brujo" (1985). Gorgeous Laura del Sol, Antony, at the outset, two French writers Prosper Mérimée, the most famous novel written in 1846, is a version of George Bizet's world-renowned Opéra-Comique since 1875. <br /> <br /> Like Opera and Novella, Carmen in Sauran's film is undesirable and deadly, the last femme fatale, which is forced to go above anything else. He could not endure the love of any human and preferred to obey death. The story and opera opera have approximately 50 films and, as they are different, have a tragic ending that can be combined. The Saura / Gades movie is most sensitive to all the truths and is truly unique as Spanish. The first time I saw twenty years ago I fell in love with this and today is special and beautiful as it is today. Be advised.
