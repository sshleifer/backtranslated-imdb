Pecker is an entertaining movie about a small city in Baltimore that has been violated by a young photographer Pecker, who has captured the everyday rhythm of the "real thing". No nice fashion, beautiful person, not just a tough life. This beautiful movie is fun in the plastic arts industry chain. A homeless woman who shopped at her mother's store at Pecker, like Whitney's art junkies, gets about the same amount of clothes up to five hundred dollars instead of just under 25 pounds. It can not always be tired, no matter how much money you have. Nevertheless, John Waters sends you a laugh and a spiral that is not ending with a reality. You can look at the Hollywood movies with special effects and hills, but give a "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another great John Waters movie) on "Titanic" or "Godzilla!"
