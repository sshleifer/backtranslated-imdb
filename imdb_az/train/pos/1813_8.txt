In my case, I liked this movie very much because I found that I found more than I expected. That is one of the few cartoons I have to comprehend about these topics after I understand it. You are talking about death, revenge, and hell in such a way that it is like a blow on your face, and even suffers from sleep sequences in the middle of the film. This film is so good: Don Bluth (director) is unique, the ability to play with the emotions of the people, and never to love or hate a character. It's a sad, but happy end to the fact that you have very good characters like Charlie and Ann-Mari, and you have to say, "There's something in my eyes to hide the others crying." I said that only a few of this movie is good. As for the rest, the film should be honest with you. Don Bluth, thank you.
