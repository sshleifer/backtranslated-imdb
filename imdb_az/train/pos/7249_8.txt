It's hard for me to give the movie "fair" stars, but in 1968, I settled on the 8th because of its high production values ​​and an innovative approach to a war movie. Remember, I have not seen it since 1969. But he made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> Long day's death should be one of the most important antiwar films. This is achieved only by showing the actions of several soldiers in Northwestern Europe in the 1944-45s. Before this film, no movie had been fighting for the infantry division with a very fierce detail, and all this showed a cold, weakness that allowed the actions to speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no modesty. Partly because of their condition - trying to survive - characters have come across straight, familiar clichés. As "entertainment", the movie does not do that, although it is not meant to "amuse". The horrors and horrors of the World War II and the modern war were designed to put you on top of each other. This is more "watched" than Saving Private Ryan twenty years before and on the thirteenth day of Plato. It's hard to sit here, though it's straight and generally unpleasant characters, the absence of an actual plot and, in fact, unpleasant images (the first time in the history of the theater will be vomiting). <br /> <br /> Thus, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for your sense of touch, bonus star for the right heart. Average 8. The same as in Carl Foreman's The Victors, but with a much more interesting and thought-provoking film, Long-Time Death does not appear to be DVD. Why not? Both films are on the cable several times.
