<br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie with a wonderful story that plays the most important role in the whole film. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting dramatic story. The story is slowly explained, but it works very well for its construction. Heroes are beautiful and beautifully portrayed by actors. I'm not a big fan of the Asian movement, but those who worked in this film were just fine. Of course, the film is quite different in its style and style than other genre films. In the West. <br /> <br /> This film is far more advanced than the western films of the same period. <br /> <br /> I would only have a good visual style of the movie. For a film that is regarded as a film of an art house, this film is, of course, not in some good-looking sequences. Of course, it was a pretty cheap movie and appeared quite commonly. <br /> <br /> Well, oh well, it's about the good story and the story in the movie's story. o From this point of view, this film is, of course, unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> 8/10
