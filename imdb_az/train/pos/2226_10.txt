I was amazed at the low IMDb rating of this movie. With all respect, his low rating represents the IQ level of those who evaluate the poor. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Not a movie, nor a movie The film denied you because you denied it. This is a psychological tension. For those who are actually looking for intellectual experience while watching the movie. Reel.com's views are a great example of how you feel about this movie. Not all other negative interpretations are meaningful. <br /> <br /> Several days ago, several days ago, it was repeatedly voiced. <br /> <br /> This is our goal. Although Martha was a bad Nazi who really wanted to kill himself without warning, she had been tempted to be a self-confident mother. All the evidence is in the pudding, and at first glance, we approach this cold-wing monster sincerely for the course of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely feeling that this movie should be evaluated at least in the 6th grade with its originality. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people at the other end of the IQ - intelligent people - this movie is clearly slaughtered by those watching Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. as well. For such a low-budget movie, you are surprised that this movie hit the local cinema with great direction, writing and acting. Please do not be fooled by the IMDb rating. It's worth the movie. I really recommend taking the movie, because at the first meeting I do not do that justice.
