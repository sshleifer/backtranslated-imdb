Terry Gilliam's Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE's stunning long-term adaptation is full of mind-bending surprises, yet it touches your heart with a superior castle. Gilliam, David and Janet Peoples, have been involved in science fencing in the future, for the science fiction studies by Scandinavia, poor James Cole (Willis, most like Steve McQueen - better than McQueen!), does not know that while continuing to prevent the 1995 anniversary, he is still returning it to the wrong time. Like a good psychiatrist Willis, rightly Oscar nominee Brad Pitt and Madeline Stowe give their best performances. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style account is unhappy. It's a don't-miss!
