When Mr. Peepers starts, I'm only going to be 11. I need to see the whole family, I believe in Sun. nights. The recurring gags were a robot that the robot was opening on (it was to use a dress or pointer to place it on another cooler and to do something else, finally hitting the door) and a new form (at the start of an episode with a new dress shirt a pack, and the rest of the show was a laughing thing to find a pin after missing a shirt when it was time to open the shirt.) I remember a jump like a Rio like Jackie and always wanted to say "Sonny" something scientific. He thinks of a "semipermeable membrane" or osmosis, and said that it was so bright. (you must be there). Marion Lorne has featured on the screen every time. When Wally came out, he was afraid that he was typical, but then too late. I saw somewhere in the first television show (in any case, a big one) at Toxin Tim at Carson. Horsecocky. Rob and Nancy (I do not care for anything) and I remember having the coverage of the TV Service and the press in all the newspapers and major magazines. There was little episode on the trip to NYC's Publishing House and now it's gone. I still remember that it's still beautiful and I wish a bit older.
