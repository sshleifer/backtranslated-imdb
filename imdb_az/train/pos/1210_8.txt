Now I love my kids! Of course, I can now watch it and I know the animation is not so great and the surface is strange. Hey, if every villian says "I'm ammamm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT", they laughed at me, but it's a spiritual story with this charming music for young children. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of watching this movie I still remember words. I would definitely recommend it to small children.
