Story is called complicated. There is no break. Flashlight sets have been woven today. Casting was fine. Young Ya'ara Ya'ara would have looked at this age. The description of a blind person was convincing. Director Daniel Syrkin has had a great deal of work done with different actors. Cinematography is very good. You feel that Ya'ara and Talia are on the edge of the cliff towards the ocean. English subtitles are closely watching the Iravan script. It is interesting to note that it is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin" but "vision". Both names are very appropriate for the story.
