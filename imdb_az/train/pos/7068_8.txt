I was surprised by Jane Powell's comments on the posters that featured Deanna Durbin in the same film. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, in three SMART GIRLS, Dembin plays a crazy "Little Miss". After some failures, Fixit, who was able to bring her divorced parents back into the NEW DISTRIBUTION, Jane Powell destroyed his marriage between Jeanette MacDonald and his new-born father, Jose Iturbi, until his adoption, and his stronger weapons also denied her younger brothers . I can say that these distinctive qualities I see from Dorbin and Powell films will penetrate both of these talented young performers into early films. <br /> <br /> Durbin's performance on the SMART GIRLS is completely victorious and most effective. Some of the energetic scenes are comprehended by compassionate and excessive emotional line reading that is an early film for Deanna, a self-confident, knowledgeable and naturally energetic way of doing things and making more serious scenes in a malicious and sensitive way, you will never guess that a 14-year-old girl with only two years vocal guidance is the FIRST movie role. <br /> <br /> This film and Durbin himself, as often described as the "last chance of the universe," could be a stressful situation for the beginning of the film, starting from the age of production, from D to D, easily and reliably from the images on the Durbin screen. Even though the style of the toy is clearly evident in the face of the camera, it's an unusual creature and warmth on the camera, even though it's the first thing to say, Garland, Rooney, O'Connor, and Jane Powell. she is quite similar to her, and even though her character is frequently intolerant in her first movie, she continues to be loved and sometimes coy and shoulder, sometimes she's coy and arch quality <br /> <br /> In a word Like all the great singer stars, Durbin just has a "Beautiful voice." On the other hand, Durbin's pure lyrical soprano is a truly remarkable and honorable instrument, the most remarkable thing about it, with the least of its songs being played or without grandnes, in the films of the time, adult opera singers like Lily Pons, Grace Moore and Jeanette MacDonald soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Film is also very pleasantly affected by the vidal comedy, Durbin's cream is Charles Winninger, Binnie Barnes, Alice Brady, Ray Milland and Mischa Auer, the first-class vinegar cream. The story is light and entertaining. True, this is not a difficult "realist", but why is everyone waiting for it to happen? If you like: we can rent a "realist". On the other hand, if you are looking for a beautiful, charismatic and talented adult "lead" and a terrific supporter of a real, sweet, comic and entertaining family comedy, this movie will not let you down.
