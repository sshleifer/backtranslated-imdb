For the first time I've seen this movie at the foreign film festival in the theater, I was an interesting, interesting, sensitive bi-artistic artist. So many European, many Dutch! Recently, I leased him for a second visit and could not be a laughing matter of this highly-developed topic of the author's argument with a religious-sexual orientation. Get the flu! This person is a free agent, away from society. I suspect that the real reason for having this fantasy horror about the "spiderwoman" is that the crime complex is alone after seeing the mothers' advice to go to the car (and bed) with strangers! Only he loots outrageous amounts (probably foolish) to prepare stories (lying guilty trips), but it's too cheap to cut hair, so he loves the beauty salon. Then you are nervous to file a complaint about the bill! But I suspect that most parts of the world have changed since the film was shot. In a serious note, he was fun to see Jan de Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven's previous films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed all the time?
