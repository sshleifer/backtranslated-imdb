I did not hear this movie, I saw it on the DVD. A great movie is a perfect example of a film that pulls each cast member to work. Discovered the typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors. has eliminated any performance in this movie. He returned the memories of my writings. Vietnam War military experiments. He paid attention to the people sent to battle. Even though they are connected to the service, they have been described by the characters with fear and emotions. They were regular people, some were not cut off for military life, I remember a few things in my experience - they could not fit into military life softly - but never forget them - I advise you to think about those who are serving in Afghanistan today.In fact, training is a trip, the complicated sergeants HA does not have men in the morning and maybe they need "sensitivity training" HA! HA! HA!
