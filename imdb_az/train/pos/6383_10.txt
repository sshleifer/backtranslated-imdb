I thought this movie was very nice. I've seen this movie with my wife before my first child. That's why I just did not look like family fun and still enjoyed it all the time. As you can see, many of these reviews point to the fact that this film does not split, there are no unexpected field changes, and that the film is predictable and boring. If these people watch this movie waiting for a religious experience, then they will be disappointed. It's just an animated movie; nothing more. If you just want to see this movie just to sit back and entertain yourself, you will not be disappointed. In the end, this is not the best movie Disney has ever made, but I do not understand the fun and the bad reputation it has.
