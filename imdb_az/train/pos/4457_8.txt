Yes, this is one of the great musical films, not to mention Kathryn Grayson's small and glorious voice, with great artisans such as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Music and dance are superior. As I understand, he took lessons from Frank Frank Kelly; and Kelly, dancing with Jerry Mouse, is quite unique to this time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who is in love with Sinatra. He is one of Hollywood's biggest underrated stars. I've seen it again on A & E TV, and I also have my old VCR tape. Never get tired of these old music. What happened to Hollywood?
