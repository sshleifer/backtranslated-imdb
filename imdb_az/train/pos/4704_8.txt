This movie is a lot of fun. I have seen it several times, but I remember that there is always something funny. The "Duckies and Bunnies" car scene is one of my favorites and I still offer Morone's certain words versions! <br /> <br /> There are many fugitive jokes that are beautiful. But I love Michael Keaton!
