Rupert Friend presents a performance like Prince Albert, who raised the "Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is superior. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into dark, deep depression after Prince Albert's death, and realized that Ruper was looking at her friend's eyes. The film does not lead us to death, but it can be a great blessing for our lives. Love Movement. I did not believe it, or I did not. I believed that he felt himself. The depth and depth of the characterization of a friend is nowhere in the world or anywhere. Emily Blunt is good, but I did not believe Victoria was in a minute. There is no real meaning for the period. It can not be a sin, but his crown is worthy of his crown.
