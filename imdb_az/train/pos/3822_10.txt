Lee Chang-dong's exclusive "Secret Sun" is the most emotional and terrifying experience of the year. It is a humorous memento mori, and even a terrifying honest character, which is contrary to a weak mindset, as well as uncertain emotions it has yet to observe. Due to the decent nature of the small city dynamics and the strikingly sophisticated appearance, Lee makes clear the traditional Korean melodrama, separating many cinema film that shapes his character and splits the springs that cause a crushing strain of strange realism. <br /> <br /> The "Hidden Sun" remains a busy, intense work during the 142-minute process. His bravura is filled with brim by foreshadowing and restoring adroit carefully with tons of subtextual incinuations brought by humanistic capriciousness the first hour. Leaving a short story, Lee entered the film with the sensitivity of the past life-style and the latest life paradoxes in the brazen "Oasis". When he understands how personal revolutions change when he looks at the universe, Lee not only sees the careless heart of a widow's fainthearted feelings, but also feels terrifying existential movements that lay the foundation for a movie that has become a story that can comprehend religious admiration. <br /> <br /> Do- Yeon Jeon ("You're My Sun") was awarded the Best Actress in Cannes in 2007. Dul Shin-ae's performance is an inevitable creature. As a character separated by forces beyond his control, the compassion of this performance is in the heart of the nature of the film. When Jeon follows a cyclone rebellion, there is a collapse of a film that has never come to the film's credit. Instead, it finds a delicate balance that destroys the theatricality and subsequent similarities from ordinary tragedies and fallacies. The film is the center of the universe, and we are ours. The glorious manuscript breaks the cinematicism of the frames and compositions to capture the eyes of the film, camera, Shin-Ae from the movie CinemaScope, as long as it does not work until the moment of happiness, guilt and recession. <P> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lake Miryang takes the details of small, suspicious urban life? inadequate utility situations, her discomfort and silences from individual dramas. Shin-Aene's relationship with the urban population rarely inspires dividends, especially when his son's commitment to the name of Jun (Seon Jung-yeop) is fulfilled. A recurring acquaintance is Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), bachelor's theoretical expert on indefinite intentions, which helps Miryang in the magical open sequence of the movie, which is set in a charming sunlight. The song plays a comedy anti-hero in South Korea's biggest films, but its nuanced, low-quality delivery does not want to explicitly reveal the director's thinking process. <br /> <br /> Transient, then sadness can never be destroyed. And Lee finds the complexity in his life. As a foil for betrayal, Shin-ae has been successfully using the Christian unity as he encourages the remembrance of the one who can not imagine the distance to others. But Lee knows this religion better than he understands; it's never a simple solution in the context of human plot and intent. But Lee, nevertheless, would never punish the essence of religion because he understands the value of salvation through some forces, even though he has a form of disbelief. The latter half-scene scene is a self-guided film, so many filmmakers will refrain from doing what they need to do to accelerate the story. <br /> <br /> Since his inauguration as Minister of Culture and Tourism, Lee's first film is a painful argument for human suffering. In such a film, nervously and unreasonably, it is an angry way that there is no simple thing like emotional cataracts, but that it is manifestation and reduction of cruelty. The "Hidden Sun" abandons us with gentle mercy that avoids grace and directs our deep understanding of hopelessness and faith.
