For the first time I've seen this movie in France a year or so ago in a theater. It came and went with little fuss, but I'm very glad for the beauty of landscape photography and attractive attractive footage. (The story is beautiful, though it is not accidental, if you really think about it, there is no way of most events happening in the real world). Again, there is a very limited distribution I collect. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> Wildlife is still interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of the relationship between a 10-year-old boy and a fox convinces the second time around. <br /> <br /> Still, as I said, the story is a coincidence. It's a good movie to watch, and if you love a single life, you'll find that charm.
