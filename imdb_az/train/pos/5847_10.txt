This series was only a season, but it has been with me for 20 years. It was my favorite all-time favorite cartoon. I would give almost anything to get on DVD or any format that I could get. If I find any means of seeing this series, I think it will give it a full advantage. This was the first (in my opinion) series that was a really related story that spread throughout many episodes. And he really cared for the heroes and those who came to them. Imagine the hero, really afraid of me at times. At that time he was alone. Also, Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones, the band's leader, reminisces many combinations. Everyone has the opportunity to contact the creator / owner of the series rights and if you can put them on a DVD, do so through any means!
