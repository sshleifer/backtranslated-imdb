Wanted to know how much Hollywood could get before the Life code came into effect? Unfortunately, the "Convention City" is lost, so it's only necessary to watch "Tarzan and Christ" in order to be well aware. In 1934, sexually explicitly and even exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. Just watch Jane's naked swim. Although Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure movies for young boys and anyone else, this picture proves that the array is primarily mature. After seventy years, this is as sexy as it is. <br /> <br /> In addition to pushing taboo nature of the envelope, this is a wonderful and exciting adventure story. I've always been delighted with the jungle films of Hollywood in the 30s and 40s, but I've had less than genre movies. "Tarzan and his wife" for a long time this is the best film in the best movie. The sequence of safari attacks by monkeys or indigenous people is still tense. And animals are also very cool (especially the monkeys that throw fluids). The player will not be able to win any big prize anymore, but enough for such a picture. The film was once again stolen by Cheetah, the most intelligent monkey in the jungle. The pre-code is one of Hollywood's most entertaining examples.
