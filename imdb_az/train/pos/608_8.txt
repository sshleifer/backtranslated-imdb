Fantasy films are not always my cup of tea, so I went to see this movie. Especially romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I knew I was sad, so I set out on a cinematic magic. <br /> <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is the star of everlasting youth and it is as a bad witch that prevents you from suffering for beauty. <br /> <br /> Generally, it surprises me like a movie admirer and delights a movie because Robert De Niro Stardust is a great way to go if you are looking for fun and enjoyable fun for kids and adults.
