This is a very rare movie, and at least it is known from Shirley Temple because it is not in any of its collections. Why is this the reason why it does not have a happy ending different from another movie? Although he produced a song called "My Life in the World", it was shot in 1934 and in reality the black and white version is colorful and VHS looks as colorful as it does, but I'm afraid of Laurel and Hardy I say colorful films. The film is good for its age, and the story has no history, and I'm surprised that no one is working. Some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem to draw fifteen minutes to say what they say five minutes on the stage, as they really are dragged. in this movie, especially in the (Jerry) Ga, there are quite a good moments, ry Cooper stole a necklace and hides Shirley's teddy bear. It is built up to tension and slower moves, while her daughter continues to read to another audience. Gary and Caroles are also very good when they are taken into account with edgy facial expressions. All this is a good movie since the early 30's, and they accept the age.
