Only this season was seen 1 but this is just great! The island was stuck in many people. Nobody seems unprecedented and everyone looks like part of skeletons in their closets ... Crusoe family like Melrose Place, and why is so great? Perhaps a spoon filled with X-Files can give "what" a dose? and a great "hey" and an island you've ever dreamed - believe in your freekest nightmare and you're lost. The story is a huge number of twists and incredible. We have set up a great deal, at the end of all people (I say good ...) I think that I am acting freely with the good and bad parties. But strangely oh, weird ...
