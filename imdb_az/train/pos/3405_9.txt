"God's Paradise" was one of the 3-strip Technicolor films. <br /> <br /> The first Technicolor feature was to Becky Sharp in 1935, after Disney's 5-year excellence agreement. It was a costume drama and used the color for her naked colored suits. <br /> <br /> "The Garden of God's Glory" was shot just a few years after the use of shadows, not just color. At one time, it was a good thing for the audience to have all black and white films seen throughout the lifetime. Unfortunately, the film does not fit into cinematography. According to the film, the film deserves to be regarded as a visual cure.
