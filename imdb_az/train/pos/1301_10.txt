I love Crema's work, even a small and valuable directory runs. Even with some songs (Spoonful and Toad on the Rainbow Trolleys), when they go for twenty minutes, still more than half of any rock moves that work today. At this stage, the bride was given one of the most advanced rock band performances by Royal Albert Hall last year. They might have been old as their fans, but the energy still exists with great arrangements of classic blues songs. White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoon, The Sun of Your Valentine does not seem to have been defeated yet. Clapton's solos have some form of solo band. Ginger Baker said enough. Jack Bruce is still strong enough to have vocals with a kind of power that Klapton can never go to. Bottom line, if you want to see what the best shows you've seen last year (well, some may have seen it), on the DVDs, with the cool features of everything.
