Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created by Chester Gould in 1931. It is a plainclothes detector that tracks a villa's squad, unlike all types of sight-seeing from Flattop to Big Boy Caprice-Blank. (These villains created themselves on Tracy style films in Warner Bros., Daffy Duck, 40) Tracy's comics were known for the liberal use of weapons and the development of modern technology, especially the gloved communication device), took the fair share of the screen time in this beautiful movie . Music was beautifully made by Danny Elfman and original songs prepared by Madonna were interesting, but they were not the highest point of their career. <br /> <br /> When I watch this movie and watch the suspenseful moments, I feel like Batman for the unforgettable sound of the Elfman movie. <br /> <br /> I love the child who is a tough guy, Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (and that's Chinese!), Madonna's blasphemy and kinematography and directing were flawless. This film is very professionally prepared and a great actor known as a great actor, Toner Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). He was interested in Beatty's leadership. <br /> <br /> Beatty says he sees himself in the past or as a thing. <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ strong> <br /> I had to give 8/10 for everything we brought into this film, lt; / RTI & gt; IMDb has misconceptions over the rating of this movie, and I still do not understand. The heroes were completely original and lively, the style of sets, wardrobe, lighting, and everything in this movie. Buy it today. Sorry, you will not be sorry.
