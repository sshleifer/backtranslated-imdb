We have started all our research with the following information. My wife and I have done about 100 films in the last 15 years. Recently, we've been proud of passing a lifetime movie without spending any movie on any movie! That's why we can see everything we want when we want it. The point is that EVENTS are counted for ZERO. National critics like your local critics or Ebert are not really you or me. The only difference is to write a movie and to see hundreds of movies, whether they want it or not. Therefore, it is good enough for us to earn some valuable money for two years, so that's our belief! We will never listen to critics. We care only about our friends and people we know the same things. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not just good, very good. Critics have many morons. Because of their nudity and language they hate. It was worth the ticket price and you can ask for it. Is not that right? Each film can not be a candidate for an Academy Award. Sharon stones are beautiful and work great in the movie, and mysticists like me like hell in hell
