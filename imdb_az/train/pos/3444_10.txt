I've rented this movie because Rosario Dawson is in this movie. I sat down to watch with my friend and we stuck when we sat for six minutes. Not because of a 6-minute intensity but because it's a real movie. No Hollywood BS, no explosion, a mixed liners; movie It slowly drove you to the destiny of a tragic man. Some people enjoy the movie, but they are sadly mistaken. They love movies; not just foolish entertainment for fun. Michael Bay's Transformers and so on were designed for this audience. There is no need to think about people, just to watch and slowly put all kinds of stereotypes to solve your brain. To buy our products, we'll even post ads on the movie. Do not forget the explosions, we all love explosions. Here, we can see that art can be entertaining, but it also moves thoughtfully and secretly. Entertainment is rarely simple and even then alone. Movie is fun. Descent movie. Film is art. <br /> <br /> If you still have a soul inside a sack body, this aggression scene is as strong as "Can not be reversed." The difference here is that "it can not be reversed", unfortunately, is a violent encroachment where two people are passing through at the wrong time and in hell. "Descent" raises history. It is less disgusting. Not a little broken. Just different. This is due to the lack of trust, the guilt of the soul, and the deeper scars. If the "Maya" would agree with her character, it would have been a hot sex scene. However, it is uncomfortable for the scene to be unsuccessful. "Jared" is a kind of manipulative and manipulative aggressor and is totally uncomfortable because it resembles a passionate love affair. Although the slick lover of "Jared" is in the aggression of his son, "Maya" can be closer to anyone? <br /> <br /> Generally, the movie is absolutely beautiful. Camera work and lighting sometimes eliminate the surroundings and focus on the "silent interior" of the "Maya" and the mind. All this was done by Rosario in his face and gesture. The soundtrack was excellent, it was a mix of everything. My synchronicity of all these movie aspects, especially my favorite scene; <br /> <br /> "Maya" dances in the sea of ​​ghost corpses, something awakens her awakening, warns, all is a sad sad Jeff Buckley tune. <br /> <br /> I really did stop at first. Bottom line, I think this is the best film of 2007, with your hands down. Unfortunately, everyone is so tired these days, hacking and whistling, network aggression or nuke, and people can not be worried about it. Death is not the worst thing you can do. Only the last thing that happens in this entity. The worst things you have started do not leave you. They are always in your thoughts. Shower time; When you brush your teeth; When you take Christmas gift, when you close your shoes; they follow you. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Call yourself. Follow this movie.
