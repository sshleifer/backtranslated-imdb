This document opened my eyes to the thoughts of the people of the United States on September 11th attacks. This film has essentially come together and has presented this disaster more than just attacking the US land. The consequences of this disaster are promoted by different countries and perspectives. I believe that this film should be widespread in this respect. Something else to see in the news of terrorist attacks also helps in the treatment process. And some numbers are actually funny, but not the opposite. This movie was very much recommended to me and I spent the same part.
