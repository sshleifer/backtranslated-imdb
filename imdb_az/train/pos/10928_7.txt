The deceased Kung Fu master sends his last student to watch the next five students, a member of the forbidden Poison Clan. The master wants the student to find another member who runs out of money with the clans they want to use well. In a different style than the previous students, snakes, octopuses, scorpions, lizards, frogs, and the latter were taught a bit in every style. <br /> <br /> The classic martial arts film is named after many non-admirers, because all students are looking for an old man in a town with money and then everyone struggles to make a living. we know. I talked to several random fans and it looks like a movie with a stick on their heads. For my money, this film is a very good film, although I do not really believe in the fact that this film is for people when there are other films that are better than the Shaw studio (One Armed Swords or the Brave Archer series). The movie is not a mystery, but a hero, who knows who the person is, and who knows only the best of the Venom. We have four personalities, but we still have to work with the fifth truth. At the beginning of the film, it is extraordinary for a martial arts film, except for the coinage of the old man and his family, and there is no movement for about 40 or 45 minutes. There is a courageous act to do, but since the plot has been shared, and performances continue to focus. (I do not believe the movie is a first martial art movie I've never seen, I do not think it's a role-playing game, and I do not believe it's in the background.) It's something that hits me in some circles. it's a good tough movie, but it's still a good movie to have fun on your divan. br> <br /> From 10 to 7.
