Let's admit, there is a weakness for alternative history stories, TODAY EXTENDED TO GROUNDHOG DAY from 12:01. This is a small gem among adults. MR is very difficult to pass. The meeting's gratitude to each player, good-natured James Belushi, to the murderer Courtney Cox. This movie does not have gravitas and sizes to shoot a big movie, but it's a beautiful show on a rainy afternoon. This is a great rental for a cheap date.
