<br /> <br /> I can understand that those who do not love this movie have a lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not Geisha but the hirelings, and those who do not understand the half do not understand the film and, of course, not the end. This is a complete work of women's life and needs in this age. Everything is important, and it means more than just dress up on every side of the film. Those who think that it is an awesome geisha movie, I will propose to read a little about this community before reaching an unrealistic conclusion. This is the life of Kurosawa, and I am convinced that the director turned Kurosawa's voice into a real intelligence zone.
