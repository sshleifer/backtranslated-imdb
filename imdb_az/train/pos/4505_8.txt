Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural peak between the local population and the aggressive white man. Eskimo is a talented production containing a convincing story that will appeal to the audience to look at the last shot, although Eskimo is shot in a documentary style that appears with non-professionals. <br /> <br /> The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs, and the behaviors of women and life are more than whales that darken his sight. Eskimo's man dies while other women share their wife with a friend. Those who want to replace women's lost friends are also normal. All of these appear naturally in the context of the perception of the Arctic perception. Trustworthy Eskimo has dwelt on unscrupulous white whalersa (with severe European accents) that do not see the indigenous peoples equally. After the Eskimo men set off to work in the frozen cold seas, deception, drunken images, aggression, and death take place. As a result, the leading Eskimo (Mala) knows that he is beaten and gets revenge. The audience would enjoy theaters in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Log in to the Royal Canadian Police and the moral dilemma of bringing Malan to court. Mounties are played as police feelings, knowing that this is not a dry and dry situation. Will the mountains take people? Is Malan just a code of conduct beyond her traditional community? Is there a way to punish Malan? Is it unavoidable to give priority to white people's law? <br /> <br /> This is not a big movie, it's something you use in a very different situation for the depth of the problem. I suspect that the sequence of animals was done before the discrimination of today, because no one was injured in the preparation of the film - avoid the sequence of raw material. Be advised.
