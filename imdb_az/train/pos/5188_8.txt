Steven Spielberg has written and even directed ideas for the episodes of the Amazing Stories he has written, so why should naturally the largest anthropology always be correct? Unfortunately, it's wrong. Some episodes are simply fantastic, but often this is a mixed bag. In fact, such a dropping could be very mixed. Some episodes were light comedies, some were dramas, some were terrified, and others began to animate, which is similar, but the Twilight Zone 80 - Normally, I would like to have a mix of stories in an anthology show, but they did not work here. Some of the more dramatic dramatic episodes, like the episode "Ghost Train" run by Spilberge, have made me feel better at late in the network. In this episode, he gave us a message of hope and gave us a fantasy story, but in general, it was just a structure that did not hit me alone. Horror episodes were more prone to drama, but more dramatic, and they were tired of watching. While acting wisely, this anthology has received some of the great stars similar to the original Twilight Zone. Kevin Costner, Kiefer Sutherland, Milton Berle, Dom Deluise, Harvey Keitel, Beau Bridges, Charlie Sheen, Forrest Whitaker, Tim Robbins, John Lithgow, Rhea Perlman, Danny Devito, Patrick Swayze, Christopher Lloyd, June Lockhart, Kathy Baker, Weird Al Yankovic and many famous show have been in the episodes of the show. It's fun to see renowned actors in almost every episode of the series. Major managers also participated in episodes such as Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Bob Clark, Joe Dante, Mick Garris, Paul Bartel, Joe Dante, Robert Zemeckis, Danny Devito and even Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Amazing Stories are sometimes striking, usually good, sometimes mediocre, and once every time a real stinker came out. But this show has a nostalgic meaning for me, and it's great to sit in the daytime drum and watch some episodes. <br /> <br /> My rating: Good show. 30 minutes. per episode. TVPG
