This is a stunning piece that Gerard Depardieu is trying to convince even the most suspicious audience that he is one of the best movie actors in the last 50 years. When it comes to breath, craft shock, fun, hate and charm. The film was shot in the early days of the film career and is still very busy, but still depicts Depardieu's artistry. No one is a fan of Depardieu and his best early career.
