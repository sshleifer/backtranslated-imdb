This movie is a blow to your feet. Tom Barmandan (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS), this debut film introduces you to eight interesting people who create fun movie blocks. Each one lives in the Antwerp Metropole one day and one night. The bartender puts his heroes in a great surprise, and is skillful as Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson are some of the best ones. Surprises, movements, amusements of anecdotes; dialogue is naturally natural. Matthias Schoenaerts is a very interesting duo by Natali Broods and Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is a memorable "Windman", a strange man who dances throughout the movie. Sam is also responsible for stunning choreography and, of course, Tom Barman has attracted the attention of the ultra-sound Sound Track. Any kind of wind blows are a hit that shakes your feet.
