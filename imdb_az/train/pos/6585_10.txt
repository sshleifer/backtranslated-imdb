After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should show no modesty to conceive Brett's approach to one of the most fascinating characters in literature. Jeremy Bret Is Sherlock Holmes and I can not have any other in my opinion. The great actor Basil Rathbone, acknowledged that the second, but still second. Mr Rathbone's scenario is lower than Brett's best notch production and I'll agree. But when all this is done and done, Jeremy Brett will be the only actor to truly become "Sherlock Holmes". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
