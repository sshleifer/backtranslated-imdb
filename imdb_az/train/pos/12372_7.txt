Sentinel is a movie I've been recommended by my father a few years ago and I have seen it many times since. Always trying to entertain me while being effective creepy. Flashback scenes are really for me. Cristina Raines's father likes to throw her down in the creepy way with two creepy women. this is a typical good and bad thing but at least it manages to be entertaining. I think the latter is one of the best in the history of Horror. Burgess Meredithin was on the edge of my seat, watching Chazen's work. Sentinel has a perfect structure of tension. We have never been comfortable when Allison is on the screen. We are always awaiting something terrible and making things worse. This movie is often not considered as a frustrated admirer, but personally I think it is a better thing to do and is definitely enough for all Horror fans. <br /> <br /> Performances. Cristina Raines has wooden moments, but most of them came in a great way. She can look in the eye and feel chemistry with Saranadon. Chris Sarandon is great as boyfriend Michael. There was an instant screen and I could not help but could not help. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger are all memorable roles or smaller Komsomas. Burgess Meredith is like Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we know is completely scary. Eli Wallach & Christopher Wlaken are as good as bumbling detectives. <br /> <br /> Beverly D'Angelo has a cold scene <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Sentinel is an Effect Horror film, which is able to dwell on the dignity of Horror fans. This will make you excited and satisfied. <br /> <br /> 7/10
