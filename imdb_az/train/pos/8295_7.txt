Robert Urich was a great actor and made this television movie convincing. When I was 15, I remember watching this movie, and when I saw it for the second time, my idea was the same. People lose themselves when they come to this special club in a computerized California town. Urich tries to understand that his family is wrong and I love the Halloween space suit, bright. The film is about the film's struggle. Television quality, New York Groups, exceeding this huge budget. Was Robert Urric a compassionate man described in most of his films? I hope! 10 to 6 or 7-i.
