In fact, I love originality and this movie has a smaller size. <br /> <br /> Voters: <br /> <br /> <strong> She knows that The Simpsons was a voice, but this show it's not just straightforward. <br /> <br /> Good luck: We want to see Simba as "teenagers". <br /> <br /> Downs: They have spent with Timon and a quiet competition between Simba. <br /> <br /> <strong> Again songs. (there were some original songs, but they were background music). <br /> Downs: But stupid songs. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a pretty good movie. I recommend the original supporters. <br /> <br /> If you do not like my work, you do not like your chances like this. <br /> <br /> My account is 7/10
