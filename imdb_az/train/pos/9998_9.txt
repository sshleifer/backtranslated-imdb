The poll was pretty low on average, and the secretary in the video store thought it was "OK", and I did not have much anticipation when renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But, on the contrary, as I have seen above, I really liked it. It's a charming movie. I do not need to grow up on me, since I was so loved. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Generally, it is very nice to watch the movie and it's easy. <br /> <br /> I advise you very much.
