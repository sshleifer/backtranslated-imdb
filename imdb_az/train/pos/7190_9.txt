Zorro is one of the best arrays and one of my favorite TV series. This is a period of time after Mexico's birth. A new country is calculated for the gold produced from this city to settle the republic. But the god of gold, Don del Oro, mixes the Indians and stole gold for himself. Zorro and men to escape the group. Reed Hadley won a Zorro and cut a stepped figure when he won a fine selection (including after being reused by the next series of Zorro as well as other series) .Notes are moving and beautiful, but the real bad guy. Any series I see it is one reason I just saw a great action adventure movie. The only thing I can compare with is the Zorro Mark with Tyrone Power or other swashbucklers of the era. Its super and highly recommended.
