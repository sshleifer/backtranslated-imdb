Sinematically this movie is wrong. It operates so much. But I <br /> <br /> I beg you. <br /> <br /> How powerful a representative of the 1980s (for many in weakening) and hip-hop, Zulu <br /> nation, dance was really great. Great music, great dance! Despite the fact that hip-hop is a lifestyle, it has long been a documentary in the past. <br /> <br /> In New York, it looks like zero for a nuclear attack. Some viewers may be too young to remember that it was a poor, fleeing city in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> All hip-hop / break dance films of this period are the best. Of course, 80's is a joke now with all the bad TV shows and movies <br /> <br /> <br /> <Music, dance, and graffiti will be happy for some time, yo!
