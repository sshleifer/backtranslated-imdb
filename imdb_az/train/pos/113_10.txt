I have not seen this movie for about five years, but it still insults me. <br /> <br /> When I ask about my favorite films, I will always talk about it for the first time. Some of the movies you touch inside (this movie, "Dark City" and "Swathes the Waves") have such a protected and hidden and yet sensitive place, they make a lifetime impression on the audience, in contrast to a life-changing phenomenon, end or death of a friend ... When I first saw this movie, it shook me. She left me with a sensual scoop for a few days.
