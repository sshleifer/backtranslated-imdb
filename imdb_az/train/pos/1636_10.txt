It's one of the 80's, the biggest! It sticks like "turd in a punchbowl"! I do not believe that Mad Magazine denied this or that. And still proudly proud of the show with Stuart, I-Speak-a-no-Kite, and UPS's Rapidly. What is this? And, I love Ron Leibman - it's foxy! Why did his name drop out of loans? It was the funniest I know. Of course, just like Norma Rae, she is not like a pseudonym. But, in my opinion, this film is there with the National Lamp Vacation. If you like movies like Porky, Fast Times, Last American Virgin, or other 80's teen-centered movies, you'll love that! Rent it and you'll see what I mean!
