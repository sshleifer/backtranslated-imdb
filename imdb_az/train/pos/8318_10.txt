Beautiful movie. Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and young Irene Cara are perfectly functioning. Tony King was a very realist in Satin role. This film was one of the last major "all black" films of the 1970s and, unlike the "blaxploitation" films of that era, this movie was actually a plot and did a great job. The soundtrack sounded by Aretha Franklin was then popular in R & B maps.
