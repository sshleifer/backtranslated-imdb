Space Camp is a fairly decent film. <br /> <br /> This film was prematurely dismissed by the service disaster and was actually a barrier. <br /> <br /> The scene where spatial gateways opened in the space is simply magnificent ... on a big screen, that is ... in a television ... just considered average. I remember this scene in the theater. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to see in IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
