On February 4, 2002, with the death of GEORGE NADER, I thought about the most exciting program for me, it was just a short time, a great idea with a very good storyline. In general, something that is invisible for more than 40 years is worth considering again. Opening credits showed very different views, one of them being part of the COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, sliding into the famous rocket driver at the point where he was called "The Fastest Man Living."
