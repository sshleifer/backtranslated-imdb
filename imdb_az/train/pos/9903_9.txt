Wow, IMDb, and Google, because I've been trying to remember the name of this f'ing movie for 15 years. Slaughter High, man! Hell yes! <br /> <br /> I do not inspire you with a summary and actor about you, and I remember, remember, because you know what to do. That's why you are here. But what I'm doing is explaining the fond memories I've prepared with over 80 D-Movie movies. <br /> <br /> When I was 7 years old in 1987, my father is all these frightening films. Does he care for his children watching with him? No, at that young age I saw Slaughter High. The things I watched in that movie were tense with me for a long time. I have not seen it since, but I remember the most ridiculous murders of the film today. For example, post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) It is unstable. Otherwise, a man drowned in the pool outside. Come on! My personal love, though ... the stomach that exploded in the broken beer. Amazing! After 10 or 15 years, how can you hate a movie in an abandoned school where one of the characters finds a beer, and is it a good idea to drink it? Then stomach explodes? Yes!? And this is a great line: Let's take my car ... always starts. The classic crap all the way. <br /> <br /> I am almost 20 years old now and I'm laughing. However, when I was seven, I was scared. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's probably an unhappy movie. But for the purpose of nostalgia and the humor factor, this movie goes from 10 to 9. I hope to stay real late each night and rinse it in the same late past movie screen or VHS copy and clean dust from the VCR.
