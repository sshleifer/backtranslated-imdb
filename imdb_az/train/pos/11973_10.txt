Full House is a beautiful sitcom on a dad, Danny Tanner, who died in a car accident. Thus, Danny asks his brother Jesse Katsopolis and his best friend, Joey Gladstone, to raise his three daughters, Donna Jo 'Tanner, Stefani Tanner, and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show and I can watch it all day long. Something in the house always makes me laugh and there are sad parts. There is never an exciting moment in the house. The main heroes are Bob Sack, John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (Dj Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen Michelle Tanner.
