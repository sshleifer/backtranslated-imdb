Von Trier once told him how to draw his film world from the viewer by placing it in the middle of a real world and imaginative world. Like watchers, we will actually follow a "true" story when manipulating the film from the point of view of fear (Dancer in the Dark) or from the The Idiots / Idioterne. Of course, dogma-films acted as a tool for this theory (along with creating some pleasant tape in Von Trier). The story is typical for Von Trier: the hero is idealistic, builds relationships with everyone, but soon becomes the victim of problems that have been created in the past. Idealist must inevitably reject the community to remain idealistic and terrorist. Man's unhappiness and purity destroy only (self). <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also, these elements too often in many places Waves and Dancer-i Koyu. Film is also beautifully designed to achieve a keen (even humorous) technology about the role of Germans and Americans in Germany: changing and dimming colors, screen covers, moving over different overlays (most interesting as soon as possible by the mayor's drawing). In this film we can see how Von Trier's film is a technical tool. In his later work, he seems to refrain from doing so (just as he is less interested in technical advances than they exist).
