The only show since 90210! Why did they stop it? It was the only show you had captured the essence of Hawaii and felt as part of all its parts! At least they have to leave the DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked out similar shows, but nothing came close. The cast was incredible chemistry and I was very excited for every episode. <br /> <br /> This show was a mistake. If you have any information about where everyone can get the North Shore DVD, please send a few lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
