If this were not for the highly predictable and hollywood-business scenario, it could have been 10. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the leading actors of our time (why I ask the host) and the rest is at a very high level. I was personally surprised by Hugh O 'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a kid. The first scene I watched was really strong. Amazing! Wow.
