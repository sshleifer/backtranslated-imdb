I remember, airplanes love and fly. Now I trade with a license from a private pilot in college. I did not remember remembering that I was dealing with this subject until I was at home with my old Tail Spin ribbons in my basement, and it hit me. My parents took every single ribbon and this was the only show I would follow as a child. As I grew up, I remembered the theme and still can repeat it today. It's absolutely beautiful and I'm planning to buy DVDs soon! It's really great for kids and adults, and it's completely timeless. I can not get enough of this show.
