I liked this movie very much ... it was cute. I love it, but that's not your fault. Emma Roberts played Nancy Drew, although she did not like books. When you see them in modern times, your old fashioned outfits are strange, but it looks good. For me, there were no suits for rich girls to look rich. I would like to say that they have all their clothes, sold a garage and decided to put them in one place. All of your outfits were sticky when they wore penny loafers with their strange clothes. I do not want the movie to look bad, because it did not necessarily happen! Just go to the theater and watch! You will enjoy it!
