One of the best 2 football movies I've ever seen. Firefighter on the other hand. But Hero is about Diego Maradona, the biggest player in the world's largest world cup and ultimately the world cup. This story is mostly centralized around, and also plays around the other giants of the game. <br /> <br /> Music scenario is evocative and drawings are strong. The gospel of Michael Caine is impartial and calm and dramatic. This story is not in the World Cup personal games; more about the feelings of the players and the event itself. <br /> <br /> All interesting games like France and Brazil (one of the biggest games of all time) were covered in the same way. The latter Argentin v W Germany was in the same habit. highly recommended. Classical world football. If you are a fan of Maradona, you will see it again and again.
