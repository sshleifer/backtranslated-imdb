I kept this movie on the Sundance Channel at noon on the cables. You say "The Sun Loves", the perfect leisure story of a story, why not. You'll have a triple: Lukas Haas Will (after returning every year after returning home), Molly Parker Maggie (we know most of Bloom's family), Adam Scott Daniel (friend or foe or fianc√©), sunlight and scenes captured in vibrant summer colors against shadows by Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada. The group supporting the Trinity has two more members: Wendy Crewson Ana Mary Bloom, R.H. Thomson is Dad Arthur Bloom. Writer-director Matt Bissonnette caused the story line and its various tentacle connections to start in a spectacular way - do not worry, Haas can be an 'irresponsible' face, but humor will enter into a circle of friends, like Parker and Scott, will be laughable and blend the joys of knowing. <br /> Yes, "who loves the sun" can be classified as a very good dream ship. Combined with all five principles, an energetic ensemble of chemistry is a sure gel and "burning". <br /> <br /> There are also friends and relatives. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> Interview with writer-director Bissonnette about how the film and concept will be, Mac McCaughan (portrait of guitar tunes and strings) and scenario behind production records, casting and more. For Molly Parker's performance since 1996, I always value Lynne Stopkewich's 'Kissing' and marrying Bissonnette, who wrote Maggie for Mollis.
