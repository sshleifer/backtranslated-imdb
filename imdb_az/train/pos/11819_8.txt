They only chose DVD and watched it again. I love dark images against bright colors. Not a great Beatty fan, but this is a manuscript movie. Pacino is always astonishing, as it has always been during the years when Madonna was absolutely sexiest. I would say he was stuck in a "breathless" look for some time. Charlie Korsmo's first really big role, "What's about Bob?" Make-up effects are still dominant and still keep a lot of them. Beautiful scenery and mood take you to a fun comic strip environment. Many red-faced scenes tend to be a little curse, but not cars, cabinets, buildings, even street lights and perfect lighting. Only Beatty gained the opportunity to do the sequel. All this is entertaining for a few hours.
