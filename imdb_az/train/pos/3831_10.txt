This free adaptation of the Clarence Mulford novels; Admirers of Willaim Boyd are probably likely to feel a little over the sea (and in this respect they will still appreciate the ratings). <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a clever choice - he did not create a nostalgic "West", but first I knew Hopalong from the novels and had never seen much care for Boyd movies. ; Instead, Cassidy approached the story as 'Americana' as a slice we called; or once "old bullies of the houses" called the old critics. After the film's opening, I remembered the great "Halloween Theater" by Mark Twain's "Roughing It". <br /> <br /> Both films remind us that 'old west' probably is not always a 'myth' to Americans, they should not be 'western'; <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I never felt, never felt; Boyd Cassidy has no intention of bringing his heritage to our throats, no irony, camp. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I feel like I'm taking some of these characters or going horseback - some hundred years ago, some of the real western Americans could go. <br /> However, the accuracy of the movie - "style" - positively prevents everything we call - all in its favor; and the smooth movements of the performers are in line with this kind of care; It really feels like one of the things we expect from a good story of an adventure rope - a habit dress, just quirks and good humor - and suddenly violence - explaining around a campfire around no hike sliding. <br /> <br /> I had a very pleasant impression on this movie and it would have been a great pleasure if the observer had put aside the hidden expectations. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 9 stars, but just give the most reviewers just because they miss the point completely; <br /> <br /> The first narrator: Hopalong complained that he shot dead people in the film instead of firing weapons. (ala Boyd Cassidy); First, Cassidy hits people killed in novels; Secondly, if Cassidy was a real cowboy, he would have killed people - the problem of throwing people out of the hands could always get another weapon to become part of the film. Note 2: I confess that we are jealous of the Coppola family, among them there is the Director of the "Grandfather" that I do not allow them to do all the movies; but a good movie is a good movie; and that's a good movie. Even if someone is called "Koppola", this is just the case. American Occupied Lands (or as Bush comes to this task) is all American novels.
