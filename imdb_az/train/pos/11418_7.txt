For the first time I've seen this movie and the International Cinema Studies course. I am an "unconventional" student, and I have evaluated the slow and counterfeit pacing of the film's narrative, calculated for years or wisdom. The story, rich in warmth and dust of a droughty climate, is full of multifaceted symbolism, full of deep psychological, multilevel symbolism, and an open transformation of the theme of "Other" in an unfamiliar area, which is full of unresolved memories and subjectivity of a foreign country. It's about 20 years ago, in a genre of many other international films investigating the subject of colonies in colonial territories, they resemble the nuances of the cultures they have entered - much more movies - and heavily funded - things done after reflecting the same topics: In Indochine, there are two places in Africa, and maybe two of them have a pale and dull appearance: no adrenaline-pump action or excessive violence, the spirit of emotions is emotional and subtle. But it's a good movie, not a picture.
