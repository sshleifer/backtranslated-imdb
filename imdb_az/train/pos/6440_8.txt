I'm not surprised at how good or bad a movie is, I do not write anything about IMDb. This movie falls into the first category. Every year, I do not want to see all the nominees for the best foreign movie in Oscar, and I know I will not love it. It appears to be in line with the bill, as it is in Heaven. The area is sweet and sincere and it sounds slow. For the taste of "Heaven", which works more in the direction of original, dark and / or attractive foreign movies (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozone, many modern Japanese / Korean cinema), it is not particularly interesting. ... was not released in the United States, I sat down to watch a VCD I found in Singapore, "preparing to cross the list." After a weak start, "As in Heaven" is a rare movie that really inspires those on the screen. Poor Dots: The characters in the film are purely "share" characters - Wounded Dreamer, Town Bully, Battered Wife, Valentine's Love, Forbidden Minister .... It is good to note that they are basically a similar group, well-written and well-functioned. Ingela Olsson, the wife of the minister Inger, would have been an Oscara nominee, his performance was in English. Strong points: the music is beautiful and the main song performed by Gabriella is truly dramatic and memorable. Wait for 87-year-old feisty 87-year-old actress playing Olga, who stands up with dance steps and young ladies! I will not discuss the latter, but I'll say that. They are many emotional things happening at the last hour of the film, and we're not sure what they are for. Even though nothing is explained in the words, these are all meaningless as movies come to a suitable krascendo. **** exit *****. Probably the most powerful Swedish film I've ever seen.
