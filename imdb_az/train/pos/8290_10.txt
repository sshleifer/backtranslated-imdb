This is just an example of Gen Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and played in this wise secret. No one could do that better. The tension was completely palpable. If not, Mr. Wilder would have given us something else. Dear Wilder, I loved everything I had seen, but I did not know how realistic it was to be "Murdered in a Small City" and until I saw this sequel. He understands exactly what the audience wants and how he communicates it in writing and, of course, with his brilliant player. His subtle minds come with spears. I love this movie and / or recommend Gene Wilder's movie business. His star becomes brighter and brighter.
