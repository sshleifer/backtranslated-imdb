"The House of the Game" - without any defects - is definitely an indispensable player, the final scenes - but they are less entertaining to watch a trick that combines methodically. "House of Games" should make a good tension to almost everything. Of course, this is not a great feat, given that we deal with the world of trust and are dealing with their help. So, we think, though, we do not know what happens though, despite what we think. But the film is worthwhile for the game; <br /> <br /> Hitchcock has a strange part. The film was shot in a series of similar topics in 1964, focusing on its "Marnie" effort, but it was only one fired when released, but now it is regarded as one of the more thoughtful works of Master. Lindsay Crouse's character can easily be considered by Tippi Hedry's likeness ... maybe ten years later. Both of them are powerful willpower with compulsive behavior that forces them to approach very closely to the slavery pool. As Crouse puts it, a repressive character, "What is life without adventure?" Put the Reality Check down in a low position and enjoy sharks!
