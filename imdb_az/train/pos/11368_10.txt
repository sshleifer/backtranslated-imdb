The surprisingly complex and well-prepared work of the "First" serial killer in the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> As a murderer of Cicatillo, this research is well-rounded and pointing to some of his behavior, which is accompanied by Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland's speeches on this recurring day. Despite the law of showing others, there is compelling inclination without open graphics. <br /> <br /> HBO has provided us with an extraordinary movie, but this issue is very important for heart weakness, but it is essential for the full development of key participants. . I congratulate the director and editor of this great piece. This is in my Top 10 Visits list.
