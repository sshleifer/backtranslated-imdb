I hired this movie last weekend, cranked the surround sound system, and received a few votes from special effects. This movie is a big movie rental, but it's pretty cool to frighten my fianc√©e, but some have wonderfully created a computer. I did not go to the movie and did not see it, but I do not feel like going out on a horror night movie. I recommend it!
