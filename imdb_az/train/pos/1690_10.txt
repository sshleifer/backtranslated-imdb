I've found memorable quotes for video clips; <br /> <br /> Ancient person 1: You know, for the first time, I remember playing things. <br /> <br /> Older person 2: You remember Pterodactyls. <br /> Older person 1: I remember this for you, hook line and sinker. <br /> Older person 2: Oh, I did not. <br /> <br /> Ancient lady: You did it. He put a large pail on your head and went out to fight with the Martians. <br /> Older person 2: do not you die yet?
