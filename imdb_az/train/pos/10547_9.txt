After watching the movie, I watched the trailer on DVD and I think everyone who looks before watching the film is very surprised and maybe disappointed. The film talked about a film by the director of Cube, in which the film was actually an Absurdist comedy (IMDB's spell-checker does not seem to be an absurdist word but reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern. <br /> <br /> I love to be slowly building, then gradually increasing, and I am very glad that no explanation has been given to the film, and the truth that the story is based on is one of the only respects that is similar to Cube.
