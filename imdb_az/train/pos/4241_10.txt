I liked this movie very much! Heroes were people who could feel for you. The young man who left the service is still in love with the remaining girl. Tom Drake is always perfect as Donna Reed's love for life besides the romantic device. As you can see, she has been very well-versed in her eyes, despite the fact that she looks at her and is very hungry for her hesitation and confusion. The rest of the strange characters in the shop were perfect because they tried to bring them together. The most effective view was the young couple in the grandfather's home. I partially laughed, some cried and I loved this movie. Actually I watched 5 times. For absolute romantics, definitely should be.
