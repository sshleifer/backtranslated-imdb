This film will not succeed in encouraging and acting even in 2008, even with a more modern set of sound and computerized technicians. <br /> <br /> This is just the experience of the film shot in 1922 <br /> <br /> A filmmaker can shoot a two-hour silent film today and may be interested in it. The same pace and balance as in this movie. Silent filmmaking was a pure art, with focus on its structure, direction, and movement - with no word or computational argument. A weak or unkind silent film is indispensable. <br /> <br /> This movie should be included in context for those who are concerned about the Christian theme. It is not a "Christian" movie, it does not sell anything. These issues, based on the last ethical norms, were often the case during this time - the church on Sunday was also a national past, Christianity was most often given in households, so the film was described as just normal life. <br /> <br /> It is the most strange thing that strongly supports the many Christian views of this film (and this is not only to promote religion to anyone but to emphasize the difference between hypocrites and honest people) in 1922 with a huge crowd of film industry An open debate with a representative of the Pastor, he accused Pickford as an example of immorality with some other people he named. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, which came out in 1922 and learned some lessons. <br /> <br /> Pastor film industry has complained since the start of the church attendance has dropped by 500 thousand. In the discussion, the film's representative made the following observations: There were many more pastors in this hall than the actors in prison (the truth) and many of them were not represented entirely. <br /> <br /> So, the battle between the church and the movie industry in the early days of the ongoing film. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie to be honest and true to family friends and ready to sacrifice. Mary Pickford is loyal, honest, feisty, full of happiness and joy, loyal, humorous, and silent self-sacrificing, though poor and uneducated, a perfect character. But this does not push our throat, but it has seen a little bit through the film. <br /> It reminds some of the modern Chinese films that characters have slowly exposed throughout the course of a film, and this creates a stronger connection with their character. <br /> <br /> In the last section, there is a smooth pace for the first half that sets all the elements. It should be appreciated that the movie has been shot in the last 30 minutes and gained no benefit from sound. <br /> <br /> It is strange that you did not hear a word you were talking at the end of the movie, but it feels like you hear everything. <br /> <br /> Organizers, especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes are that as soon as she approaches the pretext of sweeping snow, a perfect balance and ends, Pickford has a great complexity. This is a type of magnificent insensitive inclination. <br /> <br /> Another special observation about silent films, and especially Pickford films, is that the star often does not shoot more than a camera. the audience is overwhelmed by stress or boredom, with actors being overly disturbed. This is usually the focus of Pickford's focus on most of his films, but people are not able to get enough of it - it is a guarantee of its excellent mobility.
