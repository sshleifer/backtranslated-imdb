I can only agree with the taximeter where it is a fantastic movie and can be seen by a large audience. Imagination, visual interpretation of the script, humor are always striking. The two potentials are great and they really carry the movie. My advice is not to look at a trailer, but to rent a movie and watch it unexpectedly. I hired a blockbuster, so this is easily available in brisbane, everyone will not love it, but I think many people will have the same idea and it's always good if it's not just "stupid". I liked this movie very much, just like every day you do not see anything like that. It's a religious discovery. Give it a try, and you can feel the same way with me.
