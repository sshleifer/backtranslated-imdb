It's one of Sammo's great early comedy films. This is a parody for entering the dragona, the main character (Sammo) is embarrassed with Bruce Lee and freakishly best emulates a person for his size. Fighting then - the story of the story, which caused the disturbance of his loved ones. Oh, fight. <br /> <br /> The funniest bit of this film was completely unusual. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A guy looking for a Jim Kelly (Sammo was one of the three hired to pull out), but blackface with a afro-wick was a Chinese man. Come on, in 1978 there was no real dark man in Hong Kong? <br /> <br /> Behold, I also saw in the old American films a fairly white fake-as-hell "Chinese people." <br /> <br /> This is for a Sammo or Bruce Lee fan.
