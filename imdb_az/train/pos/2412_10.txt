I feel that Monarch Cove is one of the best written and moving "Drama" series for a long time to come to the Network. This show had a great potential and I did not expect it every week. It can turn into a great Primetime Soap. People are expecting such behavior because we are "Reality TV". I like it for the type of writing and action I offer in Dallas, Knots, Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, Monarx Cove has brought this concept to a very good level and I just hope to get it better. it's all very interesting and attractive, and it's going to be a great deal to explore and draw on these symbols and develop it after connecting with the world.I love this exhibition because it's mysterious, exciting, and amazing.
