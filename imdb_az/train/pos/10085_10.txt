I saw this movie at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert Movies Film Festival with my children today (son, 10, and daughter 4.5). Following the film, Tian-Ming Wuya, director of the children's children, was allowed to ask questions. <br /> <strong> Of course, I did not describe many subtitles for my daughter, but most of the movie he was explaining himself with his vision. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything but this movie <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> There is a "real" / original mask king who can immediately make 12 masks. The actor in the movie trained and learned to make 4 masks at a time (then cut and change 4 new masks).
