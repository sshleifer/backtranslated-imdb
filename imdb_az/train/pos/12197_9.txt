It could have been a good time for a movie to be copied, but the Colombian studio did not cut much of Orson Welles' originality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Satan is in a state of confusion and confusion, Welles is forced to take a job as a crew after a strange encounter with a charming, dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, GREAT performance) with an unequal accent, a Irishman Michael O'Hara describes him and his cripple (Everett Sloane), Elsa or Rosalie, who loves innocent, desperate puppets as he likes to call him, incites O'Hara to his website. because he was doing a secret job in the sea, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), a member of Arthur Bannister's law firm, was a strange, invalid person offering Mikayil's unique offer. The figure is $ 5,000 to help Grisby, with Michael, to go out to a technique and escape to the sun with Elsa. <br /> <br /> Hayworth presents us as one of the best feminist fatalities. Sometimes it looks really sensitive and childish, and is cruel, secular and heavy on others. He is always in a glowing state, in which the situation calls for moisturizing in liquid or black-and-white dress, and removal of the weapon. Hayworth is drawn here with beautiful pictures and is far from the famous "Gilda". After that, cut off a trademark auburn locks for a blonde product, painted by husband-Orson Welles (Angry Columbia boss Harry Cohn). It was a magnificent marketing affair, and it changed dramatically. <br /> <br /> The sympathetic femme of the "Qilda" is not fatale, but instead it is a predatory, black-eyed man who sees murder as a very useful choice. <br /> <br /> Welles and Hayworth pairing when couples are in a very difficult situation. They cause divorce after filming, so it is of interest to give some ideas to complicated relationships. They are not romantic but loving, so it is difficult to measure whether or not they are real chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> Welles' character is that each encounter is full of strong and genuine sex, including the "autumn boy" with Welles (who also accepts himself in the film!) and Rita. a typical noir 'drifter' with a lot of sense. As evidence that Welles's noise is being used, O'Hara really does not really use her brain '(Elsa).' Welles has usually played smart, charismatic partners, so it's unusual and very interesting, like the stained Michael here. Indeed, Welles was a good talent actor, and he's doing well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane is incredibly sophisticated as Hayworth's cousin. Why does Michael hire you? Obviously, his wife is interested in romanticism, and why does he invite a ship to danger? One comment may provide 'service' to Michael's wife Bannister, who is not in a disability. <br /> <br /> <strong> There are many emotions about Elsana's behavior that she came to her husband (she was a prostitute) and Grisby's information about Bannister's secrets secrets on several occasions. <br /> </ b> This is a whipped, rough movie with a flawless structure. We are more interested in murder than in the triangle of love. Welles provides us with some of the most brilliant cinematic touchs, including a fairly magnificent "mirror summit" hall. This is a terrific scene that has been overcome by errors and delays in the movie. This entertaining home scene, in a way, feels like Dali's feelings with painted sets (painted by Orson himself). The fine visual footage used by Welles in the film improves the field and is a remarkable experience. <br /> <br /> Rita's breathing alternately, low noise and low-pitched little girl voice. Hayworth proves his ability to work in this field and proves that SH's "noir" is the last femme fatale. Unfortunately, unfortunately, Rita was a very dazzling dancer, so unlucky for the 40-year-old Colombia, creating so beautiful but sparkling and often unforgettable musical compositions. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
