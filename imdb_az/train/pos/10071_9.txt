Writing that the trader should be able to convey the great skills and magic of an artist, aging and a very proud street performance, known as the King of Masks, will be helpless to accept and develop a young lamp. <br /> <br /> His warmth and humanity are paid a few dollars for a small man who runs out of the devastating natural disasters of the Chinese. In this case, the massive floods came in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His new, 7-year-old spouse learns that he is the only child of a child to take a straw home on his boat and live with his "retired and beautiful monkey", "general." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Life is changing instantly, <br /> <br /> These are many stories ... many people are touched and Chinese culture opens itself to observe our Western eyes. For a thousand years of inherited drama, it boils and this DVD will leave a few dry land eyes. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not so great because I've found sound levels all over the place, thanks to the meter you can see video transmission lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10.
