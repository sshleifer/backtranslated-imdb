I liked Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) that Lydia Reed decided to forget and not look bad. The show was excellent. Of course, Walter Brennan was great as Tony Martínez. I liked it when I called Amos Señor Grampa. I bought Seasonal on DVD and can not wait to get Seasons 2-6. It would be better if there were more shows on television than this. This show appeared briefly in the spring of 1999, but then disappeared. Bless all of God's members and ask, Llydia Reed, to introduce yourself again to the public. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
