The original name means "birth of octopuses." I must admit that I do not fully understand this name. The English name is "Water Lilies". But after writing, I read a comment from another user: "The headline in French is also meaningful: prieuve or octopus, but also offers a decree to trick many pressures." <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think Floriane and Marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any complications. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is a water ballet. Sometimes the girls are head down, except the feet, there will be nothing above the water and they will lower their feet, wave and blow in the air. This was attractive for my people who had never seen such things before. - Floriane is the leader of a team of "water lily." <br /> <br /> Marie says she wants to see her studying at Floriane. This is not just usual, it seems like the first contact. Soon we'll go together. Floriane Marie takes her to a nightclub waiting for a boy, and Marie waits for her to go back one hour. I was sleeping with each other. But then we will learn less about the movie. <br /> <br /> I can provide some information that some users may find elsewhere. Marie has a scene where Floriane secretly stole the trash can. Here he finds an apple that is mostly eaten. And Marie continues to eat the rest. ?? In another film, Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980) has a parallel scene called "Kazetachi no gogo" (Afternoon Breezes). This applies to an adult young woman and a well-meaning lesbian woman is a heterosexual woman. He also stole a loved garbage bag and eats less and less eaten apples. <br /> <br /> Next, Floriane tells Marie she wants to get her first orgasm away from her. Marie says she can not do it. <br /> <br /> But still Marie says she's really ready to do that. And masturbates about Floriane. There is no nudity on this stage. <br /> <br /> Probably only one female director could have done such a wonderful psychological show or research? I would like to quote Baudelaire from "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Floriane is played by Adele Haenel, who is perfectly performing as an autistic girl by The Little Devils by Christophe Ruggia (2002). ? many underrated movies.
