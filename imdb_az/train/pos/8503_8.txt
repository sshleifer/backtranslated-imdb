Sherman set up a car that crashed in 1986 ... In 1986, when the United States gained an unprecedented boom in Japan, it was only the worst postwar outbreak. The manufacturing industry is still an important part of the US economy, and factory workers are a good example of the "middle-aged". The word "shrink" did not yet refer to a common word, but everyone knew this phenomenon. When Bruce reads the radio, he says, "Foreman is going to do these things, boys and they will not return to their homeland." Chrysler was simply carried out by Amka Damascus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gung Ho, Another popular movie at that time. Of course, there is a film shortage - the empty part of everyone, except for Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe. But the story refers to the meeting of the East and West: Keaton's Hunt Stevenson embodies America and relies on the outside, but it is unreliable. Watanabe's Kazuhiro is at the top of the pile with a successful system, but wondered if their western competitors are more likely to learn. <br /> <br /> <strong> Keaton shows that she's in the shadow of each of her acting actors and she is filming her. Despite the fact that Keaton wrote a story, I always admired his ability to convey improvisational feelings. His character, Hunt Stevenson, is a natural leader, unpleasant, unpleasant, a clever chain. However, for many of us there is a common fatal flaw: he does not want to betray anyone. <br /> <br /> Kazuhiro Stevenson's mirrored description: shy and introspective, but also because of his Japanese education, he does not want to be the bearer of bad news. The scene where Stevenson first came up with complaints from workers at Kazuhiro, takes the Japanese approach to conflict in the workplace perfectly. Kazuhiro Stevenson responds to his complaints "I understand what you say," but he will not accept his wishes loudly. Stevenson does not understand it by agreeing with it and goes away saying, "Ok, we've settled down." <br /> <br /> As a result, Kazuhiro and Stevenson have the same problem: the proper functioning of the plant, the fulfillment of its production goals and the responsibilities of its employees. For this purpose, each one must take one page from others' book. The Kazuhiro family is a clear example of becoming more "Americanized". <br /> <br /> According to the embassy, ​​Stevenson explains that he understands how he understands his employees for his dissatisfaction with the public. <br /> <br /> And her resolution is a bit horny, but hey, this is a comedy. You will not be able to take into account the defects of the film, there is a great story about self-realization and open thoughts.
