Fire and Ice is an animated film in a fantasy world. The film is about a village destroyed by a giant glacier in the house of the evil ice lord named Nekron. The only victim of the village is a young man named Larn, who is trying to take revenge on those killed by the glacier. Ice glaciers move with shooting lands and the landowner Teegra is abducted by evil creatures. Larn is on his way to find him and sets out to find Nekron and kill him. Fire and Ice are Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adults. He brought great tempting masterpieces like Fritz The Cat movie version and some of his self-wrote films, such as Heavy Traffic in the Big Movie. I did not like the other work of Fire and Ice Ralph Bakshi, but I still love the movie. There was a beautiful animation in the regions, and the story had a lot of fun. Only my main complaint is that the story is more than a story that the story used is very subtle and not so great. And I also want the movie to be somewhat extended, because it works under 80 minutes. An entertaining action adventure film that is different from Fritz Cat or Heavy Traffic is suitable for children aged 8. I just want to have a more advanced story and a little longer.
