This film is, of course, one of the best in the genre of horror. The clustrofobic atmosphere is invisible, music is as good as film and creepy! Players are fantastic, Rop Donald Pleasance, Dr. Because it's fantastic as Loomis, the film has made it even better. Without it, there is no vital part of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis is also our favorite screaming queen! His innocence is unaware of the real evil with him, of course, until he finds his friends killed in one of the best scenes of the film. It gives a great performance. When I saw this movie in the early 80's, I liked the fact that I was scared by hell and I'm still looking at it because it's a beautiful movie that brings you to this world, as if it were gutted like a fish every time! Having a simple mask of a mask in a mask ready to kill anyone in front of everyone without thinking of being there and staying there is just shockingly horrifying, and you can easily realize that even though you are more creative in the film. We all know that in this world, unfortunately, there are bad things, and a horrible person with a knife, of course, is not unusual, a deep fear for all of these. Death at any turn. Of course, Halloween shows it in the most horrible way. Horror should be convincing and enjoy the movie. A simple story that turns into a perfect and terrifying atmosphere. Like Psycho's a great story, I also love it and I believe there are the best horrors in the world. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best films I've ever seen, and I'll watch them all my life and not get tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
