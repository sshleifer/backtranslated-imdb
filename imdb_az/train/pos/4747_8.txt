Everyone who has never seen anything like a battlefield in Matrix has ever seen this movie. The scenes of the war, The Matrix were choreographed by the scene scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> Other poor supersoldiers have been involved in drug trafficking When local drugs begin to kill drugs, Li is the team to help them stop them with their police friend. <br /> <br /> This film is a few absolutely crazy things (a badguy cut his arm from a glass with a plaque and warned it in a difficult way). Fights scenes filled with flying kicks and punches; There is the way there is the body count. Li has rarely improved and has herself covered with a beautiful woman costars (Yip begins a serious donkey like a friend supersoldier). Anthony Wong is a community like a drug lord (there is no suprises, every HK movie is a Cameo). This is not a movie in the United States. I would not want to sit down to see all of this kind of terrible dubbing. Recommended.
