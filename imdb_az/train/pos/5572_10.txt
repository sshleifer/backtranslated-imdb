This movie was hysterical. Long laughed at this difficulty. So it was not a "good hunting", but was it necessary? I was really looking forward to a very short wait and I was pleasantly surprised. Comedy strikes and is quite stable. Amanda Peet is warm and friendly. The whole audience who watched it enjoyed my movie as much as I did.
