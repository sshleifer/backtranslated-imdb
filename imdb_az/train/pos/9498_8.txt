"You better remember when drawing." Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), a bravura supporter who plays Ronald Colman's lead role and plays the role of Ida Lupino, says the title and opening is a fact that stops the sequence. her eyes. The child's maid, Muriel Angelus, is spoiled by gunpowder while playing with a pistol. Then, a wound in the Sudan War is a catalyst for its blindness. He is a famous artist, but he is no longer a jealous man, and his eyes do not reach his full potential until the moment he leaves. Enter the evil girl Bessie (Ida Lupino) and her self-destructive action. Lupino is very strong in this role and Colman plays very well. He remembers Bette Davis in his bad weighing Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Well done and well directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
