Okay, first of all, I have submitted this movie for FREE! FIRST - This film meant stereoscopic 3D. It's part of it, but when it comes to the main character car, the movie falls flat to 2D! Yes!!?!?! It's not difficult to shoot a car! SECOND - The story is not very good. THIRD - Why show all deaths at the start of the film? Someone was filming when they were planning to die! Look for a good laugh, but do not waste your time buying. Just download something cheap or inexpensive.
