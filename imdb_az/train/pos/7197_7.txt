There are several films about Zorro, some in Europe, for example, Alain Delon. This role has also been played by prominent actors like Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but the best time has always been to Reed Hadley. This series gives you an opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will discover only the real charges, Don del Oro. The series also demonstrates a very good performance, like Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, John Merton and forever King Charles, and Zorro like Hadley. He was quick, clever, used the lashes and swords well, and his sounds were good for any Zorro.
