People have a few King Kong ripoffs - Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all fall apart, but YETI stands alone. <br /> <br /> YETI midi has been admired by Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archaeologists once. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find this movie, but you have to watch it. For the first time in the 1980s, I was watching "Elvira's Mistress in the Dark Show". It dropped my veins like a child, especially YETI was crazy. I saw it again at ABC approximately 2 to 3 months ago at 1:00. I appreciate more than once seeing him have a lot of general effects (for his era) and a story is a bad guy who wants to kill a young boy and dog and his YETI for his own purposes. And the music is pretty cool, like many YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gianfranco's Password and Yetis create a great monster, as the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Give up to 7 to 10 votes.
