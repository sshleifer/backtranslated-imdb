In this really dark, dark film, a young poor student sells compassion to the devil for a great deal, but rather a miracle of the devil (which is brilliantly prepared in the film, and the student uses fencing before the mirror) he has a visual metaphor for "man in war with himself". The student loves money, but the woman she loves is not disabled (she has contracted with Satan, has been cut off forever from love and other wealth of the soul), you can not have both of your love or money for money. Some of the scenes are incredible, the devil deviates from the unbelievable human society (such as moving away from the double and outside the city 'Paul Wegener, who is now completely human, has been an incredible actor and director for Paul Wegener, a little familiar with the history of Germany and a little bit about the German doppelganger at the date of this film, Paul Wegener was an incredible actor and director, Tradition (not google, get a proper book) Remember, it's a very early movie, it's a little calm, but what does it mean and that's a tragic end, one of the best (yes, it's!)
