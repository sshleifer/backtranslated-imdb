CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) killed shortly after her husband, Christopher McDonald, learned that she was pregnant. Then we find that we see the forces in heaven that are taken very quickly and that knows that her husband needs her. He may return to the ground, but not like himself. Mary Stuart Masterson, a shepherd's girl, is about to finish her college and get ready to meet young Robert Downey Jr. The movie is on the one hand side ... the story goes to all the places you expect, but it's played by such an attractive energy toy (especially Shepherd and Downey), but you can not help it, it's fun. The shepherd has rarely been featured on the screen and is supported by a talented group character supporting him and Downey roles. A lovely and charming fantasy that will make you attractive and inviting.
