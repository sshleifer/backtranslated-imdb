<br /> <br /> This is true and drama-driven drama is one level. If it is not a scientific philosophy (like me ...) It can happen on Earth, making it even more interesting in another galaxy. No cosmic ship or laser gun (No matter) So far I've seen up s01 e04 and gripped for what is more likely to happen and wondering what to do. <br /> <br /> The cast plays a role in the game. Eric Stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show really stands alone, whether you are watching the BSG or not, in fact, they are completely different. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive start to the show. <br /> <br /> It's less dramatic, more foreign and ray guns, and so on. I've read some negative comments from the expected sciificisations. Generally, good demonstrations in these days do not happen after 1 or 2 seasons.
