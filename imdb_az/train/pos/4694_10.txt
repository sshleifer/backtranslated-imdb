An admirer of your Airplane-type movies should see this one! Founded in the 1920s and 30s, Johnny Dangerously has not only great actors, but also great lines. "Destroying the wall wall, demolishing the wall wall, demolishing the wall of # @ $% # @ $." "I do not need to hang me a hook johnny" or "Johnnys sounds like it's pulled off." Definitely part of the old James Cagney Movies and appeal to them a lot. Jhonnys has a pretty big scene on the way to the death column and a priest set up for escape. Listen closely to the false priest's reading, which is pretty funny. Another beautiful scene plays Dom DÃ©louise Pope. After consultation with the Pope, respond to Johnny, without saying a few words. I recommend this movie for laughing or lovers of old film enthusiasts.
