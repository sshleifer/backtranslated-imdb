On June 16, 1904, Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom will be able to recreate Dublini's favorite portrait of a magnificent alignment of great internal monologues - Bloomsday - a day of double-collateral! Bravo director Strick, screenwriter Haines, also plays the role of director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece. The Gunter Grass novel is another beautiful film adaptation of the internal monologue that can be compared with Strickin's movie "Tin Drum" by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979). <br /> <br /> In the original novel, we clearly recognize Dublin's spots, although there are many well-known characters in the film, with different names. For example, Buck Mulligan, who died of Dedalus, later became a prominent Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This film becomes even more enriched with extra looks for all its excellence. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
