The FBI history has been interwoven with his own personal life story through the flashbacks in terms of Agent Stewart. Stewart and Miles (as spouse) are pretty good, as Hamilton is a serious tool. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story is difficult to attract. As it is seen from the gangster's eye, it's like watching the pieces and pieces of numerous films. Some episodes are long, some are short, some look at the ground (the daughter of Stewart's daughter). Usually, it takes too long. Nevertheless, it needs a value for its fine production prices.
