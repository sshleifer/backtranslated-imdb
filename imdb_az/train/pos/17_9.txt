This is a complex film that explores the effects of industrial capitalist production on human relations with the Fordist and Taylorist regime. Manufacturers are always employed in a machine knit, supervised by administrators, and employs workers who control all the workers' requirements (Stanley is always timely, hardworking, doing good), but in an undetermined future may make mistakes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This system destroys the family - Iris's daughter is a teenage mother from a secondary school to go to work at the factory. It is now argued that both sides should start work with reductions in wages, so that no one has left home to care for the children. Iris's baby died of a disease and should be surprised that with multiple references in the movie about medical care costs, the viewer may have lived with a better and more expensive care. Irissian's brother, who was abducted in the office of unemployment, went into the traditional bourgeois ideas of excellence and beauty (when he did not even have a working class) when his spouse shouted after another unsuccessful day when his spouse screamed for buying a beer instead of dropping his face and / ). Her husband, who refers to racist film in the film, is a prisoner of black factory in the prison (likely black, black men are exposed to relatively high pressure levels). According to him, he "spends time" - his family consists of prisoners and wages. However, Stanley still believes in human relationships and, therefore, is a film outside the Fordist capitalism system. He was able to care for his father, despite his work that led to his illiteracy - he served his father - because he had violated human rights by violating the law, he still did not diminish human relationships. mistress "), he says, that everyone's work is in harmony with the rules of eating and drinking, but uses technology and industry's techniques in a kind of Bauhaus ideal of craftsmanship and creativity, that of early modernists and the 1920s socialists (such as Bauhaus) were to use technology to provide all the basic needs of creative human beings and more complete human relationships, as well as beyond the traditional gender relationships that he cooks, clears, cares for his family, Iris, on the other hand, traditionally lives in a male role - a factory worker who has an employee for his (expanded) family, brings Stanley to the public, traditionally limits women. <br /> <br /> Here, literacy (traditional men's) as a metaphor for systems and systems (money, transportation, culture), which allows you to participate in the public domain, without Stanley being feminized - the work that is open to him is food and purity. It is excluded from all regular turnovers, money (can not open a bank account), vehicles (can not drive a license, can not travel on the bus), and social. After learning how to read, auto, agriculture and spirituality (Holy) receives his books. Therefore, the Word of God is placed relative to the same value as the books. In fact, an organized religion generally exists only in many cases - it is also seen in a cabinet such as a strawberry and a pancake for iris to have sexual intercourse. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Iris, who is dedicated to living a "good life", is recognized as a moral force. At the beginning of the film, his robe is said to be among the lost items in a closed bag. <br /> <br /> Once she can read, she enters the system and she has an executive position with a health plan, car and home, at the head of the family, gets pregnancy. Undoubtedly, he is an industrial designer who desires products that are in need of other products that continue to accelerate their dreams. The film's only bit of traditional Hollywood is incomplete with everything that surprises you, perhaps a little earlier, by a studio, <br /> <br /> Now, according to pundits, we have moved to comfortable post-industrial capitalism, and we also need As the film has a little nostalgic feel, it is a historic distance to really analyze what has happened in this era. <br /> <br /> However, it is advisable - at least you want to use your brain. The end is ignorant and perfectly close to 10.
