Charlton Heston, James Franciscus, and Mark Wahlberg chose not to wear a traditional bent cloth. Hopefully no one would like it to be Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet film, but Estrella Warren just shimmered - hair is always on the go. Tim Burton could link this episode to sex and looked at the audience when looking at adults. Even Helena Bonham Carter will not even come out of the suits that appear to be a great curtain. She is cute, but all the love things are limited to anxiety appearance and a little bit of kiss at the end. Like the artificial intelligence, it links sexual intercourse between robots and humans, but never describes it - Ape Planet talks between romance between humans and monkeys, but only gives instruction. Lisa Marie is the only ape to dare to be sexy. In this film, three great actress Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti are entertaining to chew and watch the scenery like a liquid trio. Perfect makeup (a particular Oscar) suit, kits, music is the hit hit film of the year 2001.
