Until the 1990s, Jane Austen was not a movie based on Emma's film. Later that year, 1996, that year came in 1996. Otherwise, in 1995, if you count the Clueless in 1995 that renewed Austen's appeal to a modern American high school, three in two years. <br /> <br /> The main character Emma Woodhouse, Regency is a young lady who has a good family in the UK. He is financially better than most Austen heroes, like Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny Price, and does not need to find a wealthy husband. Instead, his main interests are to find a husband for his comrades. Her friend Harriet, convinced that Harriet should have a vision of a respected religious figure, Mr Elton, the young farmer agrees to cancel his marriage proposal. This scheme is a disaster, but Elton does not care about Harriet, but Emma loves himself. The speed that Emma rejects is a miracle that is consistent with a friend who has a relationship with her (a good reason) as an inappropriate marriage partner. This is a Jane Austen area, Emma, ​​becoming a more spinster than it seems to be, and she also finds herself falling in love with more troubles. <br /> <br /> In 2008, Kate Beckinsale was a Hollywood star, but in 1996, just one year older, she was not internationally recognized as Gwyneth Paltrow. However, he is convinced that Austen's good-natured, but often mistakenly-guided hero. Beckinsale has a gift for the classic role - he has made a nice hero in Kenneth Branag's "Nothing more than Ado" version, and I sometimes ask for a more favorable role in preventing Hollywood from overwhelmingly "Pearl Harbor" or "Underworld." <br /> <br /> I chose Jeremy Northam as Mark Strong, Mr Knightley, who was interested in Emma's love. Because she was approaching her own concept of character as a gentleman, an enthusiastic old man, more than her lover for Emma. (The surname was probably intended to show his gentlemen's character - the 19th-century masters liked to consider themselves the modern equivalent of medieval princes with the codes of lines for themselves). Strong age difference is shattered (he is 37, 21) and Knightley is a much more passionate lover and a more brave mentor than Northam. <br /> <br /> Samantha Morton (another actress who continues to do great things) is closer to the Harriet of the novel. <br /> <br /> This was a smaller size than the two versions. Television cinemas, sets and suits look less attractive and have fewer names in the castle. Costume drama, generally British TV, is a good thing and this version, of course, can save itself with the movie version; but also fun and well-prepared versions of the Austen novel. 7/10
