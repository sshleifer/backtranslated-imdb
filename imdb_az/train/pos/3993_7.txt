"Mom" - is a strange low-budget movie that touches at least two uneasiness issues that are not investigated in the usual cinema: denying love for the mother's son and daughter, passion and passion at the third age. <br /> <br /> The heroes are terrible: the yeast is a disgusting lady and I believe that she can not feel any sympathy or sadness for her. He acknowledges that he does not love his son and daughter. She twice cheated his husband with an idea. He kidnaps his beloved man, not to protect him from an immoral person, but to love him, but because he feels heated with him. She is trying to organize her life after killing her husband in the worst way, dying her daughter's dreams. Her daughter Paula is a fragile loser who lifts her life in this way. His brother, Bobby, is a man who insists on giving his wife a job, who lost his savings due to a really terrible job. <br /> <br /> Darren is an ethical mix that does not love anyone, even a self-love. <br /> <br /> The player and actor play a great role: actresses and actors have outstanding performances, and the direction is very clear. I liked this movie very much, but I know it's great for a very special audience. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
