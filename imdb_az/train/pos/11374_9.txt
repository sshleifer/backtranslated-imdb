There are some excellent comments and observations in this movie. I'm glad to compare Fritz Lang's "M" (forgetting the unmatched replay with David Wayne, lightweight of 50). It is not a true obedient torture killer (unusually beautiful performance by Jeffery DeMunn), sexually angry anger for victims - mostly children. That's the goal. A true obedient bureaucratic bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its unfortunate abilities. A superficial pragmatist who wants to use it (Sutherland always for such a role), hesitant, frightened, but an honest, loyal person (Rea's "The Crying Game" psychiatrist, Max Sydow), burglaring bureaucrat (brighter Brit actor John Wood) and his supervisor, his wife, Imelda Staunton, is a damn good movie, a portrayal of a corrupt and unsuccessful system that succumbed to his triumph over the success of the darkness of his nails. Gore is ready - this is an unfortunate story, but it is added to a description of a pathologically wrapped man. The success of the story is precisely that these are the actions performed by a person, like you or me, and that we are curious about our dreams When you choose to release the body, Cicatilo has made us angry with the most innocent and vulnerable people, our children. The superiority of this story is expressed in a perfect form of perfect actors. - I just want to note that our Australian friend did not like to talk and would surely want to hear what they were saying in the Aussie Leibb. Well, very bad. This beautiful movie worked for me and for everyone I talked to.
