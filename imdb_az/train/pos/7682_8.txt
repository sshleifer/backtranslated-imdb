Holly solves the issue of raising child sexual abuse every year around the world (about 2 million children annually trafficked), and this is a long way in which the team has succeeded in Priority Films without sensitive and manipulation. American actor Ron Livington, along with a Vietnamese actress Thuy Nguyen, who plays with Holly in the movie, has come together and exhibits rare ones for people in Cambodia's famous K11 redlight district. In spite of a heavy theme, the film lasts as long as the laughter and the hopes, as the two-hour film is about to draw close to the symbols that keep us from being difficult to watch. Such a movie makes the world's attention attractive. It is necessary to stop child prostitution and this is a very good first step. GREAT and everyone needs to see a movie.
