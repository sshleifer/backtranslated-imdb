Alright, before reviewing, I have to ask: Why is not it individually listed? It could have been a TV element in Italy, but it's FILM for international Lamberto Bava fans. In America, this film is distributed on VHS and DVD as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know that there is nothing to do with "Demons" except for a player and a crew. <br /> Yes, I personally apologized for finding this site useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's look at The Ogre. This time I saw a trailer on YouTube many times and was fairly scared. The film itself (which feature length, therefore making a movie) has a very strong part and fears. I was dissatisfied with the latter actions, but after seeing the DVD completely (you can get it from the Shriek Show) I'm not sorry. I explain the film's recent television origin. <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "The Shining" There are echoes of fairy tales, but this is a different horrible horror. Female (Virginia Bryant) is more evidence that this is the real life of her fears, but she does not believe in her husband. <br /> <br /> Many rhymes were pretty strange. The Ogre kaka effect was good, reminding me of the resurrection of Frank Uncle from Hellraiser a while ago. There are several good shock and a good submarine scene. The film has never been in the mood for American movies to not be imitated by similar concepts, namely, "A Nightmare on Elm Street." "Ogre" is original. <br /> <br /> There is an interview with Lamberto Bava on the Sri Lank DVD, which is a classic "Demons" series. It also gives a lot of credit for the actual castle where the film is shot. Indeed, this verse helps the film much. Simon Boswell's music helps too. <br /> <br /> There is a very good thing here. "Ogre" is not perfect, but worth seeing. Learn less Lamberto Bava.
