It was the most fun movie I've ever seen in movies. Nevertheless, I can not say whether it is a good or bad movie because such simple attributes can not be applied simply. This picture has everything you can do in any movie. There are romantic comedy features, political commentary, tension, drama, motion picture, music and a peculiar art movie of absurdist. <br /> <br /> In some cases visit Indian marriage, Nandini (Karishma Kapur) and Shakhar (Sanjay Kapur), a happy, living in Canada, hurrying to India, after a news report that is troubling her husband's parents. The rest of the story takes place in India, where couples find themselves among some of the fraternal violence. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, for a few years now, Shah Rukh Khan has a dream that Aishwarya Rai has come from another film. In fact, the two stars are all posters, but the film looks really late and only the Shah Spirit has a real character. However, it is an exciting and truly unexpected performance for her. <br /> <br /> The Capture Captain is doing the most of the work to be done in this movie and doing a great job combining the film's folds. and with an incredible sense of emotion. Another noteworthy presence is Nahar Patekar, Narsimha, the husband of the brutal father of Shah. <br /> <br /> Nana Patekar prefers every scene where it is scary, but nuanced. <br /> <br /> Film is not without realism. Violence is spreading rapidly, but women are really worried about the abuses committed by most of the characters, and Karishma has been beaten in several cases. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this violence is clearly disturbing, but ultimately, the overall effect of each dramatic sequence is usually cathartic, as it is so funny and spectacular. <br /> <br /> I am Bollywood's releases and genres, and incredible plot resolutions, of course, their norm. But "Shakti" raises the bar by absorbing a bigger mask than ridiculous. This strange and royalty audience is a film that has a magnificent Shakespeare tragedy. This is a pure, savvy film and director Krishna Vamsi should have a good time dream of throwing every game in the book. Probably not the focus of violence and the inspirational part of love for violence, but I did not watch the excitement of Shakti. Making movies can be fun in the world!
