This film was not very well-broadcasted in Greece, but good actors, big scripts and very good photographs were not "fictional" in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it is a difficult time for a new person to go after returning home after being released from the 5yo prison (the end is too late). Mourikis works Lambropoulou is strangely big and very sexy, and, of course, Hatzisavvas is once more perfect ... More than 10 to 10 Greek movies can be. create such an impression!
