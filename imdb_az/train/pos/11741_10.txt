This tender, beautifully crafted product sank deeply down the sweet feelings of my existence. Exciting students, a life-frustrating bus driver and teachers' personalities, provide a groundless debate as the story reveals. Adult characters are all familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one is well-known and well-known. When a major incident occurs, we send a review point. Nevertheless, except for the energy of teenagers, only the organizer of the trip is kept under control. Mr. Harvey is experiencing a lot of pain. <br /> <br /> Ridian Bruk and the producers are worthy of this good-quality British movie. Effective scenes should be widespread, but do not appear to have been given the right opportunity.
