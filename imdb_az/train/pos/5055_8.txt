When I first saw the DVD cover, I did not expect much. Do not you mean, Pierce Brosnan Blue Owl? <br /> Oh ... but then the story has begun, she has entered a beautiful picture and a picnic film. I was surprised and glad this (mostly) story. Wanted to read more about this exciting feature, that is, the director fulfilled his purpose and the movie was a success!
