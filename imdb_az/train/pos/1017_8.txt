I started watching the show for the first season and I'm pretty sure about it before. <br /> <br /> While waiting for the BSG's new season, the original movie was the kind of childhood, and we were just looking for some fantastic shows. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes, he became a fan. I loved the characters - astonishing-as-thoughts-he's Jack O'Neill, smart Samantha Carter, notable Teal'c, cute and brilliant for women and children. Daniel Jackson. Of course, stories are sometimes not serious, and sometimes even ridiculous, but not primarily related to this technology or space combat - helping a friend is a life threat. "Let's not leave anyone behind." When all hopes are lost, we fight until the end. <br /> <br /> Now, breaking a record, going for 10 seasons is still doing well.
