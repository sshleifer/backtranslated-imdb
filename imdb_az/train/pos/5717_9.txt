Omigosh, this is the most terrible movie I've ever seen. It would be difficult for me to say that I loved horror movies, and I (I think there is a lot in mind considering the limited existence in New Zealand) had never had to sleep before ... I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Someone may also say that similar (yet different) story lines are off, The Ring (both of which are based on Japanese horror movies), but Grudge keeps himself as terrifying - seeing movies, I cried at a certain point. <br /> <br /> Acting especially supports characters - KaDee Strickland plays fantastic and shows, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is the truth and William Mapother resembles a fun. However, as I normally am a fan of Clea DuVall, he really does not appear in this movie. There are probably the deepest backgrounds and backgrounds in the supporting characters, but it does not seem to be there. When it comes to Sara Michelle Gellar, she remains the same throughout all the movies and she's not in the role of her? <br /> <br /> Happily, the spirits were so frightened that music and sound effects (especially when answering the character of KaDee Strickland's character) sounded. 9/10
