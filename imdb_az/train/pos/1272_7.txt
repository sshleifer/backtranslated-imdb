Even though it's still an unpleasant movie, I think it's a good idea to have more depth. Half of the film is a mystery to know why Elly is such a rash. Finally, when an explanation of his childhood is given, it is still not very detailed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, still want to watch is a good movie. 7/10 <br />
