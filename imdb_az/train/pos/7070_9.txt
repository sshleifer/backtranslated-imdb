One of the most attractive elements of a Gilliam movie is the evidence of well-designed visuals, uncomfortable backgrounds, and the presence of the creator of maniac hell. Instead of the most movies (where the director is a director of a museum paid for a star or two feature), you can feel the experience of Terry Gilliam. "12 Monkeys" is Gilliam's vision and style. "12 Monkeys" is a change in the Gilliam repertoire's similar subjects: repressive / degrading societies, loneliness of the hero, frustration and parallel worlds. In this film, Gilliam makes a wonderful job of streaking lines between the two areas, using uncertainties to force the audience to believe it. This trend of Gilliam's indifference to fill certain gaps leads to criticism of the artistic plaintiff. The difference between Gilliam and his artists is the purpose of Gilliam's election and its meaning. Cole's nearly identical beach scenes are designed to make comparisons with those who do not solve the audience. Bald head is a sign of unity in the emerging future world of illness, but only recognizes it in the world in 1996. The name of the title was a sign of Gilliam's creation because most of the story would mean that it would be completely understood. Generally, Gilliam's dedication to creating creative films that are interesting to watch requires views and interpretations from the audience. It has a great deal of repetition because it has sharp details and instructions that the film can escape at first glance. Certainly one of my favorites.
