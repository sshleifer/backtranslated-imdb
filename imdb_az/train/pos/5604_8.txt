If you liked Roman Polanski's "Repulsion," you probably should expect the "Tenant" because Polanski is a similar concept playing and playing with a schizophrenic blow. Of course, of course, after Rosemary's Baby, she is one of her masterpieces and is moving directly to the psychological depression of a suicide bomber. Other residents of the building are trying to reduce the noise level - even the smallest 'titter' becomes something big, and the stars, paranoid and glowing Polanski, have the film. She is coming to the point where she acts as an old tenant and comes to the point where she works and you understand that it's just a matter before you decide to criticize it ... The movie is a little slow If you know that you have never seen Roman Polanski movie, it will end with a bang and this frustration is not disappointing . The best thing is that you ask the premise intricacies, and it's pretty trippy surreal times, because you just get as an infidel madness. Polanski is very good, like a scary, shabby resident, attracting Isabelle Adjani, somehow. We are able to see him walking around and dragging him around, but everyone is alarmed and excited! Damn, it's a ugly chick! Thus, Polanski supporters should use the Tenant as a fun psychological visit that can actually look at the thirty-year-old pedophile charges.
