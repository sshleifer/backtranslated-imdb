This movie is cheaper, cheerful! Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) provides diatribes on the most entertaining screen of movie history. The film has 2 copies of this movie ... One of Ralph Macchio's "Hash", while hiding in the background in Major Vaugn. Of course, they have forgotten to make these mistakes in the movie, but the film shows how funny it is when actors can not keep a straight face!
