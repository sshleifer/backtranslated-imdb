After falling completely under six feet, I did not think it would be a show that would be as good as this show. Yes, I made a mistake! Lost flavor! I absolutely love this show and it is impossible to turn it off. The richness of the caricatures, the elegance of the structure, and the beautiful setting make it all surprising. I totally and completely blocked it. I do not know how the creators do it, but every character is deeply touched by me. Their happiness, their pain, everything, I feel for me right away! I do not have a cable, I rent a series in Netflix. When I put it, I watched all the episodes at a time, and I'm sorry when it's over. I will not wait for my next drive to come home. This is the best TV show I've ever seen!
