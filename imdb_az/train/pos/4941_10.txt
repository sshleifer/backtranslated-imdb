I think that many people have evaluated the film because of the lack of quality. But he did not follow Hollywood's standard formulas. Some conflicts are not resolved. The end is just a little real to others, but the journey is thoughtful and very entertaining, providing a long list of rich characters and fans. <br /> <br /> This is my 10 movies in my book, where normal and anticipated Hollywood legends will not be. They took some risks and made some different things. I think it works well, I do not want to avoid any direct contact with the film, because it's the best response to someone else's interpretation when looking at yourself.
