When Alain Delon accidentally killed his wife and child, Duccio Tessari quickly and precisely reverses the brutal crime family, who uses the Big Guns as a cunning person. Tessari and screenwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore "One minute to pray, one minute to die" and Franco Verucci take the "Death to Work" action to a wire mesh about a career point for a group of movements. Indeed, Big Guns is predictable, but it is still a lot of boring and often known as solid entertainment with sudden killing. The Godson's Alain Delon touches on the heads of gang leaders who refuse to retire to enjoy life with their young son and daughter, methodically engaging in death. Richard Conte, from The Godfather, plays an Sicilian criminal boss who wants to hack the hat with the character of Delon but the rest of his hard-nosed employees are dead-hit people. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Big Guns, as well as the most intriguing enthusiasts, also relate to the kinematics of the crime. Interestingly, a man who has nothing to do with the killing of his spouse and her son survives while treating another hero with excessive superstition. Tessari does not lose second in the 90-minute shooting. The worst thing happens when a mother and her son die in a bomb intended for a father, when the car crashes into a car that separates a hero from a car accident. As you can see, Big Guns is a bloodless journey, but has a high body number for the 1973 mobster melodrama. Only in the last minute the protagonist protects the guard and, therefore, the eyes of the eyes remain morally unbearable. Tessari combines the stages of a few good car drivers and the death of a done on a train tunnel is bloody as it is a terrible thread. Photography and compositions are very good.
