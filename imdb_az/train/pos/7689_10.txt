This black society was like the crack epidemic, gangsta rap, and AIDS that prevented ghetto's eighties. Required, hardworking families, all traumas and difficulties they encounter. Black America was a different group in the seventies. Still hoping and flying in civilian law movements of the sixties, it was difficult, but still worthwhile. This shows demonstrate how a black society struggles to work together as people and families before the ghost community's horrors begin to sink into one another and everyone else to survive when you do your best to keep your head above the water. It's a shame to see what happened to the black ghettos and what happened right now.
