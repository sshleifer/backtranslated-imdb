<br /> <br /> Dance is a beautiful movie, because something like dance shows how life flows in the spirit of man. <br /> <br /> Dance is an expression of existence and looks like the birth of the individual. Certainly, we are dealing with Aoki. Here is a modest office seafront, but place it on the dance floor and leave the density as bottled. It is surprising that this freedom is stunned in Japan because of a harsh adaptation culture. At the beginning of the film, all the characters are ashamed or afraid of their desire to dance. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen to witness the revival of human emotions and passions. She will smile on the face of the day.
