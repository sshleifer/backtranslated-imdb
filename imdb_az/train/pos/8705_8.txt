<br /> <br /> (The Small Spoiler) Although this is a superhero movie, though it has the Sasha, The Tale, The Sword Carrier and DVD cover (action / sword carrier creates herioc). The sword carrier is cursed by a sword owner who can be retracted in his front arm. Say, but not, it's a real life. If you had this power as a child, you might be able to handle it when you meet a naked person or when your dad's friend blows it. If you do not control it, cope twice with the killer as long as you are 12 years old. <br /> <br /> This is actually the place where we met Sasha. After another killing (A Bout de Souffle), he travels uninterruptedly. She then gets acquainted with Katya and desires instantly with love, and Sasha provides a true reason to live and change her way. <br /> <br /> This is really a story, and there is practically no action on the screen, though it is still very popular, its history is still being pursued. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Unlike many Hollywood's "super heroes", we get very little back story, there is no bad man (not counting the sword carrier), there is plenty of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> Check if you can find it.
