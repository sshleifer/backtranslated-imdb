"Deep Space Nine" 1999, praying for a better show after many successful Dead Trekkers (or Trekkies, does not care about me!) In seven seasons of Star Trek Voyager. The "enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, rooted different characters, striking new visuals, pop-song for intro. (I'm shocked!) I do not want something that I did not want. Sign me for the 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager", no one is happy with you! <br /> <br /> Continue on the trekking!
