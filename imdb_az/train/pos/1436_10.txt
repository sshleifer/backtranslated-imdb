Working in the center of Manhattan, I eat in the park near the City Hall in the summer days, and I'm going to visit the mayor. I had to go outside the gates of the municipal building and see that it was visible through the lobby and the whole building. Al Pacino ("Mayor John Pappas"), "Gigli", 03, performed an outstanding performance through the entire picture and made a speech in an African American Church for a young boy who was killed. John Cusack, deputy mayor of Kevin Calxoun, was a "loyal fidelity to the Mayor," 03, and he worshiped everything he was trying to accomplish. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Cogan) begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and is a great helper. Last but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", 01, played a head coach with many challenging options towards the end of the picture! Great movie with great player and fantastic photography in NYC!
