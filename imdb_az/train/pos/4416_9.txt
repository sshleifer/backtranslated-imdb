Harvey Keital is the best performance of the new century ever. He took a beautiful picture from the past Castro Cuba. The story is packed around the nephew of a local small criminal boss, who has created a friendship with America with Hollywood contacts. Indeed, a child is bound to understand that a small circle that a person actually knows actually lives in a much larger and more complex world. The scenario is strong and humorous, the direction is crisp. For all of this, it's really a work that suits the tradition of Latin American cinema. One weakness is not to speak Spanish, but to sync-sound in English - probably to improve sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this film is a little more convincing. But outside of it, I will make a sincere visit to another world. Recommended.
