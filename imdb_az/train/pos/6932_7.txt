WINCHESTER 73 is a story of a man who has recaptured a recycled rifle made by Winchester (Jimmy Stewart). The rifle changes hands and Stewart keeps it afterwards doggedly. The B & W case, made by Anthony Mann in the 1950s, looks more like a gangster than a traditional western film and cowboys, old cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a suspicious virtue woman who leads for a ranch with a man who can marry (Charles Drake). He ends up falling for Stewart, but before passing a little around. Winters is the most sophisticated character in a film full of extraordinary characters. Watch for young Dan Dureyea as a yogurt killer and Tony Curtis playing a very small role. Woefully plays the miscast Will Geer Wyatt Earp.
