Nowadays most of them do not watch such classic films. Most of the friends are watching movies only in the 90's. Surprising things. <br /> <br /> Many of the old movies are unique to them. Only when these films are thought and compiled, when ideas are fresh. Now people are just trying to think about new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. Classic horror is for real fans. This is for you. The film explores the disappearance of a movie actor and relates to three other bizarre incidents associated with an old researcher named Scotland Yard. <br /> <br /> I will not say it anymore, because I will destroy the film more and more. But it's a great old-fashioned movie. And never again wait for it!
