The first is that this "limited" amount is released so it should be bad ... The "big five" Hollywood studio's "pass" or "ignore" everyone's undesirable features can not be lost or imagined by direct censorship <br /> <br /> Now, because I love this feature, this product is limited because it is "unidentified", although it is never a "so-called" account of anything, OBVIOUS.- it's always the same for everyone and the current American "Charlie Wilson's War" or "on the boat", although it is something that anyone who is interested in or influenced by is politically motivated. The country of "turakistan" and "emerald city" are similar to what Iraq and Baghdad are doing for Tamerlane's haliburton (Dick Cheney, LOL, playing with vice-president Dan Aykroyd). The film is, in fact, immortal, not even sarcastic (a true example of how John Cusack's character will lead to his depression), in fact, is a real moment. <br /> <br /> Generally, all characters may be related to one thing or another, or to specific stereotypes. Now the word of counsel; especially if you do not have political activity in terms of "globalization" aspects, you will not use most of this content. Because most of the content and "jokes" target "non-prominent" personalities for the public. on a daily basis ... (the main exception is Hilary Duff, a well-known materialist pop star, name (S))? In CORE, this feature is anti-globalization concept. The message is, of course, delivered with funny revenge. Joan has a line at one point like this: "And here's a book we've written, how I miss the world and solve my dad problems." PRICELESS))) <br /> Brother and brother Cusacks play well as always , As well as in Grosse PointeBlank, I would say a little bit more "mature" .Marisa Tomeihere "surprised" <br /> <br /> Many critics can not get it (they can not). , or we do not want). it's not a "regular" movie, it's not a funny documentary. this feature has a "visuals" to get a message and not to buy an Oscars, or to get the viewer to buy the latest "HDTV experience" TVs ... I also noticed that this movie was getting worse in local movies PRO-Iraq War Movies While getting a good start for "balanced" and "engaging" -views because "artistic", though, the whole world's main press is concentrated in the hands of many children. <br /> <br /> I think this feature will prove to be abroad, and then it will be in North America. As I mentioned earlier, this is a satirical story about American foreign policy and how the "special interest" groups were kidnapped ... The "regular" American soldier wearing the Tamerlane corporate logo in battle dress is quite insulting, > Some PRICELESS shots: occupy country commercials on "freedom"; Future journalists probably have an unpleasant scene about collecting "news" ("It's supposed to be better than the x-box bullocks"))); soldiers engaged in "frustration"; <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not propose to some kind of "conservatives" or "charming" patriots. this feature is not made to reach the "spirits of the people" (for example, the main propaganda and commercial interests are always trying to do so). Instead, a good message for realists and direct "ideals" for direct ideological purposes is not difficult.
