Everyone knows about this '' Zero Day ''. In my opinion, this film did not see how the Elephant was. They have shown their lives for a year. Throughout the film, we want to laugh with them, even though we know exactly what to do. And it gives me cold. Because I felt that they were guilty of manifesting their interpretations, and I thought Cal was a sweet man. Do you know what happens to KNEW? Even at the end of the film I wanted to commit suicide, and I thought it was only funny that I thought they did not do it 3 or 4, but I was terrified to put out their heads yet. Of course I was. I liked them. They were bad, maybe, but I really felt like normal kids, really did not understand it. But I knew they were. <br /> This is IMO, the main force in this film. It understands that our friends or relatives or anyone is planning to do something, and that we will not even notice it. This movie, feeling good, made me feel bad. And therefore it is impossible to sleep now. There is still a little sense in Madam. Butterflies.
