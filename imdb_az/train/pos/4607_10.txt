My favorite Jackie Chan movie is always the "Drunken Master" (1978), this movie "Police Story" since 1985. The bell is a Hong Kong super police officer who buys an undercover lord and gang, and then is appointed to protect the girl's daughter (Brigitte Lin), which may open the country's arguments. While the story continues, the gangster sends his friends to send Lin, but Chan takes matters to his fists and feet while keeping his girlfriend Maggie Cheung. Like "Drunken Master", "Police Story" also has signature stunts and many-sided art / motion choreography popular for climbing in a battlefield at a popular shopping center in Chan. Chan's role as director, giving Chan a charismatic and funny performance dedicated to the event. <br /> <br /> Even though Drunken Master's world-wide slapstick is a humorous light in the heart of the Police Story, a police story is an angry cop-triller that will be copied in years to come. <br /> <br /> 10/10
