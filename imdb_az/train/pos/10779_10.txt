A classic cartoon is always pleasant and funny. There is an interesting plot full of cute characters. Road Rovers is a worthwhile show, this is a short 13 episodes and you can handle a chance to see it, you must be. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD containing all 13 episodes. If I were to buy it, and if they did, then you should buy it. If there are children who love dogs, they will love the wayfarers! The road boards should be more careful when broadcast, which was an original and very special show, which was definitely worth much more than itself.
