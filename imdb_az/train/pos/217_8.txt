SUNSHINE BOYS was an entertaining entertainer of Neil Simon's play, played by Walter Matthau and George Burnsun, a very striking team of devil-born in 1975, and was asked to re-join a television special or something again. The point is that both of them hate each other and have nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin, as Matthau's nephew, is a theater actor who has been given a monumental responsibility for becoming a reality. This warm and victorious comedy is a wonderful love for a forgotten fun form ... andudeville and mainly works with Neil Simon's best scenarios and outstanding work by Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. For this, Burns won the best-supporting actor Oscar, but I think Matthau flies with this movie with a flawless performance like Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for the Best Player, but did not give Nicholson a chance; However, within a year, this was an Oscar-worth performance. The Matthau screen is commanded and there is an incorrect note in this beautiful timeout. He is a classic who can vote for a potato chip and can not buy the product name. SUNSHINE BOYS is a Neil Simon comedy that sheds light on the chemistry that is not defeated by Matthau and Burns.
