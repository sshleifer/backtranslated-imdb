I'm afraid to tell you how much I love this movie. This movie is one of the least known and one of the most funny movies I've ever seen. The film follows a rap group, NWH (#% $ rs by Hat). From the start of the group to the end of the group, it goes after this tragic breakdown. After the documentary founder Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film is in a budget, but it's a very well-prepared movie, and all the actors and actresses perform well. The main strength of this film is that there are very bright lines and races on rap, which is unreal. Authors of the article: MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and Songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick, Etc.) Rusty Condieff made a perfect movie. In the movie, the rapist plays Ice Cold. It's funny, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The film works very well because sometimes it becomes extraordinary, but it is a blow to the line where it is laughable without much distance. Listening to three ideas was one of the best parts of the film that tried to talk about philosophy, producing a producer like Tone Def, when you get a bus, and the manufacturer answers? <br /> <br /> The group that describes NWH has a number of natural chemistry. Together they work well and can film this movie in the absence of a weekday moment. How accurate this movie is to some rap gangs that make this movie really good. <br /> <br /> Many rap groups have faced violent censorship, and like the NWA, the band became popular when it just began to do a great deal of controversial words. <br /> Attack. There is something here to hurt anyone in a good way. There are many people in the film, Spike Lee's most interesting. I can not imagine where they came from this dialogue. There is a line in the film after the line to roll. <br /> <br /> Despite the release of this movie, I am not surprised. This is a clever, controversial and even thought-provoking movie. This is basically very interesting, although it is interesting and is flawless in production. Tone Def has many faces who are not familiar with any stars, including Marc Lawrence playing. Look at this movie, at least you will definitely have that idea.
