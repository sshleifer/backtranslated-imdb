Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray, and Barbara Read Since 1936, this Universal movie, The Three Wise Girls, presents Deanna Durbin to the audience. Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady stars. This is a sweet story about three young women living in Switzerland with a divorced mother who is listening to their father's (Winninger) hearing. Ten years later, they sent a boat to America with the help of a housekeeper / taste who did not see her and who still knew her mother loved it and decided to stop at the wedding. Knowing that there is nothing more than a gold digger that has helped and throwed her predicted Mom (Barnes), Brady, she's getting her acquaintance with a rich Count. It is organized by his father's scribe (King). The man he chose is full of time-consuming drunken girls (Auer), but the girls make a mistake for Milland. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie, not a very sweet, but very good performance, not by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are pretty good and all are doing well. Of course, the young Durbin, a natural actress and a singer of beautiful instructor, is emphasized. In fact, as a young man, his voice is more than just an adult - because he puts too much weight on average, he has no problems with high notes as he did later. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful things in the film, seeing Charles Z. Winninger's father, does not want his children around - knows them and recognizes them. Like gold earnings, not Barnes but all the young people, the daughters of the girls look at the road, so the youth could be an older man looking for a more attractive woman and youth. <br /> <br /> Generally, Durbin's star is set up - there's a recent shooting in the movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Ray Milland has still paid for this point, and it's likely that fans will be surprised to be as young and attractive as the movie. <br /> <br /> Very fun and, of course, a stardom for Deanna.
