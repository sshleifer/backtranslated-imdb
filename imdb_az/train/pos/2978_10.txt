BASEketball is one of the most exciting films I've ever seen. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, one of the creators of the South Park creature, is a film without a movie. They play two surprise friends who want to create a sport for their way to becoming a national sensation. The majority of the ages are really cheerful, but the funniest parts of the movie when the players try to "mind" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about not allowing it, so naturally they do the most bare things. A flaw of this film is a very fast way of this speed and when I ask myself about half an hour after waiting for it, "This is already the case?" Another cheerful part of the film, Joe and Doug, always surprised Squeak, a naughty little man. BASEketball is a very funny classic and very entertaining to watch with many word lines!
