I was sick of people talking about Ewoks! True, they're not the best thing that does not happen to Star Wars, but that would happen, so be busy! Moreover, they are cute and they are profitable if they are profitable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie is always tearful to me. Perfect. The latter could not have been good. I'm excited for Phantom Menace, because suddenly Luka's heart will focus on Anakine. I love how it came to its end - otherwise it would not be resolved. Those who are complaining about the helmet of Vader, are a moment to think about it. Very effective. Vader, who has been hiding behind a mask for 20 years, is finally emerging as a patient-looking man. He is not entirely car - he is sensitive. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director chose such good players in New Hope. Everything works well. They are incredibly characteristic. Hamill is doing a great job with dramatic character development. Fisher has done a great job of being a female role model (he came! Jabba killed so many people!). Harrison Ford - do you need to say more? <br /> <br /> Music is more brilliant. It is very effective and important if you can choose character topics in different parts of the film. Luke cries the most "NOOO!" When you say. and jumps to fight his father in the final battle. John Williams is a genius! What an incredible man! <br /> <br /> It already has more meaning for me than the Episode I movie. Finally, I will not wait to see her in the theaters <br /> <br /> Bravo!
