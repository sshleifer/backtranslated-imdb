This does not mean a really bad word about the movie. I did not surprise her at first, but it was growing rapidly on me. I love it and I think it's a shame that many people like it are banned in some areas and that I'm one of them. Film, shock, gore and atmospheric department. The score is a nice part of the suspense apparatus. It just seems fair to be one of the best composers in Chris Young's business. In this movie, a small wooden plank in some spots and its effects are very realistic and gritty, a bit higher standard. All this is a high praise for a good slasher movie in my book. Some of the comments were made by the film's famous killer, P.O.V. And I ask: WHAT IS THIS? It is a classic fever that frightens any good admirer of the genre and is great for keeping the identity of the murderer secret. The only thing that makes this movie top in my book is that it's just a quick kind of thing, despite the fact that an amazing twist (the murderer has revealed) does not work with more care. In addition, PRANKS is a big movie (though I'm on its original name) and it's a shame that will shatter a lot of people just like a cheap knife. More than that, but only a few know that it was missing in the early 80s. What a shame .... Its a really good movie people! Believe me!
