The main reason for watching this movie is the summer appeal and beautiful appeal. "hula" is not parallel to clara's best movies, but still enjoyable. he dances, goes to his horse, and follows the man he loves. the length of this film is more than an hour and is driven by the future oscar winner Victor Fleming (with the wind). The movie moves quickly and clara has a lot of time in the summer. If he wanted it, I would say "hula".
