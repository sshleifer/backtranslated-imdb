GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (Quaternary) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br If you have a viewer interested in cars produced by manufacturer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock"), it's worth seeing to open your eyes on glossy vehicles. The film is fragile in many areas, though its sensitive motion and excitement causes a moderate successful summer excitement. <br /> <br /> The film's star, Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad"), is a young crook called Kip Raines, which does not feature a long list of expensive cars for powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When his life is threatened, his elder brother Randall called "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but capable car thief, replaced his brother to live in a task of sharing: model, color, year and only four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis has been helping to launch a group of bandits since the first three days. The crew, formerly known as Memorial Man (TJ Cross), along with aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), also known as Sexual and Sexual Retirement Car Scarecard Sara Sway Wayland (Angelina Jolie) Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> The two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who were suspecting Memphis and his team of previous experience, help drive the film and its tension. <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> <strong> If people get acquainted with these decisive lifestyles and make difficult personalities, the movies are a heavy blow, a chic atmosphere. The film does not describe dialogue with a strange cultural tone to further worsen the film. I have not said that cunning and vulgarism are important for the development of excitement; I truly respect the decision to speak extreme nasty in a film that has won a very high R rating by the director's decision. Nevertheless, I believe in a movie like "I Have Passed 60 Seconds," and dialogue must be convincing and convincing to reinforce the character's enlightenment. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch and perform perfectly responsible performers. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's sleazy look is here completely compatible. Delroy Lindo is healthy and convincing. <br /> <br /> With the pleasure of working on story style and character motifs, the film is primarily of a standard structure, a fast moving theme, but no deep and powerful character. In the second movement, we involve a number of problems: the story spends most of the time in this segment, in fact, never sets for the third act. The middle of the film is often working and a sex scene provides a solid mid-field, and there is not much. <br /> <br /> The third act resembles the speed of adrenaline, which contains an exciting wall-wall excitement and is typically the sequel of the most powerful car-track film shot. <br /> <br /> "60 seconds have passed" to agree on inspirational moving scenes. This film is a scene from a car driver, despite the devastating shortcomings. Dominic Sena, a career-oriented advertising orientation, has an attractive and decisive position in the form of "60 seconds." This will give audiences a two-hour excitement, excitement and excitement. <br /> <br />
