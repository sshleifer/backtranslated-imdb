For me, this is one of the best films I've ever seen. Carl Brashear is the best performer in the life of the Cuban who plays the best in his life and is the best performer in his life. De Niro is a lively legendary movie is giving. Recalls his character in the film, but has a very good performance for this film. Beautiful Charlize's appearance and always a great plus for every movie. So, if I have not seen this movie, I am amazed at the witnesses, the greatness that inspires. This should look great drama. My vote 9/10.
