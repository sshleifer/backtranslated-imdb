Unfortunately, if you were there, this movie would be out of compassion for you. As I said, it is shameful, because some of the players are for amateurism, but for realism. Let's say it in real life, even when we do not want to say it, we say everything exactly or perfectly. It works in this sense. However, in this film, our "well-known" actors, especially Jodie Foster (naturally born), are not applied. The fact that the other three girls are not fulfilled is just a story - Jodie is an adhesive that struggles to maintain friendships with the clarity of death. <br /> <br /> In some cases, no matter how close you are, no matter how many attempts you have, there are some escaping people. <br /> <br /> This is not just about sexuality, but also about these four girls and their last time before the birth of a single girl, like young girls. <br /> <br /> If you like this friendship, you will feel this movie - it means something for you, regardless of the period or the time you grew up. We all knew these girls at school, or at least we knew them. We all knew an unhappy look, wanted to grow up to half an hour, trying to catch up with more than half of them and thinking that he would do it for him. We all know the naked boy, the fear of the world, the fashionable fashion that keeps him afraid of fear. We all knew that the party's daughter was only aware of the fairy tale of her misery, not just the sad life of the house. And we all know that the "main figure" is a bit more realistic, slightly more restrained, slightly more sad because we know what's going to happen. Maybe he was one of the girls. Maybe, like me, if you were always at each other ... <br /> <br /> This film really takes the sensitive time of life while trying, pressure, femininity, childhood, world and loneliness, at the beginning of each one, The factor is similar to the abyss. Which aspect do you look like? Whatever you want to do, what do you put on the edge? How do you feel about everything you know? Here is what this film is - how dangerous it is to take steps and take a walk during the femininity of the childhood. If you were there, you know ... and I love this movie. Aching and tenderly done. A nice piece of captured womanhood.
