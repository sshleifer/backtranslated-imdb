I gave this movie 10 to 7 because villains were interested in their role and an unknown batwoman creates an interesting "guess who" game. The film needs more Robin. At the beginning and effectively part of the film appeared in the film. I have always brought less justice to the brand new Robin character, so as not to leave Knightwing alone in the new animated series. This film just continues the bad tradition. The romance of the movie Bruce Wayne is so incredible that romance is a romantic film that will not be so bad in a romantic romance. If you're a fan of a Batman, it's a good movie, but I recommend watching it.
