As I know that the main actor is playing, I have seen his performance and said that it is a remarkable description, and I agree with it. This is a fantastic movie about a very mature guy / guy who is a special body that helps him. Oscar and BAFTA winners, and Golden Globe nominee Daniel Day-Lewis play the most part in their life with cerebral palsy Christy Browna, who is carrying a wheelchair and his family. Although it is his special left foot, he can write it, paint it with it and take everything. She then learns to speak in the movie, she is very good for a guy like her. Also, the Gold Globe Brenda Fricker, named "Home Only," was named Mr Brown and BAFTA as Ray McAnally, Mr Brown. Oscar nomination for Best Director, best writer, best writer Jim Sheridan, best nominated for Best Picture, Best Feature Film, Best Makeup artist and BAFTAs nomination for best adapted scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 at The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. He was the 20th on the 50 UK actors, number 9 among the UK's most spectacular actors, and he was No. 15 about the world's greatest actor, and the film, the top 50 UK's 28 Most Greatest British Films. Outstanding!
