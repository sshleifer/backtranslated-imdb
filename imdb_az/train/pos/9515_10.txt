One of my favorite films is, with a very nostalgic finish. The film, about the Sullivan family, obviously belongs to Michael Sullivan (father), one of the main members of the mafia, the killer and the same expert. One of the children wants to know his father's job (a terrible mistake), hiding in his car's car and trying to tell Tom Hanks in this way. <br /> <br /> There is no mafia in the Mafia, no one can win, it pulls you out and leads you out. Of course, a huge house, the world's best car, any wish, but you can look at anyone who does something wrong or want to do something that the boss does not want to <br /> <br /> <br /> < strong> <span style = "font-weight: 0"> <br /> <br /> He made his son. <br /> <br /> This film is a sad thing, and it links us to revenge and the ugliness of people. This movie is really fun. Sullivan's mafia, everything you love. Hopefully the man reads this statement, does not work for the mafia, and if you work in the mafia, give your blessing and go out of paradise before your master and your employees are killed. <br /> <br /> This movie is acceptable: 10/10
