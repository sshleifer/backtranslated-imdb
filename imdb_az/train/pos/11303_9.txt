Visconti's first film has all the visual engagement visions and exquisite techniques that accompany the charming performances of Marimo Girotti, and Clara Calamai's spectacular, crazy Giovanna. Repeat the "The Postman Rings Twice" several times, but never get better. Do not believe this guy's the first movie! This shows the credibility of someone in his career.
