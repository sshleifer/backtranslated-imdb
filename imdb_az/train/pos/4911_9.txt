This movie has become one of my favorite lie experiences for the last ten years. The three story topics given by Kazan have their own unique and unique pleasure. The small intimate exchanges between her husband and her spouse were all well-prepared and naturally designed to accommodate smaller movements such as Barbara, a small bass between Bel Geddes and Widmark; More than anything else, I love their porch and the second sitting room spends most of the summer season. The second topic is the professional relationship between most of the film, especially between the characters of Widmark and Douglas. It may not be completely original and may be a bit shimmering, but all come true, respectful and efficient. The third topic, Blackie's strange tales, and a small band of us came to a dark and frightening noir world. Palance's Blackie is cold like an ice block. This self-proclaimed businessman, the man who created this self-evidently complexity, just tap into it. For me, this movie is a completely satisfactory experience.
