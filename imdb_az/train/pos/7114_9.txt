Certainly, the fifth John Garfield movie should be the pride of Marines. This is Marin's true story of Al Shi'een, and, when looking at himself, the wounded were massacred in Guadalcanal, Japan. <br /> <br /> Beautiful segments in three parts of life, Al Schmid's home life is a simple functioning rule that just goes into serious trouble with a woman and does not love anything better than a bowling night. <br /> <br /> The second part is in the city of Guadalcanal, and we see part of the movement in which an isolated machine gun is occupied by taking Japanese troops. Of course, the third part is a painful correction of civilian life and is to ensure that people do not simply care for self-reliance. <br /> <br /> This film was broadcast on the TCM on the occasion of John Garfield's 95th birthday, and there was a documentary in Garfield, where her daughter's house was home. One of the guys talking to him said Garfield was the most active actor in the working class, a working card. <br /> <br /> In this regard, he was happy when he landed in Hollywood with Warner Brothers. Since Garfield's use of Al Schmid's life, apart from Jewish funds, Garfield continued to write gangster roles in the tradition of this studio. <br /> From this point of view, he was perfectly able to play the role of a working class hero like Al Schmid, who took responsibility for defending his country. <br /> <br /> This is just a person who has managed to return to Philadelphia, but must be implemented. <br /> <br /> This is a big part of the Garfield. This is a film that should not be missed. I'm surprised at what's happening in Al Shim.
