Inside images of a shelter, overlapping montage / images, and uncertain narratives, this is a very tough movie. Apparently, a man (Masue Inoue) is a conductor or worker in a shelter, so he may be next to his wife in prison and maybe get rid of it. However, he often has an expression in his face, when it is hollow in the ground, terrible, time and fear, misery, and misery. The filmmaker sometimes looks at himself, and we see uncertain pictures on the edge of the lake, holding him to a drowning or drowning boy. He suffers for something. When the point of view is switched to self or other ignorant people, they are able to show people who are frustrated and then reacted to using filmmakers, visual lenses, and so on. And the place is full of crazy people, laughs and hides and dances day and night in dance. At one point, a man tries to get his wife out, but at night he is horrified and goes back to his cell. Gradually, the man turns into a nightmare, which he cuts in another attempt at theft, and he kills physician and a large number of his assistants, and all these strange people are laughing and applauding. He wakes up when he wakes up and is agitated. Life, streets, buildings in Japan in the 1920s are some interesting shots.
