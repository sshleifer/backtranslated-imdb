I just saw it once. <br /> <br /> We are very young ... But I, forever, remembered the strong moments of the Gunga sacrifice. <br /> <br /> At that time I understood that a people would be used and used by a difficult foreign nation. It may seem like a kind of friendship in the historical conditions, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, the sharing of everyday life, seeing each other, raising one another but among the different worlds. Then, in the most critical moments, a question arises: "First, who needs to be faithful?", People, family, homeland, the person you know. You do not have the time to respond perfectly, there is an emergency and for life or death. Gunga-Din sacrifices the answer. In one place, with an embarrassment, a problem remains unresolved, just one life before the death of one's senses, nothing is more common with the rhythm of the film compared with many other fancies or realities we can see today, because this death was a unique disappearance in my life , I shared my child's unconditional friendship. It happened by my audience. That day I lost Gunga-Din. After my retirement, my beautiful childhood is as good as I am from the many worlds I've been living since then, and these lines are a short trip today and I will not do it this morning.
