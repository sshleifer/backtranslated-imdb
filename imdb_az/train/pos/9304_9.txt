This movie is great. Simply. It is rare that you have found the comedy levels and that's a bloody good example. At first, when I saw this movie, when a loan spread, a friend looked at each other ... "Did you just hold it?" For suspects, look at the levels. Vick and people in the club, compare with DNA! If you see different characters, each one runs to the position and if you do not see anything else, see the link between Vick's treatment and the transition from the movie to the movie. THE ONE OF THE IN VICK! The opening line on Vick's world. The closing scene with the camera will be in Vick's head and in the whole universe! Comprehensive quotable, beautiful animated pirates, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
