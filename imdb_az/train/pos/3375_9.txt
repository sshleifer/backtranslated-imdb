In 2022, it looks more like 70. This is, in the first place, amusing, but soon afterward, the decayed futuristic world recognizes how much the world differs, and the few things we have been able to accomplish. Characters are often unique in their own way without any moral, behavioral, and respect. I believe that this is not intentional, bad behavior. Finally, those who witnessed the social changes of the 1960s and 1970s may well admit such behavior of many urban populations by 2022. <br /> <br /> Most of the action scenes, the priest, are very cheap for the 70s. Land is not very polished. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But great scenes and ideas - "furniture" - it complicates the film's deficiencies.
