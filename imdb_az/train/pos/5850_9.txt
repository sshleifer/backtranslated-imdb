Now 16 years have passed since the original run, and I would now have to propagate some of the "marketing wizard" of this classic's live version, or at least I wanted to re-release the original 65 episode. I do not know what science flax or cartoon network does not quit. The Galaxy Rangers really used well-thought-out areas and better scripts. The animation was higher than average for today and the slide show was great compared to the Japanese animation today. In the market there is a tough toy, which could have sealed its suffering too. If possible, I would like to have GR's money on DVD.
