This is a beautiful piece of movie. It only runs at right speed. The added music is perfectly suited and very enjoyable to the ears. <br /> <br /> However, the movie has become more sensitive and more popular with its tragic nature. <br /> <br /> However, despite the many commentary on the tragedy of the story, it was a shock to me. I loved her so much that she did not have a long experience. It is almost a general trace of contemporary and modern films. sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the life of Dan in the absence of regular violations. It does not just require, and you really have a completely prepared area that will be destroyed by any decoration decoration. At the same time, the topic is completely mature. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there are some scenes that feel 'Waltons', but these are actually the perfect ones. for a long time they have more functional moments. This rosier then leads to a tragedy that turns into darkness and carries more care. This wavy landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in lithium stability. The peaks and bottoms are soft, but they are delighted to be vaccinated. <br /> <br /> I usually recommend watching this movie regardless of the genre of which taste. Put aside any prejudice, because you have to see it!
