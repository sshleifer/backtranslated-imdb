"Beckham Bending" is a very little exposed film in the United States. Perhaps the US could have a lot of trouble because of the fact that the film was a very strong English in dialogue and terminology and there were many things in football (where there is football). This movie is totally fantastic and is unsuccessful because it is very desirable More coverage here. I think that the story's story (after the dream) is something that many people can associate with "Bend like Beckham", and that's really a good movie, a good source of motivation and motivation. I was not primarily excited to see this movie, but I'm sorry I see it now. I love this movie!
