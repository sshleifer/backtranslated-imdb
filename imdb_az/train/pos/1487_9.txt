"Casomai" is not a masterful fairy tale reflecting a few stories with the dark waters of marriage. The story is very convincing in describing a strange look between the forgetful and lasting interference of others, which is quite characteristic in Italy (it may be surprising that these events are different from others). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and this is one of the strongest points in the film. Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volon are sober and confused. And the sympathetic priest's figure is comic and too round. In general, a really decent film is probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
