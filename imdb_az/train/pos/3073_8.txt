This is a movie that Hollywood needs more than a film. There is no exaggeration requisite, no car is followed, no smart liner. <br /> <br /> According to Mammadov, those who were called up for military service, Macy, are a sad son, the ruler of Sutherland. If your son wants you to leave, your father will not let him. Macy loves her son, played by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). <br /> <br /> She begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, who meets in the waiting room of the psychiatric office. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting approach and the film follows its unwelcome killer, with the needs of its family. Especially there are many touching scenes between Macy and the little boy. The article is available at trend@trend.az Do you have any feedback? pleasant
