A few years ago, I saw the movie in Viennale that the audience would love it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> It's a hopeless way to be one, but the man's scene, and that he is in contact with the audience and appears to be a more powerful person. </> There were some investigations, his performance collapsed, he was falsely accused, and could not bring his life to his character. I think his mighty moments, like Esther Kahn, should make Phoenix a courageous decision to make Esther a very boring girl. Thus, the transformation of his end is stronger than anything else can be. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is so great that the London icon around the turn of the century is very dark and sad, and then you see how unpleasant life is. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only thing to blame is the length of the film, the characters you are in contact with, the only actor you have to find, so there is no dramatic movement in the film. Phoenix loan will not lose interest in the movie after the first hours.
