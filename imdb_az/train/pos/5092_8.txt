I thought King Solomon's mine was beautiful. My only job was Alison Doody. Her player was outstanding, but his makeup and hair were not timeless and always forced him to look at other actors. Patrick Swayze is a great choice for Alan Quatermain. It was a great choice and I liked every minute of this movie. The film follows the fairy-haired, fair skin, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, and others. We were sitting after some films. This version can not be compared with the 1950 edition of Stewart Grainger. It was a great screen movie and was not prepared for a TV movie. I thought both Quatermains were convincing, but you have to leave the two media. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, and I hope Patrick Swayze will look at these roles.
