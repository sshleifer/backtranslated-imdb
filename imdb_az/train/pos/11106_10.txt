Sopranos is probably the most-featured television series, so my expectations have passed through the roof, and the show has just passed them. I love the mafia and crime genre in the movie, and I love the wonderful stories in this world, but it's a lot more. The 86-hour-long story tells the story of a great family drama, a shocking character exploration, a laugh-loud comedy, a psychological examination of bright, good and bad nature, intellectual pursuit of the dreams and hallucinations of the representatives, as well as being one of the only exciting and unexpected mafia / movement stories. The epic series David Chase is trying to accomplish all this and more, and HBO cements such as the nearest TV can achieve kinematic excellence and will continue to irritate the audience by opening up to some other series. Realism is ready when necessary, but Chase's "sleep episodes" and so on. The only reason for leaving the decision to reinforce is to add more layers to the series. Chase, along with powerful writers, including Matthew Weiner and Terrence Winter, Mad Men and future creators of Boardwalk Empire, is becoming a complex, full-featured, universe-filled icon on the New Jersey TV. /> <br /> James Gandolfini runs the show as Tony, one of the most striking characters on television. Tony is committed to half of the pop culture's mobster stereotypes, but he is totally opposed to the other half and, during his family intervention and treatment, Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, there is an important chemistry that provides therapy scenes with him) <br /> <br /> Edie Falco hears the power of power </ strong> <br /> <br /> Edie Falco: Tony Soprano "Performance of Gandolfini as Tandy's wife, Carmela. Tony's lifestyle, suspicion of murders, mixed feelings about Tony's deception, his thoughts on disbelief, Carmela controls the emotions during the six seasons, and Falco is the ultimate tool for his non-mafia audience, and you have eyes of such a corrupt world. The scenes between Tony and Carmela provide some of the most heartwarming and painful real drama on television. <br /> <br /> Supported casting is almost extraordinary and with a large number of characters all six seasons, without any exception. Nancy Marchand stole Tony's digestive mom, Livia, Tony's personality problems and panic attacks as a show. Familiarity with Martand's continued complaints is almost terrifying, as he moves away as a believer. Michael Imperioli Christopher, Tony's protégé, led him down a path that would make it obscure, but brilliantly followed by the various weak choices. Drea De Matteo plays Christopher's girlfriend Adrian and is a good sense and love that she gets her dark armpit when she approaches Christopher's career. Toni Sirico Paulie is known as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a funny source, but eventually becomes one of the most sympathetic and sophisticated characters in the show, and nobody really plays the true rage. <br /> <br /> Persons known as Peter Bogdanovich, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingley, Lauren Bacall, Will Arnett, Nancy Sinatra, David Strathairn, Robert Patrick, Hal Holbrook, Burt Young. and Eric Mangini performs throughout the show, as Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi and Steven Van Zandt, have a regular role as the series's main characters. <br /> <br /> There are many people in the Caucasus who, for one reason or another, The series, which is fairly reasonable, almost surprises me with almost any episode. <br /> <br /> Sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series I've ever seen and his altitude is so conscious that I would call it my favorite show, despite the difficult lows (most dissatisfied). <br /> <br /> Whether you love or hate the latter or not, how important is it to do: Discussion is an achievement. The double nature of the whole series constitutes an important part of the history of television. Everyone has many elements to love and surprise in this show, so if you think of something else, make yourself a blessing and fuhgeddaboutit.
