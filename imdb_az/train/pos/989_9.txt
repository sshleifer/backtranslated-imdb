Both my friend and I thought this movie was good. We look forward to a light hearted comedy, but I got a motion film full of funny pressures. We also thought that this movie did not do a good job at the box office. Because he believed that this movie was a comedy. I was impressed by the supporting actors and, of course, Dave Morse always puts a great player. Most of the parties were not the first timers to win, and they were solid. We also felt that the first level of writing and direction and commenting on each other about buying this movie. If you do not rent for a good time.
