Another comedy about a small country of modern warriors who are struggling with the only intelligent mind in the global world and tearing them to rule them is a beautiful introduction to this Ealing ball. Terri-Tomas is a great romantic leader, as Ian Bannen, in a typical way, has led a disastrous ministerial man in the cause of a nation responsible for attracting interests in the world, Peter Sellers is a corrupt politician and suf-suave playing against John Le Mesurier as one of the most silent performers in the world as a powerful revolutionary leader. It was very entertaining, especially the audience; perhaps the highest level of Ealing classics is quite high.
