Inventive, persistent training in clustrofobia. A Japanese tension that defines itself as a difficult challenge is built entirely in two rooms. Not entirely successful, humble, surprising and good. Can someone find a movie that remembers SAW? Two people were stranded in the room by multiplying one another. but unlike the film, she dare to stay in her premiere and dare to keep the hero locked in the movie. It's like watching the laboratory experience. Some may find that the reserve is weak, but the person who looked at it was surprised. The sound and description of the film are striking. This is certainly a good movie to use to show a good home video system. Thank you for the late night film festival when it's in paranoid mood. That night kept me awake.
