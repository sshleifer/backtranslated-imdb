This movie, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is my favorite Pabst directing films and I liked the more popular movies Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX). It is likely that both are very similar to Neo-Realist films that have improved Italy in the 1940s and 50s. This kind of movie is about the French and German coal miners, as non-actors in the movie (daily typical people) are acting as players who act as players - not actors. As the beginning of the film, there is a major mine located on the French-German border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided on the border, and German workers will not welcome the French mining, even though there are more unemployment in Germany. This is a combination of language differences (beautifully illustrated on a dance scene scene) and the WWI is a major disadvantage between chapters - it results in ours and their mentality. An explosion later caused a great deal of debris in France and the Germans refused to sit back and do nothing. Those who endanger their lives prove that the miners generally have a real friendship with men. <br /> <br /> Film is a strong criticism of foreign hostility and inadequate war and hatred of the German audience in vain. One of the most terrifying and claustrophobic images I ever saw was a smiling film. Despite the historical background, the film's effect was at its best. WESTFRONT 1918, JAACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUITET (Milestone) for All, had great messages of peace and harmony, but ultimately failed to guide the public opinion. Thus, from the historical point of view, it is an incredible and sad story worth seeing.
