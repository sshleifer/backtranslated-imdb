How can I close my chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? <br /> <br /> I was not listening to Ned Kelly and was surprised to learn about this young man's legend. And I was surprised at how mediocre this film was. Perhaps it was hard to follow this story because it was too late, at the end of a four-hour movie marathon, or maybe a little slower. The story is not difficult, but because it's slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom could create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I have to recommend it, this is a wonderful story of Australian history (given how young country is, it is very rare and appreciated) and some sequence of good actions in the film. <br /> <br /> Look at the historical value of 6/10 .... (yeah right ... and the only reason to see it ...)))
