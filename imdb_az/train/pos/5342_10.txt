I was deeply involved in this film from many points of view. First of all, I would like to say that Clara Lago was the most valuable little thing! Such a pretty girl. His player was also outstanding. True and true to many people. Although I do not like the smoker; I hope this was just a fake propeller. In either case, it was absolutely beautiful and the story was very moving. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that I really came to discover this movie. I'm walking on Blockbuster and just started seeing the smile on my lap as I was walking. Fortunately, I looked at the bottom part of this movie! I thought to myself, "Do not be afraid, look at it!" So I chose it and saw that this movie was described as beautiful things like "A Little Gem." I read the sequence, and then I thought it would be good, maybe first I review it on the IMDb, then go back and then rent it. I'm very glad that I did not, because I lost it. After looking for a movie with my friend, I knew that I would regret to rent this movie, so I went back to where I found it and wiped it off for the first time. <br /> <br /> This week the school started for me, and I never gave it time to watch it, but this evening was a great opportunity. I left it and admired beautiful cinematography, tasteful, and clinging to the field from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a special note for this young man Juan Jose Ballesta in this movie. He drew attention. Also, the actor playing the name of Carol's father, unfortunately, did not appear on the site. Her voice was very fond of, and I could understand Carole's love. <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie. If you are a light, but romantic filmmaker, this is definitely one for you.
