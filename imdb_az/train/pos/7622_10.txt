I love this show! Every week as a mini movie watcher! The first episode was so closed and terrible ... because it was the second part of the pilot ... I will continue to regulate this show! This is a true Survivor! I looked at one of the other comments, and these morons I've seen right after suddenly two episodes are already a worm ... There's no other reality show, guys! Once upon a time ... now close yourself! Actual TV Shows! And this is really good from the majority of unhappy sitcoms or from a law and order or a hopeless carbon copy of the NYPD Blue or CSI series ... See yourself to create a boneheads here!
