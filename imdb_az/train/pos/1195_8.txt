I saw this movie about twenty years ago at the show. I still remember the film, especially Robert Taylor's performance. I always thought Taylor was regarded as an actor, because when critics saw him as a solid, almost adult-type man, women just liked watching his appearance. However, this movie proved to be an interesting player. During his long career, he did not achieve such a role. This is its best performance. He is convincing in a completely stubborn role. As I read, he was a very excited and easy-going man, and he did not fight enough for that role. He would do just what the MGM had given him. This film proves that it can manage distinct and difficult roles. Another thing I remember about this movie is that Lloyd Nolan's character is tedious. Nolan was a great player, but this character really made me worse. The final scene of the film has stuck in me for all these years. This movie is definitely a sight.
