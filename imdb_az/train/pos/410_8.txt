I bought this movie in DVD format without knowing a part of the winter marathon watching a movie every night. After several awesome American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Life of the Beat), Zhu Warriors struck me like a brilliant original cinematography. The story is full of ridiculers, but I found the film's sincerity, kindness and irony fresh, and the film looks spectacular. Certainly, special effects are not technically sound, as produced by Hollywood, but cinematographers are more interested in realism, color, composition and movement than foolishness, and most shootings are breathtaking. In one shot, two superhuman heroes stand in a perfectly balanced view of the three elements, rock clinging rocks, in a large month rising in front of them. In another case, a prince-warrior jumps across the sky behind the glowing sword as a heat-seeking rocket. <br /> <br /> Figures were shot from shooting and used to express emotions to reflect the reality. <br /> <br /> The heroes have the same simplicity and accuracy as the comic book characters, but they do not have a deep depth, but reference to the arithmetic causes deeper resonance. Physically, many actors are astoundingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Life's friends play their roles in a straightforward way or in a crooked way, and thus are convincing. <br /> <br /> Very striking, cunning and delicate character, with the beautiful simplicity of the players and the original, beautiful hearted vision of the director. <br /> <br />
