49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) There are pictures of 11-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) drawn to catch his own company on the bed in bed. Her health is gradually deteriorating as some of her mysterious "black materials" catch her. In each of these episodes, he builds an empty space with a boy who is only living with Marc (Elliot Spiers). When threatened with its idyllic "paperhouse" in a dark, unknown danger, Marc's life is threatened. <br /> <br /> Criticism: haunting the debut feature of British director Bernard Roseda. It was taken by Catherine Storr ("Marianne Dreams"), and then released more "original" fantasy works. While a story deals with dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to blend the astonishment and reality to operate it in the movie form. <br /> <br /> Children living in the Caucasus will follow each other. Most importantly, it is important to scare the audience without knowing that it will bring the next scene, and I will take the way to stop it and never run fast or avoid the next sequence of events. (as it does in POV shows) gives an additional dimension to cinematography, but rather the absence of the majority. <br /> <br /> Rose will watch this movie with Candyman (1992) only in this house, on the beds, in the coastal towns, the fearful fear of the true "thinking man" of the terrible gem and benevolence.
