This is a beautiful, rebuilding movie. Elizabeth Arngrim was the perfect choice of the actual villa inspired to write in the 1920s inspired casting novel! The quiet joy of this movie is not old again after the eyesight. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker, and Joan Plowright were born to play these parts! Pleased to see Enchanted April, which is broadcast in large format DVDs.
