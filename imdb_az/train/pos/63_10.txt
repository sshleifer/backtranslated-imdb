This movie is very misunderstood, not funny. Thinking of seeing this one for shooting. Stay pure. It deals with the effects and traumas that survivors need to be enduring. Even detectives are all looking for answers ... WHY? As you can see, we are philosophically influenced by two leading ladies, and we are influenced by the same things that we are affected by ignoring us. Yes, the language is sometimes tough, but that's a good thing. Some gaps have been missed or unanswered, but all are the same. The main issues are solved, and this movie gives a great statement about how our grown-ups feel after such great events. It is highly recommended for adolescents and adults.
