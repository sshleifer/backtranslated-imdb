Jon Voight is brilliant in the Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, although his next turn in Rainman, is a kind of performance that keeps me going. Just like a New York characteristic, the appearance of Bill Butcher in Daniel Day Lewis's New York networks only comes to mind, and does not give Hoffman Ratso his day-to-day emotional depth. <br /> <br /> Behavior that describes Hoffman's Midnight Cowboy as the most actor we describe is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the best 4 or 5 best players in the history of filming the people around him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think that's a strange movie like a movie that has a very good message, no matter how much you lose (Ratso clearly identifies "losers"), if you can find a way to fit your life, you have the secret of life, you can share. <br /> <br /> After a few years, I do not compare the Midnight Cowboy with Clute, and I think it's like a movie that's about to escape.
