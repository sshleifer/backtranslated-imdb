Another prominent foreign film, which totally recommends the unfinished product of the palm of Hollywood! This is a story of life and life. No, it's definitely not a perfect little life described entirely in artificial Hollywood movies, but rather complete with strong and weaknesses, just like real people in our lives and in our lives, with true symbols of real life. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all life that goes inside the baths, especially the old owner, are spectacular, heart-wrenching, and very thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> Sit back, relax and have a simple and beautiful life. <br /> <br /> If you only open yourself in this movie, there is really a wise wisdom. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
