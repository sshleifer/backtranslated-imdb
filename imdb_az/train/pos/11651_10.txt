When my friend kills me, in my opinion, is a very touching and dramatic drama about the consequences of anorexia or bulimia. Every time Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw, I wanted to vomit myself. Why it is difficult to explain. If you ask me, they must cooperate more about things. However, I enjoyed seeing things similar to each other and taking lessons from their parents. Before I finish it, I would say: "If you ask me, DOSTU KILLS shows how it can actually affect the corpse of anorexic or bulky person". Now, as a result, I did not see anyone in this movie. Some tears and you were in a good time, so you can watch it again on TV again with a friend.
