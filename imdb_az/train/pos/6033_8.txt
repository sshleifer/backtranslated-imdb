I just want to say that this is biased because I'm the producer of the movie. <br /> <br /> The star of the film, Oscar Ovies, gives you a perfect performance like a nebbish hypochondriac, Jeff Grinderlin, who spent more time than life. It really brings a touch of character to the audience, allowing the audience to communicate with him frequently and with a tough comedy. Christine Haber's mother is a constant support bar that will collapse with her. Her friends can give her hand in Jeff's life, often chooses her, does not allow her to use her free will. <br /> <br /> Writing is superb and conversations flow from scenes from Kevin Smith, with over half a Ben Affleck boo-hoo fests. <br /> <br /> Camera is somewhat shaded by some points, and the sound can also be used for a single push, but the outputs make the small details brighter. <br /> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> A rare stone among many stones.
