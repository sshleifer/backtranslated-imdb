"Footlight Parade" Warner Bros was only one of the few beautiful musical pieces produced in 1930 to eradicate Depression. The 42nd Street and the Golddiggers series have also taken over this period, and in fact, millions of Americans have forgotten their little concerns and loved them. <br /> <br /> Most of the films produced were Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell's great talents, the only Foolight Parade, unique James Cagney. About ten years ago, the most famous music, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here, dance performs the most original dance styles, with her hands flying around her legs with all kinds of fluctuations and strokes. <br /> <br /> Although almost all music tracks appear at the end of the movie, they are worth the wait. I believe that this movie was prepared before installation of the production code, so some suits and scenes are a bit of a threat. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <br /> <strong> Guy Kibbee </ strong> </ div> <div>
