This film is a must have classic. Not perfect, of course. Pacing is a slow-moving film form of a tortoise with an arthritic knee while perfect for the scene. Jean Seberg is misguided to be very sweet and very soft. She is a clever, passionate and trusty Joan, but unfortunately the director shows talent, skill, and mastery that are enough to overpower the character. George Bernard Shaw is my best playwright. In no other game, his dialogue was not sharp, or the lines became more musical. However, it requires you to consider this film as a working lawyer. This film is a situation and the audience is dominant. This is the enjoyment of the picture. 7/10.
