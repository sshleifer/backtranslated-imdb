"Going to Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy I've ever seen. Of course, this is a low-budget budget, but this is a non-stop comedy tour force. There are tons of basic notes. For example, after asking if she got boom in a short time, Candy says, "Oh, I'm going to get eleven thousand dollars for thirty years, sir." Of course, Candie sells the delivery. Only classic things. Eugene Levy is also a cheerful performance as a small filmmaker. <br /> <br /> So if I want to rediscover a candy fan and a forgotten stone, I can not offer enough of this movie.
