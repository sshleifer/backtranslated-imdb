<br /> <br /> Why? Because the bloody shake well. This show was unique for recurring stories when there were many other shows related to toys / games. As others have said, ahead of time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the show is condemned. So far, produced 4 DVDs with 16 series. I hope more. <br /> <br /> How does it compare with watching it 20 years after leaving for the first time? Sometimes, despite the animated animation, I still do not like it, and IMHO is just a flaw. The writing was almost top notch and was ahead of competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope you have more DVDs or even a whole set of episodes ... DVD is good, but stories are theirs but I did not believe that he was in the right order.
