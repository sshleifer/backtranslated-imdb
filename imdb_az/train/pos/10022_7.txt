Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people in a 70-year-old Guatemala mission. He also claimed that he had killed another 16 people (after killing pregnant women he fired them). <br /> <br /> This film is a portrait of Aro's identity. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious matter, analyst, that is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Such a horrible expression that some childhood traumas can make a person a monster. <br /> <br /> My degree is: 7/10
