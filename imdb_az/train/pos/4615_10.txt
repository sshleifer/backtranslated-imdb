I believe people appreciate this incredible movie. People see this as a typical horror movie that protects us from being scared and getting some sleep. After trying to do this, he would have earned a decent 1/10, but watched this movie with a few friends and we found it to be very fun, and though Stephanie beaton is a good film though. For this reason, I think the movie is worth 10/10 for pure entertainment. <br /> <br /> The overall picture of this film is that it can be old-fashioned for 10 years and can not be seriously considered, and therefore people are at a low level. But I see it as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece ... though it's a funny funny script that's more entertaining by the players, and although it's very entertaining though very serious.
