This is a documentary film for anyone who is afraid of the loss of the taste of modern youth's real life adventure and morality. Darius Goes West is an incredible roller coaster of a story. Darius and his crew live on a lifetime journey. Darius, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, is a disease that affects all muscles in the body. It is limited to a wheelchair and requires 24 hours a day to focus on it. So was this group of young friends able to take it back to the West Coast on a 6,000-mile journey and return? Watch the movie and enjoy the great adventure - laugh and laugh with the crew when facing astonishing problems along the way, and enjoy the ultimate victory after some three weeks in their towns and some great surprises!
