* some spoilers * I was pleasantly surprised to find that the harsh criticisms (activity, historical dialogue, unclear storyline) were groundless. Belafonte, which has to win wings but not really fitted out of its past life, is a great, heroic spirit of the Brandoesk. How hugging his hustling, how material late life is without losing love. Mostel is as big as an angry man with his dead wife, Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his suffering prevents him from adopting one (or a believer). <br /> <br /> These two social world characters alternately complement one another and the result is a joyful and touching sadness. <br /> <br /> Foolishness is entirely in line with the rest of the film. After looking at Belafonte everywhere, Mostel looks to see a falling feather, and finally reaches nicely as ready to believe in the angels and the miracle. But Belafonte did not allow his miracle (to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith), so he never found his wings. The storm is violently overwhelmed by Mostel's grip, as well as a metaphor of men's lively meticulousness: you have no chance of being late or second. Like "it's a beautiful life," this movie is magical, beautiful, funny, but terribly tragic.
