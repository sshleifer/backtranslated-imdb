After a while there were different types of films. These different films are somewhere else, though they are somewhat different ... <br /> <br /> This is obvious at first, but I would like to have this review because some people may have been forgotten. It's just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all this. It does not claim to be anything or anything. People who declare themselves as something promising do not see the entire picture exactly. For all of these, Hollywood movies are a sophisticated tool for people (Bodyguard or Preacher's Wife / Whitney Houston 2 examples) <br /> <br /> Firstly, film for Pavarotti. There are bad things in this world - bad movies. Reading fantastic and arias is entertaining. The film begins with Schubert's Ave Maria and Leoncavallo's Matinatta. Pav La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, while also quitting in San Francisco and singing for Oscar & Golden Globe, "If I were in love" <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > Built for Pavarotti, of course, this can not be applied deeply or universally to the audience. This is a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night on Opera night a few years ago. When asked to read again at the same place, "MET" in NYC loses scared voices. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah Italian :), played by Kathryn Harrold, gives him a shot to heal the psychosomatic reaction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Another woman. Despite all this, they are exposed to love (thus, "if we're in love") and with the help of her, she will overcome her fears and return to the successful MET. I will not be able to say how it ends, but it is very much anticipated. It's not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Speeches about this are not bad. Pavarotti (playing Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, but you are not a Pavarotti but a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance. He knows that he is not sudden. He is lovely, attractive and charismatic. It's not that bad, if you're entertaining and you're entertaining. A funny line is when Pamela (Harrold) says, "anhydrous plant, Fini can water you"! and, of course, he says: "I do not want to be watered by Fini!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a wonderful job as a semi-naked woman who learns a bit of life from this insane man. One of my favorite lines in the film: "Life never has a life dimension". And there is Eddie Albert, who works well as the manager of Fini. Real conductors, singers and so on. There are several "self" people on it and are placed at the Lincoln Center in the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> If you want, if Pavarotti wants, or if you just want to make yourself a little bump, then why use this movie? this is it. I know - all the time. :) <br />
