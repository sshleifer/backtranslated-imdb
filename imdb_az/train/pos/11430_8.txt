Unfortunately, because of the need to oblige US viewers to overlay the subtitles, this movie has not received the attention and interest it deserves. Copyright, identity, racial relations, and especially colonialism, are sensitive to all sides, open dramatic tensions, nostalgia memories of the protagonist's childhood, and the "household" of parents, probably only "real" people. We will not even consider his mother's relationship with this delicate person. There! Hopefully, if you accept it as French or subtitles, you've given enough hooks to take it. I call you to be brave, strong and aware as La P'tite.
