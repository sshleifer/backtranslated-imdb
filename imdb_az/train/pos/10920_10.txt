I remember seeing this movie as a kid. I do not remember the places I saw. I was 14 years old. I thought the movie was incredible and I would like to see it again. Once I came to the Kung Fu channel, but I ran away. I really bummed. The best private effect I've ever seen is Kung Fu movie! I strongly recommend it and now I have found out where to get it, so I can use it once and several years later. Someone also needs to check this Rule of the Venom movie, which he talks about.
