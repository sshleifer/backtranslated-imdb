I saw this movie in a special cinema in Nuremberg yesterday, and it was beautiful. I have to admit that the cello player and the original musical composition of the percussion / xylophone player affected the film's mood, but the film itself had the power to describe the tragic Nibelungen epic. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in silent movies or Nibelungenlied, I love this movie. The costume was fantastic and creative, the bands were rich and exotic, and the actor was dramatic and breathtaking (just like the typical "tragedies" of the silent film) Unfortunately, I did not see that this movie was linked to Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfrid's death. Kremhild (Norwegian version of Hudrun newspaper) is planning to revenge on his brothers. <br /> Also, I watched this movie in Germany; I speak native English and have basic German knowledge. Subtitles of old-style German writing (what do you say in these silent films?) It was difficult to read, so I advise you to look in German, "k", "f" and "s". :)
