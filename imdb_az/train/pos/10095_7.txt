When I was 9, my parents took me to this movie. I have never forgotten it. I have never seen anything wonderful like Elizabeth Taylor. (It was Twenty-two when correcting Elephant Walk). Remember, I'm the ninth, I do not see anything else on the screen, not the feelings. I just wanted to sit on his feet and look at him as a puppy. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Started to show his age. That's because it's a pleasing melodrama. Of course, Miss Taylor's beauty, magnificent d√©cor, very effective elephant definition, and a prime array of humanity in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> Generally, a well is a few hours watching a movie channel or rental video.
