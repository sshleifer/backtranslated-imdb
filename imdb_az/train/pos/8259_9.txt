At the Toronto Film Festival, you will be taken out of the deadline for your final curse. Clearly, Fido was selected for the US division. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Did you ever see the Shadow of the Dead? Well, good. How about Lassie? Can you please both? Your name, Andrew Currie, can be the Canadian helmer, the zombie comedy for the first time, or the zombie. (Cidden, this was not a press-book in Toronto.) The dead are loyal to the roots of Fido, though not as severe, dry, or English as Shaun: both Lassie and Lassie Fido's talented heads ( Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker and Tim Blake Nelson). The film explores all the effects of its warranty: the zombies were born because of a huge number of fatalities. Why did you use your new conscious servant? A butler? Handmade? A pet? Incorrect actions? Fido's all these capabilities are sweet and surprisingly resolved in a classic way, with Connelly (as one of the zombie singers) and young television actor K'Sun Ray, sometimes younger Elijah Wood, a young Elijah Tree. <br /> <br /> If you wait for another Shaun of the dead, do not waste your time. Unfortunately, it is not strangely enough and you are cleaned up in the genre to provide you, and you will only leave the theater a bitter and depressed. But when you jump over the lake, you want to see what happens to the Saints of the Dead, you are in a cure. Imagine Fido as Shaun'a sensitive, more often beaten younger brother, who was dying of Disney, and begin to slide. If you like (or at least tolerate) zombies, small children and deadly satiric loads, Fido is the movie for you. If this is not the case, you know well. Only shot a square between the eyes.
