All Dogs Go to hell, slavery is a crime scene. The film is a delight for children who have a comic and full-fledged, happy ending story with plenty of songs and dances. Charlie, who was murdered, but charged with murdering a slavery returning from the dead. He welcomes a homeless man who is looking at her and, on this occasion, understands the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation that is very popular in my eyes as a kid. I would recommend this movie to children very much. I'm sure the adults will react to this. (I tried to look at the VHS several years ago, but these notes do not last long, but are they?)
