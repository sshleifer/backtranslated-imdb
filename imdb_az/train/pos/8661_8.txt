I have long used the Law and Order Prison Purposes series. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the female detective seems rather harsh and appears to have a bit of pain in the Criminal Intentions Group. See the other side in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the fresh side of these talented actresses and if you are an admirer of the Nation, it is a fun of his actor and a very good darn. <br /> <br /> Albert Finneys did not like his role in this film. Because it was such a tough job of the South South, that it is difficult and unchangeable to others. <br /> <br /> <strong> Why do you love Kathryn Erbe's love for this movie and why? Penalty intention, law and order as 10 stars for fans.
