A great idea: 11th September 11th story. 11 directors with different results than different countries. Ken Loach talks about an immigrant (ordinary) just brilliant (as usual). The Burkina Faso film is a wonderful surprise, while French is a very good job. However, the Israeli film was a bit boring and the Mexican man should go and work well in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
