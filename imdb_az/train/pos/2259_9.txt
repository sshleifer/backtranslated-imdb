I purchased this store from my rental in our local store. It was almost mint, and I had never heard of it before. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in my luck. Through all the parts of the party, a tough message - the very moral and non-rich position of Mandela's party, undoubtedly, seeks to gain advantage. Despite its magnificent length (I had to watch it in two sessions), it was like a book that could not write a book. Probably these songs are not unforgettable, but the soul of the thing shines forever. I do not understand the interpretation of a music (for the scene) is not real! I've seen the "South Pacific" and read a book, and I can ensure that the music is not realistic compared to the book. I'll earn as much as I find small. One day they will do it on a better budget. <br /> <br />
