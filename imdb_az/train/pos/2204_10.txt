I think the movie is strange. At the opening stage, a person is killed for no reason. He is not mentioned again. Special effects could have been good, but I enjoyed watching an old horror movie. This is not the best example of a classic horror film, but it's still a good movie. I'll give it from 10 to 5 on the scale.
