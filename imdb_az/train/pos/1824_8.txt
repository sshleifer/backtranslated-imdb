All Dogs are a movie that I always love to go to Hell. Every day I was watching when I was a kid. If you look at the ratings of IMDb and the comments of many people in general, it's no less. This is not a very bad movie, it's a very good movie. That's good, and your kids probably love it. Although some of G's assessed, some parents may consider it a little bit of violence. This is actually a dark story, similar to gambling, extortion, and even mobsters dealing with a cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog called Charlie, who escapes from the pound, killed by an old friend, and goes back to the ground. Many young children watching this movie can feel as they watch a great baby movie. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that can scare small children, but I'm sure they'll do a good job. Every time I was watching this movie, I was a little kid. I'm convinced that everybody has a movie that reminds them when they're young, and that's what makes me feel that way. Outbreaks from Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the latest movie by a young girl called Judith Barsi. Unfortunately, he had very little potential, thank you. Now that I know his story, I can not watch this movie the same way as it is so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation is great in this movie, the sound is great and the story is good, but it is slightly different from many other children's films. It was popular when it was released, but was shattered by Disney's mega popular The Little Mermaid. It's an adult movie, but if you are a kid or you've grown up as a child with this movie, I'm sure you will enjoy watching it.
