First of all, it is very difficult to know what's happening while watching this movie, but it will become clearer later on. I am very pleased with this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in Bob's role. The character of Lexa Doig was mixed up to understand, but first he knew that Bob was trapped, but when he broke his heart, I believed he fell in love. Dean Ca's performance was a great one. It is better with every movie. At the end of the film, my question was what happened to Bob, Camilla and baby. The viewer left to decide
