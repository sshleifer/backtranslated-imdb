This anime shook my socks very seriously. As anime first opened up, I felt very slow; The story did not move forward, and Siru was a very striking man. Learn more about tracking, learn more about Saber and the Strange War, the story goes out and you can see many aspects of your action. It was fantastic. <br /> In addition, I felt that the way of developing the characters is very real to develop through the development of a real human being. There was nothing foolish to compromise; It was interesting to watch the development of Elijah and Ryan, but I think that Siru and Saber were interested in watching all of them grow up in some of their identities. The "surprise" is a part of the people (Gilgamesh?) At the same time, instead of "General Bad-ass A" "Generic Bad-ass A" I hope that I love music. The opening music was played and the last episode was the last one ... The episode of the last episode was even more serious. Good job, Tip-MOON!
