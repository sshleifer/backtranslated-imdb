I like this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an amazing job describing Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding in secret with her young son. As a romantic loving anglophile ... This movie was just a river tea and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to run for England in the 1800s for a few hours. And I have to point out that Toby Stephens, who describes many magnetic Gilbert Markham, is enough to watch this amazing product.
