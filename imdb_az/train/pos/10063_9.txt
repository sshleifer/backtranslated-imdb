Filming is pleasant and the environment is quite realistic. I firmly resolved the very difficult moral and social morale of the Chinese lands in the 1930s, as well as their views on major human issues. In fact, I felt that traditional Chinese people were even rebuilding. theatrical and street-life purist expressions. It was necessary to be experienced. The role Buddhism plays is probably the most realistic form - both of which are the most effective I've ever seen in a Chinese movie, from a ghost and philosophical point of view. Casting is great. Pictures are memorable. The player is strong enough. Sufficient in nature, but enough to praise the expression tool.
