<br /> <br /> "After darkness, my sweetness" is a strange mixture of compassion and darkness. The film works slowly, very slowly, but takes a rhythm to explain a story about killing and passion. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension, cat heat, traces of the past ... Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (man gives a real performance) and Rachel Ward is all sexy. <br /> <br /> Flashback scenes, the strangeness of Patrick's Character, all become a sexual mystery. That's why I think it's a more sexually explicit movie I've ever seen. Check out the scene of love, especially sexual.
