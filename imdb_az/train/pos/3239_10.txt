Why do not I love the offense of unsafe health? Why am I laughing or laughing when I think of ten or more scenes from this movie? It is very difficult to explain, but I will give it a try. First, it's really ridiculous - mostly you want to believe most of the "official" comments. But still it depends entirely on your sense of humor, so there is no point in the debate. Frequently, humor is often the case of comedy. For example, there's a very funny scene where four gang members are given a lift on the back of the truck. When the farmer leaves them, they just stand on the road, covered with cows or anything. They were totally uncomfortable; performing the humor of the scene, laughing at each other, and laughing at Ruben Blades (like Carlos), terrifying (although odorless), at least his breath, I'm giggling again when explaining the scene!). What is the second point? Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, Ruben Blades and Corbin Bernsen (of course, the latter are sometimes exhausted) play well and play beautifully - in fact, they themselves love the film themselves. Third, there is a plot. Jim Kouf, director and screenwriter, was shot very often; take time to open the sequence and set up individual characters themselves. Often often, there are no real moves, and while still trying to rob four of these four people - their boss (Bernstein), they are respectful and respectful of each other. The film is a fantastic parody of a typical bank robbery - it's totally impossible with all the advancements and coincidences, but it's still quite convincing in its love for ironic details. Incidentally, the title of the movie is the best I've ever encountered because it summarizes the plot in a very astonishing manner. So advise me: watch this movie, but do not giggle, scream or smile during the first 10 minutes, remember - it's not the kind of movie. PS. The only negative thing about this film is that there is no way to keep the scenarios - tell me if you know it.
