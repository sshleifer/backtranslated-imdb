I'm a great Woody Allen admirer, and when he saw that he was playing cinema, he could not help me. I would like to see Allen's spectacular film. Because it has become one of G.B.'s films. (Which is unique among Allen's works) appears to be the new author, Scarlett Johanson. Scoop MP is lightweight and humorous Scoop's most unpleasant aspect. The area is surrounded by Johanson (journalist student) and looks like a hot story on the edge of the grave. He must fall in love with the suspect serial killer (Jackman) and make a worthwhile decision he must find the truth. <br /> <br /> There is no problem to fight poverty. <br /> <br /> For this reason, Johanson's film is in no position and firm. Allen's plays a ditsy, funny, bumbling sweetheart, a type of change that resembles a stereotypic neurosis disorder. Adds body language for fun effect. <br /> Alen Allen. It still has the same character as Chaplin and its small tramp character. What's happening in this film is of interest to me to see the neurotic small hypochondrias again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < strong> <br /> <br /> I have not commented on this issue either. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Jade resembles the Scorpion curse. Johanson and Allen are more detective than anything else. But I have to end Allen because it's a bit more clever than the typical Hollywood version of the movie. Black and white are all painted in gray instead of everything else. Being completely innocent has nothing to do with it and it is a guilty one. Despite the area's old look, Woody still has a skill for a liners. <br /> <br /> I found interesting ideas about the latest film talk ... Come to the Prophet, laugh and be cheerful. <br /> <br /> It does not need to say that he liked the job of Allen. If there is nothing else ...
