I have never watched the 'Hero of the Hero Hero' show and did not know that this film was a 'prize' from this competition until I read the other comments here. <br /> <br /> Yes, this area (the most dangerous game, etc.), but I'm watching myself, I dreaded with excitement and found the courage to the end. and hoped to finally "getcha" - the heroine was eventually going to beat the hunter. <br /> <br /> I think it was a high-tech GPS, and I was given a cold night strike by the driver, but it's not much. <br /> The main problem with this movie is the SOD required from the viewer (postpone the kufr). Does a person really flying in a helicopter think that he can get a huge number of accidents on a public bridge and investigate NO COPS? Can a limousine countless donuts at a Las Vegas intersection and show NO COPS? Pleeease. <br /> <br /> The last solution was good, but the last one was disappointing and then tasty. Bad Star Trek episode. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I understand how much the player is - just like Zein, IMHO does not work as much as it deserves - they have overcome the reality show.
