Apart from Airplanes, Trailers, and Automobiles and Uncle Buck, this is the funniest movie of John Candiang. When he is hypnotized with the game card (like a Manchurian Candidate) and becomes a naive person who does not know what to say, he makes two very memorable quotes (he also deals with male anatomy). <br /> <br /> The lover scene, which deals with some items, should not be described. <br /> <br />
