For a long time since I was an admirer of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creativity, I did not have much hope for the DVD; I'm really looking forward to hating to manage it remotely within fifteen minutes. Instead, I was delighted with this production and particularly appreciated and appreciated the ability of producer and director to explain Blaise's story. That's why, he did not escape the trap of creating a bad (movie) version of the books we know very well, just choosing to pay attention to Modesty's life in novels. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For production values ​​(and I'm not a filmmaker): Yes, the movie is shot with a tough financial and time budget, and maybe it shows ... I do not think in this case. Instead, we get to know one of the greatest literary heroes in the world and enjoy its capabilities. <br /> <br /> In connection with casting: we are the evolution of people who are only important in the unfamiliar area, and (possibly) Professor Lob. They were completely safe for me. Alexandra Staden has shown the character and coolness of modesty, described by some as a wooden and very delicate actor; <br /> <br /> Generally, we know that this film is produced for a claim alleged by Miramax. Modesty Blaise's character is quick and inexpensive, but ... I will not wait to see the next generation of this series of manufacturers as long as they do not follow the basic values ​​and characteristics of real stories!
