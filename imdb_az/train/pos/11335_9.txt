Jake's Closet has emotional power along with Kramer-Kramer's Pan's Maze. The original effect of the star is similar to the Pan's Labyrinth. But this is a story that is happening in the modern era, not sixty years ago, and today it is even more resonating. Jake's Closet is about a kid, a child, almost alone with the summer vacation, engaging with the family. This is a fright film, "The Others" and "The Sixth Sense." If you're looking for a slasher movie, this will not be your tea, but if you're looking for a story that's touched by a good motion and it's a suspense, this is a movie for you. I saw that there was a moment when the whole audience was shouting. I strongly recommend to know this film closely.
