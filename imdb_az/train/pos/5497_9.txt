A piece of memorable documentary that combines a living image of a country (for more evidence, consider some comments on IMDb!). Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (Fidel Castro's nose) is very predominant. I do not know whether Chavez is a self-proclaimed or populist Latin-American "caudillos". I do not know if Venezuelans can do great good things for the vast majority of poor Venezuelans. It's hard to expect such a movie to be able to respond to such a film, but now there is no doubt what is happening and what a good idea it is to keep in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the film "We are building history" and it feels like the film is shot. Notable things.
