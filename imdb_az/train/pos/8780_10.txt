This is one of Hollywood's biggest sports movies. What a beautiful story about one of the greatest sports figures in American history. The story of James Corbett is particularly intriguing, with Mr. Corbettin presenting the ongoing boxing style. James J. Corbett has really been updated in this regard. But after returning to the film, all appearances were perfect. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed, she seemed to be Nicole Kidman. Despite a period of time, the story is subject to time-test; it's outdated. Ward Bond's description of John L. Sullivan is one of the great illustrations of an actual sports player in film history and the realistic, staged and very effective boxing scenes. This movie, combined with a great script, is absolutely necessary.
