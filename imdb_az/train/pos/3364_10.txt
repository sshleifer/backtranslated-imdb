<br /> <br /> I'm very glad to see how many people voted in this movie, and my articles are exactly what's been written. movie A superb move between Mastroianni and Loren. As the story tells: Humanity and love are slowly developing between these two edges, and the fascist radio speaker (the Mastroianni counterpart) at the same time and continuing ongoing human-to-human travel and "coming from the show." A very nice movie about what this person is to me. Perhaps some will claim that the "anti-fascist" message has been conveyed very accurately, but that did not destroy the film for me in any way. My vote is 10/10.
