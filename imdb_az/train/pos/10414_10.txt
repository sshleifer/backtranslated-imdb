For the first time in the 1950s, I discovered that Alexander Korda's (1940) Fantasy was looking at the BAGDAD's "The Century of Wonder Show". Both Cork Technicolor, BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK DATA were featured in a never-ending program. Miklos Rozza's music reinforced both films. Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! BAGDAD DEFENSE remained the best fantasy film on my list. Over the years, it has become even more difficult to use the film's original color. True Technicolor allowed the Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both Cinema and Samuel Goldwyn reissued both in the theater and in the video. But Eastman's color pressures were far more pastel in nature and silenced the vigor of the original Technicolor. The release of this title Laser Disc also has a pastel appearance - nice, but not as it does. NOW comes from the M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). BAGDAD'S EXHAUST has a more beautiful Technicolor look, which is linked to a DVD, nothing stunning! It was very interesting to watch such a thing since looking at the DVD for the second time after looking at it once. Only "Extras" are a Spanish dubbed version, English and Spanish subtitles, and a beautifully-designed original theater novel. Thank you M-G-M for the freedom of this EXCEPTIONAL DVD. Now it will only approach the DVD of Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and the revised version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace the poor public domain in circulation).
