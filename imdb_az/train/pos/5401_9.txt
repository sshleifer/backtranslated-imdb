It was an indication of Gosha's incredible filmmaking that he completed Hitocchie and his stunning work, Goyokin, in 1969. Sintaro Katsu - Okada Izo: Catherine, a faithful and disobedient obedient to the tribe of Tosha, played by Tatsuya Nakadai, the protagonist of another genre, as well as for the general public as a criminal offense made by Takechi. The tribe of Tosha was an integral part of a great alliance that supported the emperor Shogunat. The history is justified - with the increasing political turmoil of Japanese imperialists and Tokugawa and the West's 300 years of social and political ends. It helps to know something or two about Japanese history and eventually led to the resumption of Meiji and the cancellation of Tokugawa Shogunate, but in no way it is important. <br /> <br /> The film was originally designed for a Japanese audience, so certain things were accepted, but it also runs well for uninitiated. <br /> <br /> From the Hidayat Gosha movie in the late 1960's, the visual palette is hidden behind the pictorial beauty, using breathtaking, exterior and interior symbolism. Style is not decorative for Gosha, but is always used in the story service. <br /> <br /> Hikokiri, speaking of wisdom, is dominated by Iso Okada, the tortured main character. As a hero of many trumpets, Iso connects himself to one another, breaking down between the entrails and the ninj (natural impulse). In the first half of the film Iso tries to develop a social self. An aristocratic daughter, public rank and extreme desires of marriage - is a major advancement to one of the roots of a farmer in the 19th century Japan's harsh public caste system. <br /> <br /> Understand how ISO's turning point is self-evolving, loss of identity, and ultimately self-defeating. At this point, he has passed through the famous Swords of Tosha Clan, and without the future, the "unknown" drifter is exposed to the very symbolic transformation of Torazo Vagrant. Yojimbo is technically unusual in his mold and is a genre drifter, though his previous self-acclaim and ego, passion and self-dillusionation, that Izo really can see things like and let himself back. <br /> <br /> Hitocrates ends (here I will not disclose), any story can end: positive and negative, Iso's last protagonist, death.
