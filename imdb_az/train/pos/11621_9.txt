<br /> <br /> The Red Eye is one of the best films for a long time. <br /> <br /> I almost like the film, Rachel Mcadams, has two great potentials in the film, like Lisa Reisert and Cillian. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> If you like the Red Eye, I come to the Electra and the Rag Voyage. <br /> <br /> I'll give you the 10th Red Eye 9. <br /> <br /> Great movie
