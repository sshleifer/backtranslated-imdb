We found him at one of the local cinemas located in Montrose, TX. It was a surprise, compared to the article in the theater's bulletin, but both were blown up by art. In Munich there was a beautifully shaped and (visible) schloss (German name ch√¢teau). An isolated group of daily restrictions is a very open investigation of 20-year-old men and women's sexual relationships. The more levels I can remember are fantastic. <br /> <br /> The version we were in was in English (at least), at least two versions because the first reviewer (probably the original) German version. I called the video tape and looked for it, but nothing ever happened. I absolutely love this VHS or DVD version. It explores connections at a basic level and is a great training for how you can get in touch with your partner. If everyone knows the writer / director, leave it, probably leave it in DVD these days. Perhaps I can not imagine getting tired of watching the genuine performance of the actors in their 40s. Please, please bring it back.
