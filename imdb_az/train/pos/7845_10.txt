So the Fox circulation drove through a drama / mystery ... <br /> How old is that old man? Do they expect us to spend time in new shows when there is a real risk to not know what's happening? Why did the US episodes remain episode? <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Listen? It was a great show, but it hanged us. If I will introduce new drama / secrets, give at least a conclusion before the end of the average theme. Every time something like this happens (and there may be many things to do with you - Fox), who want to "wait and see" before spending their time. This is artificially low interest rate and is likely to end the series. See it? A short period. Do not let us down again ...
