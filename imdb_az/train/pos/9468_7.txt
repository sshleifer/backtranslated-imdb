I've had a special scan selection today. I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I have not given any realities. <br /> <br /> A widow's story with her three daughters, who are going to spend the weekend with Dan's family. <br /> <br /> This film is pretty well-prepared - noise, kinematography and driving. Top notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem was mainly Dane Cook's character, which seemed to have no character development. Even though immediately with Dane and Steve's relationships, I felt that Dane Dane could do some little to show what the internal conflict of her love for her girlfriend was. In addition, Dan Real Life is an absolutely solid, sweet movie - an absolutely wonderful break from all the horror and action films we have this year.
