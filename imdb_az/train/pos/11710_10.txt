Before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, MARK IV Pictures, a Christian film distribution company of Billy Graham Evangelical Association with LEFT BEHIND books, gave us this masterwork of shaving the world of Christian subculture (and millions in the process). What I love most about this genre, sitting in the living room, gives incredible attention to detail. Instead of taking us to dramatic scenes of "post-surprise", when we sit in the living room and hear about it, filmmakers are unable to show it. The film is based on Christ's pre-Tribulation eschatalogy, believing that Christ once came to get the true church secret and then comes back at the end of seven years of paradise on earth. Now those who are used to scaring me at a young age make me laugh. Patty's exciting adventures and his travels along with his anger (and three more continuation of the two films) tell him a good story about not believing and eventually a curse. I hate to admit it, but I'm still watching it. It also has an EXACT account directly from Monty Python and Holy Calbwell. I think the only person in history.
