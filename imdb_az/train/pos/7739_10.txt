Have you ever read Jim Thompson? He is the hardest cooked peas with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. In his case there are rarely special detectives - only victims, psychologists and small-time artists. This film has succeeded Thompson - "If God made any mistake in this world, it would be a challenge to live when we did not give any excuse." Each character in the film remains on the edge of a razor between a surreal and creepy realism. Doc Goldman, played by Bruce Dern and having a good rabbit, has an uncle, Bud's cousin, as if by George Dickerson. Jason Patric delivers beautiful, often heart-shaped performance, like many bright, shady old fighter Kid Collins, who is more afraid than anyone else. Rachel Ward Fay is not a sexy femme fatale, we can not quite understand ... This is not a copy of your standard movies, nor is it meant. Along with My Sweet Grifters, one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson, is the perfect two adaptation of novels.
