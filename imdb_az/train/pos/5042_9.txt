The publication for this film does a great job to explain what's expected. This is a very good tension. Well shot. Although it is difficult to believe that Bill Pakston is a director debut, some shots will appear exactly as a story version. <br /> <br /> There are still a few pictures that really look good and real imagination by Paxton. <br /> <br /> Finally, some great twists, some, all convincing, all-encompassing and well-lit stories have been hiding enough to twist them. <br /> <br /> Children's actors are doing great things in the film. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Generally, I'm afraid of movies with children playing a common role. Because Nickelodeon is often dismissed as rejected. But these guys do well. <br /> <br /> This movie is not rough. Not too scary. But it is very, very creepy.
