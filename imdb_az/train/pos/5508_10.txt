1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, has been a Cuban citizen over the last five years, has disappeared from the Earth, and Fidel Castro is really dead, and is supposed to live in Cuban, a supposed identity to Bolivia. While living in La Paz, Guevara is there to deal with corruption, the overthrow of the bourgeois government. Once again, Steven Soderberg comes out of "Che: Part One" (just this time). Pacing is more than a target, and the player's job is not good (in turn of Benecio Del Toro, who looks sick like Che Guevara). It would be best if you saw almost all Guevara's true story and the two movies to see what that person was (it's a rare outdoor window to see both films in a movie on a long way!). Like 'Che-Part 1: Argentina', this movie does not have a MPAA rating, but it's easy enough for a 'R' to contain enough salty language and violence.
