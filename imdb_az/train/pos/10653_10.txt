I know it's fashion now to hate this movie. In 1963, I have seen hundreds of spooky films covering the majority of Haunting and Hammer movies. This film is not restricted and, nevertheless, contrary to many modern viewers. However, many viewers can take control movies like Scream because knife kills are more convincing than many people, either from the devil or the ghosts. In fact, there were many great scenes in this movie, and the actor and the special effects were great. Now I've seen 15 times and heals every time. The director of this film has created a number of interesting and transparent films, and in the sixth sense, he worked for realism. Haunting allows you to go and is not, of course, boring. Probably this movie can appeal to John Carpenter fans, but more than a traditional plot. Old Haunting was also a beautiful movie since 1963. It was even more scary. See both Pamela Franklin and the legend of Innocents and Hell House.
