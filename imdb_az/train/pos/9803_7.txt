It's pretty cool, like Batman movie, Phantasm and Batman Batman Mask and Mr. Freeze subzero. But Batman is a good payout movie. This movie is good for the same reasons. The studio is not as good as the other, but still pretty good. These cartoon effects are very good. The sound of actors is really as good as Batman as Kevin Conroy / Bruce Wayne, Barbra Gordon as Tara Strong, Efrem Zimbalist Jr, Robin as Eli Marienthal. His friends are as good as Kyra Sedgwick as Batra, David Ogden Stiers like The Pequin, and Hector Elizondo as Bane. That's why I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the Batman Secret. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies, there's some part of artistic literature. * ***** out *** <br />
