Penny Princess finds his American businesswoman Yolande Donlon, a legacy of a small kingdom in France, Italy, and Switzerland's triangle called Lampidorra. Lampidorrans owes debts in all Europe and the country's main occupation appears to be smuggling through its geography. Many Americans are replaced by a millionaire but die before they can get their title. <br /> <br /> Of course, what property should be tested in America and what should Lampidorrans do? <br /> <br /> Now Donlan, a princess, has banned smuggling. <br /> <br /> Insert Dirk Bogarde into Switzerland to learn about the piercing industry. Undoubtedly, Lampidorrans seems to be a kind of cheese that they refer to as sweetness as Schmeeze. Shmelde, with Donald and Bogarde, solves both financial, geopolitical and romantic problems with a few blows on the road. <br /> <br /> How does Schmeeze work, well, that's all gimmick for the movie. But here's a sign. <br /> <br /> In the past, Jack Crosten could have been able to keep Schmeeze's secret when he was busy creating Rock for Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Penny Princess, a romantic comedy of the English Pharaoh. Although Yolande Donlon is on the other side of the pool, Marilyn has played a role in releasing Monroe. Dirk Bogarde played a good role in the career of a romantic heartache at the beginning of his career, but everyone was acting in front of him. <br /> <br /> This movie was just released. In the morning at TCM at three o'clock. But at least I found my gratitude for insomnia.
