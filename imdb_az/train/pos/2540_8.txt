While other collaborations (such as BLACK CAT and BODY SNATCHER) are not as popular, although casting decisions are a bit strange, this is a bit of a terrible horror. Boris Karloff plays Janos Rux, a strange scientist living in the Carpathian Mountains, near the home of Drakula's home town. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - whose name is French, even though his citizenship has never been discussed. As I really seem to have made Carpathian role specifically for Lugosi, it would be logical to have two roles, especially with his emphasis. However, despite this extraordinary twist, both had done excellent things. It was Karloff's absolute leadership role, but Lugosi recovered himself as a relative of a normal person - something he has never played in movies! As other scientists (especially Benet) think of his theories as strange and unusual, Dr. Rukh is a pariah. During the course of the film, the Spirit goes right and is particularly generous to Benet Rux for a new definition. But, unfortunately, Rukh's amazing new element has the wrong effect of turning it into a bare murder machine (do not hate it from the beginning). <br /> <br /> It turned out to be a mad scientist who just turned out to be a beautiful, well-built, beautifully-developed characters and brilliant Rukh is a dimensional killer, not complex and exciting. <br /> <br /> The film will be loved by all, except those who hate old fears movies. Indeed, Universal Pictures pulled out all stops and, unfortunately, made a bigger budgetary film instead of the cheap theses of Lugosi and Carloff in subsequent years. Good things.
