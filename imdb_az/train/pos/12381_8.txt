A young woman, who is a successful model and is engaged in marriage and twice suicide in the past, is chosen to be the next "father" to the Hell by the clandestine and remote combination of Catholic priests, seems to be a creepy old but well-kept Brooklyn apartment passes through the building. Tenants throw stairs and revive themselves, but surely it is impossible to avoid as far as the road is concerned. The former (John Carradine) is dead, he or she is destined for the fate or everything, and the prisoners need to kill themselves to be free to themselves. Very interesting details, under the surface, the connection with his father, the stories of the prisoner, his fianc√©e, because it can be a horrible horror, but given the set, big cast and general strange, this is definitely worth seeing.
