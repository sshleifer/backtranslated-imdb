Based on the recommendations of this site, I decided to follow this. I have to say that efforts are worth it. However, we should pay attention that this film will last 210 minutes. <br /> <br /> Now, the movie, what I say will be a "spoiler" if not or <br /> <br /> Iskander is a bunch of boar, a woman and a gigolo. He lives with an old woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and provides for Alex. Alex spent the days in cafes and restaurants. The story shows that Gilbertei, who had lived earlier, Gilberte threw him to a less attractive person, because Alex did not like him and beat him. At this point, Alex helped him find a job and raise his child before he learned that Gilberte had canceled her and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By chance, a nurse called Alexander Veronica, and they have a relationship. Veronica fell in love with Alex for the first time after all sex with men in the past. Marie and Veronica are fighting for Alex's love and have been fighting for years. Eventually, at the end, Veronica asked for her pregnancy with Alex and Alex wanted her to marry her. I think that, in connection with the situation with Gilberte, Alexandre will come out and serve newly found love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> La Maman et la putain, Jean Eustache, was related to the character of Veronica François Lebroux. She was a prostitute and then became a mother. So, the mother and the prostitute are the same person? Anyway, I know what to do! The French films are full of many (not many) conversations, full of political, propagandistic, theatrical, strange, curse and pricey. Lebrun and Léud were well-disposed to the movies because they lost some of their films and left some of them. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. 7/10.
