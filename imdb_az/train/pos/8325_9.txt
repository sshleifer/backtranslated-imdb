I liked this idea since I first saw this movie for me. Einstein was always one of my heroes, and I came to see his picture with a good, fun, and a bit horrible genius. <br /> <br /> Matthau as Einstein did extra spices better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy but pleasant. An auto mechanic is in love with a beautiful woman, the only member of Einstein. Ed, with the help of four Fairy Godfathers, begins a study to win Catherine's heart. <br /> <br /> The film is full of great actors and gorgeous sweet and terrible speeches. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as an ungrateful emperor; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins Ed and Meg Ryan play as a step above the normal rom-com level. Steven Fries is the joy of being "RRRatman" and Ryan's fianc√©e; <br /> <br /> The film is a treasure that has fallen under the radar, but with no repetition. It offers the first degree of writing and speeches and is a subtle treatment in a subtle world.
