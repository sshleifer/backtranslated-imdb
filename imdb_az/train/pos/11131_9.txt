I was on the list of Oscars and I was surprised to see Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for the best picture of this movie in 1969. But after seeing, I'm not surprised. <br /> <br /> <strong> Joe Buck was the pre-timeline for his style, cinematography and entertainment to enhance his character. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing for me is Joe Buck's short film. I think Voight is angry and angry-angry. Indeed, the two scenes we held were taken at that theater and when the old man did not want it. If we take into consideration that when he was looking at the mirror, he had really done it or wanted to do something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think Hoffman is a brilliant decision to accept this role. . Otherwise, he may be typecast after graduating. Anyway, this is always a big deal for one reason.
