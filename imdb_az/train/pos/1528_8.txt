I'm a home-based writer and Diagnosis Murder is my lunchtime partner - a good, clean entertainment, good humor and nostalgia for Dick van Dyke show days. How we all are sinful (and how the murder of the innocent Diagnosis). I loved episodes with other nostalgic figures like Joe Mannix. Bad guys are always kept, good guys keep going. <br /> <br /> A beef: why women were the most women or at least bitches? Amanda was very upset. <br /> <br /> I hope we like Dick van Dyke and his family on the last pages of the family, as well as in particular. lunchtime!
