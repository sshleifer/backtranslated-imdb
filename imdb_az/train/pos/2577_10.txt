My dad grew up, watching George Reeves as Superman, and when I was a little kid, there were episodes in the VHS and I'd like to add a movie to this movie (if you're in the family) and I loved it. Clark Kent and Lois Lane are a man who was sent to a small town and oilfield and sent to the Superman to claim that he had been radioactive from the mine and killed the molecular men and killed the city and stopped the confusion. <br /> <br /> It looks as nice and entertaining as possible. Special effects and sound in the old style - crew attracted such a beauty with such a little technology. When I was a little kid, George Reeves was my hero, and now I am 16 years old, just to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.
