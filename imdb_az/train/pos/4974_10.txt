It was a pleasant presentation. Hemo, the god of Greece, has played well by animation with boredom, arrogance, snobbish superiority, and innocent miracle. When I say, "You did not use all of this plumbing system ... you did not learn my secrets", I remember and ("scene") included salty water that threatened the "Talassa" philosophers, as well as the blood-chemical aspects of hemodialysis and segues. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful entertainment and information mix that is classically fresh and is still as it is today. Encouraging interest and imagination teaches children to love learning.
