A super, unusual movie from Audiard, reading My Lip, Pulpy, is a tension that only increases. Vincent is perfect for Cassel's delicate character and has a striking performance from Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard, with the emergence of Kairin Viard for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: everyone is able to have a stunning, fascinating profile in this movie, , A definition of a role like Carla, a dog bureaucratic affair by her colleagues who abuse her deceit. But, as you love Kassel's former Paul, he finds an exploitation. Each man exploits his or her non-traditional talents (theft and lip-reading) in order to comply with his own situation, and creates a romantic rapprochement. Devos / Audiard manages Carla's deafness and service, enters the inner world with a neat, elegant scent. In this film (2001), Audiard is under the control of the tension, movement and the scope of his administration, nine years later - a great prophet - with a truly visual experience. 7/10
