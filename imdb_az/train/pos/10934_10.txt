After reviewing this intense martial arts film in about 18 years, as I recall from my youth, I have not lost any of his activities from his imagination and of the martial arts. A dead martial arts instructor, his "unfinished" pupil, does not find a wealth of money hidden by his mate, sending him to find the former 5 members of his Poison Clan. <br /> <br /> If the latter is afraid that he does not have enough education, he orders his friend to be friends with four "poisonous" people. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about choreography or choreography. camera work. It's a beautiful movie that suits one of the best martial arts films. A CLASSIC !!
