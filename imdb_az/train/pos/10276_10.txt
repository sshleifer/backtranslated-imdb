The opening of the film with Bach Toccata shows how much it is to come out of this intense drama. All composer equipment, Bach, perfectly captivates the listener (and performer) of this listener and entertainer. The two leading characters in the final classification and the leading woman have no mutual sensitivity. My visionant warned me that it was a witch, though I was being harassed. Mamet strengthens emotional distress and distinction between sexes, but they praise one another as to really give each other a sense of humor. If Mamet develops a healthy sense of humor among the sexes, how do I think about this? As it is, it is very scary and passionate.
