Director Andrés Waissbluth has worked for seven years to complete this two-hour film about underground crime in Santiago, Chile, and maybe the resulting film is episodic and one of the reasons he needs editing. <br /> <br /> Two brothers, Silvio's elder (Néstor Cantillana) and a small Viktor (Juan Pablo Miranda), are a displaced film. after their parents' death, they are trying to support the education of Santiago and Silvio Victor from their home in Temucoda. On the seventeenth birthday of Victor, Silvio throws the virgin into the club and encourages Victor to lose one of the club's stripper / prostitutes and his virginity. <br /> <br /> Silvio should face Victor's probability of his emergence when he is on the floor of the club admiring the "owners" of potential employment opportunities. <br /> <br /> Silvio earns a lot of money to support a knight / Viktor's training for "bunch". But Victor, one of the dancers in the club named Gracia (Antonella Ríos), has eyes and begins to throw off Silvion's school-furious. Gracia is only a compressor of the leader of Silvio, the club gang leader, Don Pascualin (Alejandro Trejo)! Since Gracia, Victor, Silvio, and Don Pascual are paramouro, this is a sticker that holds this story together, and the result of this strange era has resulted in a trojan fatal consequences. <br /> <br /> We understand the weaknesses and cracks in each character through the story of Victor, Silvio and Gracia. <br /> Chile Pulp Fiction? Here, it is drawn in a cruel, colorful, darkness that includes many frontal nudity (both female and male) and provocative sexual encounters. But in the end, the director's vision is what makes a movie playing in a psychiatrist playing a successful professional sex workman. Casting shows that Gracian's role as a player is particularly strong in Antonella Ríos. The only thing you think you understand is the fact that it is enough to repeat and repeat events, but in an effective way when the change is explained in the eyes of a different character. The effect of the film on the two-hour border would have been slightly modified. Spanish with English subtitles. Edgi film is recommended for those who love noir style and South American film art.
