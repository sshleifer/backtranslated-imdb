Bedknobs & Broomsticks are one of Disney's masterpieces. Animated series and actresses related to actresses and animations. (A similar concept was used in Blue Poppins when entering the children's and Mary's paving art). I'm basically seeing this movie in the eyes of the child, because I have not seen it for so many years. He was one of my favorite films at that time. It was magical and mystical, and my last favorite scenes (a clash of cunning armor going to war) was my favorite. There are also many stop-animations used by spells (that is, people turn to rabbits), which can now be a little dated and stupid. (And I believe the movie will start slowly). With a child's eye, this is a fun movie, and it's easy for children to place their children's seats in the movie. Today is a very regrettable creative film.
