This movie was originally designed by Jim Carrey. Carrey had made his face look in this movie. It was both funny and sad. Carrey played an interview with Bruce Nolan. Nolan blame God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that went wrong in his life. Then God sends down from heaven and gives Bruce authority. As I said before, Carrey did a great job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as actors / actresses. The area was good because there were many subpoints on the main point. This movie may be funny (Bruce's dog), but also sad ("breaking"). The scenario also worked well. I'm glad they did this movie later. I rate this movie at 9/10.
