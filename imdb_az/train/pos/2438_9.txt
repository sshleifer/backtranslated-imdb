It was a stone. Amazing Liam is Cunningham, Orla Brady and all support cast. The film raises not only the history of Ireland and Ireland, but also many societies around the world and many in the community. Violent and sincere shows that the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions drive a love-loving and passionate family. The chapter titled "Love Split" could not have been better captured. Although a real story happened in Ireland in the '50s, he recalled how the whole village was ruined and that the "pogroms" had begun. Intolerance and bias are still strong in the world and, unfortunately, are deeply hidden in human nature. The character of Liam Cunningham, as in the film, says "hate was always on the surface." People were interested in watching moral choices when making this story. Also, the character of the Catholic priest and the end of the story were very important to him. The story tells us that the love of two people can conquer everything, and love further strengthens us. Liam Cunningham's character goes through all the transformation of being a man who always wants to be in the story. Again, a top notch operating. Story is fast paced. The Irish village is always as beautiful as it is. Be advised.
