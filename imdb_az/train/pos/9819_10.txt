This is a great movie of the century made for mysterious television. The most beloved actor of all time, Robert Culp, is a masterpiece of liberal injustice and trust in the system, knightly conservatism, and a terrifying path to crime and murder psychosis. Teens are a collection of clean, rough, stereotypes, and the final message of this movie is overwhelming by comparing Dragnet episodes. But it really shines that the film's great speed, fears and paranoia, and feelings of feelings throughout California. As I remember, the machines are really great. I give this movie when I'm 10 years old, and I keep everyone from watching this movie and enjoying every minute of it. Keep in mind that this is not a great art for television.
