This Arnold movie. Now, you know, I survived when I tried to read some of these reviews. If you do not like Arnold, you will not love this movie. If the situation is different, most likely, I want it. <br /> <br /> Now, when you read this, I'm waiting for you to look like Arnold. It's good for you! He is not very good. Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature. <br /> <br /> <strong> We have a retro-future that we know better than the 80th B-Sci Fi, a terrific liner, a lot of violence and explosions, a beautiful looking heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In this case, the 1984 government is a controller that uses badly-trained television as an effective massive control over gladiator-type game shows. Of course, Arnold ends in one of these shows, and all two fans and well-visible Amber turns upside down with a little help. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget but still able to create a pretty good atmosphere in the future, with some beautiful matt pictures and to help. It desperately 80, but I find it attractive. Actor is a variable, Arnold, doing something boring and shouting on every side, a liner faced with stones. Hero Amber, a little stereotypical and stylish, is a typical evil television fan named Daman Killian. <br /> <br /> Despite all these flaws, the film clearly shows its message; Television is a good way to handle people's opiations and people. Also, future futuristic digital video editing will be made, and bad guys will be able to deceive their faces by deceiving their audience. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold movies before, you know when you can watch it. Enjoy.
