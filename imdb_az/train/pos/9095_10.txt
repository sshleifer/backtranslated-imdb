It's a charming, funny movie that gets some degree around it. I recently saw an admirer of his film. It was great to see this movie different from all the horrible horror films I have ever seen. Here, I thought I was writing that this movie is going to theaters, but I hope. It's a great movie to look at friends, her enthusiasts and some funny jokes. The wife (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf) was a pretty good director (not a movie to be versatile). I really like this movie, I think writing, Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and symbols are smart and have a great rhythm. As an aspire writer I pay attention to these things! (I'm not a dork) Anyway, a really nice movie I offer.
