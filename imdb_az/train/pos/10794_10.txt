I've always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in the movie. Although the acting can not be superior, the fighting scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform. In my opinion, Norris Brothers proved to be fine artists, and that was a better production! I hope you take the time to see this movie!
