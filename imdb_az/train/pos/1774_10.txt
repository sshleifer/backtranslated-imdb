<br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> Founded in London in 1969 - Hippy Ray Purbs is an anarchist magazine editor. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was superb as Ray, but he was very nice, his friend is his plain companion, very withdrawn back and mystery Alex, his "girlfriend" is feminist Jill and no brilliant Hugo. Everything in it. This sitcom had the feeling of "Citizen Smith". Ray was much like Wolfie Smith, who wanted to beat society, but failed in a failed manner. Finally, this sitcom will be broadcast on DVD in March, and I will not wait to get it. Like in 1999, it was still repeated on the ground television - my memories were not very good from the sitcom, but the two episodes really are clear: first, I thought, "Hippies Protest" - while the other episode protested against Ray Abramovich and "Hippy Dippy Hippies". I think the episode was 4, a very clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, the sitcom received a negative reaction from the audience (why can not I say)? The BBC wanted another number, but Arthur Matthews decided against her for a negative reaction. Well, wait on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies-Series 1 episode 4.
