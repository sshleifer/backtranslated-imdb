Middle-aged friend Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrible attack on their school. <br /> <br /> Some films are called "Elephant". There is also such a film called "Elephant". Why bring so much? Of course, to compare two movies. I said, although I liked the "Elephant", that's a better movie. What's the difference, you ask? For starters, Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project, and the Diary of the Dead are multiplied differently. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are related to film shootings. Unlike "Elephant," you recognize these two shooters. I actually took care of one of the shooters and understood their actions and did what they did. This film actually feels sympathy for people and is a good thing, because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> For honesty, I was crying instantly in this movie. Heroes are real people behind their logic and actions. You understand them. It's not like they want to kill people. Generally speaking, this movie is emotionally bloody and very surprising and better than the Elephant.
