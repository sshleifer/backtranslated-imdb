This film is about life in Queen Victoria's life and British monarchy for the first few years. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful production of "Young Victoria". Each scene is designed and decorated with perfect detail. Unusual suits, luxurious spots and beautiful landscaped gardens make the name of "Young Victoria" very impressive. I was most impressed by thoughtful cinematography. Each person is well-thought-out of the way to the background or to the front, each scene is well-designed. Victoria was the scene that hit me the most when negotiating in Melbourne. Melbourne Victoria was placed in the middle of the door frame, while Melbourne's angle was placed between Melbourne's arm. <br /> The story is wise and overwhelming The Queen will be watched and understood by a man who does not know Victoria's history. Many events have even fled or are not disclosed. Generally, "Young Victoria" is a good movie and it would be better if it were longer. it becomes evident that events can not be properly described.
