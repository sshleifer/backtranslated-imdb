A good comedy movie, worth $ 100 million, taken in 60 seconds, but has been blown up by most critics. Personally I thought it was a great movie. The story was convincing and had never been the biggest game ever to have such a film, including the nicolas cage, robert duvall and a very hot Angelica jolie, which received 3 Academy Awards. Apart from the dubile who is his wife, this is a perfect blend of comedy and drama action. my account **** (****)
