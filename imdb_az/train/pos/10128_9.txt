Here are the friends of the first EVER episode, Control Freak Monica Gels, New Divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actors and ladies men (Matt Le Blanc and very strange Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry ) How does the scene begin before Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), 6th and her spouse, is presented. <br /> <br /> Episode is better than any new sitcom, the first episode is not always fantastic and lends more. It's not good to act in this episode because the cast, in the new characters (apart from Kudrow and Perry) <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Man, his actor is frightened, because later he becomes more secure, but funny <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> David Schimmer- Rachel Green works well, but we only see Real Rachel at the end of the 1st season, Courtney Cox - this episode appears quite anorexic, her discomfort looks absolutely different (more healthy), she moves a bit sketch but everyone this is a 20 minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I connect these two, because the comedy was superior to time and quality of action and was one of her first roles for Lisa and she was naturally like Pheebs, while Matthew Perry just played Matthew Perry himself! The quality of episode develops later, like Sets, looks dark and creepy in this episode and welcomes them hostility, the player is complete, the characters rely on each new scene, and I am proud of this pilot! Hopefully we will reconnect our friends! Because they will always be with us!
