This film is the second immigration in films after a characteristic study of Damian Szifron's "El Fondo del Mar". With Tiempo De Valientes, he creates very good character with a chemistry that is far from prototypes. I must simplify Szifron's talent to each character, but it is enough to empathize us. His control over it is spectacular, so he writes a great deal on the film and a brightly polished article, laughs and cries with real emotions and invites viewers to participate in their emotions and on their screen. <Br> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Spanish is taking over the British, the city of Buenos Aires, which replaced Hollywood's nightclubs, is as exciting as the city's landscapes and premises, so we have a brave film about Hollywood's Machine. <br /> <br /> But I would like to see the movie because I have never been busy with such amazing characters. The writer is perfectly suited to actors and appears to the contrary. I really believe in making a movie until Argentina's competition.
