Disney can be anything here. First, together with Denzel, "Remember the Titans" is a story based on the truth in America and a small city. Now with Quaid and The Rookie ... there is another story based on truth. <br /> <br /> Both films carry you to tears, and both of you smile and feel warm after seeing them. I took Rookie with my wife and we were expecting her to be a good movie. When we left here, when we asked him whether he would buy it on DVD, he was not disappointed. Most definitely.
