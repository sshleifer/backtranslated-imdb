I've seen this movie in Winnipeg lately - according to the place used. I first read Lawrence in the 70's and for me, it has always been a very powerful description of the aging process in our society. When I was young, she resonated and resonated. After the movie, I would like to see the story live. especially with Ellen Burstyn's speeches. He is generally trying to give us a complete human being, despite the fact that the character is heartwarming and convicted. It is capable of seeing your favorite characters throughout life.
