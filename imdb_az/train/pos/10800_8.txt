This movie is better than the original The Jerk. I advise anyone who likes very stunning humor. <br /> <br /> Like Monty Python, we've included almost a dozen lines from the conversation on the agenda. <br /> <br /> The card game with Hobos and then Mr Suicide. The scene is horrible for dining table and turtle soup. The original coin was on stage. I love it as Steve Martin, it seemed to work tough. Jerk Too is a parody and will be used by everyone. The Jerk Too is genuine family friend of the original The Jerk.
