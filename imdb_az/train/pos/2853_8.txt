Finally I saw this movie after renting it at Blockbuster (VHS) tonight. I must admit that I am also original. Yes, maybe the characters are not fully understood, but not one of these films. Rather, in the eyes of the director, we must see what we think about the story. And it does not stop. And I did not want to be honest. I believe that Sab has influenced the director's "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" and "Run, Lola, Run". But I love the beautiful SEO way to beautiful women in three streets to draw one another. I really need to see the other work of this director because this movie really interested me. If you want to understand, culture, sturm und drang, go somewhere else. If you want a smile, camera movement, and charming amusement, see here.
