Hidden Frontier, a show of affection in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after the Voyager returns from the Delta Quadrant. Official Star Trek shows are some of the characters, but most are original to the show. The show takes place on the basis of the star base Deep Space 12 and in a number of space ships, which does not have any official demonstrations. Heroes have a rising opportunity in the hierarchy where there are no symbols exhibiting just one ship. The show has a good computer animation of spaceships, but the player stands in the green screen and gives a green glow around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, most are good. Episodes are characterized and characters are developed over many episodes. This is a bit less than the official Star Trek show on Babylon 5. The Hidden Frontier receives a taboo as he refuses to use the official series. I am very pleased to see all of this.
