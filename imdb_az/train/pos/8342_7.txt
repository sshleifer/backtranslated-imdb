Meg is looking for a cuter who is a good romantic comedy I've ever seen. All players did a good job by keeping this live quote. Of course, in the real world, no genius mathematician will look at some butter monkey, but like romantic comedies .... one thing to forget about the reality and a good time. Beautiful movie. Damn it, Meg is a child, eh?
