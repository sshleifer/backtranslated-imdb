Having heard many positive comments and seeing the trailer, I had to see this movie. It should have been better with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell. And it surrendered. Generally, the movie is not crazy, but it's a really striking scene, and it's classic in my eyes. SPOILER Finally, it's just fantastic to see where they break through the wall to be safe and we see the confusion of Rockwell and Washington Jeter. It's good at the Big Lebowski scene, where Dude uses chairs to barricate her door but turns the doors away. END SPOILER Just watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
