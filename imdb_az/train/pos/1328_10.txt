Without a "mental anachronism", this film, which I would like to find on the DVD, offers extraordinary diving in the minds of the people before "the world's embarrassment." That is, for thirty years, the director and screenwriter will try to empathize, and I'm surprised by such a romantic truth to do. It is necessary to see and re-examine the film in order to better capture temporal and cultural distinctions in order to accept, analyze and analyze the example of primitive thought and finally lose the ability to accept it. " Because this thinking has kept the feelings in the world almost impossible, but it contains certain bases of behavior, and only future generations will be able to analyze it. Where does someone know me where to get an exemplary copy or VHS to me or DVD? Thanks in advance.
