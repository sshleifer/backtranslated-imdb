In fact, this film was not so bad. It includes action, comedy and excitement. Bristol plays a good player, for example, Doug Hutchison ("The Green Mile" by Percy). Another known actor is Scream and Jamie Kennedy from Three Kings. The main heroes sound like Alvin, which is pretty good and funny by Jamie Foxx, but one of the most surprising was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He is a very sympathetic person in other films such as "Green Mile", "Indian Runner," "The Negotiator," or "The Langoliers," and "Bait" is a man without the feeling of being able to see. The only negative thing about this film is the few images of the World Trade Center, and this maybe making the film look a little dated. In general, I thought it was a pretty good little movie!
