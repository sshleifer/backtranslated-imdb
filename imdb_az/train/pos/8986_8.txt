Anton Newcombe is filming and he is the main subject. While an album often shows a real talent of a man, we watch him singing a song. He thinks he is God, but very productive and interesting. Compared to DW, musical or otherwise it is not interesting. "Hey, are you driving a driving license?" Anton says, "Let's go on this guitar!" Great use of archive / home video materials. Rock documents will still be seen. A doc related to the creation process. See Nirvana Live if you like! Tonight! Sold! On DVD. This movie is a good experience. 10 to 8
