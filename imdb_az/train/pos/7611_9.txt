One of the main heroes of ABC's award-winning "Lost" television show "I've looked into this island's eye and it's nice to see it." The series could have been summed up as a drama story about a group crashed on an unknown island, but this demonstration would be a rescue. They are watching a large group of characters on the island, each other and eventually contradicting themselves, just as the "lost", the new lifestyle and their addiction to each other. <br /> <br /> After hearing the concept of this series, my first concern was the lack of a new problem. stories that could tell us after a certain period of time, but proved that this was groundless. The Prophet runs naturally, dialogue is clever, symbols are memorable and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> All of this island is a peculiar character, and you need to see yourself going to show the peculiarity and power of these interpretations. <br /> <br /> In this article, the review has just released the first two seasons and filled with powerful episodes. My only mild criticism shows that half of the second season has slowed down, but later it becomes a surprising form for happiness to the latest episodes. <br /> <br /> If you can recommend a television series, it would certainly be. If you like excitement, adventure, character-based stories, extremely powerful cast and crew, beautiful places and naturally a more invisible island, "Lost" is for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
