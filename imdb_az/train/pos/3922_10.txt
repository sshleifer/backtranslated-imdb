Carmen is one of the best films I've ever seen. The advantage of Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Solun is quite good. They dance their souls. A beautiful fairy tale that is an integral part of life and myth; Myths penetrate into everyday life. Dance gets life and dance all life. True people at the same time live their lives and turn into another, perform the actions of old lovers. Magic continues.
