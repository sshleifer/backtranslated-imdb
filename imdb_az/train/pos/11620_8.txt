Great tension. I was watching a little horrible movie, but what I was getting was a tremendous shortage, which is why it never cost us time. Most of these films have to go back to their heroic stories, because we will feel good or hate for people and start killing people. he is such an idiot here. Yes, you see a few characters, but they really communicate only with managers. The room is like a spouse of an abandoned motel. We saw them, so we knew how effective the character of Lisa was and how effective the new Secretary of the Hotel was. We will see the little girl simply playing a very small but important role in the film. Flight Atrendants, because it is necessary to move ahead, especially in the plan. Especially bad guy, he needs it at the start of the flight. The rude guy at the airport was also important for the movie. Two characters with only 5 liners that were not used on the plane were two young children on the plane. Because I thought they would have something to do with each other. From the first field to the end, a young hotel named Lisa is responsible for the female character. He does not even panic when Jackson's true colors are shown. He thinks what he can do to stop his time. Any actor of intelligent female actors will act as a dragon. But it is not. It was a very short film, and I was looking forward to the outcome of the movie, so I waited for ordinary arbitrage devices to start. None of them are grateful. The new hotel secretary did not call a regular call and said what he would do to him, panic left the phone and he ran away from the hotel or asked your boss saying that he was too drinkable and only left it. Craven should do more for such films. And a recent comment. Brian Cox is in the movie, but I did not know who he was. I came to see Lisa's father. He is completely unrecognizable.
