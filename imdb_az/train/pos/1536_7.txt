Drama is even tougher than the fraternal competition movie! This little boat was mainly presented as a comedy released in Sweden, so I'm glad to find out that there is no work. Funny bits on the small town bickering are definitely a pleasure, but as the story progresses, the drama takes the center stage. <br /> <br /> It raises questions not only about a family drama, but also with respect for the diversity of people's lifestyle choices. <br /> <br /> The Great Character Ensemble, which is a very beautiful and moving dramatic scene of the universe; and they just scattershot, keep everything in place. <br /> <br /> Ingerger Bergman did it (the drama will fit him!), If you have international attention, it would be immediately. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7 in Ozjeppe.
