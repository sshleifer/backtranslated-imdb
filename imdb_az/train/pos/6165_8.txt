Yes, some areas are difficult to follow, and Bill's tendency to violence is, but in fact, an indicator I'm trying to avoid. The vast majority of episodes are very exciting and exhausting, and I miss leaving like Roberta Tayloru Inspector Gina Gold and Gabriel Kent as Todd Carty. I'll admit that I prefer the old episodes of the new episodes and the program is a bit embarrassed after the last part of the program since I checked out at 8.00 am. Still, why I love that Bill is not just an emblem, but the shooters make the next episode unavailable. True, this is more melodramatic, but I love this program so much I love it as a program. 8/10 Bethany Cox
