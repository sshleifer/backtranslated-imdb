I love this movie and have seen it many times over the years. Better every review. Here I agree with all the positive comments. Yes, in those days, there was a sense of life and cruelty that was living in that period. I'm commenting on it while I'm watching. One of them said that Rip Torn was wrong. More satisfied. It is brilliant as a dull, treacherous Clyde Stewart, who works as a smaller and a slave / worker. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as widow Elinor, who works with Clyde's home worker / cook (along with his 7-year-old daughter). Lilia is perfect as a remote neighbor named Skala Grandma. And also a star, a fresh Montana boat. It is both a beautiful and a miserable country to sit on the ground. There are some scenes that are both surprising and necessary. There is no special effect here, what you see is real! It even has a great music score and a great script. You will never forget him after seeing Heartland. All 10's come here.
