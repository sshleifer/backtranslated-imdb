This is a beautiful movie. Casting is a great mixture of characters and deserves the story. The film is basically a good doctor who stole the dead bride's corpses and leads them home. When the corpses are at home, they eliminate things (I hate to use such a general rule, but I forgot what I did) and put it on her husband to keep her youth. Later, reporter Patricia Hunter investigates the situation and begins to find out why the brides are dead. Doctors are walking home and interesting things happen. Of course, follow this old shade, but do good.
