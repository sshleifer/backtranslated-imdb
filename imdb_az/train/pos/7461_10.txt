Fight Club, The Matrix, AI, Sixth Sense, compared to others. This movie is a psyche that has never been seen before. The first 30 minutes builds an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is good, surprising, and you'll always be more selective when watching it (I went to the movie to see the movie three times)
