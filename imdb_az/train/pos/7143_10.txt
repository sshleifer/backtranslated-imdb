"Holes" is my favorite movie! So far, I have seen this movie three times in theaters and was looking forward to buying it on DVD this September. After seeing the film, I read the book and was amazed at how the book and the movie were. The director of this film has done an excellent job of re-creating the book in a movie. Also, all actors chosen to play the role played beautiful characters, especially ZigZag, Max Gashg. Reserve everyone who took part in this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 children, I definitely recommend everyone to see!
