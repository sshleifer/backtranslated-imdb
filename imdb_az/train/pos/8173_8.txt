The shine of this film, even an authorized dentist, is terribly terrible. This is one of the main fears of a man. This movie is a nightmare image that every child needs to pass through the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen is trying to kill people, but works on the teeth, because it gives a staggering nonviolent performance as a confused dentist does not really work. Especially in a terrible scene, I've seen that very strange actor Earl Boen's teeth destroyed, but it's definitely a bad thing you can do when you're a killer dancer. This is a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written, but that's it. The area is embarrassing and sometimes visible on the spot, but hey, this is a killer dentist movie, we all think it, but they did it first.
