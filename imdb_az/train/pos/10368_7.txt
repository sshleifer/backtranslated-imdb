Meryl Streep was incredible in this movie. There is an incredible skill to accentuate, and in general it is incredible in this movie. When Lindy was persecuted, I really felt for her. He played as a realist. As he continued his ignorant ignorance of the media and the government, he was curbed, upset, and unpleasant. I did not expect more from the movie, but I was really interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and real-life events. It turned out to be better than I expected. Sam Neill was also prominent; It's the best thing I've ever seen and I like it in other films (Piano, for example). I gave the movie 7, but if I could only score the player, I'd give 10% and 9.5 for Strep.
