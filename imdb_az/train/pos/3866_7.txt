This unassuming, award-winning series is worthy of two reasons in the history of TV history: it was the first to earn the Emmy award for the best syndicated series, and it was the first show from the premier Republican picturesque studios popular for Republic. Low-budget, but powerful shoots in the 30s and 40s. <br /> <br /> The Republic was one of the first Hollywood studios to leap on a small display of infancy. But it will be short for studios to act as producer of television pulp fantasy. After this show, they would dabble with "Commando Cody" with other forms of adventure, but they did not last longer than 39 episodes. It was also a studio at the last stages of the Republic; <br /> <br /> Rental stages in Hollywood for several Revue Studio series, such as Fortune Soldiers, Original Draget and Kit Carson, before closing its doors in 1959 as it ended. <br /> Anyway, the stories of the Century are not bad, its call card is in the western history, mostly, like Black Bart, Johnny Ringo, John Wesley Hardin, The Dalton Bros, and so on. The late Jim Davis, known for his role as Ewing's patriarch of Dallas, has set a prominent role in the leading role as a detective iron detector Matt Klark, who fights recorded wars. <br /> <br /> Here are two miraculous facts: Wars will occur in the 1880s and some in the early part of the century, but Clark is never aging. Also, Matt, with Mary Castle playing, sidekicks, Frankie Adams and her successes, have been lucky to burn themselves with two lovely female detectives by Margaret "Jonesy" Jones, Kristine Miller. Lone Ranger just loved lady friendliness. <br /> <br /> "Stories of the Century" is the "Studio City TV" of the "Republic Photos" Corporation. In 1954, 39 episodes were created, 39 of which were on public domain and DVD.
