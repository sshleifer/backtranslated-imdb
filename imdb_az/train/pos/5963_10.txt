This movie is terrific, but you need to see why. I'm here to discuss the whole movie here, just the biggest sad scenery. Although Eddie Tim's milk is spilled, she remains in the hallway. Eddie puts obstacles behind the wheel with furious consequences (such as playing a trumpet player as a whipped DVD and slow watch). The best obstacle is to knock down a bucket that jumps through a jock but goes from one door to the floor. But when you slide, it moves swiftly, so it prevents physics (mainly friction); What lies behind the door is high. No one in the school, the most steep ladder, this joke goes to CLEAR in the air. In fact, he will probably die with a broken neck. Not only does it interfere with all the concepts of reality, but also makes the most spectacular sounds in that situation. Go and buy this. Believe me, this scene is worth $ 6.
