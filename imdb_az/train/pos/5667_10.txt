This is definitely spoiler! I love the American Gothic and saw it for the first time since I was 14 at night, the first time I was 14 at the UK. The comparison with Stephen King is just right. This small town is supernatural eeriness, but with fantastic layered characters. The best thing to do, and the reason I love it, was never black and white! Lucas Buck, despite his lack of conscience, often works to give people enough to hang themselves. His manipulation works only with the weak moral values ​​of other people. Although Caleb is generally thought-provoking, gentle, clever, he can show the darkness of his inheritance from his father. Angels Merlyn The Plague Sower An angry face with the angry supporter of the plague is not entirely good or bad. Not only that, but Gail, who is closest to Caleb's main figure, not only realized that she would fall asleep with Lucas, but realized that this show would only go there and apologize for it. I'm a big buffy admirer, but this show was harder than ever when it was really trying to get "dark" in the seasons, losing that troublesome side and completely ignoring its ideas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Television is very good trash and good, original shows are stripped and sealed. At least I see my show as a whole! Some of the visuals are now visible, but a creepy, strange atmosphere is sufficiently provided through the storyline. <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, some of these movies are where they are not 'solving' or where they are in great trouble. It is clear from the fact that Lucas Buck has some evil powers and that this show is going to fight for the spirit of Caleb. Thus, this show can create individuals who seek to find a goal or an unknown 'truth'. Yes, Gails has been settled as a parent-related reality, but unlike Lost and X-files, this show does not try to learn more about the 'facts' of the IMO. All this is a way of dealing with moral choices in symbols and wrapped in the Trinity. Personally, I would have had such a stroke just to see Lucas turn over every situation. <br /> <br /> Check out all that's the main thing I want to say. I love many fantasy / horror fans. Even though it has been canceled, all the characters have backs and it is enough to give the finale some tiny touch. It was Dr Matt who was the only dependent topic I felt. It's strangely not to be in the last episode. <br /> <br /> I would do everything for the second season, but at least there are 22 full episodes and maybe some TVs seem to be in motion, but I'm absolutely delighted with this beautiful show! !!
