"This is not me, it was my brother Rupert!" Dugana says when he opposes Bobby Sally's presence. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best times for fun and unbelief. Steven Oliver Dugan was perfect for his part, as it was of the same character as the "Malibu Beach" in 1978 (although there were not many screenshots). <br /> <br /> "Someone is a Turd!" is another line for centuries. This classic film was definitely worth the admission price.
