Fast and simple, I love this movie very much. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, I am not from the south, and I have never had a cowboy hat in my country. (I have never been in a car with a dead body in my body, but I love Goodfellas). 2.35 formatted and transferred to beautiful DVD. (VHS was 1.33 full screen). Yes, a solid 5.1 mix is ​​your taste. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> This is a great love / hate story set up in Texas with a great performance. Travolta is fantastic. Next to Pulp Fiction, this is the best thing he has done. <br /> <br /> <strong> For 5 years, this is a 10 !!!!
