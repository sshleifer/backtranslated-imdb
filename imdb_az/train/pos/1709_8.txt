After a Halloween re-broadcasting error adapted to the classic radio wars of WAR OF WAR OF WAR OF ORSON Welles for the true Martian invasion, a group of Moronic Martians are just looking at their plans themselves as actually finding them out and actually alone. <br /> <br /> This is really good and funny, do not pull on some decent lines (check your memorable tab). Most likely, we will appeal to Sci-Fi fans. It was a time trial for me, and again I saw that it was better than expected lately. Although it is a cast of a starless star, it may be the most spectacular Martian invasion in the film. Interestingly, the Martians themselves represent almost every classical Action Hero / Sci-Fi Hero stereotype (cool 50s teen, combat pilot, brave astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). Entertaining for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare for SIS! Earth Scum!"
