Dr. Mordit is one of the rare films underneath the radar, but is absolutely worthwhile. This really reminds the old series of the 30s and 40s. So I would like to see watch movies ... but when it was judged by Full Moon, there were not enough tits to provide a typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely sacrificial scene, there are so many things for the family audience - this is a failure because it is a Harry Potter-style wizard, where children eat. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are very good - Ms. Nipar had a great deal of confidence in the film if the A-list had not been photographed. No, seriously! In any case, it is a shame that there is no dollar for the Stardoll license because it could have been a general kiddie phenomenon.
