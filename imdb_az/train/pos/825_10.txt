A long time ago in a galaxy ..... When the original Star Wars film was released, there was only a boy of two years. He does not remember the film for the first time, but does not remember before the end of his life. He remembers the first "Star Wars" themed gift ... a shoebox filled with figures from the original set. She was too young to understand how special the gift was. However, a few years later, he was recieved as one of the best gifts ever received: a box similar to the box of action, twelve to complete his collection. The legendary, Anakin Skywalker, has been produced and moved to the store, as he has been using the last movement figure in this boy's family, and this boy is trying to follow someone for about ten years (until entering the college) and finally, War "can not be regarded as a movie. My childhood is full of good, entertaining and magical things. There is no difference in Christmas thinking, birthdays, summer and winter. In the winter, we would build snow castles with my friends and claim that we were in Hoth (always Han Solo). My friends' father planted a tree and served them as Ewok Village. They also had a large pine tree, which was quite high enough to create a kind of cave under the rays, and it created a great place to claim that we were in Yoda's house. When it comes to the word "Star Wars," I'm a dorky person, and I think people understand or do that. <br /> <br /> I can not get the "Lord of the Rings" or the "Star Trek", but as I am an admirer of George Lucas movies, I understand the admirers who follow them. <br /> <br /> I do not need to defend these ideas as the biggest part of all time. When I put it on a DVD player, I feel I was eight years old, life was simple and my biggest problem was how I could track Anakin Skywalker. <Br> <br /> Level (for all trilogy): A +
