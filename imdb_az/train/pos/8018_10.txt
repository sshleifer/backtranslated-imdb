In this Muppet movie, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillo, Dr Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are their college college graduates who decided to bring the Manhattan Melody Broadway to their successful college music. Unfortunately, no manufacturer will meet with Muppets. After being rejected by many manufacturers, Scooter shows that the Muppets decide to move on. Kermit believes he can still get a show at Broadway, but at last, everyone knows that after the show, Kermit will receive amnesia, others will not know where. <br /> <br /> It has many beautiful scenes, including the lively heroic circle of the Muppet Babies. These are Sesame Street laying and Trip Matt (Fraggle Rock), Scooter's movie theater, Rizzo and other rats cooked breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters are not included. Certainly, many of them appear at the wedding, but should be an important role for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and the lips should be Maye Mayhem as the last season of this Muppet Show, and the Big Muppet Caper and Miss Piggys it Foo Foo (after all, Rizzo The Rat, played by Steve Whitmire, played a major role in this film and was not well-timed).
