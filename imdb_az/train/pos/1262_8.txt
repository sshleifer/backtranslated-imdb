A young and apparently promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to prison for the murder of an innocent young girl and put on the ranks of death. Sean Connery is playing a "happy" advocate following the retirement of a young man's grandmother and urges her to take up her job with the hope of releasing her granddaughter. Laurence Fishburne plays a well-off police officer, and it is hell to condemn a theory that Connery and the whole police department can win to release a man who has been charged with a boy's suicide. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and the latest Lynne Thigpen are co-stars in this very dense dramatic trilogy.
