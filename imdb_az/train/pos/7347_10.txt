<br /> <br /> In short, Fire & Ice, a forgotten masterpiece of Ralph Bakshis, is an old OOP rental video tape. <br /> <br /> In short, this is better than any previous Conan-esque movie you've seen before. Of course, it is cheesy, but to whom does it benefit? At this point, the test stopped and the only way cheese started appearing is comparable to modern fantasy epics like Lot: FOTR (although I love the movie). <br /> <br /> The plan is like this: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> Betty, but this is not the point. It is really to bring an interesting idea of ​​the two enemy worlds: Fire & Ice. <br /> <br /> When it comes to action scenes, it is superior. They are well managed, have a terrible, durable and many noise. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> They will not be nominated for Oscar, but they are good and will not fall into captivity. <br /> <br /> Animation is very good. Drawing on 3D and rotoscoped (I think THINK) looks very good. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a small boat that is not a good necessity and will be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Many backgrounds seem to be really detailed and well-designed, and although character designs are less than 1-dimensional, they are more than superficial "entertainments". 10/10
