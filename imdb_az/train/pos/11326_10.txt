I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is just amazing! Since the Neon Genesis Evangelion I'm not interested in anime series. This series is actually based on the h-game, but I'm not sure whether it's the previous or not, I did not play, but I'm watching it very well. <br /> <br /> I give this series 10/10. There is a magnificent story, interesting characters, and some of the good animations I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series yet, check it out. Some anime sites can find subgenesis episodes, from plain Japan.
