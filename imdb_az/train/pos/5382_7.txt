After watching the next Action Star reality TV series, I enjoyed seeing the winning movie immediately. I was on display at the new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Billy Zane was, of course, his great personality, but Corinne and Sean came to him. Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) were also pleased to see their community role. Sean's character, not Billy, is caught and his frustration is well-known in discovering new rules in the game. Corinne seeks to shake tightly between Sean's favorite symbol and the border within the money. I liked how the game played towards the last second. And then beyond! Not a great movie, but in a fun way all the way and for the first time outside of the big showcase door for two nations.
