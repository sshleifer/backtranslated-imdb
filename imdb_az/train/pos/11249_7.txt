I only watched all 6 episodes on the DVD. Perfect behavior is very good - no question. There was not enough movement to say for me. There is no such tension, only the first-class character. Nothing like the Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you are watching a good story slowly and carefully, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The film reflects a treacherous life. She had to be a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service, but a person with a psychologically damaged childhood was deceived, and her lifestyle was her lifestyle. He blessed a child's father, but his father was once disclosed as a crook and guardian once and for all. Pim did not betray ideology or money, but to deceive those close to him (his spouse, son, mentor). Pym has been fatally damaged by its father's influence - it removes the spiritual fibers. <br /> <br /> The 6-hour series features severe psychological things and many light moments. Although very good.
