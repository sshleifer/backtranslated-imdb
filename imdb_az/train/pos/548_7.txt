This film was as good as some of Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur Anthony Mann and James Stewart and Thunder Bay and The Bend Of The River very well in the other western. This film begins as a weird strange run, but becomes more complicated when it comes. Stewart, who came to Seattle with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan, is charged with murder. He was found innocent, but the cattle was stolen by a bad judge. Stewart then agrees to lead something, but I've forgotten what happened, but Stewart only takes care of the return of cattle. While on the film, Stewart just cares about himself as his character in Naked Spur. After arriving in Alaska, it's better at half a point. This is one of the better westerners of Stewart.
