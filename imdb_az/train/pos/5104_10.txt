This is a clever drama about a lifetime lifestyle in Texas in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger reveal two incredible performances, such as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the country's music scene and has helped America to present a mechanical bull. If you love a good romantic movie, you'll love this movie.
