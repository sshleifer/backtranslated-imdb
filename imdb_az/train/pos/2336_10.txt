When I heard about the show for the first time, I heard a lot about it and got some good reviews. As I declared myself, I watched the first episode of this "fairy tale" and really hooked on it. I liked it since. This show has a good sense of humor and it's fun to see a good show like this. <br /> <br /> For those unaware of this show, centers around a man named Daisies Pushing Ned (aka The Pie Maker, played by Lee Pace, who found a special gift when it was a boy): Give the dead the touch of a pound It could have been. First, he did it with Digby. But there is a catch: if a dead person survives for more than a minute, another dies. He learned of it when he took his mother back and died at the place of his mother Ned's mother. Keeping another one, he touches a person again, but is still fine. Her mother learned it when she kissed her good night. His father took him to boarding school and Ned had never seen his father when he went. <br /> <br /> Ned is about 20 years after Ned owns a cake paste called "The Pie Hole" intelligently. Ned is a Zeytun Snook (Kristin Chenoweth) worker, who is suffering from Ned, but Ned does not try to approach anyone in the past to learn from his past experiences. Special investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) found Ned's gift and decided to become a partner in dealing with crimes. Ned touches the victim and asks those who have killed them, and touches them once more and solves it. They do this often. <br /> <br /> One day Ned's childhood love, Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), solving the next crime. He brings his life back and decides to break the rules and save his life. Instead, the funeral director who stole jewelry from funerals died. When Emerson finds out and Chuck wants to help her with the murders, she is a little dissatisfied - we call Chuck 'Dead' s daughter. All of these are kept secret: Olive, Chuck's Wives Vivian and Lily (Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz) and everyone on this subject, everyone obituaries, news, and so on. If they know it. Vivian and Lily, swimmers, have not left home for many years. Emerson, Ned and Chuck will work together. <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck resemble each other, though they can not touch each other. <br /> <br /> This show has funny, horrible characters, great space foliage, and will definitely get your soul. I hope it will not be canceled in 13 episodes.
