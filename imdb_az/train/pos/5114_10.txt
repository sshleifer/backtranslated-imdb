Urban Cowboy provided a clear idea of ​​that day and age, while the city Texas, although not a leak with the same testosterone it might find in a rodeo. I also think that this film was really a matter of criticism, time and relative residence. Good music, entertaining time and yes, a few "rough and tumbles" were honky tonk roadhouses. The relationship between Bud and Sissy was well understood as "two ships passing overnight." When Pam destroyed Sissy's note to Bud, it reflected the tragedy of many real life romances. The whole story was well thought out. I thought cast and crew did a great job. I thought the screen game was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have taken the Oscars for the best supporting actor.
