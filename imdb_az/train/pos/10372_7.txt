ROLL is a beautiful movie. Toby Malone plays a 18-year-old boy (playing very well) into the game. Malone's cousin brings him to the night before a big game in an adventure with a lot of hardening and queue, involving two gym bags, a drug lord, some tough bikers, some cops and some prostitutes ... and the movie tells us what symbols on the side of the law, The contents of the gym bag are even the mainstay of a biker. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL strengthened my three opinions before I saw ROLL. These are the following: 1. One day, I really want to visit Australia. The country and the cities are beautiful and look like a cool place to strike. <br /> <br /> Some of the best filmmakers in Australia. Cinematography in ROLL was particularly effective. <br /> <br /> In many scenes I liked stylized colors and lighting. 3. Australian women are hot!
