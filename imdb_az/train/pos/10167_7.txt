I'm not an admirer of seeing this movie, but the gf has called me and just said eva longoria and jason biggs was just a free screening link tagged tagged to laugh antics <br /> <br /> Generally, it was really better, but it was unexpected . It was a hybrid of how a boy and paradise were lost in 10 days. with my mom, I think with a typical romantic comedy. The film was short enough (about 85 minutes), but enough to explain the whole story, set some characteristic developments and reach a happy ending. a ghost haunting an old husband was an interesting structure to follow the whole idea. <br /> <br /> After looking at some of the movies, I did a good job at home. The conversation and paul rudd and the rest of the support (especially jason biggs) keep coming at a pace of laughter. <br /> <br /> There was little laugh so I did not go somewhere else, I would give this movie a bit lower. hey hey, it's a chick flick and I'm looking at this movie alright alright guy, this would be a fair fight if the woman's film was reviewed and given ideas on it.
