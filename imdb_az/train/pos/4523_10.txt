When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was drifting in this movie, I had few expectations to watch the entire movie. <br /> <br /> I think it might have been a kind of Persian type of Ms. Doubtfire, something that could have been fine and subtle. deep comedy. Pasdar is absolutely convincing and sincere as an ambitious businessman who wants to free himself from his female part. It conveys the needs to the listeners in a convincing way. Julie Walters is magnificent, like his habit, as a host of teachings of volunteer love.
