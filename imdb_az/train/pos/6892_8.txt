Two years ago there was a clip shown at the Gerard Philippe exposition in Paris. I'm not interested in reconstruction and I've just been held for more than half a century now, but I can only assume that the sword that protects is a long-term target. Hollywood has had the technique of switching to the foil with the largest Basil Rathbone, Errol Flynn and others since the 1930s, and after realizing a satire, realistic sword fights. After a while, you do not notice the Henry Jeanson dialogue, which reminds Zdene Zindanda of both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly could play such a role, and Gina Lollabrigida was probably better than Martine Carol, then the other obvious candidate. The print I was seeing was particularly bad and at one point it was completely destroyed, maybe a DVD version developed it.
