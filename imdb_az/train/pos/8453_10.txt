We can write a great deal of Gundam Wing's characters, each with a series of internal conflicts. We get 8 great potentials that make the anime happiness through 49 golden episodes. <br /> <br /> There is a dialogue that you can walk around your head for months, and then return and get a new meaning, writing, and writing (despite the typical Anime character that has subtitles between English subtitles). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Relationships between the symbols of women who love our fellow countrymen in the Caucasus are one side of this series. Connection between Heero and Relena, while Milliardo and Noin are happy to watch. Her husband's decline is protected by an inner confusion that creates the love of women (a never-ending word in their series) in a harsh military environment. Women, we rarely look at people who are more profitable to the leading men. Heero's 49 episodes make it hard for him, but he gets there and is a big payout then. And then there's a giant robot fight. It is fun to watch awesome sequences as any Hollywood epic battle scene. Any less engaged person sees this giant as a magic cartoon function for children while trying to recommend this series to friends, but they make a mistake. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing's great giant robot battles are struggling to fight, There are constant changes in sound and focus. With each episode, Gundam makes it impossible to dig, and is an attractive, thought-provoking study of human mind and body potential.
