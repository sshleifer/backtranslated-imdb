A unique film about a mixed woman (Lindsay Crouse) deals with sharp men. Joe Mantegna gives Oscar-caliber performance as the group's most sexy person. Mantegna Crouse shows the "ropes" of the "John" games. The storyline soon dissolves, but still stands as an innocent image captured in a dark world. Definitely worth a shot.
