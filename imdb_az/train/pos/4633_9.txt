One more beauty in the series of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of lovers (an Israel, a Palestinian) passing through modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film is not only the description of ethnic conflicts, but also personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups. For example, when one of the secondary characters is exposed by a friend who wants to kiss her in front of a family who visits a visitor to one of the open gay guys, we see sudden waves of concern. rinse out of the room. Undoubtedly, the young man will not be as open as he can, but will not accept the family because his lover is mixed and rejected. A good complexity is a momentary moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is an expert in short-range packaging, effective emotional and psychological complexity. The film is also effective in distinguishing between the cruelty of the Israeli and Palestinian counterparts. If you are not indifferent, you will be crying throughout the last three episodes of the film. Although the solution is melodrama, it reminds of how much good a melodrama will be, that it is cleverly written and mobilized.
