Samuel Fuller's coming to the South Street is abnormal: the red-scare movie, which is nothing more than just McGuff, which provokes the communist threat. Pickpocket Richard Widmark releases Jean Peters, the empty daughter of his wallet with a microfilm strip; Without knowing either of them, he hides important secrets for the Cold War. Peters, like all, was detained by the FBI agents, who kidnapped him as a cowardly communist, like Richard Kiley. When trying to take a precious movie, both sides are dealing with the old paradise, who wants to sell what they hear and sell with the help of Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Fuller draws from the pace of the tempo. and tonalitas describing the story that became a race against the alarm clock. Manhattan, a writer from the subway to the seafront, says he has a sweaty shimmer. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become a frustrating mix of tender and tender, and they're signing a song called "Again" from Ida Lupino at Road House, where Widmond plays. The rhythm of the beautiful writing and performing scene is one of the most striking vignettes in all the nouvea and a ghost voyage of the sky. This is only the work of writer / director Fuller, the most harsh boundary of the Noir era; his later studies in the American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld USA) have never resulted in a synthesis such as Pickup on the South Street.
