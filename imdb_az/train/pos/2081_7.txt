Part 1 8/29/2009 - From 10 to 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Good Farmers report in China and their native nature and their struggle for what it was thrown. This film is based on a prize-winning novel that celebrates a family, starting with his son's marriage to the slave girl. The film does a good job of protecting your interests, despite a little bit of performance with a hero played by Paul Muni. Von Long (MÃ¼nini's character) and how his land works, gets more land, ultimately becomes richer, but then he returns to the land that he originally started. The relationship between Louise Rainer and her spouse is a major part of the story (apart from the land) and, despite non-Chinese actors, does a great job to show the country and its people. Obviously, the MGM was probably using some money to create a good epic in this era when it could afford it. The scene with locusts is very well done, and the rest of the film is awarded the Best Cinematography Award in the Oscars in those years. The definitive definition of epic is what this story is and is pretty well done.
