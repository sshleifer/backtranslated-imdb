Like The Jeffersons, Good Times was one of the classic American citations that had never been published in England. I did not mention the fact that I went to the 1970s - for ten years I was not born yet. <br /> <br /> As the show's fans, I watched several episodes at You Tube, and then I liked it. <br /> <br /> Evans family runs James and Florida. despite their encounter and insufficiency, encourage their children to live their lives and to win their chances. James J. J., Michael and Thelma - a brave but loving father who did not hesitate to take too much step. Unlike Florida, he was a fair, kind and polite mother and beloved spouse, although he often viewed parenting and family values ​​in the attitude of the Afro-American perspective. <br /> <br /> Kids were as entertaining and entertaining as their parents: JJ is often infectious and recognizable as talking to Willis talking about Arnold Jackson's "Willchoo", which can often wear multi-colored suits and the "DY-NO-MITE" Collapse? Diff'rent hit. Michael was a smart alec who wanted to be a lawyer, and his brother Thelma had his own dreams and hopes. <br /> <br /> Verbal insults with JJ were largely cheerful, a love / hatred relationship between a brother and a sister, and played well by Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> Over the seasons At least Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and young Gary Colemán have made very few appearances! I really want to tell The Cosby Show, the 80s, that I choose the Good Times because: a) I preferred the Evans family to Huxtables (a), and (b) felt that he had solved serious and difficult social problems I did a resonating way with many viewers. It was a comedy, but in the 1970s, Afro-Americans had a public commentary to emphasize the working class. The Cosby Show, Huxtables, tried to answer the main viewers in a 'candy coated' way, as described by Blacks, who easily assimilated themselves to a high-level US culture, but opposed Good Times, in contrast to 'edgier' and drug abuse and child abuse. they were not afraid to settle. In fact, when Cosby Show saw that it could be fun to watch once, it was not the part of the Good Times, and it was not part of the tender and coolest "shaking". <br /> <br /> As the show continued after the character of John Amos, the shark, Jacob died in a strange accident in the following seasons (in fact, the time when John left the Good Promotions for the Near). show). <br /> <br /> John did not take the show and, unfortunately, lost a lot of charm. <br /> <br /> For a sitcom still, Good Times corrected all the right boxes. Only in England in the 80s they show this. Certainly, as JJ puts it, 'DY-NO-MITE!' <br /> <br /> My rating is 8 half
