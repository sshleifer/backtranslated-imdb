If you have not seen this dark little charm then you have to look for it. Fight Mac Sadness is the story of War Fighter MacMurray, a 4-F list of bumps every time you join any soldier's department. He certainly finds a magic lamp inside a gene (Gene Sheldon), but Mac is bumbling more than MacMurray, and sends it time to serve all the wrong places and the place he wants. It's a cheerful, cheerful and clean hairstyle and you can not help, but it's not like that. The fields resemble the Disney movie, especially two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon), and created numerous Disney films in the 50s and 60s. Needless to say, it's okay for everyone, and the viewer feels very good.
