Simple quality filming can be powerful and attractive. This film is able to hide in everything, talk to everyday scenes. As others have said, it is true that the film really lost Hollywood's special effects, its emotionalism in the face and how it clarified the end of the upper climate, and the essence of a meaningful story explained by simple realism. Most of the characters in this character are thought to be in the dialogue dialogue as it is written in the dialogue dialogue. One thing I really liked about the movie was one of the contradictions between the two brothers. One of them was expressive in childhood, the other completely stoic, but both of them gave birth to deep emotions. His elder brother had to say almost as if he had everything on the dead surface! Beautiful cinematography, beautiful toy, great direction! Not to be missed!
