Barbara Stanwyck has a double project perfectly on a disc. The first film - and I believe that both are smaller - are linked to Clark Gable in the MGM's "Woman's Request" (1950). In fact, the screen is a star tool with Gable, which gives preference to the movie. Here, a feminist journalist plays Stanwyck with a madhouse racer who starts out in a bad press and starts a sex battle. Of course, soon after, they end up in the arms of each other, and all this is expected and glad. <br /> <br /> However, the second feature of the real meat on this DVD is something very surprising and quite unknown. Small tension called JEOPARDY. Developed by MGM in 1953, this is a wonderful movie that does not give a single date! Here Stanwyck plays Barry Sullivan and his wife, a vacation in Mexico and the desert coast when their younger son Lee Aaker suddenly catches the tragedy. What is the estimation of a wooden pier Sullivan under the heavy stump? Yes, the tide came. There was no spirit in his eyes and Stanwyck, who was unable to release himself, set off for help. After some distance, the only help he can help comes from a courageous escaped prisoner (Ralph Meeker) - with his help - more money or a change of clothes ("I will do everything to save my spouse"). Is he or she not? <br /> <br /> Meeker runs through the picture! It turns into a brilliant performance! You can not take your eyes off the movie when it comes to the movie! An actor in the style of Brando who was surprised did not have much of his career in the film. In 1953, Naked Spur (1953) in the magnificent Mann / Stewart West, and Stanley Kubrick's powerful WW1 drama, "Glory of Glory" (1957), as an unexpected, courageous cavalry officer, was one of the French soldiers. The only real claim to glory was Mike Hammer, Mickey Spille's "Kill Me With Death" in 1955. His performance in "Jeopardy" had to do miracles for him, but he had only one career in the film. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Because of this freedom, Danger can now take a decent place as a classic noy. It is a memorable, modest and exciting tone due to the coolness of the atmosphere by John Sturges, the crisp Monochrome Kinematography of Victor Milner and Dimitri Tiomkin. The extras are not the exception to the Hellfire radio version, and to both movies. <br /> <br /> This disk is part of the Barbara Stanwyck box, which celebrates its 100th anniversary. <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - a MGM winner!
