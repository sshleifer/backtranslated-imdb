Take the McCoy (Richard Widmark) candy wallet, an important microfiche designed for Communist reasons. He is followed by two federal agents who are whispering after splitting his microphone with him. However, everyone stole a bag on the subway under his noses, and so begins hunting by Candy and Candy, who wants to return the micro and the police and Joey (Richard Kiley). The tour can only be watched by Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information about criminals. Despite the fact that what he stole is important and wants both sides to ask for a movie, he intends to have a high appreciation. This leads to a confrontation between Joey and Jean, who later fell in love with Joe and Jones. Joey has a deadline to deliver microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a good move and it's a good start to directing it. Though Jean Peters fell in love with Widmark, just as he was a bit untrue, this point would go further away from Joey later. Its a good movie.
