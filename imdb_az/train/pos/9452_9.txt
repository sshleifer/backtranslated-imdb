After seeing Salva, films such as Pulp Fiction do not look too extreme. Maybe it's not as strange as today's blood and bullet standards, but you think it's 1972, and if the film has a really bad nucleus then you're different. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie before the Dueling Banjos scene was not unusual. At that stage, the film's cruelty and its edges can really look. Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) shows me with a retarded young boy, as it is watched, shows how these films really are perfect. <br /> <br /> You think the child is a small bunch, that Drew could have been handicapped in comparison with a nice guitar. <br /> <br /> As the lair of the land goes, it is very convincing and will not cross its boundaries. But, in fact, the director, John Boorman (Excalibur), removes all the characters from smooth cartoons or stereotypes, according to four businessmen who are more than just a coincidence during a canoe trip that differentiates this film. As the film frightens me, I really care about four people, and what would happen to them? <br /> <br /> Acting is absolutely excellent. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, the State's Enemy) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease), which is a great sound. John Voight is probably the most difficult thing in this film, and he believes that this family man is a warrior. Unlike Reynolds, the character is an outspoken warrior, the character of Voight changes the course of the film. <br /> <br /> Ned Beatty (Life) is in a very tough role, raped by a hillbilly, Ronny Cox turns into a convincing performance. <br /> <br /> What made this movie really powerful for me was so terrifying that my comrades could see. The fear of Bill Mckinney and Herbert Cowboy was as good as hillbilly and extremely scary. <br /> <br /> Generally, rescue was excellent and I would recommend it to everyone except those with severe stomach and children. 10/10. Watch this movie.
