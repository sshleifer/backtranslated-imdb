I saw this movie in its own apartment and encouraged me to start with myself. Maybe I got it so seriously. I completely believed in the psychological disturbance of poor character in Paris, where everlasting construction yards, dust, crevice, egoism, ruthlessness, betrayal and decay. I give all the credits to Polanski's craft, his playing, and the inevitable script, but I have been frustrated at the horrible final stage and should be animated with the cognac at the theater manager's office. Fortunately, my life was not as disastrous as ever, but I always respected for an artist who could fulfill such dreams, and so he wanted to convey it. Simply put, that man is primarily a genius and a credit for human race. This film is a great collection of great players and great casting patterns. While some of the speeches were in French (with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas and others) and others (with many other characters) in French and Polanski performed their dubbing in English and French, while watching the magnificent transfer on Paramount DVD, English or vice versa. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "apartment building trilogy" and is also composed of "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" has not yet done for decent DVD transmissions in Region 1. It is not necessary to say that the three films will form a magnificent box.
