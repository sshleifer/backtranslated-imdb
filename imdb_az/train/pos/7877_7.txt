<br /> <br /> <strong> Not really! Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant "destroy" myths about glam and glitterati, which we are watching with the passion that we can only describe the pages of our newspapers and their lives (reading the party habits), which can only explain the interior voyeuristic chain. <br /> <br /> The 3 page phenomenon is painful because it is so profitable. How accurately control over the word was printed, and when it came to the front page, it was subjected to other debates. Bhandarkar cleverly runs away. It is only about the mechanisms of this strange existence. By doing so, it separates the different elements of life style. Although Robert Altman (Bhandarkar is not comparable to Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses many symbols to boost his motive. This is a page 3 wannabe NRI, a gatekeeper, a new rich, approaching model, a public politician, or an erotic novelist; all the characters are presented with one purpose and each of them has a separate character-sketch, even fragments may be smaller. Here's the film's appeal. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is a young and talented journalist Madhavi Sharma, 3rd page for Nation Today. At first, when she is satisfied with her work, she soon begins to see the ugliness of the underbelly covered by fake and cosmetic darkness. However, Bhandarkar is resisting humiliation and is afraid to justify a single character to make this topic a moral film. Thus, the film is not just about Madhavi, but also Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi. Anjali Thapar Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer), a homosexual makeup artist and Madhavi's guesthouse, Pearl (Sandhya Mridul), is a breeze and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) is a post-graduate actress. Many characters in a story seem to be an impossible task to absorb (and more), but full credit to Nina Aroraya and Manoj Tyagy for writing a tight script. Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar's dialogues are carefully written. <br /> <br /> Any narrative can be straightforward with the absence of original speeches, no matter how good it is. Fortunately 'not with actors and stars,' Page 3 '. Koncona easily supports the role that is supported by the author. Ditto Boman. Sandhya gets the best written part of Mridul, but it's almost too. Atul Kulkarni is worn out with a written character. Sometimes, as director, as many pedophilia, homosexuality, and so forth. It looks very enthusiastic to enter. But the used contexts do not force them to miss. <br /> <br /> As a result, Bhandarkar's initiative is to touch our voyeurism, but it takes another step. He takes us through the photographs and drives us to the terrible realities of this sect of the stunning humanity that lives in a distant and distant world. These are the excitement of the New Year when several hundred kilometers away from their peers are spoiled by nature's drunkenness! Spectacular writing, skillful songs, sophisticated performances and sincerity of sincerity are worthy of this film, despite the lack of elegance and poor production values. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Medium *** Good **** Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
