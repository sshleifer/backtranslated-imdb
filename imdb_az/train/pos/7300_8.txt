Like the finer giants that form the last half of the film's head, Michael Oblowitz's last production has the grace, but it is slow and surprising. There was the same problem with "Mosquitian-3D" in the last journey of the producer. It's hard to imagine a dull shark movie, but it has managed it somehow. The only shooting for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy is a fun animation that is always fun when dealing with beautiful worlds under the ocean surface. But even that was just passive. Poor visibility in some images made it look amateur. With the Dolphins and Whales, the technology has wasted everything. Cloudy scenes and a great deal of gigantic subjects of the movie There is nothing to use with the stunning 3D capabilities of the IMAX. There are very few scenes of any depth or type. These awesome creatures are closely aligned, and there are many living beings in the area of ​​cameras, so there is no depth of contrast. Michael Oblowitz tries to track his father's footprints, but the shark has a Shark-Week, an introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
