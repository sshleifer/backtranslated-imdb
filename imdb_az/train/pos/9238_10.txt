Others have edited the only two versions of this video: Space Space and Living Legend, if you watch the original show, you'll see the dialogue from this video release. I liked this video version better because scenes and lines were added. If you want to see the show in the original version, see the VHS video versions. Now they offer more fans than the original episodes offered on the DVD. Another good video - Galactica is the Conquest for the Earth, which has more than 1980 scene. In general, I value it as 10, because the network gives more delight to the manufacturers than they want to.
