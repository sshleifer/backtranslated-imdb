I thought this movie was doing a good job. The first was not as creative and original, but who was waiting for it to happen. It was a lot of fun in the lottery. I think more about what I think and when I leave the DVD, I'm proud of it, paying every cent cent. Sheron Stone is great, he's always a movie (Catwoman), but not this movie, it's one of the movies that will be denied for a lifetime, and probably 20 years of classic. Do not wait for her to be classic, look now and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is fun and advisable. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is fun and I advise you. People who do not see will not see it, because they say critics and cash register, you can not always count, watch for yourself, you can only enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
