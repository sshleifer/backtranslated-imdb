I took this film every time I retired at the age of seven when I left the cables. This was the introduction to Harlem, which was so surprising with me (and Bill Clinton). I was still very young and the film made a great impression on me. It was wonderful to see films about other juvenile girls, try to decide who they want, and see some bad choices as well as good ones. I was amazed at the beauty of Lonette McKee, finally the biggest clothes I needed to wear and the speed of dialogue. I can get acquainted with these girls and their husbands as they are raised by a single mother. It's funny, these characters look more real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
