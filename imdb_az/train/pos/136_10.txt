This movie is a great way to finally end the series. Peter (Puppet Master III boy) grew up and now is a Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy puppets and learn the secrets of Toulon, but instead listens to the story of puppets. Most of this movie is about Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Puppet Master Curses and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... But Paramount predicts them will not allow them to use scenes. Personally I'm a Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys will finally be done, but the way to end the movie is basically "The last movie in this series ..."
