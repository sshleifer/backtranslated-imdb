Pinjar is one of the few films that really make a mark and think. In Section India, this film shows the real reality of division in India. Urmila gets full marks for a beautiful and profound emotional description of a painful woman. Her freedom, personality, and family respect were taken overnight on a tragic land dispute. Manoj bajpai is just as brilliant as he punches himself. A few moments in the movie tears. The film is deeply traumatic. Some of the section scenes are lubricant but Urmila's endurance and survival are remarkable. Women who are freed to women in similar situations are deprived of liberty. A movie that needs to be credited for smart characters and stories.
