In a Los Angeles neighborhood, four teenage girls are disturbing: parties, drug, police, mixed parents, old friends. Jodie Foster strives to amaze the main bread type of the package, as "a family" (it's not a family association) and it's a heartwarming thing about the movie. Slowly, everyone is growing and moving away. I emphasize, however, that, unfortunately, it is a regrettable point. Do we need a long sequence by carrying out a slaughter car on Scott Baio's skateboat? Or with a longer range - also with Baio - Foster has a strange solution about "illusion pain." In fact, some of the dialogues are obvious, and I did not pay much attention to a night's nightmare. But this is mainly nitpicks, which is a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie's face finally speaks. At the end of the audience, the movie won it. He does not feel embarrassed or embarrassed for his tears. It shows us the example of friendship and the hopes we understand. From ****
