The man in the house is in the comedy of a real situation in every sense of the word. The comedy relates to a character named Robin Tripp (starring great Richard O 'Sullivan), a wild man who ends at the house of two ladies named Jo and Chrissy. A strange party was organized to commemorate old friends. <br /> <br /> While talking about this man, the man at home was a pre-cursor in the spin show of George and Mildredin Cooke and Mortimer, both of which were homeowners, Joe, Chrissy and Jo. Robin. These two characters will actually act as masters of the house together with Mildred (late and abducted Yootha Joyce), especially the best lines of the series. <br /> <br /> When the Americans wanted to lend something, semi-regular character Larry (Doug Fisher) was always a weak man and came around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> American is a version of three companies, Thames drew the risk of creating a comedy about a man who shared a house with 2 women at a very conservative moment, but at the time, according to estimates, about 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned art with comedy, cast and scrambled script. A strange modern comedy can not reach this high standard. <br /> This program is available on the network DVD
