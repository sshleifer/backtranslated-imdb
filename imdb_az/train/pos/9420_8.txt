The man in a white suit is one of the fun comedies that Ealing's research in the 40s and 50s has been very good. This area is followed by a person who makes a dirty or unbreakable piece. Of course, this is a big leap in the textile world. Nevertheless, everything is as simple as a piece of jewelry, fabric manufacturers, and every week that it will threaten many people's lifestyle as an elderly lady who wakes her up. The man in a white suit is a science fiction and they are not always needed to help; An elderly woman says at a point in the film, "Why can not scientists just leave alone?" <br /> <br /> Like many Ealing comedies, this is a star Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic player; has the ability to illuminate the screen with his presence (and in this film, in the true sense of the word), and also try to portray the characters in a miraculous way. In this movie he is so creepy and he only has the right environment for his character; intelligent, ambitious, but loyal scientist. In addition to Guinness, the man in the White Suit is also a featured actress, Joan Greenwood, who plays with Guinness, simply a divine "Pleasant Hearts and Coronets", and Michael Gough, a man who will continue to play the role of Alfredin Batman. Acting on the film is not always great, but it's always worth it and it's compatible with the movie. <br /> <br /> A white suit is a clever, thoughtful and witty comedy. morally The comedy is not always clear and does not always work, but the movie does not mean to be a laughing movie, so it can be forgiven. I mainly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of films.
