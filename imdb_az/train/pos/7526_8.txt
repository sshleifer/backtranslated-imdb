Canadian director Maryam Harron is a cultural deer who reveals the previous films as an artistic advantage of the sixties and a hollow avaricious eighty. With The Notorious Bettie Page, Fifties shows the eyes of the American, despite the eyes of her in a period of time covered by the moral justice of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing sex awakening that end with love for the next decade. Harron and co-writer Guinevere Turner are not interested in the standard biopsy of the gender symbol. This is a film under which the underground symbol of a time and its flamboyant sexuality emerges from the imagination of predatory instincts and fairy tales of a culture that touches the beauty of a naked body. If the details of Bettie's life are worrying about all films, why does it end before its most tragic period begins? Obviously, Harron is now more interested in America's position against sex images. Gretchen Mol and W.Mott Hupfel III, along with a fierce leading performance with stunning atmosphere cinematography, succeeded in pursuing that goal and called on viewers to "discern" 21st-century relationships, pornography. As America's drowning under a new conservatism, this is more than ever needed.
