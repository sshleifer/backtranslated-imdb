What can you say about Mr. Moore? He is the rap spouse, the king of Z-level blaxploitation flicks, and here, as he is the most popular characters, Dolemite! Can you crush it? This film is politically incorrect humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence and the most up-to-date movies (or really haha ​​in any movie!). The stand-up procedure that will give it early, should not be missed! Anyway, D2 is an absolute entertaining way to spend an hour or more. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and has no class!"
