Escher, this charming study, "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?" Converts multiple cerebral questions to 100 minutes of excitement and fun. The film is directed by Bartin, a writer who fights against the scenario, and "Thinking Sea". When he is sitting on his computer, writing a script, not just a description of sitting on the computer, is starting to work. Everything he wrote a long time ago was a real shaking. Director Gert de Graaff explains the subject with a subtle humor concept and surprises our audience with some stunning visual tricks that resist the nature and our perception of our perception. Finally, the De Graaff movie meets the audience at several levels, and what we have seen or touched or tastes really is, or just a game of us all of our understanding of the universe and all its concepts.
