Super Mario 64 is no doubt the biggest game ever created. It's so addicting that you can play for hours at a time without stopping for a break. I beat the game four times, but never won 120 stars ... (I've earned 111) ... but I hope to eventually achieve them. Even though I did not play this game until the age of seven, I watched my siblings play. <br/> <br /> <br /> News: Gameplay is addictive. Controls are great. Levels are difficult, but impossible. Bowser battles become challenging. <br /> <br /> I would like to give you more information, but why just got it for yourself? Put your X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii-in and find yourself a Nintendo 64 and play this beautiful, beautiful game.
