The legend of Dragoon is one of the few popular games that people love or hate. Some people are meant to be Sony's Final Fantasy, so it's clear that other games - the Final Fantasy series. <br /> <br /> I think that my favorite part of the game is a battle system. <br /> <br /> I think it's my favorite side of the game. You do not have the ability to turn into a more powerful drag, but when you attack each time, you have to pay attention to completing the attack by pressing the keys at the right time. Sometimes enemies will attack the right in the center of a sequence, meaning that we press different buttons to avoid damage. Even the use of some offensive agents requires a little button handling. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to attack, you always protect it, which is only the loss of half, but increases your kick without the use of healing elixirs. <br /> <br /> For the same quality as the FMV Final Fantasy 8. However, during the game the graphics are not as high as this standard. They were beautiful, but they could have - and honestly, better - better. Translation also creates anything. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> <br /> <br /> <strong> One people die, and the latter will be unfit for the party and will have leaves. While the death of a character often means that there is no point, he realizes that the characters are still early, even though the heroes are still fatal to the next person. People replacing lost characters simply earn all the statistics, as the switch game player is fairly accurate. Maybe a complaint about the characters is the interest of the main character, Shana. He is the point where a poor woman in need of escape goes to drive a driver to shout excitedly. When using her party, she is very weak - I did not know what her dragoon powers are, so I did not like her, I never used it. On the contrary, in any game, according to Rose, my favorite character is my character. He is no nude and his dragoon magic is very useful. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Meru is a strong enough guy who is sometimes a teaser chatter. <br /> <br /> Cartoon designers tend to translate most of the female symbols into something beautiful or anything, and do not give much thought to the true benefits of your outfit. Seriously, no armor is useful in dealing with the monsters that are in your skin. <br /> <br /> Therefore, in many countries, there are women who serve as princesses. <br /> <br /> I can not say a lot in the plot. Honestly, I needed to go next. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> There are defects, but for me, just hit the right balance of killing monsters by just pressing the buttons.
