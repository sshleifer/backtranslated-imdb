In 1948 it was my favorite movie. Betty Grable's costume grew so much that he wanted to grow up and grow his clothes like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was an irresistible Hungarian officer. As it has been the case for the first time, when it was eight years old, it was as if she was hairy and looked at what I was saying about relationships between men and women. I saw it again today; I was surprised to find it.
