I watched this movie with little interest. 1) Can Paul Muni play Chinese and 2) asked Luiza Rainer to win Oscar. I'm away from YES thinking! We saw Muni in a film that was quite sincere, I expected a similar performance here. I've been happy about it. Some may criticize the idea of ​​the Hollywood Asians in a very childish and stereotypical fashion, although I thought it was true in this role. <br /> <br /> Kye Luka could have played the same role if she had the chance to act as a government official. <br /> <br /> I was especially impressed by the camera scene and the crowd, especially when O-Lan was working on the palace once. It was epic, unlike the others at the same time where the gorgeous atmosphere and the glitter and gleaming atmosphere of the chic staff and drought were all the same. I was surprised by this movie. I can not say the same for the "epics" of today.
