Crush builds well when it comes to drama, humor, and such an Iranian conjunction that is related to the heart of the English language. This beautiful scenario, mostly known for directing John McKay, has written about three forty friends in a small city in England. All three women were abducted by men, with ritual women gathering at night, with delayed behaviors or their libido needs acquired through gin, fags and sweets. Index MacDowell, an Englishman around the British (still the most leaked place), is as attractive as a head coach of a prestigious school that unites with a young man. In a small city, he opposes gossip and jealous friends (big supporters). We have come across a number of brutal unfortunate incidents, and when we are in the real happiness of one, we show many challenges. Please note that the main purpose of this film is to be friendly and to show us the end. This is the kind of movie you love or hate, so I believe in many mixed views, and the biggest success has been the release of this movie. I'm sure most of the film is now filming. I'm very pleased with this movie and like movies like "Love in Love", "Three Weddings and Funerals". It's not uncommon for a soundtrack to capture these important points perfectly.
