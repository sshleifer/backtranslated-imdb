Many know Paul Verhoeven as the director of very good (and bad) fantasy films in Hollywood. But before that, he pulled out of the common alarms in his native home. The story is the main femme fatale premise, no new or enthralling. Verhoeven thinks that instead of defining his main character and position, he can do better by simply adding a number of sleep sequences used to advance the predicted area. The scenario was tight, and the dialogue dialogue helped solve the effects of a mild story. At least what made a good movie, there were some terrible moves. Jereone Krabbe was as nice as the "torture artist" and his supporters were also very good. Also, Jan De Bont's cinema adds at least one life to the movie and helps Verhoeven look at at least a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 * 1/2 / * * * *
