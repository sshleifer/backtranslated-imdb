I'm shocked. More than 428 IMDB users who voted before were shocked by the fact that they did not give more than 7 ratings to this movie. - this is a C! I'm glad if you can give FOB 20. This film is on top of a modern comedy pantheon, along with Half Baked and Mallrats, one of the most delightful films of all time. If you know everything about rap music - you should see this! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn something and then see it! Compared to 'Spinal Tap', thank you for the genius who inspired this unique movie. If you love Bob Roberts you will love it. Watch and vote!
