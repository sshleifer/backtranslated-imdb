Always one of my favorite movies. Only beautiful, full of human emotions, intelligence, humor, intelligence. Life, as a lesson in life, is a beautiful film in just about many films. <br /> <br /> The mill is also a fantasy ..... is a great selection of the best English talent around. I liked everything for every different item brought to the movie. <br /> <br /> Italy should be one of the most romantic places to create a story like this - everything about this movie works. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
