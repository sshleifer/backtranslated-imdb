This flick was found on the video tape, $ 2 was spent to buy. The whole movie is really bad! Although the lid was reliable, the so-called colonel who was supposed to be in the eighties of the hero could not go. However, it is one of the world's most enduring ninjas. Then the story separates the colonel, given that the old man is unable to do everything necessary to celebrate, now two terribly eighty-looking children have to have some sort of story. I've lost a hundred times, but I'm crying, because the movie is really bad, it's really fun to watch. Zero budget, trash with actors who do not deserve this name. Go, check!
