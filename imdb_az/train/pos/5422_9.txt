In 1939, the film "Gunga Din" is a story about the inviolability of thousands, not as a great soldier who saved hundreds of lives. Based on Rudyard Kipling's poem, the film is directed by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and Victor Mclagen. The roles are played by well-known Sam Jaffe, the director of Ben Casey, as Dr. Zorba. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> As a great lug in Grant and Fairbanks and at McLagen - cuts are actually three grown boys Gunga Din is a water carrier, almost verbally treated - McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) loves it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the events in Afghanistan, Ballantine (Fairbanks), a lovely young woman (Joan Fontaine) marriage and dismissal. When Gunga Dyne and Cutter fled between refugees, a deadly religion under the leadership of a guru (Eduardo Cianelli) runs to warn the Gunga Dynasty and calls for a re-listing to rescue Ballantine Cutter. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" is a very funny, friendly film, which started with indifference, especially by Cary Grant, with a magnificent, comic comedy. Both Fairbanks and Fairbanks are very nice, it's hard to decide first. Most of the film is made up of great action signals that are very exciting. In the final part, the story is dramatic and remains a tense, exciting battle. <br /> <br /> Grant's most famous role, Fairbanks's lover is romantic, and McLaglen's McChesney's treatment, mainly Gune's Religion, is the most inappropriate character, though one perceives her softheart in her love for her elephant Annie. <br /> <br /> Always a soft and unpleasant actor, Sam Jaffe, offers a wonderful game like Gunga Din. a brave man with a great smile, strong imagination and high dreams. Without much dialogue, Jaffe Gunga delivers the heart of religion in a magnificent way. <br /> <br /> This is really the ultimate adventure movie, surrounded by beautiful, moving scenes, beautiful music accounts, and some beautiful movies. This remarkable year is another, 1939. Highly recommendable.
