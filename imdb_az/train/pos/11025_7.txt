Cliffhanger is a good motion crime adventure with a series of striking flaws in this film about a climber found by director Renny Harlley, a film full of money stolen by a boy who has been kidnapped by a gangster of dangerous criminals, Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is particularly effective as an experienced climber Gabe Walker in the motion / fight ranks, but some are definitely the boundary on the non-realistic line. It's a form of the film, though it's ready to stop my swearing. John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon, as well as the remaining castle in the movie. Action / combat sequence is well executed, but as it was mentioned before, some of you are not very realistic, no matter how difficult it is. The climbing sequence is very good, because in a studio, the place chosen by the whole film was very real, and Ariel landscapes of the mountain ranges added a realistic touch to the film. Deaths are inventive, others are predicted. Their spouses are exhausted, but it would be best if they were directed to a more central center rather than many. The film's pacing was a bit slow, but good this is a filthy filth. If you have a chance to be a great admirer of Harlins or Stallone, you really love it. Common Cliffhanger has character development with good performances of players who have made this film, enough for action, drama, some shooting, excitement, excitement and watch.
