These three sticks, with my other finger fluttering, were bound by the "Court of Justice". <br /> <br /> Every three Stooges fans are a laughable laugh to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Children are the residents of the recording studio when they hear a great version of Christine McIntyre's "Spring Sounds". He will be offered a record contract, but he is afraid to be honest with his father to choose his career and show himself as a true singer. When he and others left the studio, the stooges decided to have a little fun and curl their record and dress as Christine. Kristin, who can build his career, looks at Christine and is mistaken for Christine and invites her to play for her party. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a man who criticizes himself for being in the party and destroying his soloist before the crowd. So he will find a way to come back. <br /> <br /> Stooge flick, it should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
