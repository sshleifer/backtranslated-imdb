The answer to this question is yes, you must use this legendary movie. I just saw Paris several hours ago (where the film is moving) and I still feel the great trauma behind my eyes ... What is the visual shock! I have not seen such a big change in the way to make such a beautiful black and white photo and cartoons. I believe that it will come before and after the Renaissance in a similar way to what we see in Pixar movies or in the Akira and GhostInTheShell experiments. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films and I hope that this French initiative (a small, unrecognized French studio with several young people with a dream called Renaissance) will receive a worthy success and recognition. Vive la France!
