I'm not saying that this is a bad movie; In fact, the type of movie that was released by the studio of poverty at that time is quite typical. Monogrammed Bela Lugosi, as a demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the public, is very effective in his role. In this film, Bela and her chaoschik have bad behavior in stealing young brides, and after Bella's death, Bela's spouse combines with a sera taken from her body to keep her young. Lugosi is more than just about making it a pleasant film, but the movie, co-stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin are suffering from ultra-wooden action. Horror (a good name for a horrified person) is particularly bad in this situation. I have seen him in numerous films and television shows and is always unique; hard, wooden and completely unknowable. Miss Walters is just a little better, but she does not have the ability to move her convincingly. Perhaps the audience can use another neat scheme to break down in the end of the great Lugosyan! Despite the poor who work for some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a fun movie for all.
