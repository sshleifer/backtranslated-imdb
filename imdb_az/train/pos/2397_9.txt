Since Greg liked and loved the latest version of Lombardy's "Knots" (also wrote and directed these features), I decided to check the previous work and it was worth the effort and rental cost. Macbeth in Manhattan is a cheek tongue, perfect for Shakespeare's love, refreshing, and relocated to NYC. The main intelligence and intelligence of the work was amazed and shown in the film as the story line of the production reflects the story line of the game - and was very clever. The difficulties and difficulties in life in Manhattan were rarely brought to the attention of many Shakespeare games and Central Parks to better use the trees around Macbeth's castle. Mr Lombardo has a beautiful place in his heart for stories in New York and New York (Knots, Manhattan offices and comic and hot sex comedy about sixty-thirty something identified in a charming Brooklyn neighborhood with a downhill crash) for Shakespeare's spent a lot of time around their games. The film is full of good pace and the story reflects deep insight into the main drama based on Macbeth's. It reminded me of Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard" - another beautiful Shakespeare plays in the movie. " I would highly recommend checking Macbeth in Manhattan.
