This series was featured at the Comedy Central cable television station in the United States. He was born to death and shown in sequence. It was sad for the audience he was supposed to be, he did not stay out of the way and fell. Fortunately, at the same time, my cable company was digital and I got the BBC. Thank you for the happiness, because "The League of Brain" was to be seen as full and uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> The Gentlemen League team is home to the British Monty Python Flying Circus and Canada's The Kids in Hall. <br /> <br /> Although the "League of Brain" is a step. It's not deeper and more darker than dragging and losing cultural problems. Now I can tell you many - insulting certain groups of people and insulting others. But remember, his only comedy .. dart, dark comedy. If this is not yours, do not follow. If you do not know the dark comedy, you can watch it - when you are angry and upset you will not know DARK COMEDY exactly. <br /> <br /> These guys pushed right and right button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I love to create every character. From the episode there is an ending story that has been completed. You can not watch this episode at one time, this is one of the arcades of the series. See for order. See how these children were creative and stylish and deeply troubled. No one and nothing is beyond the boundaries. This is my beloved, "dark humor". Bravo!
