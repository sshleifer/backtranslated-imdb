In the same way, Frank Miller and Sin City have used black and white to express themselves (and the noir effects of the film), as Christian Volckman, the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> In Paris in 2054. In the science fiction tradition, a bright, shining future is a must-have tear. This is a miracle in weakness, injustice and darkness; top with a bright and beautiful under dark underbelly. One of these "bright" people, a researcher from a very large and influential world company (Avalon), was kidnapped. <br /> <br /> Famous and efficient, Captain Karas (new James Bond himself - sang by Daniel Craig) tells him to find it. <br /> <br /> Cunning and layout are not very dependent. Along with films such as Blin Runner, Sin City, Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Minority Report, the movie is noisy, Gibson's Neuromancer and other detective stories. Finally, there are key areas covered by other possible sub-fields that are interconnected. <br /> <br /> The power and originality of the film is in its powerful vision. A series of complex levels in Paris levels and lower levels. Its base has more primary industry infrastructure. As the city climbs up, it has its architectural complexity and luminessence. But in this structure, it is not equal to the rise of the upper human ideals and behavior. Paris has a sophisticated animation and is bright in black and white. The film is closer to soul than Sin City (movies) with the source of Sin City. It's even easier, because it remains in the same environment; animation In the same way as with a Scanner, many things pushed the visual aspects of the story darker. Light and darkness, black and white, create a regrettable atmosphere, as well as visual uncertainty. Right and wrong, black and white may lose all meaning at the same time, right in front of us. The film also proves how black and white can be uncertain and clear. <br /> <br /> In the spirit of the film, I can be a critic and a fan. In the same light I love and hate. Imagine for those who love visual arts. So pour another Black and Tan, enter the space and enjoy the trip.
