Along with Darkwing Duck, this is unjustified. Disney has started to decline since Tarzan, and we need such a show to get Disney back. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for Louis and Baloo voices (acquaintances?) The topic theme is also appealing. Tony Jay is among all the immoral people who are different, like Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo were actually very similar to the shadow of the Jungle Book, which is not a bad thing. In fact, this is incredibly inspirational! It was an animated place and the script was a lot of wisdom that had been lacking in animations for many years. BACK THIS SEND! 9/10. Bethany Cox
