After a week of Finnish experience, I describe the nature of Finnish society very clearly. Especially when I'm in Finland for myself, as I have observed the same thing, the phenomenon of younger couples is very familiar to me. <br /> <br /> The relationships and problems of people, the sensitivity of the marriage organization, the drinking culture, the unemployment and the rising money problem are put in a very good way from any subjective or extravagant. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to understand each other and to compare one another, but it also rewards a great picture. Each of the short stories is not interesting or deep, but as mentioned above, the big picture is not a failure to convey "real life" and capture the audience. In a calm moment I began to think: What happens to the lives of all these people on the street? That's what happened. Such films are good for feeding their creative power. <br /> <br /> This film can be applied to life in many countries, but especially reflects Finland and is very cursed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Maybe not a work, a very good attempt by the whole crew. <br /> <br /> At 7.5 / 10, I will talk about the future releases of the director and players
