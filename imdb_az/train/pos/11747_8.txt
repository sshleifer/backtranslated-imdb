A wonderful effort for the Australian show. maybe the quality of the Aussie drama seems somewhat refreshing, but not surprising. Can I compare this show to the glow of love? no. but reminiscent of his early secret life. Casting is great, the first two episodes I've seen in the gibney works her magic, the English pouring is stronger than the call and flavor characters. but if this show is a season, it may be a saving light (no need for savings). I'm not an admirer of the awesome awesome branding performance mini series a few years ago, but always more green. it's good to see the brook satchwell again. the show continues to improve with every episode.
