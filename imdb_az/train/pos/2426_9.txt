"Once in life" is a very good movie. But not everyone is good because of the widespread use of vulgar language and the severity of some situations. The film manages to represent anecdotic, convincing "life" in NYC neighborhoods where drug problems are important. This description is used as a d√©cor for the most thoughtful and exciting drama supported by powerful dialog boxes (but English is not my mother tongue because it's hard to figure out some of them). Sometimes, sometimes there is a little overplay, but I think that Fishburne is well suited to the general direction he has given to the movie. This gives you more reflexion, especially when implementing a good style in time / activity management. Cartoons, though not simple, are easy to relate to, and actors do a great job while imitating them. By the way, I loved music very much (B. Marsalis). If you are not very proud, you need to see the movie once, twice, three times. I sounded 9/10.
