I liked this movie. I am Mexican and at least I hurt her. In fact, this film should be shown in all Mexican police stations. It is a sad fact that our police system is rotten like a 3-month corpse. In prisons cells, such as kings, paying a strange penalty, or murdering, abductions, and other lively ones. We have to have one of the creatures of Denzel Washington, such as Creasy. A knight was turned into revenge vigilante. Theft is here the florishing industry at least in major cities. I wish, in fact, that the people I missed in real life could get the same fate as they did a wonderful job with their creativity. It would be surprising (sorry, I am so angry!). MAN ON FIRE, do not miss that is a passionate film. If you do not use subtitles to read (Mexican do this all the time while watching American movies), but your efforts will be good. Some of the editing is somewhat fuzzy ... What kind of TRAFFIC, remember? (acknowledges how another brilliant Mexican is infected). The film starts a little slowly, but the pace is bare in the second half. Denzel will be delighted when looking at Washington's wrongdoers. His performance is not the perfect thing. The last (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure I would like it anyway. FIRE MAN is one of the best films of the year. We need to "own" the DVD collection! 10 to 9 *
