I do not remember what happened before that evening, probably the name was mentioned so much that it did not pass me. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is a well-prepared western, slipping into a large open city looking for the story of his wife and daughter. It's a city-tamer for a while. As usual, good business people have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of the baddies, but like the work they bring. Still apply: drinking and listening to gambling laws and encouraging industry, but I keep the rooted effects that can affect ordinary people. An interesting thing about this film is cynically clarified when it comes to cleaning the city of Baddies, and it is the only city to adopt the violent methods of population. Favorite bits: Baddies in the Red Dog room suddenly die of 2. Firstly, the ceasefire of the main hall weakened but was an effective way to prevent the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, a very good movie, thinking of a few hockeys, is not very good. Instead of ending, they will prefer the lifetime of the negotiations with the Jews.
