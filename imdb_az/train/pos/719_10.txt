This film is perfectly drawn, even though it is cheesiness. Undoubtedly, this film should be regarded as a modern classic. Basically, there are two types of movies I like - deep movies (chicken filters, if you need it - I blame my spouse for it) and the comedy that can come back and relax. <br /> <br /> This film is a perfect example of the latter. <br /> <br /> Shortly after my friend was released, he turned me into this movie. He looked at me a little quietly, and said, "You have to see this movie, it's just your movie." I'm waiting for extreme injustice. I know that they reminded the Ramones a million times, but when I really saw them, I said, "Hey, these Ramones." My friend answered: "I did not know they were a real band". <br /> <br /> Although this film is now somewhat dated, it's a matter for Ramones admirer or anyone else.
