The story of The Stone Angel's adaptation on the screen is so close to my favorite novel! Great movie! As a good reader, the worst thing about movie studios is that the book has been translated in some way. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is an excellent choice for Hagar's role and she is definitely a movie star. But, I think, the Canadian actress (Christine Horne) chose to play Hagar in her young age, doing an amazing job, which is a great praise. <br /> <br /> I had not seen Horne's previous job, but after seeing his Stone Angel performance, I would certainly do it. <br /> <br /> I heard that the Canadian The Stone Angel will take place in spring or spring from the theater series in 2008 and still do not want to see it on the big screen!
