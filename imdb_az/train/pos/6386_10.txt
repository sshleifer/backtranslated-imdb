At one point, Disney, who is innocent and accessible to everything, has the name of the film at any given age, and finally needs to be different. Over the past few years, this kind of diversity has become very clear. Movies such as "Tarzan" and "Emperor's New Groove" have tried to get away from the rhythm that dominates the traditional song of Disney's past and go to a new, uncharted land. "Atlantis" is still the most brave step, but we should remember: This is Disney. The first serious film to get out of Disney's animation studio is a great success for them - in fact, this is a very serious PG territory. <br /> <br /> In spite of some issues, it is alarming that many families are scared in the summer of last year. <br /> <br /> However, despite the more mature topic, it is not yet with the Disney family, so the kids are "Little Mermaid" and so on. They are quite interested in getting away from their worlds. <br /> <br /> So, what we have achieved, unfortunately, is a potential detail with a blow to a 96-minute film. Finally, this is not a motion movie about Atlantis, but about the previous exposition, so we shift the screen up to the bombardment as fast as possible without connecting the screen within the first half hour. Stop kicking off your characters from B to Point B so fast, you can not find a detailed animated movie from Hollywood! If you want details of the details in the field, see James Cameron's "Titanic". Both films have a rock as a rule. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about love. Yes, as with many films, a leading male (Milo Thatch, a bumbling archeologist) and the leading woman (Kida, clichéd Atlantian prince) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I saw was not as klichel as I expected. Until the end of the film, the touches / senses / kissing sequences were more unhappy. The film has a variety of points, but it's called "The Little Mermaid." <br /> <br /> Maybe, this is a very good thing. cliché movie. True. You have a leading hero and hero, supported by more than half crew members going to the expedition, giving their moments in the movie. Many other symbols appear, give a few minutes, and then no. Is not genius to do math? With 96 minutes of action and visual attention, the film has a very important game and there is very little time to expand the characters to any extent. So what is your trust? Clichés and most of them. Each character treats something that has been made a thousand times before. The drummer scientist, the charming prince, the inner colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale? <br /> <br /> I do not know what that is? I found the film's language-in-side nature quite entertaining. Alright, this means a serious whistle, but do you really expect Disney to abandon every aspect of its history? At least the writers tried to come up with a consistent dialogue, and sometimes inspired a little. <br /> <br /> But in the end, there are striking images that make icing on this cake. CGI animated places are really spectacular and the latest "Titan AE" Symbols that are defective are not dwarfs. down Speaking to cartoonists, Disney recruited a foreign commercial industry artist to create anime style for the film. The visual presentation of the film is entirely obsessed with anime, much more than any previous Disney visit. This led to a confrontation with the Japanese anime fans and "Nadia" for the overall resemblance to the film's animated series. I have not seen this anime, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> There is a voice in the picture. Gary Rydstrom controls the sound band and what a soundtrack! The sound from the opening stroke is vivid and is a cure. James Newton Howard is right for a dynamic music account, which praises and praises the movie and always helps to create a tension. <br /> <br /> Probably the creators intended. In my opinion, though the film is a bit more serious than any Disney movie, it is a driving adventure driving. If you do not like cliché-language-cheek attitudes, perhaps your effort to visualize will be a pleasure. Heck is more than just saying about mythology's other Disney efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough). <br /> <br /> This is positive, it was blown up by the movie. Do I always stop my blasphemy with any animated film? Because the real world laws are often violated in the animated film. So, go back, enjoy your trip, maybe everyone can find something to use for this movie.
