Tim Drake, who often works with Batgirl and the new Robin. NightWing (Dick Grayson) is often in the rescue. <br /> <br /> Batman abandoned his yellow logo and black wing suit and slightly larger, but still announced a donkey's tone. <br /> <br /> The show is basically some of the updated characters, but stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. <br /> <br /> Over Edge can be one of the biggest Batman episodes. <br /> <br /> General 8-9 / 10
