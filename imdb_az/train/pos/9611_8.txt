It was strikingly clever for a television movie, and bulimia is completely up to my experience. In fact, it was well-researched, and a man who had passed through that experience had all the small details. The heroes were very well drawn and Mare Winningham and Alison Lohma's performances were great. Sometimes what I love made them special and clever and did not dive into the cause of the divorce (some of the diets did not go out of control, the pressure on the girls caused by the media), we would not actually resort to pressures. "Her mother is not completely clueless - Everyone has some consciousness and their heroes are the last people on Earth ("What is diabetes? Oh, my world is in a hurry, doctor, please ask me all as a little child", etc.). Bethin's scenes are NOT overall melodramatic and sensual, and more focused on Bulimics' privacy needs and their overlooked control. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bethin told her mother was bulimic, <br /> Well, I liked those bits, and I did not do a good job for me, but it's similar to what we know and do not particularly like in a television movie scene. <br /> <br /> "I can also treat your children's eating disorders, if you have so much money and if you live in America ..." <br /> <br /> I just want to say that Mare I love Winningham. He is great.
