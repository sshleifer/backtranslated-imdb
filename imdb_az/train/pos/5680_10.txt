Holy crap is so hysterical! Why American comedies are not so written? There must be evidence for everyone who does not think of comedy - there are more intelligence and intelligence in six episodes of this series, which is on the shelf of the novel! Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot. I could not believe I was the same person as the house! There are plenty of lines and gags in this series, every time you watch dozens of dots, and always get new things. Rowan Atkinson puts Edmund as stupid and butler as the verb. This is my favorite in the entire Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson, as always, is as beautiful as the weak heart of the series, the "Hellfire" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines are: "When someone merged with Wellington, he really puts his foot on" and Baldrick explains his name and his cousin Macadder as "the best seller of the kipper from Scotland" and how he explains his sword.
