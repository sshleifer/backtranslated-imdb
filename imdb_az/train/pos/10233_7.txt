I was always going to watch Hong Kong movies, but all of them had not been met unexpectedly ... so far! THE LOVE PARADISE does not include the flat humor of most HK movies, nor is it a second-line story line dragged to the film. The story is not complex, but there is no scene to fill a "smart" space (the only real intellectual battlefield I see is TIRER, but this is not the HK movie for Hollywood). In this movie, the first major scenes (one of the best quality I've ever seen for the first time) have amazing scenes of fighting! But there are many bloodshed (cut, cut, etc.) in mind. Production is pretty good and special effects show that even though some shots are technically very technical, the dreams of the author can be fulfilled (note: paper throws and wall-mounting). Yep, this is my favorite Hong Kong movie, Tsui Hark or John Woo, this Ringo Lam! And I'm sure that hell is more than that director! Ace.
