The Heroic Simmetry is a totally controversial point, whether they are affected by the Armchik episode, whether they are, or whether it is a shock or a humiliation. As I am a great admirer of both series, I'm subscribed to the latter belief, although not a little philanthropist. James Whitmore was brave enough to get the task of directing the sounds like a recipe for such a challenging episode, unprecedented elephant and gorilla suits, but he definitely leads it with a teaser style. Lance Guest, Kyle Lang and Jack Rader have a great deal of work to do with a safe character like Ed Meecham. Forget the fearsome Symmetry's suspicious originality and enjoy it just like the deeply satisfied X File.
