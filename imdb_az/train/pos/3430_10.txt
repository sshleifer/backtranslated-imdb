I held it in a show at the Sundance Film Festival and was afraid of the absolute power of this film. This is the study of the psychological effects that our courageous soldiers who join our army are proud to maintain and serve our country and that our government needs care. The film reflects the psychological changes taking place in the opening camp, as soldiers have become "killers in their countries" and after they return home, they effect the war and the post. It also describes how killing affects the human soul. He respects the soldiers and, unlike other films, does not criticize the soldiers, but criticizes a system that does not care for all physical and psychological needs that Vetsin does. <br /> <br /> This film is powerful, moving, emotional, and thought-provoking. It is a call to arms to help the soldiers not only buy labels and go for parades, but really listen and help them to care for their health and well-being after their killing. <br /> <br /> So far the best film of the festival, ***** ****
