Kubrick also proved his brightness in a shocking and horrific film based on Stephen King's book. Jack Torrance, a man in his forty age, married, with a child and with a history of anxiety and alcoholism. Overlook Hotel, Colorado, stops service shortly due to bad weather conditions and has a good paying job for a caring person for five months; Torrance who wanted to become a writer found perfect. But the manager advised Torrance about the potential dangers of loneliness in the winter, and said that some caregivers were insane and killed their family in the past. Before they came in there, his son Danny knew that the earth was not good and did not want to go, having an illusory friend who illuminated the future (illuminating it). They started working after they settled in the hotel, but for a month Jack started strangely, annoying, and depressed. At this point we know something will happen but when and how we will not know. The terrible things happen to someone who has been talking to Danny and looks like someone who has attacked him. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt as good as his family; Among them is the famous psychotic helper Delbert Grady. Grady says Torrance should kill her family because they are "intruders" at the hotel. You've followed this command, Jack, the purpose and the most scary I've ever seen was here. The latter is spectacular and the audience will remain fascinated and shocked by the last minute.
