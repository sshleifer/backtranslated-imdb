<br /> <br /> Polanski returned to the topic of loneliness and madness, which was so greatly affected by the Baby, the Tenant, the Compass and Rosemary's Baby. <br /> <br /> Atmosphere is Polanski brand - dark, dark, sad - but there is something. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist is responsible for one of the most beautiful films in Bergman, where he does not justify himself. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The < br /> moves down. Polanski, of course, is not a bad player, but seems to have done more than chewing in with Trekkovsky's difficult role. Some of the support, especially Melvyn Douglas's homeowner and Shelley Winters, are as big as concierge, while others are poor and bad. <br /> <br /> A strange comedy has some wonderful moments in the film that is unexpected. Everyone who sees Hero Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is a good comedian. But there are moments when it comes in dangerously as parody. <br /> <br /> Trekkovsky's sudden (and slightly unexplained) 'transformation' giggled more than a bit of gossip that would have to be a powerful moment in his psychodramatic journey. <br /> <br /> All this is a pleasant and exciting experience, though a little neglected for its good. <br /> <br /> There are many extreme cold moments, and there is a consistently worrying and predictable atmosphere, but this film is not as successful as it can, but it's good. Unfortunately, one 'okay' of the day is better than Polanski's movie. Indeed, do not wait for the price of an hour to just blast.
