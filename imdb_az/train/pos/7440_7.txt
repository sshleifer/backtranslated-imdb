I just watched the film and it was scary, and people in the movie sounded like actors. There were moments in the film, but it was late and very ill. All this means being a Persian, but after you see the plight of the people in the movie, you think about yourself, "People look like it." All attempts to get the audience's benevolence are similar to the actors. Another thing stupid. Moreover, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think the video would have been waiting, but it was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry takes his shirt during the movie! (beautiful look!)
