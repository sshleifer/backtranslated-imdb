Finally, in 2008, I watched these episodes and have to confirm that they are constantly coming back and actually producing. They made fun of what would happen in the future, and they were completely afraid. Either Parker and Stone live in Texas, and Gov are strangers who are witnesses of Bush's deception, or those who pay attention to them. Boo, scary! Bush's frat bors attacked White House as Arabs used rifles? Bush 'accidentally' someone executing? (No, wait, do it like gov.) At this time there may be a failure like a sitcom, but now, if spooky, it should be considered brilliant.
