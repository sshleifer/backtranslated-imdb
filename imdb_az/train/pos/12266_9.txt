Imagine that this great cultural event had disappeared on Swedish TV last night and my girlfriend just wanted to keep it on TV (yes I would, of course, do this) an unusual idea - to lay the foundation of a movie, a documentary in an interview 30 years ago, but one of the most popular literary craftsmen of the 20th century, animated film and other documentary films, Georges Remy aka Hergen's very good and deep <br /> <br /> I am convinced that after seeing this movie, Tintin, which has a distinctive album, allows you to easily combine content and content with different periods in Hergen's life (and I can tell you ) Of course, my perception of albums has been over 25 years since I read them, I have some idea that there are some scary albums, but this (at least) adds another dimension to them.
