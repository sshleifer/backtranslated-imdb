This movie is one of the few high quality films in 2000, and of course I do my best. The scenario is based on the novel of Vladimir Nabokov and the transition to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film's photography is as beautiful as Turturo and Watson's. Turturro proves that he is very worthwhile than we think he's doing best. Watson also performs brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro), which is extremely eccentric in everyday life. The film is presented in a non-linear fashion, with many fun of Luji's childhood. Through these, Luzinin's complex is characterized. <br /> <br /> There is nothing I have said, but it is to present this movie to everyone.
