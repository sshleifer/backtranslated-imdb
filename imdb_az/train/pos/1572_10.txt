When I read it from another user, saying that it is a terrible game, I will stop nothing and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is full of news (two real people full of amazement and reliability!), the story, I find very well! Only complained when the enemy started blinking before they died; and LEILA VR missions in some nervous situations, cycling, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Besides, a great story, a good graphic, an excellent hero, a great soundtrack ... I recommend it! Of course! May be a little older, but still enjoyable! At least in the Dreamcast ... the PS2 version is identical.
