When I was 8, I saw this movie and liked it, but at the age of 13, I did not look back, but realized what it was. An animated film about a criminal kick with a real heart of gold accepts a little girl to exploit the animals to talk to her talents. The dog star, Charlie B. Barkin, was killed by Carlie, an official partner (this is a totally fierce way). His soul actually goes to paradise to find a golden hour for his life, Charlie is a secret, but beloved cadre, sent back to Earth, where he stole and returns. Once on Earth, Charlie is about to seek revenge on the evil Carface. This is how young Anne-Marie, who can talk to animals that Charlie plans to deceive for his talent to return to the enemy Carface. Anne-Marie does not pay attention to the plans of the young Anne-Marie, as "the best friend" Charlie really needs to organize her idea of ​​doing right things after realizing that she used to earn money for her. a new and better dog casino. Now he must be saved from the fearful Carface. I still love this movie at the age of 22. The idea and the structure are really different and depend on many other cartoons. Especially I love the idea that a dog plays the role of horror once. Carface was better than all the dogs go to paradise later. In that way he seemed quite suspicious of the murderer's role.
