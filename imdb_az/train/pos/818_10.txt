Jedi's return is, of course, the most salient event and is a great result for Star Wars Saga. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> When we come together on Tatooine's opening, we see Jabba's palace, slavery and palm pit, a new home for Khan Solo, set out to get rid of Luka and the bunch, and with Luka's Jedi powers. <br /> <br /> In the end, we are witnessing the great triathlon. They fight on Khan, Leia and Chewy Endor, they are desperate to extinguish shields that protect the Death Star. While waiting for Land to land, Rebel Fleeti, who started with Lando, went into battle with Imperial Fleet and made the final meeting with Luke Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Epic for the Classic Saga has come to an end and is only enough for the first two speeds. <br /> <br /> 10/10
