Liza Minnelli and the well-known comedian Dudley Moore, supported by John Gielquid. Moore is a member of many millionaire families and is a woman of about $ 750 million. In principle, Arthur accepted the terms, but finally he refused to meet the beautiful and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, and he had to drink and drink only prostitution. After a few serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to stay in Susan for a few minutes. The latter was happy for Linda and Arthur, though he knew that the next life would change in the future. This comedy is a good lesson for everyone. Rich people are generally not happy with their lifestyle.
