Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) is a cunning man. Or, as he preferred to call the "dead mediator". She is in the middle of a drunken, female woman and midlife crisis. In a case in Mexico, he thinks he's only reaching a final pitch, but not sure, bumps into a business man Danny White (Greg Kinnear) who does not mind. <br /> <br /> They meet late at night in the hotel bar. Once they have several margars. <br /> <br /> One is similar to a comedy tension. ? But it is not. Instead, Matador is a funny and sometimes touching character. Prevents each bumper from the above suggestion, and sometimes even shoots them to destroy them. <br /> <br /> The man who hit the brosna will inevitably be compared with his Bond, but it's also unfair to both of these. Bond is a half-formed idea, the product of everything else; Julian is characterized by his own motivation and defects. <br /> <br /> When she meets Danny at the hotel bar, she sees on the contrary: a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems. Envy Danny; The cunning man fed his life and, as he put it, saw that he was approaching the inevitable "burn" situation. But when Danny opens his only son's death, Julian tries to change things with a bad joke. He is a man who "flees from any emotion" with his words. Kinnear takes Brosnan's controversial performance and draws Danny White with the delicate attractiveness of everyone. Perfect foil for Julian; the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism, Danny falls into the ground with only one eccentricity sign. <br /> <br /> There is real chemistry between Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> Bossnan and Kinnear have real chemistry. The top three main scenes of the movie are: bar bar; Julian Danny is a bullfighter who tells what he has done for a life and drives a conspiracy; and six months later Julia returned to Danny's home. This scene was well-known for Danny's wife Bean (yes, Bean). Instead of panic in front of a hired killer in his own home, Matador asks only a compelling example of how he respects Matano's symbols, Bean (Hope Davis): "Have you brought your gun?" The scenario is probably not as good as possible after another post. One or two lines seem a bit difficult, and some jokes need a little more work. But Julian and Danny (and then Bean) just talk in the scenes, the writing is superior. Film heroes do not need to be put in a strange situation (except for a meeting with a crashing man) and a cunning man who opens the door. <br /> <br /> <strong> The number of people living in the Caucasus is high. A remarkable situation is that Julian is finding a job in Budapest, because he continues to see himself in the scope of the rifles The rest of the film is about characters, how to interact with each other, and finally, this is about friendship, even in the most difficult place, at one point Julian told Danny that he was the only friend, and that really meant it.
