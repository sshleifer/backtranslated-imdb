One of the things that made Ealing Comedy so angry that it was a clever arrangement. For many contemporary comedies, images that are considered to be absolutely essential are intentional. <br /> <br /> Three are still: Funny combat is just like this. Alec Guiness invent a new piece that will destroy the industry. Half an eleven-year-old businessman invites him to the office to sign a contract that refuses to control the cover for suspension of production. When he grabs it, Guiness climbs back to the door. Two people have closed their way. "Forgive me," he says quietly, taking a step. Two men move between camera and Guiness. Cut it off. In the living room on the edge of the secretary. There is silence until the ringing tone begins to point to madness. She takes her laptop and opens the door to the inner office where the noisy Donnybrook continues and the room is half a mile away. <br /> <br /> <strong> Guiness cut the door open. <br /> <br /> Today could not be an example. At the time of his invention, Guiness builds an accurate chemical apparatus, but instead of turning it into a new piece of experienced fluid, the device exploded. Again, it's bursting again. The laboratory clears all other work. Explosions continue. Ceilings fall down. Windows is blown. The head of the investigation sat on his desk in a small office with a purple dirt on his head. When the door opens behind him, he throws a foot into the air. "Sit down," he says to his guest, "There is something else at all moments." Extremely entertaining - there is no explosion. <br /> <br /> The last example is a series of fast, relentless cuts and is brought together in the right way. Guiness is followed up and transferred to the lobby of an office building by people who want to sign a contract. When faced with two men to fight him, Guiness supports a certain expression. He hits a king with a bucket of iron. The bust moves from the back and prevents the wall. The bust of the wall has a shot lasting for about a second. Another short stroke of a metal sword hung on the bust fell to the ground. Gutin, heading toward trouble, cut her head. The horrific rice crevices and tuding sounds were being heard on the screen and cut to two men looking at the camera. The smile was cut flat on the back. <br /> <br /> <strong> The media did not win with the victory. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> This comedy is good, but it's pretty painful under all the disadvantages. In the solution of some problems, Guiness has created many others. It opposes both leadership and labor, none of which prevails. And, of course, the economic outcome is more than the cloth. "What is the car that works with something or another pinch?" one of the workers asks. Thorstein Veblen says, "She's interested in her interests, just as she nods in her grave." What happens when energy problems are solved overnight? If I own Exxon shares - and I think it - I would not tremble with thought. Where would oil industry be without oil? Where would it be if the police murdered and the FBI offenses disappeared suddenly? This is a nice and very entertaining movie. The list of performers is irrelevant. Joanne Greenwood voiced this voice. The sad Cecil Parker. Ernest Thesiger with sparkling mummies. <br /> <br /> First-class work around it all.
