We ask you all to come to hell from the Todd Shelf! Give 30,000 dollars to shoot a movie and see what you're up to! Boy has 735 zombies and regular shooting to work for FREE! Indeed, the player sometimes laughs. Yes, you will never see makeup. <br /> <br /> This is a clean, good, old fashioned Guerilla movie! Todd is a true profession and around the beautiful person. There are gaps in the field, yes. The plot of the land does not look. But hell, I still love this movie. I want Todd Sheets to come out of the hiding and repeat it. While somebody is trying to shoot a movie, they know that getting it done is an achievement in itself.
