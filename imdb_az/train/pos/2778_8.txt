I saw it a little bit and I totally loved it! It's a pretty typical old-age movie about a pretty atypical girl like Beckham. It plays the role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), Jess, a teenager who is a traditional Indian family living in England and a football affair (for us North American football). <br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship, especially with Jesse Jules (Keira Knightley), her family of friends, especially with her mother, her purple nail polish and her shoes, and Jules' more women, wearing loose clothes and flirting with boys, and having a fear of being told that her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both play games and try to convince their families to go after their dreams. Unfortunately, they also love the same people - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes some difficulties in their friendship. <br /> <br /> Some places like a Beckham Bend clich√©. <br /> <br /> However, the scenes are dragged too long, and this film may have benefited from even more intricate arrangements. <br /> <br /> But this was a humble, funny movie about growing, cultivating, and loving football. This is to strengthen women, follow dreams, and support your friends. <br /> <br /> Do you have any feedback? Contact our journalist at capital@trend.az 8/10.
