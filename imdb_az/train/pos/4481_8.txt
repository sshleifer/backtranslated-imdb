The only reason I have given this movie is not 8/10, 10 but 1) Sinatra is terrific and 2) Desire for Kelly's character, IMHO. Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, the little boy's love. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and beautiful dances I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my beloved and beloved daughter. I am 28 years old and I'm 4 years old, so it's a couple of kids and adults today, though it's less than a mickey character. Kelly is always entertaining, her eyes are entertaining and exciting. I always shoot a show in every movie I've ever seen. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. Paula Abdulin says, "It's no surprise that Kelly's actions are an example, and I'm going to show Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people in the 20th century, and do not miss out on dancing with Kelly's Jerry Mouse.
