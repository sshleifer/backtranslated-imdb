When I came out with Red Hair, I saw Lady and I did not remember it like that. Although the truth is based on a true story, its screen is silly and unbelievable. The essence of the picture is casting. The constellations of some of the best supporting players in the 30s and 40s are always the foundation for Miriam Hopkin's delicate, smart work, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rain, as always, the best thing. Picture. What the actor! He has never won the Oscars, but is one of the best companies in Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps it's the best thing in movies with Red Hair Lady. <br /> <br /> See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
