The film sometimes feels a little, though it is worth it. Gordon leads Vonneguts in a style that remembers the style of writing. Compassionate, thoughtful, ironic, quirky and dark, this is a movie that will stay with you for some time, appealing to these impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are incredible. Sheryl Lee also plays a role in reminding Lynch fans of the Laura / Maddy days. Do not miss this!
