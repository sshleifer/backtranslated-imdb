Designed and adapted by RICHARD BURKS in COLD CHEMICAL. Nevertheless, it is bent over to become a realist, and sometimes more fun than fun. Writer Truman Capote, who describes the brutal killing of a Midwest family, drew attention to himself and his reader by focusing on topics and topics! Brooks, the docudrama, set out on this approach in favor of something close to it. It keeps the distance even though there are movies in actual places. The murderers, of course, have put themselves in their place. They can not be seen as spirits that are misunderstood (as in the Capote book), and the fear of their actions is frighteningly scary. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake may act as a supporting actor, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart, as director (Capote "character"). Landmark photography by the great Conrad Hall.
