She is forced to leave her daughter Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson) because she is sitting behind bars and failing to do herself .One day, five boys - with very little brain power. Anothers Anthony and Joe Russo, welcome to Collinwood (2002). Welcome to the Directors .There is a very comic crime comedy in most cases. Everything can not help when it goes wrong with these guys, but laughs. actors play these characters. William plays H.Macy Riley.Isaiah Washington Leon.Sam Rockwell Pero.Michael Jeter Toto.Andy Davoli Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interests Michelle.Jennifer Esposito Pero's love of interest Carmela.George Clooney (also producer ) Jerzy plays a wheelchair boy.
