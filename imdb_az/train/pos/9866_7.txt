I just saw the ICE AGE, a very funny and particularly beautiful movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are delighted and beautifully released, but it's really a light-emitting digital design design. <br /> <br /> Traditional animated films are really inspired by the truth, and the designs are truly beautiful. the color looks at a surprising use of the world. Sometimes the touches of the reality (especially water-effective) shine, but still a reality-based fantasy world. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine brightly with the technical brilliance, which sheds light on the effective use of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> technical nudity is fun, fun, family friendly and sometimes hilarious funny.
