Again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you to the wild. <br /> <br /> Mumbai's hi-community - stars and starlets, glam dolls and witch doctors, business and brokerage types, and lots of yepin all over. Here is a sharp focus. <br /> <br /> In the form of natural charts, their worlds open up every colorful story with an intelligent sub-plot. <br /> <br /> A difficult star, a pregnant woman, a stewardess and a high-profile husband, is abducted by the producer, pedophile businessman and neurotic wife, journalists and police captain; <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar drills drama kings, dance kings and dead dead dirt. Atul Kulkarni, Boman Iran, and Sandhya Mudul collects a fist. <br /> <br /> Konkona Shan Sharma has been effective as a former criminal prosecutor, but could have been a bit full of business change and party bout. <br /> <br /> High focus (140 minutes of abduction) and freshening movies are worth the money.
