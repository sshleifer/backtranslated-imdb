I saw this "movie" for the first time and I liked it. At 11 I was interested in music and dance. As I was older, I was more interested in actorship. The first half was just a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to Bad), but still fun to watch. Although the kids were pretty good, the Badder might have been the same. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were funny, especially the police officer Michael says that he stopped dancing in a dance floor to dance, saying, "I need you to sign it." But it's "Smooth Criminal" that icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job like toughie (and hairstyle). The dance is perfect and has special effects. It could not have been a murder. If you have not already been, any fan of Michael should see it. I give 10 +!
