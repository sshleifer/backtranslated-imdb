Version: DVD version of Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4. Cantonese / English subtitles <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was cautious with 'The Matrix' and I was still better than Terminator 'Matrix'. I was a simple teenage boy, looking for a good action movie, then a shining light on a television station that did not really follow a small station known as SBS. One night, I realized that a film by Jackie Chan, 'The Police Story', would be later on in the television guide. For the past fifteen years, I just saw the Bronx Rumble and the Rush Hour, and I said, "WOW AWESOME," and sat down to watch and shouted "WOW AWESOME" as the film continued. Two weeks later, after showing the SBS "Police Story" trilogy, I knew I had found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, played by a Hong Kong police who destroyed a huge drug lord, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), was arrested by the police as a witness against Chu and Chan was appointed to protect her. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of the biggest action movies and of course one of my favorite Jackie. Chan movies. It starts with a powerful start and ends with one of the most incredible sequences of action. Everything is great. But some funny parts may seem less than a few people ... <br /> As a story this is still one of Jackie's best efforts. The story for a motion picture is pretty good, and Jackie is a better actor in this game and he's a player and intense 'New Police Story'. <br /> <br /> The Police Story is one of Jackie's best works. Jackie Chan has fun for me and should provide a nice start to potential Jackie fans. The bad news for everyone who first sees this is Jackie Chan's movies - 10/10
