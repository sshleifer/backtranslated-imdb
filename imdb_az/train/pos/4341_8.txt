Who Have Unresolved Issues With Parents? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I always love Paul Reiser and Peter Falky and wondered if their star features may be too big for a small movie, but I was curious about the first scene. <br /> <br /> In particular, he discovered that his son's father was like a father. Peter Falk is a great source of balancing monologue, dedication, and husband. When it did not work well without this scene, the film seemed less attractive to the lesser nuance and character. <br /> <br /> Thank you Paul and Peter!
