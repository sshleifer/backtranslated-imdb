The Islamic Revolution in Iran constitutes all aspects of life, including everything. People still continue their lives, and generally do what you expect, just as you are going to win the World Cup to bring happiness to football teams only. <br /> <br /> Women are not allowed to go to the football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> A very often funny little movie, a small group of women entering the football stadium and a bored small group watch the soldiers stationed on a stick on the edge of the stadium. <br /> <br /> The situation is absurd, the simple desire of these women to work on the team (not everything destructive) and the touch of few people on the life of everybody add a pretty good comment against ideology against humanity. <br /> <br /> enthusiastic movement, good script and dialogue, a really nice movie. Bending like Beckham, the kind - a warm heart and a joy of everyday people's everyday interests and tastes.
