All the dogs enter paradise is another brave kid's movie. Gambling, drinking, death, weapons, and hell are known all over the world, and although the children are very few, adults will beat their heads because they feel like this kind of gangster film. <br /> <br /> Charles Barkin, head of US President Barack Obama's delegation, Carface (Vic Tayback). After being drunk (a dog ... gets drunk ... in a child's movie, it's just strange.) Charlie was deceived by Carfax and was killed. When he is in heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed in heaven. He is still on the ground and meets with his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise) and plans payments at Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has captured a little orphan girl Anna Marie with incredible ability to talk to all animal species that helps her predict the race. Charlie and Itchy release themselves and try to help themselves find a family when they learn a lot about themselves. <br /> This film is one of the non-Disney groups that appeal to both children and adults. The adults will enjoy the funny characters and vibrant animation when you use more beautiful, sweet plot and more commonly developed characters. Something that keeps this is a music. Normally this is a good thing, but music is a terrible horror here. They jump around, along with almost no instrumental support, sounds on the ad slopes. In fact, this is perhaps one of the worst songs I have ever heard in the animated film, but fortunately, the rest of the film is so powerful that it can not fall because of some bad notes. <br /> <br /> The last works of this movie are working, but I honestly hate it. It feels sad, but happier, but happier then it is more sad and a part of the movie is needed. Given that this is worse, I wish the latter would not guarantee later, and would bring a happy, happy ending. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> My rating: *** *** out. 85 minutes.
