Watching the devil is one of the best times of all time in cinema. I was interested in a mixed reaction to the movie - and, according to me, the limit of ideas reflects a movie that touches something that covers a general audience. <br /> <br /> Of course, can some DVDs and filmmaking elements illuminate the DVD? What these include: Sydney Lumet's return film, storytelling, Lumet and Masterson's superior combinations and why it works well, the master's direction, the relatively rare focus Hollywood films are men's characters and, in large measure, the struggle for being an open-access test for women , the performance of Marisa Tomei, under pressure, and, of course, the heart of the film is Hoffman perfect with a central monologue of parts for me. <br /> <br /> Phew! No doubt a masterful film. <br /> <br /> Hey lover - you made it right! - I say no commentary, no interview, no interviews, no additions.
