Yes, I liked this movie when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times because my old father's copy was obsolete because he had to get another VHS copy. <br /> <br /> My family got a VHS copy of this movie. new VHS system. <br /> <br /> As I said, I am not convinced that this movie is a top 10-year-old, but I've been allowed to watch it because I bought a new VHS system. every little boy dream? The film is a great venue barbarian, beautiful topless women, great evil monsters, and jokes that you will get when you get older. So, a few days ago, I put the video and I watched the movie a long time later. At first, I was exhausted, and when I was a kid, I began to think how much I loved this movie and continued watching. Yes, the experience was not as great as I recalled? The player is pretty bad, the story is pretty bad, the jokes are no longer funny, but the women were still beautiful. Yes, I grew up. Although the film's experience changed for me, I still think I'm 7 star. Do you know for good old times?
