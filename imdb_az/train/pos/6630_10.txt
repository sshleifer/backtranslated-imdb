Unlike most recent American movies, this movie is primarily for filmmaking. DVD has many bonus features and there are two comments that explain the film for viewers, which are still visible after first sight. When the film was featured on Sundance, he was very angry and angry with a few audiences. It's not a coffee movie tomorrow morning, but a Friday night party movie. This is a treasure trove for the presented audience.
