Along with this, the "Fistful of the Dollar" is re-organized by Sergio Leono's Kurosavian novel, "Yojimbo" (from the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> This is really B-Movie; it was so much taken, it's pretty nice. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the film has decided to marry the film's "fistula". Lion's "Once Upon A Time in the West" is a sub-plan called 'yojimbo'. Although Leone directed Fistful and West, the motivation behind the two films could not have been different. "Man with No Name" (Eastwood), is a boundary social way with a mild place for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with obscure family and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have much to do with each other. In order to bring them together, Gun Crazy makes it difficult to twist the plan and lose track of the story that actually follows. <br /> <br /> But this B-Movie is full of action and silliness; fun at this level, do not expect anything more.
