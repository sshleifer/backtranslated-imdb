I have not heard very good things about this movie, and I've probably seen a low score on the IMDb, so I missed it. Today, Vanilla Sky has been shown on television and it's not a good thing for me ... and as it turns out, it would be difficult to find something better. Vanilla Sky is a scary, sad and touching movie, in fact it's the best I've ever seen. I was surprised at how impressed I was following her. It's hard to imagine, but it's a part of the movie that you have about your feelings and changes, and a very emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched a very rare way for a movie, or any media. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.
