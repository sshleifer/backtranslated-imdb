In this film, a very different subject was treated. A simple and straightforward description of the local Chinese characters by looking at the daily activities of the public bath, driven by the old owner and his elder son, thinking of his father's death and returning to his elder son's home. Everyone in the city invites you to chat everyday, play games, discuss personal issues, and get honest advice other than ordinary spa treatments. When the old man dies, strong and loyal family relationships lead to the responsibility of the old boy, so the use of public baths is not violated. Finally, the upcoming modernization is the end of this path of spending and equality. The public bath must be demolished, and the place for the commercial complex to be built.
