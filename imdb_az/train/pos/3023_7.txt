This delightful little nouveau has a top cast and very memorable scenes. The great escapism does not pay full attention to original accents. The Spanish characters in the movie are played by a French (Boyer), Belgian (Franc), Greek (Paxinou) and Hungary (Lorre)! And Bacall had to be British aristocrats to turn them all over! Despite these absurdities, speeches are very good - especially Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene, which is familiar with Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre, is a real thing! And I was just like them, though they really could speak Spanish! Brothers Warner seems strange that Los Angeles can not find any Spanish-speaking actor! Of course, Hollywood has often pursued the policy of "do any old emphasis" - Greta Garbo (Sweden), Mata Hari (Holland), who fell in love with a Russian soldier who played my other favorite Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe he should have bought Novarro for the "Secret Agent" - he would be in the role of Boyer or at least Francen (a great deal to the dark makeup budget).
