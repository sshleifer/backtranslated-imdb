A standard high rise of fairy tale, which has several high points. First, Lonette McKee is like a Sister who gives a stunning, starring performance. After all, there is no feeling of great feeling outside of me. Unfortunately, it is a supportive character, and we have to pay attention to the mild character of Irena Carter, that Sparkle is not easy, dull and not convincing. However, when the girls go out and take the stage, the film is returned to life. It is necessary to praise Curis Mayfield's original music. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The picture quality was pretty low, and I also estimated the production values. In general, it is something worthless.
