I love this show very much. I was disappointed to find out that George Lopez was racist recently, and he was put out of the show by Masiela Lusha, because she was an immigrant from Albania but discovered that Latina was not an immigrant. I learned from this in the show. It was really one of the best parts of the show, and so it's really disappointing to learn that you can hate someone for their country of origin in order to know that you are sensitive to racism.
