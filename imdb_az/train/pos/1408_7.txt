Although a Pentagon scientific team seems to have perfected a serum that is invisible, the shell bark can not get the process back when it comes on. <br /> <br /> This is a truly powerful and drunken, powerful, classic HG Wells tradition. <br /> <br /> This terrible is a terrible invisible man's story, transformed into luxurious Verhoeven and Bacon, loonytoon-maniac. Like most of Verhoev√©'s work, the Boy-Own comic-book adventure (the only hidden underground lab of the scientists' work) has a terrific sense of unity, combined with the most terrible and immoral images (groped and attacked by women). an invisible divine, dead beast, the last two reels, verbally with blood and all the massacres). Although the story does not give a new twist to an old idea, CG's special effects by Scott E. Anderson are nowhere vigorous until they see arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones, and body. Particularly, the team is protected from an invisible situation and the scene where Devane drowns in Bacon's swimming pool is completely breathtaking. The film also has a great noise by classic horror-film photography by Jerry Goldsmith and Jost Vacano. Despite the fact that the film was shot from a technical drawback, both Shue and Dickens are sorry for their depth. This is a great fun movie.
