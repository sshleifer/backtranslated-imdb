Some have compared this movie to save. I believe mice and men are more appropriate. Our leading man, Heaton, loves Spike. It's either sex or love. That's why Heaton did not leave Spike. She needs her. They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as a single relationship to humanity. The setting, scenarios, minimal casting are all added to a beautiful movie. Undoubtedly, I did not care for the heroes. But I was interested in what the filmmaker did with them. He did good with them. I spent some time wondering how the end looked like mice and men. Soundtrack and cinematography were attractive and exciting.
