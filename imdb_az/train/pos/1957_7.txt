<br /> <br /> Siron Stone plays Catherine Trammell as Roister Drum like Morrissey. An analyst who is sent to evaluate him after the death of a sports star. <br /> <br /> Trammel is drawn into a charming game he uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The act was good (except Thewlis). The stone really has a role in this role. It is sliquin, naughty, and seductive, and does not look older than its first day. It really amazed me (like Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed a very vunerablitity in a required role. Thewlis was naked. He destroyed his character and was on the whole road. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Do not just see Thewlis.
