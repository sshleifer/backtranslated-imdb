I love Paul McCartney. It's the biggest time in my opposition. Nevertheless, I could not give a ticket to the concert at Tacoma Dome in the US tour. I'm tired to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was as good as it was. Paul is still human and I will love it in the years to come. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. <br /> <br /> Our Prophet (may Allah be pleased with him)
