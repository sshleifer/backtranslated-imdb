In 1975, I saw for the first time in several German TV channels and immediately got involved, and then I watched the movie 12 times in cinemas and had a video track at least once a day - this movie is beautiful in all respects (direction, actor, cutting, music score ...) . "Hartown" dictator Clean Mussolini and Raymond Massey seemed to be the prophecies for the movie in 1936, only in a charming, incredible and best way "hero". <br /> <br /> This movie is a positive signal for technology and progress. These days, usually nationwide retirement standards, especially after watching the movie, are always the last to bring my eyes to my eyes twice. <br /> <br /> It's good on TV, but it's great for the big screen, so some movies have the opportunity to see it. Please, it's great.
