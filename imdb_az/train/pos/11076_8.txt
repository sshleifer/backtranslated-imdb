I'm saying that it's just everyone's worth it! The truth is not what Guy Ritchie has ever expected. Everyone's expectations were cockney geezers and good liners as "dags?" but this is more than the previous one. I agree that it is confused, but all the truths are for us, we need to see them and listen more, this film requires attention! <br /> <br /> Take a look at the cool and sparkling look of the movie, try to listen to the dialogue more than just hitting the performances, and I think that we will better understand the entire film. <br /> The impacts of modern classics (battleships, pulp art, etc.) are original in both directions, and are pacing with no second tracks. I feel that if anyone watches this movie again and again, they will understand it and perhaps appreciate it for a beautiful form of modern cinema and I hope that Ritchi continues to reach that goal, and that's why mockney "masterpieces" .
