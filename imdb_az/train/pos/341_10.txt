I'm really glad of these thrillers! When I finished, I wanted to see it again. Casting was very good, the area was suspenseful and entertaining, and it was just a generic welcome movie! I regard it as one of the best excuses I've ever seen! The girls inside were, in particular, Denise Richards. He was very passionate about the movie and gave some OOMPH his character!
