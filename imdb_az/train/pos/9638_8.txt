This film was a link to a gay man and how to deal with anyone. Her mother is oppressed, her little sister is a pain, her elder sister accepts a bit. Connection looks good with boyfriend / exhooker and she separates from her family trying to make life with this first boy. Unfortunately, the new man takes screws around him and says that does not really mean anything. Our young gay man goes to bonkers and ends at looney bin and eventually begins dumping new lover and beginner. We were together with him and joined in happiness, though we stayed together. Maybe in the future there will be better things for her. The latter was in the queue, but the whole movie was completely real, and I would explain this realistic end to a high level.
