In 1987, it is impossible to believe in a well-known and western rarely known film. It is impossible to repeat other analyzes here. The score is very good and moving. To say the least, "Dawn is never asking" - when it comes to the wonderful ghost and my darling forever will be separate. After 24 years Joel and Leslie still look great. Like Better Tomorrow, Leslie liked Joel and many other films in the God of Kumar.
