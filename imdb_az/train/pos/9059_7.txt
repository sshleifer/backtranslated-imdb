If you do not have a good movie, a good family movie to watch. If you expect this movie to be a word from the book, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about a new boy in Billy. She is betting at school with bully and betting is not like most bets. Billy should eat 10 worms a day or a strange win. <br /> <br /> The player is probably the worst part of the film. Children's actors are exaggerated by many things. If Billy does not eat worms, they consider apocalypse. Hallie Eisenberg, though, did a great job. <br /> <br /> The plot line is as good as a movie, but it arises as a book adaptation. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I could watch this movie without looking at it. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good family movie with some weak points. I appreciate the 7/10 movie.
