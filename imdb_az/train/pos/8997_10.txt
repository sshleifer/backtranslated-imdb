I've seen this movie in several different ways. <br /> <br /> 1st tip: THE GREAT PEOPLE. This film is thought to be an honest-to-good samurai film that joins many old Japanese men and women and medieval Japanese dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2nd Kind: FILM SNOBS. In the short time, two heroes begin to discuss frightening films when adding random images along with their heroes' penalties. These people think that a movie carries an "Independent" nickname, because it will be a very difficult, multifaceted burden that can either be automatically or in English. People only praised this to think that they were then foolish and civilized. When they see this movie, they really are in awe. After anime-inspired sword battles or an overwhelming bloodthirsty bleeding, when you talk to the phone, you cut a dogless dog, which will be terrible, and will go. <br /> <br /> 3rd tip: LIVE WORKS ON THE WORK OR NEW MATRIX-AWARENESS EFFECTS. <br /> <br /> We would like to inform you that it has become one of the many countries. <br /> <br /> These are really people who love the film. They only heard the Samurai's Genius, either by chance, or poured into an unhealthy theater in an alcohol abuse, laughing at all the jokes and eventually thanking for the movie: ENTERTAINMENT. This film was not intended to clarify or encourage deep moral thought, which means (actually, I can draw a dialogue line from the film) to "hit really a donkey." <br /> <br /> So, you depend on which person you are using, you can or can not use this movie; However, if you appreciate why you appreciate the movie and can use a lot of blood and play, watch this movie and make sure you bring your comrades.
