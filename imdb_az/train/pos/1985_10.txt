Normally, music is not my darling, but if I chose to be my favorite, she would definitely be Oliver. This movie is very good, symbols are well illustrated, costumes are good in acting, and I liked the "Situational Review" by Ron Moody, a portrait of Fagin's songs. When I was in the 1960s, I was not old enough to see Oliver, but my sisters were like I had to play bloody songs, usually "Who will buy my beautiful flowers?" I knew all the songs before seeing the movie. I do not think he would have worked very well on his book. I do not think that Charles Dickens will not dream for Oliver's writing to describe the poverty in London; film about whether orphans, working houses and poor people should apply for survival. Another great reason to watch this movie. Bullseye Old type English Bull terrier focuses on long tidy feet, which has been dropped many years ago, and should be hunted down and down to find an example like this and exactly what the British Bull Terrier looks at during the Victorian era. There are traces on his face (Bill Sykes may have used dogs to shoot dogs or rats). Victorian Bull Terrier was a record number in a rat hole. When she realized she had a nice dog in any way and realized that she had obeyed Bill Sykes after she killed Nancy, she did have clear standards that Bill Sayks did not think it was. If you love music, if you have a great music to watch and music If you do not like music, try it all, there is something for everyone in this movie.
