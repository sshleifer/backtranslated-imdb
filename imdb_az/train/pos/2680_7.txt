Lorna Green (Janine Reynaud) is a performance artist for the rich intellectuals at the local club. Like killing those who think that sex is the horizon, it's falling into fantasies as romantic intervention promises to kill. It is possible that by means of a hypnotic proposal, someone (a skilled master capable of drawing a puppet) begins to direct Lorna to kill them where they are found in places where they only appear to be in love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lorna, awakening. <br /> Someone tells me this special job is Franco, elegant and challenging. Now you've probably read other user comments about this movie, so much of it happens in an atmosphere of sleep. Franco pointed out in an interview that Godard was very impressed with his early career and was characterized by a style of film, and we are trying to create a completely different viewing experience. And, as you read here, the reaction of the user's comments is similar to the decision, some of them find it styling, dull and surprising. I will be the first to admit that the film is on my head, even when Franco himself asked the critics watching the Succubus film, confessed that he did not understand the film and manage it! Some say that "Succubus" is simply a "Venera FÃ¼rs", which is more awe-inspiring, by Franco-loyal, who studies his works because he knows something real or imaginable. In a sense, we are experiencing the same turmoil as the hero ... Undoubtedly Succubus is an unconventional film structure, so we know exactly what happened. And many of the many dialogues do not help. "Succubus" is full of beatnik types and "poet-speaking", Corman, "A Pumpkin Blood." My personal favorite scene is amazed at the interference of Lorna with a woman who is interviewed by a woman ... A strange fantasy sequence used by mannequins in an extremely unusual way. Great places and jazz honey ... I liked this movie myself, though I understand why I have a negative reaction. With Lorna, a scene in luxury parties, an exaggerated, violent (and even frustrated) kiss like others.
