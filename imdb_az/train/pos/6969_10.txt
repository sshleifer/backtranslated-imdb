First, this is a perfect array, though we have James Bond effect. I would like to say that the new adventure 007, chronologically at the new Casino Royale 2006, No (1962) is the second, while Golden Eye's first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, as a new replacement for "M", could not be the same as Bond was 14 years older than before? This is more "poetic" license for fraud. If we want, we have to turn our head off a bit. No, the new Star Trek movie does not have primitive electronics about half a century ago. The comics in 1960 were fantasy. (now we call them mobile phones) and have the option to slide the keys instead. OMG, would you think 400 years later, would Rogaine be perfect for Jean-Luc Picard? <br /> <br /> Let's also note that we do not think about creating Cylons 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If so, where did all the shells that filled the original soil come from? We know that technology is available for space jump spontaneous. There was a time when a Cyclon ships were fired in the war against the Caprica fleet, or a ship loaded with a sunbathing or any boat and human laughing Cylons did not just jump out of the ground, but a thousand or ten thousand years, a crippled by ship. They did colonialism, repopulated it, and eventually destroyed themselves, but before finding the ragtag fleet for themselves to search for legendary Caprica, they found a place of colonization for human transformation, finally invented by Cylons. Time paradox? Of course. First, the chicken or the road came? Whose mouth? This is a fun jerk!
