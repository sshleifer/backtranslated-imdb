In the early 1970's, Clifford Irving suggested writing Howard Hughes's latest biography, claiming that he was spending his monthly spending. When all of this was wrong, Irving was charged with accusation and spent a few years behind the bar (though he always accepted his results). An unknown author, a writer named Norma Xuri, entitled "Forbidden Love" (in the US, "Onur Lost: Valentine's Day Fighting Day"), a woman from Jordan in 2000, admitted Dalia as a religious Muslim root according to the death of his best friend, Dalia's mercy. It appeared as Irving's translation of Hughes as a potential dissolution. Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski could not enter the quagmire that Xuri was trying to clean up the lies. Does the film try to explain the truth of Norma Hurry for a 104-minute period, or is it a compulsive libel with vendetta? Interviews include those who know / familiarize him (including the old man, his publisher and others) to the side of this story. This is an irreproachable, well-documented document that manages to direct a lot of fingers to many potentially guilty parties. Saw: Part 84, which has never been rated in any degree, but worried as if it were done in a very bad game played several times (but nothing was done in the episode of torture and the latest torture episode). Not a good option for youngsters.
