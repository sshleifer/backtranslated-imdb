The movie "Same in Som" was probably one of the three most beautiful films ever seen in my life. If I can not win Oscar, I will not tear. This film, in turn, is in a class that can be used to win an Oscars! Dear friend Anders (Nyberg), here you have made a real beauty with your pen! Rock Pollak, your creativity and everyone contribute to the world as a gift to the world. You can say that among these points of access to this world, it is really better to get out of it! I would like to thank all of you for bringing back some valuable memories from a second person of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young minds and today's Beingness are shaped and formed in the form of very beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. I express my gratitude to everyone. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
