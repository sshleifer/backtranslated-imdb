Because the Cameraman's Revenge theme (adultery) or his animation (Winsor McCay introduced this movie Little Nemo) is an unusual short, but because of the story describes errors to say! Ladislav Starewicz wanted to shoot a film in real battles, but they could not do it in the camera because of the hot lights he had taken to the dead and began to use stabilizing methods to manipulate the deceased's movements. This short, motorcycle is doing a good job to put human characteristics on small creatures such as sliding, drawing, shooting, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would do Frogland (1922) and Mascot (1933), but this would be his first outstanding job.
