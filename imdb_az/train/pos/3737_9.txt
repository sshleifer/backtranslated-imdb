First, this film was a wild way from all directions. <br /> <br /> A story that combines the training of soldiers, fighting with their leaders, and eventually bringing together. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is a war drama, for regular debate (sometimes outside), and the horrors of the luggage camp. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the interaction of players were sometimes quite nice and sometimes humorous. <br /> <br /> Bozz (Colin Farrel) is involved with Paxton (Matthew Davis), throughout the story, from the camp to Tigerland and even helping her. <br /> <br /> Innovative free manuscript enjoys a certain taste or movie. Fixed-action, continuous operation and only permanent confusion. Sometimes it was a help. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies, she was more realistic. Some of the points in the film (especially sexual scenes) seemed strange when they did not participate in the film without a movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of the better movies of Colin Farrel (if it does not have the highest performance). Moving for each character was perfect. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
