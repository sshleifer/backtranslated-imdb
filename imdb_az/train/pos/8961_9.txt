Bell, Book and Mum were one of the biggest pop culture phenomena in the mid-20th century, very similar to what we have seen today (70s - more than ten years - still infinite references to this film). This made Novak a great star, Jack put a nice item on the lemon, gave Jimmy Stewart a new light, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new prospectuses to explore their career (both continued to play witches and other "old bats" ), <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Along with the film of the 40's, she also married a Witch (Bellini, Book and Damascus), which helped her to become a symbol of the Veronica lake. <br /> <br /> I rarely mention the movie, Xmas, which is a very interesting alternative to the film, but it is reflected in the Christmas holidays and, despite being a matter of gambling, actually refers to most of the spirit of Xmas (love, family, devotion, etc.) Especially when it is shown after the environment or the holiday season, I always watch this movie (I've seen it several times since the beginning of the 90s). Like man Ribi, he is, at least, radical in his time, even now radical (both characters are characterized by innocence and might), and this always appears before time.
