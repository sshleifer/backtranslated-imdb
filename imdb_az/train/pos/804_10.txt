No, there is another! <br /> <br /> Because each Star Wars fan had ideas on I, II and III topics, and since the idea was very biased, we missed the atmosphere and symbols of the original trilogy. "I'm returning to Jedi" and Prequel a few good bad points will give you points. Of course, I like music, special effects, two droids, but it has been discussed much elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we can do in the original trilogy and in this film: - Strong environmental concerns - Anti-militarist positions - Interesting stories about Jedi Order and Power - Favorite creatures - Smile of Harrison Ford - Murder scene: Vader alternatively and when you look at the emperor, it is close to finish. The lightning bolts' lightnings were reflected on a black helmet. And he endangers his life and seizes his Master to save Luka. It's a boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the Premeli INMHO: - The whole human factor that is likely to shift the original shooting has never been lost - super powers of power on the one hand, many Jedis and many Light Sabers - the experience of several actors on the screen The absence of frequent threats to the consistency of the plot. <br /> <br /> After reading the Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and the power theory described by Yoda, you need to read a few books about Buddhism and Ancient Japan paintings. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is IMHO's main heritage, from a father to a son of a master, although he is heavily dependent on it. "De mon'me à ton åme" (from my soul to you), for the late Zen master T. Deshimaru, like Bejard.
