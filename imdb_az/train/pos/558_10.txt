Classic drama / movement with incredible cinematography western, at the beginning of this time (1954). The production is very good and you can tell it with pride and love. It is very entertaining and entertaining, giving preference to one of the American NORTHT WEST pioneers. This film is very valuable, because most people do not like to see a lot of truth. At this time and on the ground, "lawyers" were very crooked and corrupted as many developing countries. The action sequences could have been even more realistic, but this movie is still very important. The testoterone type for this movie is more for westerns than those with history and philosophy .......
