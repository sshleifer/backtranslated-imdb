S. S. Van Dine should be a rude businessman dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film studio was limited to one or two studio days. However, Van Dine must have sold one of his books on Philo Vance right away. Note that Philo Vance films, such as Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more. Only Tarzan seemed more to come around Hollywood. <br /> <br /> MGM Garden has prepared a Criminal Case and Edmund Lowe played as a fashion detective. Of course, the MGM was under contract with the original Fleet, but Bill Powell was then engaged in The Thin Man, and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is a fairly acceptable Filo Vance. Lowe began to be quite tremendous with a series of films at the tail end of the silent era, with the Price Glory and later with Flagg and Quirt characters by Viktor McLaglen. McLaglen entered the Lowe B picture market after receiving Oscar for Informer. <br /> <br /> Three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt, are involved in the Garden Murder Case. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it has been one of the many countries that have been a few days so far. Vance takes a great chance to expose this murderer and deserves Hitchcock in the last 15 minutes.
