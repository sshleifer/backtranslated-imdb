<br /> <br /> This comedy makes such joyful and light. <br /> <br /> The Keaton comedies, which are sad, tasteful and inventive, exciting, sophisticated and inventive, are ordered in a thorough, rich manner. <br /> <br /> It should be a three-year comedy project. The triple love story will inspire the audience; Keaton's comedy was amazed at Lang's DESTINY or like Ã€ REBOURS. However, during the carrier period, during the Roman and Keaton periods, the Renaissance passes through the waters of the era of Italy and China. The same device works in both films: one, a terrible, exciting melodrama; the other is a light, virtuously paced comedy. In Keaton, this is actually the same pair; and maybe with the same Lang. Both are beautifully beautiful by Buster and Beery. I was three years older and well-versed; <br /> <br /> I just enjoyed the Keaton movie, and maybe it's a great thing. It would be tempting to claim that it looks like ambitious fun, but not yet, but great fun, great fun, is a great fun. Wallace Beery is a wonderful nemesis.
