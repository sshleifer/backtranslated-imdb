Morgan Freeman was something more unusual than George Burns? This film was sure that it was "God." I'm absolutely gracious and all the way through LMAO. Carrey was perfect as anchorman wannabe output, and Aniston is part of the ordinary as well as an incredible girlfriend singing a good game. I do not consider it ugly or indifferent to one another. Carrey became my favorite scene when she opened the file office thinking that she would never be able to save her life. Can you replace the file in the cabinet that holds the miraculous events of the bathrooms - though I'm talking about it. Well written and well-played, this comedy will fall into one of the funniest.
