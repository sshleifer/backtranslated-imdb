The plot of land is as bright as a feather. But here's the classic refusal of boys and girls we've used in "Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat". <br /> Of course, because of the music of the 30s, there is a problem solving problem. The least irritation of a choice of sabotage with bicarbonate soda spends something more than ginger. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The top hat and evening dresses are kept up to the end, which is a refreshing change. Fred and Zinger come again to appeal to the world ... and fleet charm. <br /> <br /> Everyone and everything is a recurring taste. <br /> <br /> The best classical silliness. But with Astaire and Rogers we know that we need to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
