Sex Bender has some things to do for sex x-files. This episode is an interesting point, a good story, but a wishful end. Bender also debuted x-files for actor Nicholas Lea, also known as Alex Krycek. In this episode, Michael plays a man who attacks one of Kindred. You need to see this episode to see Nic Lea's less spectacular. An interesting thing about Kindred's "gravitation." When they get to Marty's victims, they turn into him. But when he cursed Andrew Scully, he was just unbreakable and terrible and not attracted to Andrew. Maybe he has more experience than Marty Andrew. This episode reminds me why it would be difficult for me to hate the British movie in Colombia. Throughout the episode, it was so moist, cool and dirty - it could not have been fun. Despite the disappointment, Gender Bender is still a worthy episode to appear.
