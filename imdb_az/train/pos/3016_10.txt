As a star detective, William Powell turns starch and inspiration, sometimes acting as he goes to the suit cleansers and pushes them together. Mary Astor here is very nice. <br /> <br /> For several years, Powell has played a leading role in Philo Vance in a number of series films shot in several studios.
