Unfortunately, one of the best indicators that did not last a long life was "Father of Honor." And I think it's pretty similar to this show and the "The Simpsons" (though I think it's a "simple life"), but despite the similarities, the show has its essence. The animation is not only adequate, it is incredible, it is good .Notes are the best. All the animals are very unpleasant and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy have their moments. <br /> <br /> Although the show is not very original, I think it has a lot of potential. It was not like Mission Hill, it was very popular, but I liked it, it was not worth it. What a shame.
