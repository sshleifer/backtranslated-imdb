I watched the show 10 years ago and loved it! I'm watching the DVD and watching it, and I've been waiting for the scenes I know (in front of Grace in Lucas House) and I realized it was missing - I was watching it suddenly. Then I crossed the border to check all the BIOSs of the stars, and I came across comments on the shows coming out of the orders. Thank you very much!!!!! But there are some conflicts. Some comments "Strangler 19, then a triangle 20, came back to Potato Boy 5 and Earth Dead 6, when it came somewhere else.
