My personal favorite horror movie. This is the Carpenter kingdom until the last story, which lasted long before the first watching. <br /> <br /> In 1963 on Halloween night, small Michael Meyers kills his older brother. In 1978, All-Hallows-eve escaped Michael Smith Grove sanitation. On Halloween night, Michael came home to kill him again. <br /> <br /> The story is perfectly simple, Michael kills the babysitters and the handle. No bells or whistles, just basics. Carpenter is a very strong atmosphere of fear that creates tension. As with any great fear film, the events are telegrams for a long time, but still happen in a random manner, and will not allow viewers to predict the film. <br /> <br /> Dark lighting, long-lasting - camera shoots, and (most importantly) this damn creepy music creates the most claustrophobic and negative scenes I have not seen in the movie yet. There is a body count, but then slides are relatively small compared to the speed. Most of these and the murders are almost bleeding. Fear not die, but without knowing it. <br /> <br /> The act of playing is good. PJ Soles provides most of the movies with limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns into a decent performance, and then (then) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. It looks shy and inaccessible from the beginning, but is not ready for what you are experiencing with frustration and insecurity, which is ideal for character. Of course, there is Donald Pleasence, the perfect cast as Dr.Sam Loomis (perhaps a bit unstable) assigned. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a dangerous defect, this is the passage of time. Many years before the release of this movie, countless clones, duplicates, rip-offs, and imitators came and stole movies best-of-bible (usually bad) until nearly everything is familiar. Many films combined with changes to the expectations and appetites of the audience are sparseness of the raw material. Today and at the age of time, to really appreciate it, it should not be forgotten, as it was once. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not always a little, I'm looking for this movie, it's awful. Top executives. <br /> <br /> 10/10
