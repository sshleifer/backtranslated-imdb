I do not know how much or why it does not like about this IMDb. <br /> <br /> In this film is a work that begins with "I am interested: Blue". <br /> <br /> If you do not like the movie process in this movie, you will be able to <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: <br / <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <a href="http://www.worlds.com/"> <BR> <BR/> The most important thing about this film is that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. A political document about the Swedish public system, which is a political document in Sweden. <br /> <br /> Interview with a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A film about a film director, Vilgot Sjoman, in a film about his relationship with the star and He said he did not have anything to do with the people he had to work with. <br /> <br /> The film by Vilgot, a documentary film about a young woman, Lena (IE # 2), a young and politically active (IE # 1). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After a few hours you are watching an interview on politics, then you see what the interview is doing behind the scenes, but sometimes it is as good as you forgot the story. <br /> Dynamic between "Yellow" and "Blue", you'll see someone else. "Blue" is not completely durable. <br /> <br /> Think of it as a "yellow" live, consider the events of 14th. scenes. A complete fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Among all the things you think of "Blue", amongst the 14 scenes you have not seen "Yellow", this is a story full of reality. They are parallel films ... the same story, in two different ways . <br /> <br /> I saw the first 30 minutes of the "Blue" and I realized that it changed because I looked at this movie because it was useful to people who were afraid of different influences. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
