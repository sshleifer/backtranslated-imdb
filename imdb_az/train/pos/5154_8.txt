As WW2 / Nazi Germany's amateur historian, I did not expect DVDs to appear. When I was first in 2003, I missed it. I do not want to repeat what is stated in the historical inaccuracies in the previous 8 pages. A better job could have been described as "attractive" Hitler. I had a minor problem with casting options for their performances, not for their players. Peter Stormare does not look like Rohm, why did Babson wear a wig? And my biggest complaint ... Hitler has always been the eyes of Hitler's visible blue eyes, why not transferring blue contacts with Carlyle? From now on, I thought the actors playing Goring and Drexler seemed pretty good. Again, people watching it do not think that this should be the 1st type of entertainment, and that there will be many damages in the 2nd.
