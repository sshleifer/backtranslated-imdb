This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo still plays Anna Christie, but all other characters have different actors than the English version. They both returned, because Garbo had such a person in Germany. Garbo himself likened this version to Anna Christie on the English version. This is a good tale and a must-have for the admirer of Garbo.
