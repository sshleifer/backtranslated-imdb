A few years ago, a friend gave one of his friends a video of Michael Mann's movie "Heat". After finishing the film, after we got up, there was another movie we found, and the owner of the cassette tape did not write it. However, we were seated at a different opening, which was deprived of our loans. <br /> <br /> After some two hours, I wondered: did not I hear this masterpiece? .. <br /> <br /> This film was Europa. Lars von Trier drowned from the dead, deliberately detached from the reality with a clear group, but often I saw that it was similar to the post-war German photographs. And then trim hard! <br /> <br /> The story itself is a moral odysseey that does not have a happy ending. A young German-American pacifist of German origin comes to Germany after the war and intends to do a good job of paying homemade bomb. However, he is often accused of defamation and self-destructive behavior. He begins to work with the whistle-blowing car company (Mitropa modeled), working with Zentropa, one of the Nazis workers, from the occupation whistles. Hero is later turned into a lover of the Nazi war terrorist with her daughter. <br /> <br /> When the world (or only the Europeans) does not understand it, in anger, it just shoots a railway bridge under a train that it has just saved. <br /> <br /> As a last resort, for the sake of honesty, the real world was, in fact, the ultimate Nazi propaganda coup that the Kurds did not have anywhere as the film intended. The SS declared the creation of all legions of sabotage and terrorists who were ready to fight the lines, Kurtadam, after killing the Allied occupation of Aachen's presidency two months before capitalism. However, several hundred Hitler youths had only a few training sessions, and some of them were killed for the murder of suspected communists and violent foreigners in the Bavarian villages. <br /> <br /> But the wolf's propaganda had a great impact on the occupiers. Everywhere they were afraid of the Kurtadam, they were suspected of any serious accident, but another reason was later found (not considered by some new pseudo-historians). For example, a gas tank exploded in Bremen bombing Police Station, or a Soviet military commander died in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The effect was the strongest of the Soviet Union. They are "preemptively" suspected of being a "werewolf" (many of whom are children!) And many of them have been jailed in prison camps.
