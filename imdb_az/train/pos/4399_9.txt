The shortest way to describe Satan and Ride is by word: original. I will not repeat what has already been said about this magnificent movie, but I would like to tell you the story of the film's history and, of course, the care of the crew. <br /> <br /> As a student of history who has been acquainted with the cycle and the adoption of this film, this product is one of the most accurate fictional films about "Kansas bleeding". Yes, there were freedoms related to actual events, because there are many works of art. The overall feelings of the movie are original. <br /> <br /> Indeed, suits, original attitudes (no PC hindsight here) even the actors appear genuine. Despite being drawn in the middle of the 19th century, Jewel Kilcher (a small part of the film). <br /> <br /> Some of my chatterers have expressed their views in a stylized dialogue. In the 19th century, farmers do not believe that they will speak as poets. <br /> <br /> The 19-year-old American public community is surprisingly talented and silent in this verbal silence. These people were removed from Shakespeare and the Bible in King James Version. The screenwriters have rebuilt the most oral verbal styles of these people, depending on the time documents. Stylized dialogue is only added to the magical atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> However, in addition to a historical document, this film also works at a visual level. Performed in beautiful illustrations, it goes back to the days of the great western epos. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - moral and ethical conflicts. There is everything in this movie that a different movie might want. <br /> <br /> During these years, many of America's most beautiful artifacts, such as Beauty, have been buried by an unusual studio system. But I am sure that in the coming years Satan and Ride will be given. Rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
