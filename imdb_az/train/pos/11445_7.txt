A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work is to see the work of Rivers and Tides supporters on the move. Goldsworthy develops an assessment for every stone, leaf and thorn he uses to build his works. Goldsworthy describes how life flows, rivers, and waves work. Although the film is happy to cover the majority of Goldsworthy's (snowballs) numbers, I feel a bit lonely. Filmmakers have done a wonderful job to bring Goldsworthy's job to life and created a wonderful film because of the joy of watching.
