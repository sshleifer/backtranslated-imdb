From his birth he had two children with his father's gun. <br /> <br /> Jamie was married to an aggressive husband, Danny Glover, who was coming in the next years by Whoopie Goldberg. <br /> <br /> The life of the bride was humiliated by her husband and sister and, therefore, was quickly removed from Chelsea's life. <br /> <br /> Because Celia continues her hopes, the story may one day reunite with her sister and her children. <br /> <br /> During his lifetime, he is a difficult character as a brave wife, including his son, including Sophia, and a loud and cheerful singer Shug who teaches something or two about love, Speilberg's direction is brilliant cinematography and some excellent performances.
