The first part of the series of horrors coming from this horror was discovered by the manufacturer and was designed as a full-size video camera task with a digital counter at the bottom of the frame. For a few days he presents a woman kidnapped by a group of black naked men who tortured her before killing her. <br /> <br /> The unhappy victim is beaten with pride and her nails are not beaten with scabs in advance, she is beaten with hammer, her eyes tightened with a needle, and so on. <br /> <br /> The most breathtaking scene, the female enthusiasts burn her with warm water and release sparks to the burns. American actor Charlie Sheen, who believes that the series contains genuine murders, has taken a great propaganda while trying to ban the spread in the United States. Most FBI investigators have shown to the audience that something that has led to the rebuilding of the disease - using wrong, but obviously, special effects. Staged by the famous Japanese comic artist Hideshi Hino, who directed the third and fourth episodes, this film is a reliable way to clear everything, not the most tolerant of the rooms. But gorehounds can not find anything special.
