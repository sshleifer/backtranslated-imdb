The film was a romantic drama based on three sisters who want to be a really famous girl band. In their deeds, the oldest brother responds to a drug dealer and a street hustler named Sister, because he believes that it is a "great time" to give "everything he thinks he wants to get out of life." Although he is accused of killing him, he really kills his soul and is forced to live, and then leads to drug addiction and ultimately dies from many doses. The story is about the street life or the Italian mobster that they are trying to buy, but then threatens them, when love is described in songs and styles, how they can overcome the worst tragedies of life, and when they try to "discover" the young women's time.
