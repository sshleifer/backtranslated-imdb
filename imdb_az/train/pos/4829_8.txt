The 63-year rule of Queen Victoria is one of the most documented and popularly-regulated historical monuments in the history of Britain. On the one hand, his story does not have a theater of the previous royals due to the change of social climate and behavior, and his story continues to be particularly human. Director Jean-Marc Vallée, who enjoyed previous years of his life with German romantic Albert Albert, remained just as uncertain about the industry's uncertain shadows. It is very important for her legacy. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it has become one of many countries on the one hand. Shortly five or one years between Albert's rise and marriage, Young Victoria offers fewer periods of this nature, and instead of Vallée, one of the lesser known confusion of Victoria's early age, but does not try to extend the life of such a figure, although it is a feature that can hate historians with flippant compared to the facts and the like, but now writer Julian Fellowes uses weapons to prevent any document from gaining an attractive story and describes a bit romantic, yet convincing. <br /> <br /> Vallée takes it and runs it, but it can also restrict enough to fully capitalize these elements, in the scope and watchmaking view. <br /> <br /> Most of the joys of watching the young, Victoria, but here, from the early 1800s, Regal describes the production values ​​that bring Britain into a living reality, which is rarely genre was surprised by his films. Everything from suit designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography emphasizes more than just a wonderful backdrop of Victoria's story. Indeed, when watching Vallée's explanation, it is very difficult to succeed with aesthetic means of penetrating the visual element; The Fellowes-in script is very subtle, but still has a personalized tone of the movie that works more. Not to mention the works of Schubert and Strauss in the story of Victoria and Albert is not only a place to play with symbols, but also elegantly and in contrast to composer Ilan Eshkeri's works. <br /> <br /> The only important thing here is that for all the wrong compositions, lightweight funds and the perfect suits that violate every field, most dramatic dramas are the performances of this game and how they help the world to survive. Thankfully, Young Victoria is blessed with a clean ensemble, both young and old, and it's just a fantastic job to do. Among the sweet, romantic romanticism of some antagonistic struggles by Viktoria (Emily Blunt) and Albert (Rupert Dude) and his advisors and others (led by the awesome Mark Strong and Paul Bettany), the floods and heat dissemination in the Fellowe scenario, > Despite the fact that the film is "beautiful in this respect," it is perfectly conveyed by all the participants who help keep it as a widespread event. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's hard to blame a job like Young Victoria. It is an interesting source of interest to the spectators who are attractive to such details as they have some of the most important historical romanticism. Of course, the world of cinematography can not get through the storm and does not have any significance for its total existence, which is more than the romantic period of drama that limits it to evolution; But in a sense he likes it. Vallée never looks to work for grandeur, nor does it appear to be a piece of escapist trail for enthusiasts. To be sure of the place in the middle of the gray, young vantilia, fans by ordinary production and a little more disappointed; <br /> <br /> - Reviewed by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net).
