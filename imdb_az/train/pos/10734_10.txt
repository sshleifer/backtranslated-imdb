HELP! WOW! <br /> <br /> This film is the best live decree of what's happening in New York City on 9-11-01, compared to what's seen in the most massive media outlets. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie shows you what's happening in INSIDE. <br /> <br /> This shooter will start with a New York ceasefire, waiting for the first big fire to be called for battle. The subject will be ONLY ON THE FIRST PLAN TO SEPARATE CROPS. Later, firefighters set up a front seat for the Tower One lobby. <br /> <br /> In the minutes ahead of the crash of the second aircraft and the subsequent fall of Tower 2, firefighters sounds to the crowd in the lobby. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> we should never forget. <br /> <br />
