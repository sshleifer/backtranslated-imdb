Those on the disc are the first degree indication of the first band. This disk is not for the sake of the heart ... music is pretty dense and very cool. What will you learn when watching this movie? Why it was too long for a long time. Their notes are great, but their demonstration was overhead. When this concert was held in 1969, the jolly bean bells jumped at Beatles and went on for a long time and often spectacular views of musical virtuoso groups (and audiences) - the intellectual interests of several audiences settled by Britney and Christina at the age of music is. Especially, what we have learned here are wonderful things that can happen when talented musicians are encouraged to improvise. Abandon the concert, it's really beautiful.
