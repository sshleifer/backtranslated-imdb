I was surprised at night after seeing the "Whipped" movie at a distributor at AFM. The audience laughing in all their ways. Unfortunately, every country was sold, so there was no way to get movies, but I really would be a big hit in this country and in the sea. Instead of being "whipped" instead of "Sex and City", it does not take very seriously, it makes a satirical satire. "Whipped" the most comedic comedies are enjoying relationships that do not dare. Additionally, the film, shown in the AFM, had more plot and story than "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and City". "Whipped" did not slow down for any period and provided spectators with non-stop comedy. The performance of Amanda Peet and the others left the film, so the film made the budget more effective.
