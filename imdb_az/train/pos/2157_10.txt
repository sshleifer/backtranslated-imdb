Okay As you can see, this is one of my favorite movies. It is a character drama that is totally hilarious. The main character is a businessman with "same thing, different day" mentality. Every day she sees a mixed woman from her own dance shop in a dance studio and is glorious about her and decides to give her further information about her. She is not an instructor, she decides to join the dance class. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: > This movie has been rebuilt with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new one is actually no good for the original. The film has never been great in America because it has not been featured in Oscars since the television broadcast in Japan (movies can not be broadcast on television or disqualified for Oscar nominations). The best film, gallery, director and so on. He won numerous awards for his Oscar Awards in Japan.
