Beautiful movie, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives a striking performance on the success, aging, loneliness ... and the declining actress who is dealing with alcoholism. She tries to escape from her subconscious imaginations, which is embodied in the death spectrum of a young girl. The overall objective of the film is to accept the human condition. There is no parallels between the drama and the film itself: when the scene is for the hero. All American movies can be of high level, dealing only with adult human relations, trying to understand and standardize emotions ... One of the best dramas. 10/10.
