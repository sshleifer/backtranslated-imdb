I do not write a review about IMDb for the longest time, but I had to write it down! While watching this movie, I found a special research that encouraged people to avoid watching this movie. Do not pay attention to these ignorant people! A fantastic movie full of laughs and nothing more than a dream! Are you sick and tired of feeding the same old bubble garbage movies? Sometimes something like a movie comes and gives you something you have never seen before. There is no need to love the movie (even though you hate it), but nobody has the right to condemn the film. It has a significant influence on the IMDb reputation and needs to conceal any negative details of the film. Just say what he hates and why he hates ... but do not tell them to tell people. <br /> <br /> If my decision is better, more people will use it differently than those who hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Treat your vision for a little eye dessert! CANCER!
