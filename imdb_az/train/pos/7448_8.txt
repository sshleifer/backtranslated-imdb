For a long time, I have not been very laugh - especially in the film, when there are honest and serious changes in the movie, there are some impressions. Heroes are often very often, sometimes cheerful, but very convincing. I'm not an admirer of the Jerry Springer show - I apologize for the people I've attended. This movie is a satire and great work instead. <br /> <br /> This film is pretty bad when it comes to public television, all the expeditions. <br /> <br /> I'm going to rent this movie to enjoy it. <br /> <br />
