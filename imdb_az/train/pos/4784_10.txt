It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is Robert Farnsworth's simple, beautiful, daughter-in-law <br /> <br /> Finally, in his last role, he begins to show that he is a good player. It's hard to believe that it's David Lynch. Slow and even sweet and vibrant. As long as the car is not loved, the best of scenes and violence.
