There is a very good point: "Only a few elite (upper class) can go to the internet and also communicate on a site like English speaking IMDb." Some people think the internet is not a reality, but from this point of view. Chavez's supporters, even if they have an internet cafe in Venezuela, will not even rent a half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You are probably the first time you use the internet for a fascist upper rich wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors screwdriver.
