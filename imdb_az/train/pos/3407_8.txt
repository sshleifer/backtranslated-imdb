Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer make a splendid speech in this beautiful but empty movie. This irony is that Dietrich will play a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Truthfully beautiful movies and sets, and yes, Dietrich's awesome dresses are also incredible. It looks fine; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <span style = "color: red;"> A good score by Max Steiner and a good support player. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Movie 76 minutes and looks badly corrupt, and some characters simply appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut is brave as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith plays the old priest, Lucile Watson's mother, Tilly Losch dancer, John Carradine diviner and Basil Rathbone .... not sure. He comes out of the wilderness and destroys everything! According to others, John Gilbert was scheduled to star in Dietrich. I can not help, but I think it would be nice. The role of Boris in the world would fit well with the great Gilberte. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Of course, she looks beautiful and carries some fashionable clothes. <br /> <br /> My favorite Valentino is like an outfit like Shiek put in the pool. <br /> <br /> Certainly, you have to look at the loose sets and colors and the two big stars.
