"A Guy Thing" can not be classic, but a good, funny comedy. The plot draws attention to Paula (Jason Lee). She sleeps in the morning after having no memory and lies naked in the bed of Becky (Julia Stiles). Until she can not understand what's going on, she pulls Bekky out of her apartment, because her fiancee Karen (Selma Blair) comes. Then, as you can imagine, chaos occurs. <br /> <br /> Each scene of "A Guy Thing" laughs louder. The most entertaining moments are when Pavel tells Karen what to expect. Selma Blair is truly a talented comedian, and the worst thing about this film is that he is unfounded. Although it turns out to be more interesting than the character of Stiles, in fact it is not interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not a classic, but it's also not bad, 7/10.
