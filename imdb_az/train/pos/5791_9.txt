<br /> <br /> This is one of the favorite Twilight Zone episodes, first of all, according to the description of the two souls in the apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> The streets of Kobweb-out and the rubble streets are heartfelt. <br /> <br /> Although it's a bit of a hard approach to today's drama standards, this is a great situation - using a setting to make a statement about human experience. as well as geopolitics in a timeless fashion. The whole drama stands alone on Bronson's and Mrs. Montgomery's shoulders, which is not disappointing. <br /> <br /> The real classic.
