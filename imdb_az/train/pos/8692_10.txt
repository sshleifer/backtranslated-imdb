I loved to watch it. I did not know it was a bigger part. I have to be 6 or more while on TV. I just thought it was funny, and for some reason, I had a profound glamor for something that the president had in the bath club. My parents pulled out this TV channel when it was first broadcasted on NBC. In the bant, along with a few others, there was an old Sanka coffee trade. Soon, I'm planning to return home sooner, and those who want a copy will try to write a cash register on my computer. If one of you wants to contact me, I think you can feel free to do so on the IMDb website. When I display it in digital format I will update and inform you.
