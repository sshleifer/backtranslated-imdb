With CLAIMS: <br /> <br /> I really love this movie, though I'm really a minority on this subject. It is not classic, but it definitely takes place and quite adrenaline shifts. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, I have not seen the reason you liked it. It says to me that the strongest fans of this movie have not seen the original version, and so there are very few people to compare. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but I've been into a lot of things and actually wanted to see me as genuine. <br /> <br /> There were a few things I liked about it. One was Kowalkski's fall. Viggo Mortenson was perfect and actually brought a lot of charisma to the roles. Because most of the film fell on his shoulders, he really had to be excellent and that was it. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about the point of sale is television. There was no such situation when watching this. <br /> <br /> It looks like a great movie for me and I can not say if I ever see a big screen. <br /> <br /> I also found that the story was too much to swallow. I am not the only one for action films, but I have come to this question. Of course, drama, mysticism, a love story, and an action film that turned into a person interested. (Even I did not know Priestly). This also touched. <br /> <br /> This is not a big movie, but it can be watched. <br /> <br /> And then it's over. It is a powerful blow, and it is very difficult to end if a person's story is intrigued by this point. I do not know how I feel the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Kovalkski survived and, nevertheless, I doubt that it would be possible, and this is a film, <br /> <br /> In the end, it's incredibly unreal, but I usually do not like it, but for some reason, I would like to say that I'm dealing with a kind of manipulative type that has been postponed in this movie. Let's admit that many things just belong to the field (the villains could already be stereotypical?) But manufacturers have a lot of rights, even though many things are wrong. However, by saying this, I will admit why this version of one of the greatest admirers of the original can accept why, because I did not see the original, and saw many original films I love to be rebuilt with terrible consequences. <br /> <br /> People compare it with Smoky and Bandit. But I can understand low prices. Is Thelma and Louese responding to a version of the Fall's Legend? I am convinced that the touch of both films (both of which are my admirers). But I do not think it's a big movie. The average for me was better, but it was very good. But it was a burning, touched film of adrenaline, filled with a great masterpiece. My vote is 10 to 7.
