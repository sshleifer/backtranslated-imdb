Neil Simon had the ability to communicate, and nowhere else is clearer than the lines of WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON, as opposed to OLED COUPLE - comedy and disappointment, an apartment of two friends who are totally disagreeing with these two inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> Lemmon speaker Felix Ungar agrees that his wife divorces suicide after divorce and reluctantly shares with some of the disastrous consequences of an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau). Felix says that everything is said by Felix and the Oscillator does not drive on the wall, nor can anyone follow the path, and Oscar is the most attractive man imaginable and Felix is ​​the opposite. <br /> <br /> The most delicate scene for me is that in the apartment above, Pigeon sisters visit on a meal day. The priceless interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you on the stitch. The Talented Pigeon's sister is a gals for Disney's Gabby Sisters at ARISTOCATS (a pair of sounds) and here's a comic film of Lemmon's hopelessness enough to make the film unpleasant - if you're a Neil If you are a fan of Simon and use other screen treatments for his work, this should not be missed. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly drawn (although they play a role before filming) and, of course, it's easy to see why it's the best television show ever. <br /> Simon's comedy should not be missed.
