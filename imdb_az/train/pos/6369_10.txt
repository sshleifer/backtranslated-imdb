I liked this movie! I have never seen a great Disney admirer, but I really liked it. The action continues at the start of the movie and it's just going on! This is a bit far for Disney, they do not spend enough time to develop their character (my husband is a sign) and there are no music numbers. Definitely a moving adventure. I love it all and advise everyone who loves Disney, they are young and old.
