This sweep drama has all of these: top notch action, incredible photography, good story. Both films are often compared to "Braveheart", as it occurs in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think this is better than the two movies. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (an Oscar nomination). The role of Liam Neeson is fantastic. Tim Roth plays one of the worst, dreaming characters in the film's history (he was nominated for an Oscar nomination). John Hurt has another unpleasant character as Lord Montrose. I'm always surprised by the incredible number of characters John Hurt can play. Rob Roy and his tribe, and Lord Montrose, is a story about a dispute over money. Rob Roy is a man of his own, who will not solve his problems with Montrose. Montrose, who inherits his head, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is about; the general man's dignity of corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining and should appeal to everyone. There is a romance, action, beautiful scenery and an exciting area. One of my favorite films.
