This film was resonant with me at two levels. As a child, I planted homeowners who were evacuated from London and did not want a village village. I escaped from the bombardment and had valuable memories (for example, a nightmare reads the dark night for the first time), and I had the experience of enjoying a lifetime experience in London, and I missed my family and worried about them. Tom died as his wife and child, and an elderly man living alone in a small country village. Now I'm still alone as an old man without a wife who remarries her children and lives far away in another province. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with only one idea of ​​raising a child. After a deep compassion of old Tom Oakley and this young man, Tom continues to look for him and finally rescues him from a strange and dangerous situation. At the end of the story there is a great tension. For some bureaucratic judgments, it is believed that the child is losing someone who is loving him.
