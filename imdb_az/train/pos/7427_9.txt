While watching a 70-year-old movie, I only saw the novel of this movie when I was 16 years old. Oh! How excited I am and my best friend. We will not wait until this month. I watched this movie 17 times in the theater this year. I love, love, love. Chris is so perfect for the movie. He is sad and animated but shy and uncertain with Babs and it is very pleasing to watch it again. In his studio, he is always singing, but unlike perfect notes from him, he sounds with his voice, but I think it's one of the best scenes of the movie. He looks at him and is so proud of him. Every day I could watch this movie. When I tried to dress like a dress, I even had a long linen and a jacket, as she wore. In the meantime, I came to the television and took my daughters to watch the teens and loved her. Perhaps you were so captivated at a time when you did not know that everything was too extreme. Today is always tears in my eyes.
