'Gun and Man' is one of the most funny shows of the show, and this production is doing a good job. Helena Bonham-Carter, a pre-movie star, a fianc√© (Patrick Ryecart) and a soldier's shelter for a soldier's shelter during a raid in a city (Pip Torrens), is a daughter of a military family. <br /> <br /> leads to the rapid expansion of production, and Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit, as the servant, leaves the rest of the boat somewhere. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen make them happy as parents and the whole game is generally happy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
