I absolutely loved this movie! I'm not related to any other comments I read about it. Every second I enjoyed it! <br /> <br /> I focused on the story, the strongest action and the point. Every time I'm close to the end of the movie, I'm gonna splash. Although the story was nothing but "scary" about it, I went through all the movies and my evening parts. <br /> <br /> I've had a very nice selection ... casting, scenario, small bits of scattered inside. There were many points where the movie could go for cheap excitement, but never did it, and for me, this film has put a lot of mediocre excitement over recent occasions ... and for the past few years.
