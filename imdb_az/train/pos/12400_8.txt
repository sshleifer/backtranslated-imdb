This is the second Animatrix short, and the first one is called "artistic". There are many references, metaphors and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially during a 9-minute process. I heard some complaints that it was "against people" or "hatred for the car" I tried to hate people. I do not think this is true; we use only robots to show us, as a human being, we do not particularly accept or openly oppose everyone who is different from us. I can say that this is a great deal. The field is good ... it is a historic document repeating the event that has led to one of the major conflicts in trilogy. So, the so-called news and so on. Contains some clips. If there is not much, the moving sound is very good. The animation is beautiful and typically the use of color, even with the realistic style of painting, is more open to smooth transitions and other surreal imagery. It has a few bits of powerful violence and entertaining visuals as well as a little nudity. The disc needs to be read in English, not subtitled and interpreted in English. There is also a good and informed structure based on both sides, so it's advisable to watch it after seeing the next one. I recommend this to everyone who has the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
