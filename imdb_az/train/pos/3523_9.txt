The director is a strange and brilliant combination of secretary to rescue the chief of the electricity department by watching a secret "treacherous" woman like a secret and scary sculptor between Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines. There are also some interesting pieces that Elisha Cook Jr plays as a trapped drummer with drugs and other symbols that constitute part of the assassination. If you use Raines to make it even more efficient, it is allowed to enter the scene, especially with Cook. Fran√ßoise Tone also plays a very different one, and though it is not a convincing part, it works philosophically. Though conspiracy is very subtle, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
