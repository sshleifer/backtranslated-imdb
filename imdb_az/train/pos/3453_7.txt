Although this movie has a list of excellent players, a great storyline full of exciting effects and surprises, it has not been taken to the studio distribution and has gone directly to the DVD. Perhaps this contains many "anti-police force" information, or maybe a lot of leakage during a gluten, but, fortunately, the concept of release to the DVD, regardless of the big screens, > The subject is old: the rotten reporter is in the police who violate corruption - in this case, the FRAT (First Response Team and Tactics) group, the city of Edison's downtown crime scene, narcotics, prostitution, A very well-trained police team created to clean up. 15 years after the opportunity and money laundering, 15 years after the FRAT murder, drug trafficking, insulting innocent people, and so on. is responsible. The lead dog Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, a terrible real gangster) and his partner, Rafe Deed Cool J, can prove to be more buff and sensitive actors than ever before. Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) has a "bad mist" wind and reports the theory of fraud and corruption that his writer made to Ashford (always trustworthy Morgan Freeman). Gradually Polack Ashford and later Wallace (Kevin Spacey also consistently subtle character actor) and assisted Pollack in reporting this investigation. <br /> <strong> Pollack, the truth is that more surprises and bad things happen, and the story turns into a shopping mall until unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake, especially experienced actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott will end a well-finished car of a movie. No, it's not a big movie, but it's about to shake one edge of the seat movement with a message. Grady Harp
