<br /> <br /> The only reason we came to this movie is the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend watching it, despite your love. <br /> <br /> We like Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard, as a man and his companion. The film illuminates enough, but Coop plans to use her daughter to earn a lot of money from her first boiling, but when she sees a girl and sees her discipline she will be more dramatic, choosing her to protect her. <br /> <br /> Pirate and Lombard are good and Shirley is still trying to steal her scenes. It also has little music and Shirley has only one song. However, it is worth watching with this entertaining and LITTLE MISS MARKER.
