For those who do not know the topic of Kusturica - the continuation of the West's ongoing attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will not be possible to understand its narratives. This persistent theme, which is expressed as a fantasy and furious comedy, is that Kusturica's mandate is chosen. Since his film is a fantastic work and Magnum Opus' Underground, Kusturica's Black Cat White Cat film is a miracle of life and has recently been promoted by 'miraculous' carnival-style Balkan culture with its ambivalent come and attack the traditional case. In the case of "Tell Me," the city (city) and the village (paradoxical) world (traditional idiom) are contradictory. The urban world reflects the western features of the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a perverted sense of identity and disrespect to traditional values ​​- as a young child - an expression of the peasant. The end of the film, as we have seen in a funeral mass and a wedding on one-sided soil, gives an example of this. They are capable of collision; accordingly, the wedding, which represents the life and the pulse of the village, is to deal with funeral ceremonies, which traditionally values ​​the death of the tradition in this context. But Kusturica shines this theme with its unique, stylistic uniqueness. His treacherous and luxurious style serves as a tool in his description.
