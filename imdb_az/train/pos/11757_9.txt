Robin Williams and Kurt Russell in the 1930s decided to repeat their heart failure with rivals Bakersfield (Russell a little unwittingly), threatening the players. Williams is okay, but Russell's flat-out as the legendary Taft Quarterback Remo Hightower is great. Holly Palance is Williams's spouse as a beautiful and attractive turn, it lives without rematch. The film is looking only to see Remo. Be advised.
