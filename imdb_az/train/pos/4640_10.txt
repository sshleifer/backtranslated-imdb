One of the best films I've seen in the last two years (the first time I saw the end of the war in Israel in Tel-Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006), has led to warfare for a long time and is for boys and girls, flat and gays, Jews and Arabs it does not matter ... I have seen Bubble three times now and still a striking and exciting sight - every character is one of the many people I know and reminiscent of the difference between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... Last time I saw it - my friend, was a Christian Arab, and was on the day of Israel's independence (most symbolic I know!) and ... finally cried! - touched and embarrassed - everyone would be touched by Bubble!
