Meryl Streep is such a genius. Yes, at least as an actress. I know it's fun because it plays a lot of accents, but it always emphasizes. His performance, like Lindy Cemberlen, inspired him. Here, Mrs. Chemberlen was particularly fond of, and as clever as described here. But this makes Steppin's work even more remarkable. I think he deserves more than 10 Oscar nominees. There were a couple of good things about the movie. I did not know much about Australia, but the issue of religious religiosity among the general public played a great role in the story. When I saw the movie a few years ago, I missed a great deal, but it was a high and clear yesterday. And the Australian press seems to be pursuing a failure and over-killing, like the American counterparts. A beautiful movie. A bit different. Level: B
