One thing is clear ... If you have a bad day you should not watch this movie. The story stands around a sad incident and follows a character that lives with a sin that can not be ruled. The story keeps you curious about what's happening, because it's a simple dumbed low explanation, you're given a drop. As a result, the dots are combined and outputs sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> to accept your choice. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree. <br /> <br /> The trip you are taking is quite exciting, not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a fairly good film at the end of a bit sad. You should think and not just watch explosions and battles, but would recommend this kind of movie.
