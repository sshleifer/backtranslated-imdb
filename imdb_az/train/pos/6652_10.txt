I saw the movie and really did not stop my tears. There is no tragedy in India after the release, when she dared to act fairly with her children, and did not act properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children to politics without measuring their calibration and skills. Gandhi's Dialogue "We want to create such a community with anyone (about Harilal)?" Now, there will be no dream in India that will be a difficult leader in this or that generation. Einstein lived about 50 years after Gandhi's body, soul, and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) in this world. 'Sincerely, I thank all movie actors / actresses for this beautiful film about Anil Kapoor, Feroze Khan and the great man and son. All the father and son should watch this movie once and must do some lessons for each role.
