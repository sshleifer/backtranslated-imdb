I liked the ball. It was interested in me. Predicted plot, decent character development and story line. The people of the city are weak and look like High Noon because they are afraid to stand up to a bad man. This movie has some quality actors who really do not have the chance to share all of their talents. Also, actors did not get a loan for some roles. Denver Pyle was a good man in his small days. John Dehner, Rod Taylor is superior to their roles. Sterling Hayden did his best with poor material. It's hard to imagine him as a pistol. Laura was an awesome character, played by Karen Booth. He was surprised that two men could fight with him. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
