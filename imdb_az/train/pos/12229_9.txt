For me, there is something tempting and nostalgic about low-budget intelligence. That was all about a child in the 50's. In 1957, with my father, I saw "The First Man Space" at a cinema theater. Marshall Thompson's chief roles and some of the other poor-winnings. Also on an evil mission mission where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. I'm good and very scared. The memory of these heebi-jeebies still lives within me. The Incredible Ergonomic Man is almost entirely renowned ... scenes are well lit. The only thing ...... Darken bursting scenes, disgusting sounds and this scary music for more than an hour. Bravo!
