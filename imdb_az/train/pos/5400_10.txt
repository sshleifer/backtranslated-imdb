This film is a brilliant lesson in the history of Japan at the end of Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the Shogunat won a major fight against the loyalist who wanted to return the emperor to the throne to manage Japan. <br /> <br /> Sintaro Katsu (also known as Zatoichi) is Izo Okada, with four Hitokiri (= Human Slayer) Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai, who lost all his wealth. Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke's Sword Doomu) was captured to live a good life. Hanpei is a ultra-nationalist politician who allows the Hitokiri group to kill many high-ranking Western politicians to reach their political goals. Iso Okada is following the leader without asking what he really is doing. There is money to walk and drink and spend his prostitute. In the course of the film, Okada's murder is intensified and he is proud to have a fear-based reputation when he goes. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful portrait of a simple samurai in political affairs, and it's really a matter of understanding what's happening. The first is to change their views on their lives after being exposed to betrayal and torture and always negotiating with a samurai who rejects controversy with Sakamoto. But it's too late .... <br /> <br /> Follow the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the employees give a brilliant performance. Each actor has his own role. Sword - a very unique and fast fight ... faster than a few movies today ... <br /> <br /> Check it out!
