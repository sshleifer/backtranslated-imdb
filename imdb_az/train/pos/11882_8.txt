This movie was in my collection for a while, but one friend did not mention it. I decided to watch it. Did not know much about Leo? just had to come out of the wet movie and deal with a very serious topic? Aids. <br /> Or is it who is helpful? Is Leo? The scenario is wrapped around the road where Marcelin (the youngest brother of Le√≥n) connects with her illness. At first, is everyone trying to hide the truth from Marcel? is believed to be too young to understand his illness? Leo is also a homosexual thing that helps parents not discuss the issue with young Marcel. From the experience, I know that even though most elderly people are sometimes young, it will not accept the truth and will not be able to act more adequately. Did Marcelette make a big impression on me, except when the family tried to hide the truth? As they support their son? even after discovering the truth about sexuality and illness. The young Marcelin is the truth that Leo and Paris permit to go to Paris to meet his ex-spouse. Most families I know do not want to do that. Are there many warmth in the scenes of the brothers coming together? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
