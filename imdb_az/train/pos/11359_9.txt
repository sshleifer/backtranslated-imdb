Citizen X explains the real life drama of a serial killer search called The Rostov Ripper. This great movie shows long journeys to capture a killer. The film shows that the killer is helping the politics to last for more than 12 years. (Generally over 50 victims, mostly women and children) were outstanding as Stefen Rean's leading detective and leading a general investigation into Donald Sutherland. Jeffrey DeMunn Ripper is like Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is a type of movie that will surprise you and instantly research the internet. You do not have to miss this movie. I believe in this HBO and I have not received any theatrical freedom for my understanding. Great movie
