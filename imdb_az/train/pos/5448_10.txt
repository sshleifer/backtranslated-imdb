This movie is probably the most beloved film of all time. Miriam Flynn is great as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby is a comic genius like Delore. The rest of the game is beautiful and the movie is really laughable. A precise line of horrible movies, with a delicate twist. If you enjoy a fun, comedy evening, go and buy this classic rent. All the ways to laugh!
