Daniel Day-Lewis is a live legend. Cerebral palsy brown on my left foot (just a few names) with the aristocratic snob of the island (New York's Gangs province, Adrian Brody's ten times strongest performance in the Pianist), and the appearance of a passionate Irish sword named after Father, like Ugly Cristy. Its roles affect each other, but each is separate and totally unique. It changes completely with each character. And I believe it can be something. Everything. <br /> <br /> Cristy Brown is astonishing. He does not make the character laugh and is not indifferent to the character. Difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. Smart guy. Ugly guy Man. <br /> <br /> This movie is inspirational, despite a small scene transition and a similar film. Yes, it was foreseen. But is this a foolish syndicate? No. I laughed. I cried. Cheese is not a moment. This proves that he is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The restaurant that I love is the scene of the restaurant while discussing artists with Cristy, Eileen, Peter and his friends. Where Daniel Day-Lewis reached the point where he worked. "I play you in part of anatomy," "Take a wheel!" And its performance never slows down, it's never soft and nice, just because it's a lot of time here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Despite the events in the Caucasus, Fo sho, yo!
