One of the best music is worth seeing at one and the same time. Delicious! Especially by Ron Moody, who works as Faji. <br /> <br /> I think he is very good. Oliver Reed does a great job of describing Bill Sykes where he can not help but hopes for a terrible end. <br /> <br /> Dance is choreographed and surprisingly clever. Oliver My Fair Lady, Music Voice, Oklahoma, and so on. Someone loves it. A movie for the whole family.
