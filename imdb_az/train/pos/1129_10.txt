Iphigenia and Mikhali Cacoyannis are the first directors to show the sense of the ancient Greek theater. The tragedy of Euripides' own tragedy was not as easy as the other two of its trilogy. The story is carefully set up from the Euripides version and is placed on a logical, serious chronological framework and is more appropriate for contemporary cinematic storytelling. Cacoyannis also added a number of characters to the film, which was unseen by the tragedy of Euripides: Odysseus, Calchas and the Army. This is to make certain points of Euripides's war, Church and Government more precise. Finally, the end of Cacoyannis' Iphigenia is somewhat uncertain compared to Euripides. <br /> <br /> The film was shot down in Aulis. Photography director, Giorgos Arvanitis, shows us firm, but beautiful Greece, where he stood still during the days of Homer. He benefits from corpses, dry land, ruins, intense light and darkness. The hardness of the landscape is particularly relevant to the characters' emotions. For a long time, the camera uses all shots that deepen the landscape's wideness and ruin, as well as deeply scatter the spirit of the characters, deeply diminishing, deepening and suffering. In particular, the opening of the film is a very effective tool for the establishment of Aghamemnon's awesome political and military communications, with a daring, accelerating track, along the beach, along a line of ships, and then aerial view of thousands of soldiers lying on the beach unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Kosta Kazakos (Agamemnon), Irene Papas (Clytemnestra) and Tatiana Papamoschou (Iphigenia) can describe striking performances. Kazakos and Papas embody the delicacy of the classic Greece tragedy. Cossack's character is extremely down-to-earth and more powerful than its words, it shows the incredible anguish of his soul. Irene Papas is a modern quintessence of classic Greek games. In Iphigenia, it's horrible in his torment, and more will be his revenge for what we know. Tatyana Papamoskou is not the first person to appear on the screen, in the image of innocent Iphigenia, who contradicts the short description of Agamemnon, Kazakhstan's father. <br /> <br /> Cacoyannis is committed to Euripides, which he represents <br /> <br /> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> The Aunhamemno bird resembles a wooden dress, like others, utilitarian, hand-woven, simple ghost Clytemnestra's royal convoy <br /> <br /> The music has been developed by modern music composer Mikis Teodorakis, which dramatically enhances cinematography, reflects the psychological aspect of the tragedy, and emphasizes its size and relevance. <br /> <br /> This film and its story was an ancient lost world Greek thought was a part of our modern civilization, teaching us much about personal and social and political creatures, such as Euripides, the size of a simple family and love instead of simple warfare and patriotism, and reflects the sensitive position of men in the world of violence. With the Euripides tragedy, Cacoyannis reviews all of these topics in a contemporary, clear, and dramatic way. <br /> <br /> Political defiance-governed relationships clearly demonstrate: the war breaks down and destroys the human spirit. An individual or group can no longer function at a certain extent. Everyone has his own personal motivation to fight Trojan, which has nothing to do with Helen: the thirst of power (Agamemnon), except for Menelaus, envy (Army, Odysseus) or fame (Achilles). In the true sense of the story was Helen Troyan War WMD. <br /> <br /> Another conflict that took place in the film was the war of the "Homeric glamor" and the "religious arrangements" only an imperialist initiative. Between the Church and the State. Calchas, who represents the Church, wants to sacrifice her for sacrificing her daughter, who is prone to the rule of the priest and wants to destroy God's Servant, who served Agamemnon. With the Sacrifice Agreement, the King is approaching the spiritual, but by abandoning his power against the masses (army) beaten by religion. Of course, this is a game for Agamemnon. <br /> <br /> The government itself has made itself an irrepressible resource even though it can not really believe in God or not. How can we explain the difference between the murder and the two of you? By focusing on the severe and primitive horror of a human being and the worst victim of his child - Euripides / Cacoyannis creates a drama of immediate political and hard work. It touches on the most complex and sensitive ethical problem facing each society: a confrontation between individual and society needs. In the case of conspiracy, the father is required to kill his offspring with his own hand, as in the Biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. What kind of God would this require? Can we be just or spiritually inspired of God? Finally, does the sacrificial death of a girl differ from the death of all the boys and girls sent to battle? These are a lot of deep questions raised by a two-hour film.
