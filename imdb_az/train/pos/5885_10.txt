This movie was very surprising to me. There were no high expectations for that, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well-written. Because they did not trust the success of the old television show, they did not spend much time to renew their past. In general, it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend might be a one-week sit-com and I think she can agree with her.
