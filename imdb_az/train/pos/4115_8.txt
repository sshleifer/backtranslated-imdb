This is one of the darkest movies ever seen. Because it looks less like a movie and looks more like an experimental film. Kurasawa's experience was to get people to live in garbage dump and experience their experiences, often making them a tapestry offering a tough appearance. Each episode is tough and tough, but it's definitely a tone. There is a case of murder / aggression, attempted murder, spouse replacement, alcoholism, blasphemy, frustration with a person with severe depression), probably thinking of being a street car show is a desperate dreamer who will be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man, and "shifts" the street car through all the waking moments between the heaps of garbage. Actually, Bergman has dropped a lot of films, in fact, almost as an Ingmar Bergman movie in Japan it is astonishing as it seems. managed to deal with mental illness and life's despair. Is this movie surprising after trying to kill Kurasawa? So did I love it? No This is a fun experience. But it was a very good movie that kept my focus strong and I would like to see what these people are. It was like tracking a train crash - you do not want to see all the massacres, but you can not help, but you can watch it! One of all vignettes, I think, is an invisible old man who is inclined to look at everyone and is not really compatible (he is a well-regulated and wise wise living at the bottom of the trash), perhaps representing Kurasawa himself. Can be. <br /> <br /> If you see many Kurashava movies and have high tolerance for strange art films, give this one an hour. Nevertheless, watch the movie you are watching for the first time - not sure about scaring the audience!
