If an actor plays an acting or actual role, playing a role will be much more difficult. In Double Life, Ronald Coleman overcame himself as a dual person, Anthony John, subjected to torture. He put all his talent and sincerity on this character. Face expressions, behaviors, marches and stance Anthony John said what happened when playing Othello on the stage. Coleman also performed extremely well as a Shakespeare actor in short stories such as Othello, part of the film. Coleman's torture on the face of Othello was tortured by doubts about Desdemona's loyalty. In addition, his character can be confused by the scene and someone who has a deep-acting depth of Coleman. Dr. Speker Tracy As Jekyll and Mr Hyde were watching, this double roles were deeper and tougher. Shelly Winters is also very sweet, sensitive and beautiful and adds talent to the movie. Ronald Coleman believes his role in this film is great and he is going to win the Oscar for the best player in 1947. I will see this movie many times and will never feel bored.
