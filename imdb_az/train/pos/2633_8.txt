I have to be honest that I was expecting a bit worse than failure because they really tried to give the original film to make money. But there was nothing like this in a pretty comical (sometimes strange) movie. The story of Timon and Pumba explains his story with Simba and his troubles were funny. When the jacket foam and Pumba get out, the bubbles will stop. Good for kids and some adults, all harmless. I think this movie will last for some reason, because it's good for direct Video and DVD movies. The film looks a little strange and attractive, though it works. 10 to 8
