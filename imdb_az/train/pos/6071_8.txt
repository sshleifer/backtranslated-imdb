No matter how difficult I am, I will not find a better version of the Othello movie. Because you love Kenneth Branag's "Nothing on Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996), I will also block Oliver Parker's Othello for being dead. Laurence Fishburne has played a variety of beautiful roles throughout his career. "The boys' title" (1991) was quite striking - I always regarded the fun role of Furious Styles as a great achievement. <br /> <br /> He plays a part of Othello and is in the most difficult role of his entire career, but does a brilliant, fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely stunning in the most fascinating role of the dreadful Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh, the bloody, manipulative story of Jago. Interesting "Othello" is an indispensable part of Shakespeare's creative works. Her favorite topics are: fraud, envy, deception, and jealousy. This film adaptation is, of course, one of the best films based on William Shakespeare's works.
