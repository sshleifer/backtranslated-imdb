In 2006, AMPAS was awarded one of the most innovative documentary films describing the unique vivacity in the world's coldest places. The film was a penguin jaw narrated by Morgan Freeman, Academy Award winning actor. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios is now a monopoly in animation for decades. They have made their stabs to shoot a live action movie and hit and lost the entire board. Disney later created a subdivision called Disneynature and released the first feature film featured in the world. This is one of the most effective and knowledgeable documents I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Earth, narrated by great James Earl Jones, does not offer anything new to anyone who has been looking at the Discovery Channel over the past five years or closely following the global warming crisis. The place is very touching on this issue and makes a very liberal approach to the subject. <br /> <br /> It allows nature to communicate with a nature I have not lived before. It also shows not only the beauty and mystic feelings of our beautiful planet, but also the angry and disturbing aspects of our frequent occurrences. It's one thing to follow Mufasa's abyss or catch a Bambine's mother in the midst of a forest by a hunter. All in all, because at the end of the movie we know it, it's just a movie. These penguins, polar bears, elephants, all kinds of families, live in all living conditions, live in a natural habitat and die. <br /> <br /> Although the graphic nature of the movie (although many will not agree), Earth is an inviolable experience. With a great camera band and incredible account of George Fenton, here's a beautiful cinematography. Compared to March, Penguins or Grizzly Man really do not see any action, but it's great. At the end of the day, you are blessed with a blessing on our planet, and most of us will not visit these places where we will witness the film. We live here, but for the same reason, we will never explore our planet. The place is beautiful. <br /> <br /> ***
