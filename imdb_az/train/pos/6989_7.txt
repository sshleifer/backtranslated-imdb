This film was featured in the very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I do not think of this cool TV series. This is a strikingly good early 40th horror flick with a very striking good sound and picture for a 67-year-old social horror movie. I really like Bela Lukas and his strange staff, including the young brides, the old mind and his two bizarre sons, and another funny dwarf (Angelo Rossitto) Freaks since 1932. I love the courageous young female reporter, who has some sort of stereotype, but still amused to watch. Another problem with my other problematic film is that it is even ridiculous and unusual for the movie. I do not want to spoil any of this movie, so get out and rent, or buy for a few more dollars.
