Since a baseball is hard to die, this movie will be contrary to what I expected in a sports movie: original-looking sporting exercises, incredible characters, and original story line. The "Angels in Outfit", despite the severe failure of the first category, the second is a good result. "Angels" Roger and J.P., despite the love of baseball love for two Anaheim children, but only by calling a family, Woebegone Angels touches on his story of fighting with fans to win and win the franchise. Roger, who said that only one family would die when the angels gained the tricks, asked for some heavenly help and took the spirit of a non-drinking spirit twisted to regain the lower spiral of the franchise. And when the short-term manager, George Knox (described by Danny Glover), begins to believe Roger's vision, the group is suddenly hoping to change the season - and Roger and JP find something to believe. Performance and Tony Danza is good, despite the thought of ZERO, how to get out of the good wind when playing a washbasin!
