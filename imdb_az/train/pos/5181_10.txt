I love this movie as a whole, but the four things are really different: Sam's Raimi's perfect comic timing and beautiful features of the camp's necessary (?) Man, Alan Arkin's camp owner, and best of all, as cinematography. Beautiful golden tones of horrific scenes take me to the movies, and lakeshore draws my summer memories as sunset. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and mood are very natural and convincing. Some editors are criticized for not having a "deep" script. There is nothing missing from this movie. Heroes and their problems seem realistic, and I think about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line creates part of all the units that come together.
