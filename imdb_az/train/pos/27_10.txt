Emilio Miraglio's "Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is the perfect example of a gioma that I see, mixing all the necessary elements with a bad casserole. First and foremost, it has a complex, twisted structure which is of great importance to me and, finally, it has a perfect meaning and does not go out of the left area at the end of the killer. The story is related to a series of horrible crimes (which you know from the film's title), which appears in the performance of an ancient prophet of two brothers? The story is one and one figure with a delusional laugh of a red-colored killer with a killer is neither fear nor memorable. Each great gymnast requires a few beautiful actresses, and one of the two sisters, under the direction of laughably beautiful Barbara Bouchet, and one of her previous roles is a cramped tramp in the fashion house of Sybil Danning Barbara. Another outstanding ingredient in the superior giallo is an attractive, hummable account and provides one for this movie that Bruno Nicolai should stay with you for a day. Gorgeous scenery? Check again. The photograph taken mainly in the city of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, is really a kind of look. OK, OK, but what are these crimes? Finally, what about gialli? Well, I was delighted to find that most of the audience was delighted with the various films, shooting, impalements, and other movies that enjoyed delicious ... cryptos, freaky dream sequences, rats and bats (and drug references, aggression, forced red breads and women a great ghilo, which is a leader of the hunter for the audience.It's a wonderful gilo, as I said, and this is a good folk that no shy DVD is and that's what it means: a great load of boots and loads of loads of loads! Thanks, guys!
