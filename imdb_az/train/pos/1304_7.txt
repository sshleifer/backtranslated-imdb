Okay Yes, it was a very tough budget movie with persistence errors (as it was explicitly painted in the sun and then shaded and then mixed), and as I loved Nick Mancusoy, it was a burning part and a small supportive player was really bad ( at least one player was used in two different, but outstanding roles). But come. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair just worth the trip). Steven Ford was very welcome. Mancuso had some giant lines, Nancy Allen, a heartwarming, completely soft and uninteresting. Classic? No. Yes. Entertainment? Great yes. I liked Grieco's day to decide which hairstyle to make. "Are you fast?" ... "You're not that fast."
