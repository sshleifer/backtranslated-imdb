A movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol are also very nice. Soma mother Sharmila Tagoru is very reminiscent of this. Abai is an actor born, and in the future, much will grow. <br /> <br /> The film's end is different from the majority of movies. Though you are disappointed in some way, you really realize that the last one in the film is only if you really think about it. Otherwise, there would be an unfair injustice against everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is a professional witness who is facing a girl who is waiting to marry in court. His lover does not appear and he ends with the help of the witness. Slowly slowly, as time passes, he becomes in love with her. It is unclear whether he has similar feelings. Follow the movie for the full details. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Abha. I hope to see more films from him. The sphere was pretty nice, but did not talk much about the movie. His eyes, his innocence, made much of the conversation.
