This film is a story related to adventure shot by 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius Duchenne has Muscular Dystrophy. It is still an infectious disease, which continues to kill the lives of his 19-year-old brother and kills one another in the United States. He and several close friends send MTV, Pimp My Ride, to Los Angeles to get a wheelchair, one of his favorite shows. Travel begins in Georgia, where Darya has grown and never left. The west is westward for a trip to which all participants will never forget. Darius first embarks on a boat, goes to a hot air balloon, sails down the ocean, and always visits places he wants to see as Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here have a direct contact with the material. They do not give any money for the sale of $ 20. $ 17 is targeted at disease research and $ 3 more copies are being prepared. He has won more than 25 awards at the film festivals and agrees with the variation given by Variety for the film "Define Your Author's Hearts."
