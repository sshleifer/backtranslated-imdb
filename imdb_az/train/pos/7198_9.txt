This is really a good movie, and it's something I've been watching for a few times. Michael Caine is awesome as always. Michael Caine has a reputation for playing a good role in Sidney's play, regardless of the quality or deficiency in any movie. It's so well written from the beginning. Irina Levin, from the Brazilian "Boys," and Rosemary's Baby, wrote something terribly interesting. <br /> <br /> <strong> She works as a rector of Qafqaz University, because if anyone wants to give something about this movie, it can be a crime. Just watch him and make him happy.
