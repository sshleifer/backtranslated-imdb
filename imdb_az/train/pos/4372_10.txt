Rob Roy is epic of passion and action and is within a few MILD SPOILERS. Liam Neeson, Rob Roy MacGregor, gives a strong performance as one of the best in his career. The letter, such as Jessica Lange, his wife Mary, is perfect. I have the most passion and chemistry I've ever seen in a couple. John Hurt is a portrait of good snotty aristocratic performance.Tim Roth is a great screen villains.His harassment. Mary is surprising and harrowing.He really is a gorgeous bastard in this movie. The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best swords everfor. Ans written in script and Michael Caton-Jones are flawless. From 10 to 10.
