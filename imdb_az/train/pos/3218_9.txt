<br /> <br /> The ninth is likely to be a high point to a video-fantasy film that is outdated in the US box office and is criticized as the poorest film of Russell's career. <br /> <br /> First of all, when you read the negative details of this movie, it is true that they begin with the wooden character of Soldier, who is named Todd Russell. I'll start here, with this amazing statement, maybe Russell's the best player I've ever seen. Todd suffers from an emotional cripple and intense PTSD - this film was widely known as it was written before the phenomenon. Todd withdrew, was not forgiven, and became a companion. He teaches a grim discomfort - going to a firefighting chamber, to every action, and to interact with another person for signs of insults and dangers. His hyperfocus results in a lack of understanding of his duties to sit in the tasks he has given - he cuts carrots and has a scene that continues to work indefinitely, with no scarring or blood purification. Many interpret it as a sign of physical fitness and pay attention to the job, but it is simply a sign of rote - it does not understand the connection between its own vegetable and nutrition. Todd's dialogue is spartan to say the least - the two big talk scene is the basis for the plot and emphasizes the obvious nature of its existence. Fear and discipline are called to us. Always. Do not be afraid to press it down to a hyper warning state, with the smallest details ready to react to a knife edge. Discipline to keep him in control of his fear, to overcome it, and to tactics. I have to imagine that it is not worthy of thinking and thinking. Many viewers have different reactions to Nielsen Sandra's enthusiasm - but I believe that you can interpret the perspective of a man with experience of a laugh - that horror represents his reaction / reaction to flight instincts. Therefore, its cancellation (twice in fact) - because the tendency of our society to set out is to take pedestrian fighters to the garbage dump of society when they meet their requirements. 40% of unemployed are old-fashioned military units in the world, and may only deteriorate at HIS. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that Russell soon assumes responsibility for Mace's spouse and child - he needs a mission, even with a high probability of his death. <br /> <br /> Then there is also a military subtext - a conflict between the Busey Church and the HQ, Mekum's illumination. My new people are faster, stronger, more accurate, and aggressive. Any of them could have picked Toddy out - but not about how you use these tools. Entrepreneur Todd uses tactics and secret tricks to cut off a single stroke by acting in an ineffective manner, taking into account the freedom to implement his initiative and sending the message without support, coverage and discovery. <br /> <br /> It is a reminder that military power can not prevent the failure of leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle themes. When a movie is shot and minimal scripted, it leaves a lot of white space for your comments to get rooted. Look at the soldier openly and see what you have learned.
