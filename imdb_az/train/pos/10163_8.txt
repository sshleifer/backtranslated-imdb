<br /> <br /> We have watched many films over the past two weeks, and this should have been the best. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> br> This can be a romantic comedy and I do not like it at all, but writing, direction, performance, sound <br /> <br /> This movie has gained quite a lot of results over all the films I have seen lately and the rest is a great budget or they have introduced better. <br /> <br /> Good job in writing.
