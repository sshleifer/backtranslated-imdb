The best way to describe Europe in the list of best films for me is a communication from a friend after the end of the film: "I did not know that films could be done in such a way." It is one of the best examples of being genuinely original in the visual style. This is far from the "master and scope" shooting style; sound, effect, props, dialogue, sound, performance, editing, illumination, etc. It perfectly integrates many layers ... all equals, prevails. Despite Hollywood's "dialogue" myopia, cinema is not about dialogue, but about beautiful lighting, moving or music. All elements work best when they are in the same position, but only express the idea of ​​the DECISION, the order in which they are presented or the combination. It does not mean to reduce or eliminate an element's contribution. What should Europa do to become a movie theater?
