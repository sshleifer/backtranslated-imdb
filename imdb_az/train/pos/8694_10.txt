In 1988, I first saw The Ronnie and Nancy Show (Austrian Television). At that time, I became a great fan of Spitting Image (since the 1986 Montreux Film Festival won the bronze rose). Of course, I wrote on every tape and repeat - especially at The Ronnie and Nancy Show. I remember the scene, Ronnie was standing in front of a painting by Lincol (thinking he was a mirror) and said to himself, "I need a rash." Or, if you play ball with the most entertaining, sharp - on the contrary! <br /> <br /> Such a shame that Spitting Image may fall echo; It was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent television shows. Compared to other satireal broadcasts, this was definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Well, it has been around for about 20 years and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy one from one place?
