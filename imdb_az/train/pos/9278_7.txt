The two films by Cafar Panahi, which I have seen in the White Balloon and Crimson Gold, make a mysterious amount of depth on the subjects that appear on the director's surface. In offsite, Panahi's respect for Iranian women has ceased his rights and I do not think he is successful. Of course, what he says is not important (of course, like any other Panahi film, Iranians can not see it). However, after a while, the film feels fresh and feels even 90 minutes long. It was not like me. All actors are fantastic and celebrate at the end of the film is infectious. But this is not an important matter in my opinion.
