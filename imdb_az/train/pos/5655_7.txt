I watched that demonstration by reminding David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show that I recall. The show will soon begin to present us to the main characters, and the more unusual the pilot episode is the best for me, its extremely dramatic, and truly the advent of the show, which is the rest of the season, is all bad. My biggest criticism is that I feel somewhat down the show - probably because it was canceled only after 1 season, it seemed to show rather potentially not his own fault, and more healing. The actor is perfect and this show has the best characters (good and bad) that are developing well soon. The first degree is dramatic for the first 5 or 10 demonstration, but it is corrected as the season progresses. A good watch is definitely something ordinary!
