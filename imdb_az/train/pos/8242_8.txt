I have to say that FIDO looks at a number of movie channels and is a fan of the moment. The film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the facts of the 1950s, but you know only a decade after dancing to Elvis, leaving only nuclear bombs in the desert outside. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> This movie is a shame because it's not a big hit. More recognition was granted. This is better than Tim Burton or the DEAD team's SHAUN. He is excellent. Nevertheless, it is a sudden classic.
