Over the years we've been watching all the horror movie films like Saw 2, with terrifying indie releases that are totally unmatchable ... we are suffering from all the bad movies with hopes of finding small gems like us. "<br /> <br /> In 2005, We've been filming this movie for a year and liked the audience and I believe the award has been won for the best film. <br /> <br /> Studio movies can not have budget or star energy, though it's a serious blow to the creepy atmosphere and fear category. and cinematography is a hinge, but it's worth the look of the movie, and the story and characters are just developing at the right pace to provide some fantastic fears. <br /> <br /> Edit and visual fx are also the top brush. <br /> <br /> When many horror films can not use music for profit, the "Dark Remains" form <br /> <br /> I know that the film is showing in many festivals, but no one is with me, and finally, I will not wait to hear when it comes to DVDs. Trust me, even if you are sick of the horror movies, try this one ... you will not regret it!
