China O'Brien (1990) is an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This "Golden Harvet" was beaten by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, either he was lucky to get into Dragon, or he was touched because he is not a big part of the director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see Rothrock and Richard Norton's combat skills. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, this mood would have been a classic action rather than a straightforward move. <br /> <br /> O'Brien O'Brien returns home to help his father. The local team is having trouble and needs help. So he returns home and restores his order (with the help of two difficult people). <br /> <br /> If you're a big Cynthia Rothrock admirer, then this movie is catered for you. I love only martial arts, everything is out of place. <br /> <br /> Raymond Chow did not do anything and took the top notch movement director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
