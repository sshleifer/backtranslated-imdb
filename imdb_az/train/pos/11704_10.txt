<br /> <br /> <strong> FUTURE USE is a beautiful weekly account of the week, up from RAPTURE weekend and one week from this major event. <br /> <br /> I have evaluated the production values ​​and content of this independent Christian movie. <br /> <br /> Production values. Hey, this shoe is an independent movie with a design budget, so it looks a little surprising (if the standard A list is Hollywood). But, compared to other independent films, this movie is perfectly acceptable. The narrative is more important than imagination, dress, and music. Are you compelling the story? Do dramatic moments work? Is the story trajectory built to convince? To answer all these questions is incorrect "yes". As side-marking, it's really important that the technical features - durability, sound, and lighting are good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The movie's message is superior. When you think about how the film maker is thinking about it for a short period of 69 minutes, you appreciate its art. He threatens the message of salvation, the result of the unbelief, the danger of retreat, the truth of drift and the ignorance, imagination and danger of the devil's government exposed to world domination - most importantly for an evangelical film. biblical accuracy. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker is a good storyteller. For example, he develops the message of salvation in two important ways: (1) the reality of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for us. The zoo-keeper is obtained by a poisonous snake and is derived from a subplot where it is nearly dying. The only treatment is the blood of a human being, against the snake's poison. Poison is like a sin; The treatment resembles the blood of Christ shed on the cross. (2) The filmmaker develops a message of salvation through dialogue. Different heroes explain the need to save the truth about human sin and faith in Christ. Thus, the filmmaker uses the action and dialogue to explain his story. <br /> <br /> As we have noted, a film produced by evangelical Christians really has dialogues and scenes, and salvation, imagery and theology described in the true evangelical Christian language are also perfectly acceptable. It is absurd to criticize the film for being a Christian; Nike's trade is something that is criticized to promote wear. What else will Evangelical Christian filmmakers do if they are not a movie that will work? Also, the filmmaker hopes that those who do not believe will abandon the idea of ​​a Godless world, yet it is completely acceptable. The creativity of the film uses the astonishing potential of this idea. How do I know? In 1974, I heard a woman who had been on the show a night; yet thirty years later he lived in his memory. How many movies can you tell about? A very pleasant, thoughtful show around you. I plan to show you a group of teens in the church.
