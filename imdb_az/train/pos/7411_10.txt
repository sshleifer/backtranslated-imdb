Happiness and beauty, the key to life's pain and grief are our ability to accept our lives on the basis that we will not only struggle against this single truth. We will find peace when doing so. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth, but allows us to discover it ourselves. This beautiful but simple story is a very well played worship. <br /> <br /> How do you watch this movie? <br /> <br /> It would be motivated to see others starting with reviewing this movie. I'm a victim. The story is about men's bathhouse. It sounds like it switches off correctly, right? But nothing can be far from truth. The American title for this film is Shower, but this bath is the antithesis against the main thematic element. I still lost. They will not justify talking about the story or the characters. <br /> So, I'm going to tell you about watching this movie and how effective and moving it is. I also enjoyed it. I took great care of the heroes and I thought deeply about what happened to them. For any story, this is the highest praise. <br /> <br /> If you use movies that are masked or not too small, make sure you look at the shower. There are Netflix and DVD video and sound quality is very good. <br /> <br /> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;
