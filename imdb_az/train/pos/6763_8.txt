Elegance and class are not the first words that come to mind when you sit around around the nation (at least you can do at least such a thing) and talk about movie noir. <br /> <br /> However, the best films of the genre, "Past", "Killers", "Yalnızlıga", "Night and the City", is the right level of transparency in the management of the catch and the moody shadows, and femme fedoraları rejects statements in front of the fatalists. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < </ STRONG> with these classics. <br /> <br /> Açıq kreditlərdən ibarət olan qara buluddan bu gündən etibarən, Perdeli tək detektor Marc Dixonun çökən dünyasında bir pərdə çəkilir və anlar keçdiyi kimi, daha da yaxın, təhlükəli bir boğulma olur. Of course, he is familiar with the "dark past" police, but Dana Andrews is worried that Dikson is in the dark and worried. Yes, he has been shocked by the suspects for a long time, and warns him of the "last time" of a newly-promoted chef (Karl Malden, usually on a solid and commanding visit). <br /> <br /> Dixon now hates long enough to stop them. And did not they have a guy that did not come? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, dusters, mugs, spider nickel rats" tough nut cartridge making it all the complaints about iron and out of the office when Dixon tukurur right hook. Advice is cool for its good. Instead, he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> It is a world in which some hatred has come to the world, relying on its instincts, a generation that has passed or passed back to nature. <br /> <br /> Immediately the police, the syndicate, deepen with their partner. Dixon's suspicion of involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job and declares it as a sworn-in swearing. In Bourjac's "Lonely Place," he says, "Can he save himself?" /> <br /> Onu başqa bir yerə çevirməyə başladığında, o, onun qocalı bakalavrın varlığını evə dəyər verən bir şeyə çevirə biləcəyi kimi görünən bir serapik gözəllik (təəccüblü Gen Tierney) ilə gözlənilməz əlaqəsini məhdudlaşdırdığını görür üçün. <br /> <br /> This is the pacing, pressure and comprehension of the super movie. Writers who contribute to the production team, parıldadıqlarını high-gloss polished shine - dialogue, parody feed, melodramatic and passionate way split before Semime spreading rapidly. <br /> <br /> And this top-notch orientation and player-play is not too quiet or luminous to loosen emotionally the whole film. Gen Tierney's angelic, soft-focused beauty has a great impact. He shows himself to be a great number of actresses, and his subtle, kind nature is limited here as his "psychosis". The scenes between Tierney and Andrew Dickson are growing ever stronger and destroy themselves as they get closer. <br /> <br /> Despite the end of his rope, cut, bruised and exhausted Dixon combines its summary: "Innocent people are able to log on cigarettes is horrible ..." he says. "It's a mistake and you're on your head." <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all about making this movie totally attractive, for almost everyone, for a really good person - a wrong decision or a blow, or the most intimidating, due to factors you do not control. Noir always dreaded the most terrifying fears. "It's in a place where the cedar is gone." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> /> <br /> But noir fans - heck, any movie fan who does not see this movie is in a wise treatment.
