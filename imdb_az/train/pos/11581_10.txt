Since we know most of the horrors that bring war and violence, it is a little calm to film a war and genocide. I do not want to say that the story is shocking, I'm not surprised by what I said in this movie or what you did not know about before, but I'm sorry that this film is affected. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film focuses on Hannah's successful participation in the Hungarian resistance. Maruschka Detmers would never be able to win the Oscars because it was a constant director, but his actions are still strong and he has a great character. It is poured very well like Hanna and has immediate sympathy. His beautiful appearance certainly helps, but he has nothing to do with being a good actress. <br /> <br /> Some discrepancies occur in Hannah War. Sometimes thinking director Menahem Golan (often despised for The Gianni Versace Murder) was in a hurry and really should allow for more than one scene. On the other hand, I am very grateful for the adoption of this impressive and thought-provoking film, and I think it's a good job to be positive about it. </ P> <p> The second half of the film The most interesting and tragic one. Paying attention to Hannah's suffering (fear of the terrible description of Donald Pleasence's cruel and sardon captain Rosa) and the injustice and horror that comes with hate, violence and war. I regard Hannah's War, especially the second half, as a strong anti-war film, and deserves only Golan's credit. The second half of Maruschka Detmer's talent is a character that appears to be the most talkative, strong and tragic movie to date. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn's look and manner of action always reminds Romney Schneider. She was alive and beaten - similar to Hannah's war. <br /> <br /> The disastrous effect of the second half and sometimes the unlucky tension, replacing hopeful perspectives and good news, struck like a bomb and led to the final scenes of something unpredictable, very moving and poetic in the tragedy that left me in tears . Once again, I realized that this was not science fiction, but all this was realized, it was more tears. The image of Hanna, described by Maruschka Detmers, will always be in my mind.
