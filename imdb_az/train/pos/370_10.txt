<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie at least fifty times and I've been doing FELT for a long time after watching for the first time last week. The story itself was incredible, but it's Spielberg's experience and Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia was awarded an Oscar nomination for Nettie's short but powerful image. <br /> <br /> You will experience the feeling of every human being while watching this movie. I laughed, cried and got angry. The biggest films were considered by the Academy as a series of nominations, but there is no win. But this movie is definitely one of the best films of all time.
