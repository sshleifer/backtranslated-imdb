Okay, when I left it, I saw it in theaters and I do not know why. I have not seen since today, but I've finished this page because I was thinking about this movie - I still do not know why. <br /> <br /> Comedy is tough, harder than any drama. It's easy to do it, but it's wrong ... is worse than bad comedy? Steve Martin, take note, for some reason, you fall into this category again. <br /> <br /> Elvira The Dark Of Mistress did not do this to commemorate this movie with joy. It feels fun, from the beginning to the end, knowing that there is not a Philedelphia Story in the cheek and at a slow pace. <br /> <br /> Brain Donors is something else that fits this category. <br /> <br /> One point dispute - ends. It seems that writers / director did not know how to finish the comedy. Trying to be a lasting love story breaks some of the strange fast temples. Then there is "like" scene. However, this should be seen (male opinion), like a shock from above and above. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy like the Spinal Tap or the Producers or the Bible. But if you do not try to break it, and tell you that it's just charm and strange, laughs and disbelieves.
