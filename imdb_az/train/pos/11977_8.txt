OK. Who brought cheese? I love her. It was a phenomenon during this period. Anorexia Twins became popular.Bob Saget began to make a paycheck (instead of a really funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. Life was good and straightforward. This is one of the great American classics. It was humorous and always brought home a good lesson. And this is where I'm different from my norm: I liked the last few seasons. As with home improvement, kids can do with scripting when they are older. So I'm dying ... It was too late. But anyway. I gave her 8/10 due to her efficient, funny story lines and Bob Saget!
