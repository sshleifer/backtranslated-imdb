"Girlfight" is more age-story than fighter fights. And what a relaxation with a convincing use of natural, realistic Latinos and Brooklyn project settings in a city school. <br /> <br /> It was understood that almost all Hollywood high schools are located in luxury suburbs or smaller cities. (Even the young African Americans, a little comparable to the suburban "Love and Basketball").

The Rocky fight movie, the practice and the battles come in a complex, and all relationships, especially the father and father, are more central than the rings of the center passes through. <br /> <br /> There were very interesting musical credits mentioned here, but I really did not notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (Originally written 10/7/2000)
