<br /> <br /> Why did not people know that they could give the film a deeper meaning or that it was worthless? <br /> <br /> What is just fun? Something about Morgan Freeman. It takes a chance to show a little. <br /> <br /> Poz Vega, his co-star, boosts career and gets a name to attract people to watch Brad Silberling's movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some ways, some bittersweetness but nothing in the top. As a receptionist in a construction company, I received a special shot from Jim Parsons. She says adoringly to Freeman and says, "You want me to be a woman." He's just fun. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a pretty, charming movie that will smile at you. You can get even worse and worse.
