It is one of the most unusual cases where a film and a novel on it are also great. Perhaps this is because Gorris took Nabokov's initial comments and gave them a different interpretation. <br /> <br /> Following the meeting with Lu√ßin, the result is a landscape that deserves more than one Nabokov. <br /> <br /> Only one thing in the film I do not like is Valentinov's influence on Lucy's fate. I can not imagine that Nabokov created such a person as Valentinov and had such a great impact on the novel's argument.
