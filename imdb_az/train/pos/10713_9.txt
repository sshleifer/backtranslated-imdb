An angry boy, who had tragically denied his father, looked at his father. Together, they find common ground in Gaelic folk stories, each of which has been transmitted to each other verbally from generation to generation. Although tragic episodes such as the way of life refer to stories, they are strikingly humorous and strange. All this is shot in Skye, so there's a nice pair of doses. The sea view is a rare chance to hear breathtaking and talking to Scottish Gaelic. I had to read the English subtitles, but the voices of Gaelicin are still beautiful. Performance is what the carefully selected non-actors expect - in other words, real people - people who are deeply involved in Gaelic folklore and history. Especially in the city of Skye, the Gaelic Society has created very few miracles to create this film. Anyone who has the least interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, English history, multi-cultural or social justice should go to this movie.
