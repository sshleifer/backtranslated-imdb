In addition to Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was a symbolic Columbo villain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy, Ken Franclin, .

I just give "Publish or Perish" the edge of this page: Both episodes contain Jack Cassidy and broadcast, but the chapter "Publish Per Perish" is more intense and unexpected. But this is still a great episode.
