<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An episode that creates a certain part of X-Files before I start watching for it. When I saw the show for the first time, I saw several segments, and I was too young to watch it as part of the brave devil, but when I was 11, I watched this episode be completely destroyed by the scene and they were drowned by the boy and then the little girl with the hypnosis scene. I say, I'm not sleeping for a few weeks! Therefore, the episode now has a special aura about the factor of procrastination created for similar pleasure. As the past life spell really revenges, it is enough to allow a girl to spend some of the deficiencies in the field as she intends to wait until she is 9 years old. Or it's just a casual thing to sit on a bus in the middle of the night. You would think his parents would be disturbed. And maybe they just did not really see a part of this story. And with telekinesis? Apart from the really cool Carrie Factor already creepy story, there is really no good explanation for her. But even with small flaws, this is a classic episode in my opinion, and I have no reason not to dislike it. From 10 to 10.
