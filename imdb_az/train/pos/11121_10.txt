As a person who sees all seasons, I can say that JG is always surprised. That is, after seeing him pass through his smile all the time into the paranoid, and after every small gesture he believed he was a gangster, he thought himself: OK, a good actor and he could enter a gangster's skin. But when he opened his eyes and saw it struggling for his life, he could almost say, "I believe that we have passed through." He showed me that Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were right. but now they are old or dead (Brando) and less filmed, and their performances are "lighter" for them, and I do not want to see Gandolfini in other films that have a completely different role. Can the old film give me advice?
