This is a storybook on Lindy Chamberlain's work and its impact on Australian society. <br /> <br /> When dealing with real-life dramas, especially the innuendo, gossip and expectations look at the problem. <br /> <br /> One of the issues related to the story also shows that people expect the same emotional response in the expected way. Everyone is going to a great crisis of ugly melodramatic hysteria. Acting in a certain way by the characters and television in the film is not a reason to expect the real people to do so. This is particularly suitable for news editors who are looking for a great scene to attract journalists and ratings. <br /> <br /> Heroes play with deep, personality and sensitivity in decisions. And they are fundamentally maintained by a great cast who plays all of the actual individuals. Some viewers are surprised to learn that many of those supporting this story are well-known in Australia as funny actors. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> </ span> </ span> I have to say something very personal here; When this incident happened, I became an old adventist in Australia, a practical member; so the story has a slightly different impression. I believe that this is a beautiful creativity, personality and emotional heart. The best scene is a place where new couples are dying. <br /> <br /> In a recent interview with Fred Schepinin, they said that the actors could play "the best thing for their character". This is especially true for this story, but I think it is a general principle that can be applied to all those who operate.
