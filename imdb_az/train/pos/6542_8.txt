Despite being well off target audiences, I've always had a soft spot for the YA fantasy, and I was naturally interested in Nancy Drew's return to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery surrounding the long-dead actress is presented in terms of a simple symptom with danger for young skin. <br /> <br /> Nancy and her friends do not take the risk seriously, as young members of the audience will not be disturbed. <br /> <br /> The final results I really appreciated from the story were quite serious and meaningful, and Nancy understood and grew older. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is as big as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll see her again with a mystery.
