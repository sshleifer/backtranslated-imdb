Only Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job with a relatively small budget for a $ 60 million animated film. <br /> <br /> These are the ultimate digital animation, collaboration, friendships and a great sense of care for your brothers, Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary (among others) who have a great sense of humor. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I received a strong political message - perhaps for all world leaders - to connect with people who shared your place! David Newman - another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - does not intervene, still serves to move and sometimes, <br /> <br /> The overall appearance of the film is unbelievable; snow, geyser, mud, rocks and ice, a strange, weirdly convincing fantasy area. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps things that can make you excited or keep your children in a very sanitary condition - but still real. <br /> <br /> A great movie to see in the theater and get home.
