Future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a brave and original tale for a big movie screen. bold, because the comedy has always taken a lot of fantasy movies - a step to something new, creative and brave. <BR> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > </> Actors are great - even the smallest part is made with such a talent, which fills me with the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is magnificent, and he is demonstrating the show on all kinds of scenes with such energy. Michelle Pfeiffer is a perfect witch and Claire Danes is a nice choice for innocent and loving "star" Yvaine. Other big names play a prominent role. Everyone is trying to do his best for this movie. However, once again, Neil Gaiman's "all the little things he has invented for the universe" is merely a remarkable story. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie one day before the official release in a previous show. and I hope this is a great success. There are many humor, but also tense moments, as well as beautiful tender scenes. Yevaine, Captain Shakespeare's "frivolities", the Lamia Passion of the People - a spectacular, memorable look. This is the number one fun movie for me in 2007, see and enjoy! <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Outstanding <br /> <br /> Peace and love
