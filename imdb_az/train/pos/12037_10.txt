The Black Lady was an Englishman for the first time at Christmave Eve in 1989 and later on '92 in a BBC TV. I believe he made a round of American television on A & E. In the early 1990's, he was released in VHS in the UK but was released. A US company left it on DVD, but this version was also sold. According to the author of the book's website, the film belongs to one another and will still be released and there are unofficial botlets sold on ebay. <BRr> I've heard about this movie first on a message board and have to check it out. On Ebay, I found a copy of about $ 28. The DVD reads that "ha ha", though, is a fraudulent seller of a far east. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. In the 1920s, it was a period of time all set by the very original and strange English settings of the period. Black Woman is very atmospheric and dark. Most of the film is a very low film, but it is effective and scary. There is nothing in itself of tempting, violent or special effects, but the Black Lady is still able to create absolutely cool moments. This is a cold classic styled ghost movie. The film seems to be made with the exception of the color of 1930. Without all the flashes of modern horror films, I'm afraid this movie will always be a missing stone. For me, this is my place as one of my favorites all the time.
