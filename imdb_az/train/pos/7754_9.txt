Any way to the wind is Tom Barmans (who knows the pioneer name of the rock formation 'dEUS'). A completely taken film in Antwerp (Belgium) begins with a sunny Friday afternoon, and many main characters throw a lot of things in between. <br /> <br /> When the film ends, there are many things to think about because most of the story lines remain open. <br /> <br /> In the film (the only instrumental) socks off. On the very scene, music really enhances the overall atmosphere and makes the film hallucinate to really watch at certain points. The main scene in the film hit the party very well. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use the video clip technique, and the main heroes danced in one of my best sounds. <br /> <br /> The scenario is great things. Camera angles and colors are very well selected. 'Costumes' are very hot and 'seventy' too. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable thing in the film is gentle touch that combines absurd, irreal, very dry or even cynical humor. <br /> <<<<br /> <br /> Without claiming to be a comedy (this movie is, of course, not a comedy but an alternative piece of art), it still manages to giggle and sometimes even laugh at its audience. <br /> <br /> This is a beginning that should not end. I hope to see Tom Barman movies better in the future, because I had a good time. Hearts.
