Many people like this movie and love it more, but it seems that this is a good reason. <br /> <br /> Many people say that the actor was superior, but who made a character better? Al Pacino. I must say that Pacino was over here, that would be a clarification here. But it's so good that it just makes the inside devil good for you. It was not such a great man to start with Tony Montana's character, but to bring thirst to strength to another level of betrayal; at the level of humanitarian. Sometimes Pacino sometimes looks a little cartoon and surreal, but nothing seems to be a commitment to me. A supported player has done a very good job. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really good, but he certainly succeeded in his role. On the other hand, Steven Bauer was good, yet Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and Michelle Pfeiffer perfectly matched her role. Robert Loggia always watches me when I look at the shout. Outside Pacino, they did not really have any distinctive or memorable performances. Everyone seemed to be in line with their roles just because they were there. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma has done a very good job in managing this movie. When an actor is bigger than life, the director should be given some credit and give it to De Palma. Brian De Palma, despite his respect, is a versatile director. He knows how to direct his films for genres, but sometimes it did not work well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A MP living in the Caucasus, at the end of this film, saw the loans and saw Oliver Stone writing, at least not surprised. However, it is a word for him. I am always with myself as a great writer and it proves once again with Scarface. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; this is certainly my favorite of Giorgio Moroder. it was a little bit of a job for me, but it did not bother me. <br /> <br /> This has been one of the most prestigious films ever since 25 years, but, as we said before the wrong reasons, cinematography is not good, really good. Tony Montana must be aware that he is not a hero, a monster, and he does not inspire it anymore, it is strange, bloodthirsty, unread and consume himself, but he is an example to many people because he is in some way or another rebel, but probably all of them are a deluded gangster. <br /> <br /> A good thing about this movie shows that Tony Montanas is not a real problem, if we or the authorities want to close people like him, we can do that, but we are not Kiel certain way, it is the necessity of our society. We need to do things a person and it is the abuse yourself, the more good. Tony Montanas from this world is the victim of our society. No one is apologized to him as a human being. Instead, it is much more reminiscent of us that we measure or think better than a gangster or a drug dealer, so that we do not apologize or act badly. I love this movie because it is more than a corrupt movie - this is a strange way to express itself.
