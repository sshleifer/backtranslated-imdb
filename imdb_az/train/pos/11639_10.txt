This evening I saw a leading violin for this movie. I absolutely loved it. The film kept me all night on the edge of the chair. Cillian Murphy is incredibly terrifying. For those who are seeing the start of the batman, his character was very scary in this film. He played his character very well. The most terrible "bad guy", I've seen a bit. Rachel McAdams was very nice. Everyone in the audience laughed, frustrated, and at the same time came out with joy, as though we were fighting. Tension passes through the film. But an incredible part is not the last anti-climate. Finally, I was not disappointed. I enjoyed it. Trailer does not do the movie justice. Movie is better than trailer. Do not expect this movie to appear on the video. Go see it. Although I did not pay to see this movie, I'd be glad to see 10.75. Enjoy!
