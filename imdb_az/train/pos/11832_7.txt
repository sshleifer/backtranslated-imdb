Time for a rent, eh: I thought it was a great movie to watch the Spirit. But there were a few things that stopped me from rating 6 or 7 (I'm a bit generous with 7). <br /> <br /> 1 point: Matt Damon makes me worse. When I first heard it, I thought, "How many nails do the main character have," and then realized that it was Matt Damon. The man remembers me very badly - The appearances in The Departed were terrible and destroyed the movie for me (the film had something to destroy itself, but that was another story for a while), almost "the Spirit ". <br /> <br /> 2 points: Brian Adams sucks ... The whole score was terrible ... These songs are unoriginal, common and badly executed; is not compatible with music once; and the words were terrible. Every time a noisy song came on, he closed me. I was almost thinking of turning my patriotic propaganda into a super-American liberty (I could not help but remembered these terrifying patriotic songs on the radio after 11/11). Taking into account the native American aspect of the film, they should be able to use the right tools to play with the appropriate music, small radio-hit, teenage-bop, 14-year-old girl dresses. I thought I was in a small school. I can not believe that something better can not be done - I refuse. If that were not so, I'd better meet the movie with Disney, who knows something or two about the originality (do not think it's okay to think that you know somebody); <br /> <br /> Some things like art and animation, except here and there ... sometimes seemed sharp because of the violets. and thick or dark lines on the body (mostly thick / dark lines near the end). Often I resemble emotions and facial expressions, and I thought I was unable to make any real emotions. But there were times when it was time to get emotionally. In any case, many scenes were lazy and the layers were clear. /> There is a wonderful attempt at the epic film ... though it was mediocre. Matt Damon, you suck!
