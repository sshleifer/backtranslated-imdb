This Hong Kong prepared more melodrama than the cost of the weekend "The Young & The Restless". This is a retreat from the original Emmanuelle trilogy (especially Goodbye Emmanuelle) than a D'Amato sleazefest. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) has a striking transformation for a warm-to-trot streetwalker with her nurse. Future Italian porn star / politician, Ilyona Staller, later goes to Ciccolina (and has sex with HIV positive John Holmes) Emy's rival. Exotic places and some good soft-core scenes finish this work. Recommended for the fans of the original Emmanuelle, and I am one of them!
