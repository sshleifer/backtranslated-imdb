<br /> <br /> I do not need a coat, I need a movie soon. <br /> <br /> There is a brother in my plight, but he has not started yet, though he will go to Iraq after the end of December 2008. Between 09-15-05, Ramadi left Iraq my beloved son from an unmanned rocket in a green zone in Iraq. There is a brother who joined the army shortly after graduating high school this summer because he has an idealized and romantic idea, as his older brother, in military service. My son's son died just 10 days in the country and he did not go to any position, so none of my nephew's experiences in this sophisticated documentary did not allow me to relate my personal experience to my dead son. <br /> <br /> One of those who met me met with me. <br /> <br /> Has met with me. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to help with this movie. <br /> <br /> The film's film "The Truth on Earth" is the best visual reference. i saw I do not want my younger brother to see his son get into bed at night. BUT: (do not laugh) I need to see this first. He really sees and hears these men and women, but they will, in fact, live forever, not their thoughts. Then, he will have a sensible determination to watch my brother watch this movie, and then he can watch his son, his youngest son. Then my brother may begin to take this seriously. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> A DVD If he is not a player, he still uses the video (with correct bands?) So I have to find a way to watch this movie. Can I get this form from anyone? If so, is there any other way for me to do this as a bandwidth? Is there a legitimate link that I can afford to download to my computer, and then transmit it to the tape? Whom do I contact? I will gladly pay for the privilege of providing a legitimate connection. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, if you have any alternative ideas, I will consider everything you can offer. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I lost a very precious person and I already loved it, and when I come back, my oldest brother will never be the same, and I can lose it. I lose three things, and for all those who come back, this emotional burden pays for every child in my family paying for it. Please help me. Fortunately, I'll call you, it's the best way to get the right information. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
