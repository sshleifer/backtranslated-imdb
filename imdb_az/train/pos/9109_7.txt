Basically, it is the story of two people who are part of the Portuguese Revolution. The competition was easy to understand, but usually the filmmakers start to talk about something other than the fact, or it shows the periods before or after the truth, where everything happens within a few days of the revolution. This can also be seen as a documentary. The film shows that these two people are normal, not normal forces, because the revolution comes from man. Although they were taken from the military headquarters, they may have understood that they are the "names" of the main characters. All the film's beautiful colors and lights, the first film director's excellent work, does not fall in the same way. Demonstrate good emotions and ambitions of people and the crowd. The Maia character (one of the main) is well-prepared and has a good comment for Stefano Accorsi, can show the limitations of Maia, not heroes.
