It's one of those films that I feel strongly in need of movies. In general, I'm a fan of films based on true true stories. And that's great! Apart from Meryl's recognition and praise, his greatest asset is based on this story. A couple of social and legal torture survivors are an eye-opening story that is truly a humane side of humanity, after having suffered a great emotional pain in the unexpected and pitiful death of baby children, and is a very elegant and legitimate society. It is interesting how people think of themselves as good and intelligent people (eg emotional jury women in the film), in fact, surprisingly considering all their accusations and prejudices, those who want to connect their brains to any debate, and even openly express their ideas. The other side of a "cultural" society, the film, has become a real cruelty to the pain of other people (even though this is a great fairy tale to Australia). If you are ready to take something seriously and possibly thoughtful.
