A classic, high-impact low-budget tension, which brings out the horror symbol, and begins the career of director Carpenter and star Curtis. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the killing of a murderer is escaping from the mind and return to his hometown. <br /> <br /> Halloween is not a work that does not live up to its reputation as a scapegoat! The carnivorous story and the clever aspect of the carpenter will be made to really feel this movie, and this boldly gives a good life! Movement often consists of simple elements, shadows, dark streets, lid doors, which provides a truly creepy daily structure of a small town. The carpenter is a feat that drives him in good times and never shakes his horror movie directors himself, with his shaking shocks, to make them most effective! Moreover, he is really wise enough to give a very unpleasant young hero and a very terrible person to the fact that the tension is even stronger. The highest kudos go to Carpenter's simple but frightening noisy music. In a sense, Halloween is a wonderful example of a great fear film! <br /> <br /> Casting is very nice. Young Jamie Lee Curtis is in a very good turn, like his beloved lover, Laurie Strode, who will continue to be in many other horror movies without entering any of the great movies. Great Donald Pleasants, Myer's doctor, is a perfect performer. <br /> <br /> So, like her treacherous, Halloween is an irresistible force that does not hesitate and hesitate. <br /> <br /> <strong>
