This document prepared by Marian Cooper is absolutely wonderful. I saw this night on the Turner Classic Film Channel. I think I'll see if I can order a copy of the DVD. As you can imagine from the B & W silent movie of 1925, film shots do not look blurred and dark. The documentary filmmakers set up in Iran in 1925 released a deserted house in a documentary film and dumped a deserted tea, men, women, children and animals ... Then it passed through the snowy mountain up and down to all YalÄ±nadeh. Swim or swim and climb or die. Looking for hay for animals. There are cows, goats, dogs, horses and mules. At one scene, a man is carrying a machete who is very sick to climb the mountain. Documented children are all happy and healthy. They had such a difficult life. The immigrant tribes of Iran are still the same. Appreciates modern life in the United States.
