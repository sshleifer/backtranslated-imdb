Personally, I cut it thoroughly. This was the first time I saw the Australian slasher flick in the theater. A genre is normally limited to Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> With all the usual puppet comedies and dramas coming from Australia, I was forced to see a horrible movie that was far from anything. Even though I did not really think it was part of other films. An unusual subject, such as Nightmare on Elm Street, was horrific, not Scream, or I know what's going on in the Last Summer and therefore more blasphemy. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ font> I'll give you seven and it's a serious thing I will not. I did what I was expecting, amused me, and I was scared enough to satisfy myself. I liked it.
