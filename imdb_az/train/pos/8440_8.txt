This is the last episode we deserve. At the end of last season, everything was "going on in life" that was a difficult situation for the real series. Although not a happy show, this series always thought (something rare on television) and this is no exception. 'Death is justified by reason?' "Does the population reflect the society, or is it a society formed morally by the few people in authority?" 'What is a fair death and can it be?' All these questions, and more often, are posted by the show writers every week, and this is their latest thesis. Beautiful work, great writing, beautiful camera work, brilliant design, clean direction. If you've missed the sequence and missed it when you first run away, wait in a certain way. If you are never watching the array, it will stand up, but it can be hard for anyone to see who they are and what they look at. For those who have not been watching for the last two seasons, this is very satisfying.
