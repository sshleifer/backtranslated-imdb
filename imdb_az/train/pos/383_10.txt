When I heard the first notes of Quincy Jones or saw the flower purple in the grass flowers, my heart kept going from the beginning. This is really a movie to cry and die! The whole cast gives you the best performance in a film I've seen for years and Spielberg has really gone away! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh lord!), Danny Glover and others, all give us the best and feel - almost touch! Goldberg IS Celie gives her a sense of security and humiliation for the character, and we grow stronger with her, along with the film, and we win with it. Margaret Avery, though the most arrogant, is as beautiful as Shug Avery, and shows us that "sinners" really have "spirits." Always a romantic, charming Danny Glover guy with a nice job and great music to hate him (I would say) Quincy Jones adds more beauty to this amazing movie! Photography, music, director and music make this beautiful, spiritual movie life experience. You do not want to miss it! Remember the "Sista" ... step ... "
