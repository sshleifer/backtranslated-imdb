ATTENTION, SPOILER! <br /> <br /> Many people say that Ape Planet is the worst movie of Tim Burton and is weaker than the original film. So I decided not to see. I do not see that Tim Burton is still a Tim-Burton movie. I decided to do it, and I realized that it was right. <br /> <br /> Obviously, such a popular regime's "Planet of the Monkeys" is automatically influenced by trade thought. Still, Tim Burton directed his movie to represent a strange cohesion, such as "Beetlejuice" or "Batman." If you love Burton movies, though it is hard not to love one of your movies, though there are some disadvantages: nervous slippery monkey squeals, excessive dressed monkeys, and the leading actor who has been challenged <br /> <br /> The film is primarily the answer to the question : What is the outcome of Tim Burton's instruction to remake? Above all, if Burton did not want Burton to repeat it from the start; it 're-imagines'. On the other hand, Burton knows that almost every filmmaker sees the first movie version of Charlton Heston (like a human being) and knows that she is not remake without her model and that two films will stop. comparable. Thus, the film plays with this comparison at any moment, e. g. quoting quotes. As for the storyline, Burton is doing a brilliant job by answering open questions for the first time, and then all the viewers desperate by destroying the full clarity and finishing the film? Leo returns to the ground and finds himself in a world driven by monkeys forever. <br /> <br /> This is now a response similar to the expectations of the first 'Monkey Planet', a surprising, shocking end. One ending, more unpredictable, more amazing and: because it's totally mixed? and do I agree with various "Planet of the Apes" homepages and platforms here? does not make any sense. It can not be meaningful, or just a little complicated, that it is ineffective. Tim Burton plays his cruel games, makes a shame and works well. Burton fans like it, others may feel betrayed and may complain against some maniacism. Well, and the manufacturers will never ask again to redirect Burton again?
