Japan 1918. The story of 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of his father. As will be explained later, both died from tuberculosis. In this hopeless situation, Ryus was only married to a Japanese man from Hawaii. Upon arriving in Hawaii, Ryu sees her new husband as old as she is in the photo and lives in a very humble environment with a sugar cane plant. Ryu hopes to work hard in the field and to escape hopelessness in his new home. Soon he will find that he will not go anywhere. Kana's friendship with women gives her new hope and power. This picture is based on the real events of 1907 to 1920, when thousands of Asian women are married to men in America and are familiar with their picture. This very well-known picture is well-written and operated. The place is breathtaking. This film also works as a Benshi (author of silent films) in the latest screen shot of Mifune Toshiro. This film gives some ideas about Japanese culture here and in the ocean. A must!
