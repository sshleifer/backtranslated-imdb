Time will come and many are not aware of it, it is now. For this legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" is a traditional classic. Many filmmakers and environmentalists believe that this is our last story. The film is taken from the novel entitled "Make room, put a room", but whose name is "Solent Green". The story relates to the Earth because it is developing in the future with the destruction of environmental problems around the world. The planet's natural resources are exhausted and the basic food is put on simple staples. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now 'Solent Green'. At the same time, there are those who know the "real" substance in Solent Green and have been punished by their sinner and fear. The first is William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, a special police detective named Robert Torn (Charleston Heston) will investigate the reality behind the suicide. Despite the highest level of corruption, Simonsons's Bodyguard, Tar Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Security Chief Donnovan (Roy Jenson) are targeted at the Waste Disposal Factory. Thorn's head, Lt. Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes in suspicion, but warns those who want to shut down the "High and Hot", but Thorn does not take "The Job" out of the way. What a story about Thorn's death, just like a movie, has a recent warning. ****
