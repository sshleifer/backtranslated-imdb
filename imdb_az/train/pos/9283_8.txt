It is forbidden to return to live sporting events because women are not allowed to have a toilet in women's stadiums, for women to be "ill" in bad languages, fearing thousands of people. Based on the actual story about Jafari Panahi's performance, the daughter of the director consists of six girls who refused to enter Iran's football match between Bahrain and Iran in 2005. World Cup. Offside is a comedy with patriotic consciousness and universal appeal when we get away from Iran and minimalist films over the past decade, but there is a rather devastating social commentary to ensure that Iran is afraid of demonstrations. <br /> <br /> Non-professional players were shot with a digital camera, the girls were trying to hide in the Azadi Stadium in Tehran, but were arrested and placed in a holding outside. stadium They are protected by the three-member army (Safdar Samandar, Mohammad Kheir-abadi, and Massoud Khemem-Kabud), but they are ambivalent about their duties, but they are commanded to follow the rules. Women are not football activists, but football activists, and they are demonstrating for the victory of Iran, but it does not hesitate to capture soldiers while waiting for the girls to come to the vice-championship and for an indefinite future. <br /> <br /> It is strange to act as victims, and soldiers constantly question questions about information behind the restrictions and clarify their absurdity. Although they can hear the noise of the crowd, women do not see the movement, but they can get a small victory when one of the soldiers makes a comment about the game. One of the funniest sequences occurs when a woman is accompanied by a "prisoner" soldier in the men's room. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <strong> They were bigger than they were, and the potential antagonists were behind their countries and the victory they would send to Iran for the World Cup. Although the point is early and often taken, the film is somewhat evident. Offside is an explanatory point about a society to deal with educated and politically impeccable citizens of an elaborated group of political elites with a medieval social mentality. I only hope that the world's pressure and the awakening of his people will have to give the Ayatollahs to the 21st century.
