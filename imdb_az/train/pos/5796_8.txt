Moonwalker is the movie of Fantasy Music followed by Michael Jackson with different segments. Segment 1 opens with a music video. The music video also features a concert by Michael Jackson, who performed the song "Man in the Mirror", as well as the installation of historical figures like Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good choice to open a movie that loved me and loved the installation of historical figures. I even liked the message in the song. I'll give 9/10 to the first segment. <br /> <br /> In the second segment, Michael Jackson is set to launch the Jackson five's solo career. I thought that the installation was very well organized, I liked the animation I liked and I love the choices of songs like "I want you back, pushed it, tension." The only thing we want to do is to make something better in one of the montage songs, "We are in the world." The reason you see is the fall of rain, which reflects the chorus of Michael Jackson and the celebrities, but it is not difficult to feel humorous. In addition, the segment is still good. I'll give 9/10 <br /> Segment 3, Bad song. You probably think that Michael Jackson's music videos are bad, yes and no. This segment is Music Video, but it is redone by Kids. The sections were cute, but were not as good as other parts. I'll give 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music movie that takes place after a bad version of the "Fast Demon". Shortly pursued by Michael Jackson's favorite fans and press, and he drives a motorcycle to disguise himself as a bird and move away from them. Claymation in the sequence of exploration was great, but some parts of the movie looked a little fake when Claymation characters interacted with real people. And at the end of the clip Michael Jackson's dwarf costume comes from nowhere, and he's dancing too. I liked the dance very much, but it was not anywhere. I'll give 8/10 <br /> The 5th segment is Michael Jackson's Grammy award-winning video clip, "Leave Me alone". Music Videos on Michael Jackson's personal life, and Michael Jackson feel that they feel that they are innocent, and that they will not leave him alone. The music video really speaks (but this is what rumors happen to children aged 80). But I did not think that this Video should be in this movie because I do not think it's a kid's movie and I do not understand what children are reading about. I'll give this movie 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 brings us to the main story of the movie, Smooth Criminal. Michael Jackson plays a gangster (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) who uses his powers as a criminal character to protect the children, from Mr Evil Mobster, named Mr Big. He made a real movie, especially dancing, and sang a song "Smooth Criminal" with a group of criminals. I also thought that special effects were good. A strange thing about the segment is why it depends on a person who grows up why children are not explained. In addition, Joe Pesci talks about drugs and what he plans to do with it. I mean, why do you talk about drugs in a child's film? The other wise men were good. My rating for this segment is 8/10 <br /> Segment 7 is the last part of the entire movie. At the end of the film, Michael Jackson and Beatle's "Be Together" cover version, and then see Michael Jackson reading Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael Become a Beat is a good idea, and it's a good idea to bring a good singer like me to a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie. The film is Michael Jackson's, if you like Beatles's animated film, "Yellow Submarine", and this is the movie that you are the creator of a movie. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
