I love these "Diaper Baby" movies! Today you can not shoot a film and are rich in cinematic history. It's blue and the film makes you laugh. How can these children not "act"? In my opinion, they are valuable, and the kids make me laugh, but this is what other people are showing as naive in the early 30's. It should be remembered that when the film industry was too young, the stock market collapsed, world-wide depression had started, and that these films were separated from the real world. For five cents, seeing movies is beyond my understanding, but there is much to eat for 25 cents. It was a different time with a totally different mindset.
