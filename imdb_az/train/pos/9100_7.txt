If Spanish films are not Gold, it is definitely a Silver Age. Pi√®dras is another example of a film that seriously frightens people and their conflicts. Still, it is still melodramatic that emotions are strong or at a level of life or death. It may be. <br /> <br /> Here are some stories related to each other. One is related to a delayed girl who does not dare to move to the next block on the street. One is about the middle aged woman who finds the lover of her life in the foot fetishist. Another girlfriend is about the girl who has drug problems leaving her. <br /> <br /> In some cases it is a madman of a prostitute who has genuine love. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing. Women in Spain were taken seriously.
