Everything was fine with 90-year-old children's films ... lovely dinosaurs, beloved children, an excentric villain and a few great songs (and typical little mermaid / beauty and animal type songs, but fun ones)! I recently fled to this movie and I still love it so much! I suggest everyone of all ages to watch this movie and I think it's definitely going to give it to younger generations! I'm not the most informative of grief, I'm not scared ... just ask me, trust me. All those who oppose this movie kill their own innocent children!
