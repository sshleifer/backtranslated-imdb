I have watched almost all of Gundam / Mech anime who has demonstrated in the US and have so many good stories. Its consistency and the way of the coup d'etat are rival. Gundam's wing is mainly a series of politics and warfare. A group of five 15-year-old boys trained for the pilot state of the artistic mobile suits known as the Series, Gundam. Gundam pilots were prepared to fight with the strongest reformers known by their name. After warming up between OZ and Gundam pilots, new political groups will be formed and the old will collapse. Old clashes will end and new ones will emerge. The Gundam pilots need to fight the world in order to achieve peace and put an end to all battles. But how much do they want to achieve? This anime comes to anyone looking for a show with a deep structure.
