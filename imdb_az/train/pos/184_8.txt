There are no people like Marion Davies (like Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (like Billy Boone). My film was a "clip" from this movie; It's a delightful thing to put down a scarf to reveal different emotions. Attempt to venture into Mr. Haines, currently; though I saw him in a less memorable role. Haines creates an incredible impression of joining Davies for a commerical meal - he throws his hat with a few nice bits on the dining table. Haines and Davies present great comic performances. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) and his daughter Davies in Hollywood, and it will be Tinseltown's newest sense. Indeed, Davies and Haines are now comedy stars. However, Davies wants to be the true drama queen. Davies leaves Haines and shares with the amazing dramatic Paul Rally. But the audience prefers Davies to be more funny; maybe director King Vidor offers a job for the art example? <br /> <br /> Hollywood's big images are both gang and off. Packed with spectacular "jamaos"; at a studio dinner, at the stars table, sits between Davies Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best "bit" player is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerves to sign Davies! Arrivals are entertaining, and in episodic sequences, "Show People" helps to make a more important film than an important historical document. <br /> <br /> Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
