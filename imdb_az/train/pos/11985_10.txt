I am only 11 years old, but at the age of five I found my full house and looked at the age of seven. Later I grew up and thought that the Full House would be waiting and I would do "more important" things. Of course, for two years, my younger brother, who was loyal to me, began to think of him as "girly". <br /> <br /> Then I started at 23 in the afternoon and I was once more addicted. Full House made me laugh and cry. How wonderful it would be if our world were like the Full House world and a mother. People have heard that the Full House is cheesy and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls killed by a drunk driver. The elderly are struggling and hurt their feelings. Three men living together can sometimes come in on the bikers. What is more real than that? <br /> <br /> I brought a little show up to me and brought me to the top, so I thought it was at the point of complete happiness brought me. I made a show like a queen on the show and had a great obsession with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff came here, but they were the most strange babies I've ever seen, they're great actresses and very nice people.)
