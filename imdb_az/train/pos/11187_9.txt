Pet Semetic (1989) 9/10 The Kreed family moved to the small town of Ludlow. A mother from the family, Louis, his mother, Rachel, his brother Gage and a daughter Ellen. They were kindly welcomed by Judc Crandall. <br /> <br /> There is a way to a pet cemetery behind the new home of the Caucasus (a pet petition written). When Ellen wants to go to see this, Jud gets a family on the road. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the children went, Ellen's Cat Cathedral died. <br /> <br /> <strong> Ellen feels she is not ready for the death of her cats, and she proposes to continue her way through the pet cemetery, setting out on Lui. <br /> Micmac Indians. Louis is helping the Church without Jehovah's help. A few days later, the church rallied, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This film was actually one of two fears that could go beyond Exorcist. The greatest performance could have been the dream of Victor Paskoy, who was trying to help Rachel's spinal meningitic sister, Zelda, or the Creed of a deadly mistake. <br /> <br /> Film is an exaggerated part. At the same time sad and mysterious. <br /> <br /> <strong>
