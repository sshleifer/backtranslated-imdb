I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm a student I've seen this movie a few minutes ago ... And thank you to those who worked to create this movie! most .... but touched my heart ... why? I would like to understand it ... it's easy and accessible ... I'm talking about a good day after a bad day looking at a self-regulating movie without any regrets! We can give up on love and care, about our lives, but sometimes for material things ....... See what we look at, but let's miss it. ... why a fu? we'll do it? You have to live like a dead man ... take care of every second and remember: good things you do - good things come back to us! There's a special taste in New York ... I love this city and our world !!!! Thank you very much for the movie and I'm sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
