I know this is not a position associated with Zabriskie Point, but I like this movie. I know, I know - legitimately called Antonioni fanatic. I love L'Avventura, love La Notte, love L'Eclisse, love Red Desert, love Blowup, and love Professione: Reporter (aka The Passenger). The only Antonioni movie I have ever liked is that I've never given me less than 8/10 (and I only have to see less than 10/10, I have to see again both of La Notte and L'Eclisse, both of them), the Declaration of the Clouds, This can be called a fairly horrific film. But if you keep my sliding, there's no good movie. So if you are not a fan of Antonio, you must not see me logically. Even if it's a random fan, you're wondering if a particular movie, often followed by a film, is a saliva that Antonio's fans generally despise. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <strong> Yes, that's not true. If a movie is beautiful from a special point of view, tell the actor or cinematography or direction, and film viewers may love it, just as it deserves. But the film can be the most prominent masterpiece and may be a nonsense or an illogical story - it's another thing that has ruined cinema over the years: logic - and then they hate the movie altogether. I will actually agree in some ways. It is very difficult for me to love a movie that I perceive as poor, until I love her and want to change my mind. However, other people tend to enjoy an empty story. This, of course, should drive people away from Zabriskie Point. I can tell you the story, but you probably suppose it is something extraordinary. In fact, but for me, it just made all attempts beautiful and beautiful. I would compare it to my favorite movie in 2001. But in 2001 it was perfectly related to the scope of this movie. <br /> <br /> What is the state of Zabriskie Point? Music is very helpful; The score covers many movements of the day, including Pink Floyd. This mood mentions other masterpieces of Antonio's other arrogance and inaccuracies. Freedom from nowhere. The best sequence in the film is that the leading man and woman (whose name is Daria, I know, but I do not remember his name) makes a way to the outside of a historic marker on the road. There is an ancient pond on the edge of a stone wall built to blow up cars. This is mainly a rocky desert and both of them begin to play in this game. The setting is very nice. She says: "This is a beautiful place, what do you think?" Adam: "I think I'm dead". There is no inclination to whether something is good or bad. It's like the feelings expressed in other Antonioni films - heroes want to be constantly disappearing or invisible. Passenger Hero David Locke is fed up with journalism, and our friends have a hippie who is ill in politics - she speaks a lot and thinks they do not feel right or at least she says. <br /> <br /> This film is simply a vision. Antonio's films can be defined in several frames, but his vision was always a building. I love the passengers more than Zabriskie Point, but Zabriskie Point can be its latest achievement from this point of view. Of course, this can be called alone - L'Avventura and Red Desert are pictorialally beautiful. I think there are camera movements that are particularly nice here. Certainly, he earned a ton of money on the horizon, the biggest square of the day, the largest. It spends well here with air strikes. One of the biggest followers of the film is that Daria stole a man who stole a private plane and stole a car bomb. <br /> <br /> One thing that can be fairly criticized is the film's policy. They are certainly comfortable. It is strange that the Hippis are not easy, but Antonio's vision of the hippies - nothing in Italy, and is filtered through a foreigner's eye. There are many children criticizing advertising, but today's criticism. I say people do not see this? What Happens? Do you travel around buying things you do not want because of billboards? Or there is criticism against capitalism. Daria, a secretary, works for a company that stole land from outside - making it cheap and suburban homes for her and for the land she uses for her. Rod Taylor, the most famous roles of The Time Machine and The Birds, is a very underrated actor, playing his boss. The end that I will not destroy is that you should see it - it's almost cheaper. I can understand the treatment of police officers. I do not generally deny them, but it was terrible at that time. Now they can still be terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I find America's filtered appearance very interesting. I really do not think the hippie will agree with Antonio. 10/10.
