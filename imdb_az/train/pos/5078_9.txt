It was distinctive. I'm tired of seeing Hindi cinema, which is a fusion of all parts of Hollywood and the Brit. Some drawbacks were inevitable, but this film was a must-have. The description of Surya's clean, honest police was awesome (against those we normally saw). Nerukku Ner had a long way from his job. I like this movie very much and I have to own it. I usually feel for each character and, therefore, will not be able to bring myself to call myself 'silly' violence. I do not appreciate excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that hand in hand with Indian and Tamil films. For the lack of the same movie I liked this movie. ACP did not react to Anbusel's loss of her husband, she suffered a heartache and wanted to get me out of my eyes. There are certain times when watching the movie when I want to shoot the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it in the cinema. He never wanted to do this while watching the movie. Indeed, I hope Ghajini will be released soon.
