Oh, noir. My favorite genre. Otto Preminger's "Laura" is a film created in the next New York city, which has led to the spread of corruption and violence. Dana Andrews stars, like Sergeant Mark Dixon, lowered her husband's tactics to hot water with the top heads. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < is close to reach its goal when combined. Of course, typical noir fashion, things quickly fall down the hill. <br /> <br /> If the film does not do anything interesting in an interesting camera or narrative, it has a constant tone of fear and darkness. <br /> <br /> It's still something that you do not want to watch, as it's in one of Preminger's work movies. It does not have the visual flamboyance of the Wilder word, Wonder, Hitchcock or Welles's space practice. Like Langin's next work, "Sidewalk" really feels "clone" to what should be a noodle instead of a true work. <br /> <br /> The movie is not something special. About a police officer who slowly thinks himself a criminal. On one stage, Dixon explains that her father is hooked up for a little while, while the movie is flirting with the notion of remembrance, but it is a scene that goes Otto or is daring to get ideas. <br /> <br /> The camera job is equally disappointing. There is no discovery in the Otto camera. No effort is made to set the camera to something. Do not play with this place or architecture or step-by-step to improvise police procedures. It only build tripod and occasionally with dolly. Yet, though it is illogical, most people do not pay attention to these things. <br /> <br /> But our hero himself has a good shot in a car filled with gangsters (noire cage) into a carriage-lift (a cage) and the head gangster's lair. Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet," Otto's film is retopologized and always looks like "hell" above. It works well, but definite design does not strengthen it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto does not have fun with the possibilities of going to Noir, but the content of the Hawksian pattern to watch a noir appears. "Detour", "Night in the City", "Red Street", "Only One", "Violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager". It is competent and attractive, but extra special magic.
