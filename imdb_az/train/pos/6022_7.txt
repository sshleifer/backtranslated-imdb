Frequently incorrectly understood Zabriskie Point is Antonioni's American film, Antonioni's political film. Stilistically, the suit comes from the "Blow-Up", ie, the tempo is faster than previous epics, of course, less idiosyncratic. <br /> <br /> Mostly it is a mistake that the film respects the hippie generation. Or it is not. <br /> <br /> Two heroes come from many different environments. Find Darfah from "rebel" youth, property agency. But Antonioni really tries to escape from fashion as well as from their surroundings, and alienate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> and shallow, then moves to the city. The corporation continues to expand billboards, a meaningless situation, but at the same time expanding to maximize the population and at the same time generating profits. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, when Daria stopped by a small village around the desert, the environment was drowned, and people, like a good example of an old boxing champion, are now put under the shadow of a man sitting in a drink and a cigarette . A stunning melancholy sequence was a part of some semi-wild children living around "good", but was even stronger with "the destruction of a true American history." Antonio's thoughts on hippies are a very symbolic symbol. <br /> <br /> And then the desert, the landscape used for destructive effects, is pure and terrible, the first, the wild and the dead turns. The succession of the two heroes, the sequence "joined by the flower", reflects a similar sequence in the "Red Desert", which tells a story to Giuliana's son. Colorful doors in a colorful landscape. Semi-fantasy in the reality of drowning. <br /> <br /> The latter, probably, belongs to the pantheon of great endings in cinema, fragmented Western civilization. A catharsis, exorcism. <br /> <br /> Antionioni's two "international" films (England Blow Up and American Zabriskie Point) are less effort than previous masterpieces, but this is mainly due to faster tempo and inevitably inevitable situations ( Flower-force in London, USA). However, when it comes to him, it is clear that he has not lost his edge.
