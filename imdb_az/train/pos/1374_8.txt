Ester Williams liked a French movie. Synchronized swimming was just a hook for the story of three girls in a Paris fury that could not find themselves. There are no questions about where Ssiamma is the source of all the children being described as "animaux," but in fact, only 3 girls are in the spotlight, and a few adults and adolescents are generally in the background. Marie is a girl's stick, not ugly, but she's committed. She wants to be a swimmer, and Floriane (a beauty of a Renascence per reviewer) boosts himself, and she is also a friend of comfort to Anna: she is not ugly, but for her, she was short of bodybuilding and now is a woman's body. What happens when you travel to realize yourself without a road map, but of course there are three unfortunate madness: Where are the unhappy and foolish conversations of young people? Along with Florianian breathing absorption, along with the perfect combination of Marie and Anne, all these were cold and Ssiamma's puppets.
