It's about a UK company, Techa-Conn, or a contractor, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates something like a computer buzz and security expert. <br /> <br /> Her secretly learns to enter the computer, her director, Carl Malden, brings together the love of his office, Bob Newhart and his compulsory secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Business information was a little dark for these non-business-oriented eyes, but they are fairly convinced and have a general idea. Ustinov is fraudulent in Peculating, Peter, Paris, Rome and Stuttgart, and uses Texans-Conn to send all sorts of money to these hackers. Abroad companies are, of course, nothing else but Ustinov's roofs, an abandoned artist in Paris, a barber shop in Rome, and a bakery in Germany. <br /> <br /> I did not think I would want the first few minutes because it appeared to be slower. I was expecting something faster and more furious along the lines of "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang". <br /> <br /> In some cases, this film has its own sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Probably, this is <br /> <br /> Ustinov Smitte: "Let me have the assets of these companies." Smith: "What are assets?" Ustinov: "Little donkeys". Now this small exchange has never been done. <br /> <br /> Ustinov is looking for dull checks in Paris. <br /> <br /> Ustinov is looking for horrible attic in Paris. These are covered with dogs. The bricks were spread around and some of the old invaders survived. The host does not speak English and Ustinov does not know any French. Ustinov looks at the children's paintings of a lampy woman and says: "Ah, a famously fye-tal, eh?" The host giggles, responds: "Vous le prenez une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE, therefore his name!" Host: "Oui?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" (Meshadi Amis, if I were wrong with these breeds, je m'excuse.) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) Says he has hots for Maggie Smith and needs to drive his house, but takes his "route route". There are immediate sequences of urgent road signs. "Attention". "Lay-By". "Give way." "Yield". Disgusting ends with "STOP / CHILDREN". <br /> <br /> Ustinov's plan has another assembly designed to detect by the board - blurry roofs, police cars, a screw from Maggie, a screw ending with a hint: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs. <br /> Well, maybe again. <br /> <br /> I will not be able to win Malden's boss as I declare firmly that I never "aggravate the decisions," and then shave several drugs and wash them with a glass of water. <br /> It is undeniably beautiful. For example, Bob Newhart's best role. Not that it is not so much, its range is not limited, but also perfect in this section. Of course, the musical score given by Lauri Johnson made such effort. She seems to have written a brief concert for the flute. Ustinov's passion is music and his foreign businesses are led by incorrect names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. Stuttgart's fake president, Schmidt, is anomalous clinker. Maggi Smith is pretty sexy, and the bourgeoisie will not be as crooked as it seems. <br /> <br /> I do not expect it to be in its pleasant style but funny fireworks.
