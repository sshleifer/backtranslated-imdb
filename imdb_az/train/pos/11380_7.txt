Although the word is used to describe the genesis of gene Kelly, sometimes its dance is too strict, and she knows how to show you. In America, in Paris, he has dropped a number of prominent numbers, and some have ceased their sequence, but they look great. (Review Gene Kelly's "Getting Started From Bed") <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly, a star of a GI away from Paris, dropped out there, soon a wealthy female gigolo, but she is really a loves anyone! It's a strange story, but music numbers keep the show here! I really sounded the job of Georges Guitzer. His duet 'The Wonderful' is a beautiful film, with his 'Merder to Paradise' and Le Gene. I can pick Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron or leave. All this is pretty good, but not dynamite movie.
