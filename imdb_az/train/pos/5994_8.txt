For the first time, I enjoyed watching the short film "The Cure" by Ryan Cafri. <br /> <br /> I think it will not be a difficult time for cinematography when many young filmmakers (as I am one of them) start to build an indie. As you can see, the product is unprecedented or low in ambitions. But this film, directed by the young director's debut, looked good on the screen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> < especially in a short time. But I'm not really a fan of the story, though, as long as the film is not filmed and replaced. Part of the story is my personal tone, my guessworker worked a bit tricky. Thus, energy audiences retreat from the film's emotions. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a beautiful movie, I can see the director's entry. Go, Ryan! <br /> <br /> <strong> Greetings from China
