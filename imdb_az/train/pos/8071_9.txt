This film tells a friend about the rebellion in the 1920s in Ireland and the grace on his head, and then engages in another person's life. When watching the movie, I repeat that I can get a scenario and feel with just a few minor updates, just to fit into modern events. But the update would be good. Victor McLaglen's (a decent Oscar winner), and most actors in Hollywood, mostly known actors, have either been created or just begun on time. A very good movie worth watching. Be advised.
