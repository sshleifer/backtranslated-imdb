I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it when I could find a copy of it. There was a lot of emotions in this movie, and I felt so real, I could really face symbols sincerely. Every time I watch, the end is crying. How can I really get acquainted with the character of Busy Phillip and how will I feel if the same thing happens to me? <br /> <br /> I think all the universities should show this movie, maybe the desires of the people make the same thing. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the biggest films of all time.
