Ancient Mariner is a genuine classic piece of work, like the original poem. The context / structure of the old sailor himself is beautiful, clear and imprudent. Fiction, accompanied by poetry reading, is perfectly matched to the era and work time itself, using only the best-acting excellent action strategies that are still moving-up to the time of the audience. Earlier manufacturers of MTV era and much more in current affairs appear less apparent. (MTV has brought static movements to television and videos moving forward, without further action and focusing on the theme without explicitly focusing on theme or story). Sound, intonation, and vibrancy of Redgrave's reading brings this touching poem to life with all fear, strife, and pain. In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and sometimes the monotony (in which case the positive mood in the story itself) in the presentation of the author's sad and strange fairy tale. This classic poem, a sea story, a tale story, is a necessity for a love story that is almost correct and is a story that has a lasting impact on our world and our culture. Who understands the meaning of "Albatross"? or "water, anywhere in the water, and a drop to drink"? Very nice experience. Thank you Mr. DaSilvan for carrying out this life for us, and should never be forgotten.
