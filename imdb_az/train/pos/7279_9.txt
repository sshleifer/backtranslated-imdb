When I was five, my grandmother got this movie (always fond of horror films) and even so I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is awesome and the story is original and entertaining. I love the scenes that RV is in the desert. The rocks are convincing for such a low budget flicker. The player is on the average for such films, and music is very heartwarming. This is definitely a uder-rated gem. I recommend everyone who loves these strange movies in the early eighties like Alice, Sweet Alice, Poor Pretty Eddie, Nightmare, Hospital Massacre, and The Aliens, Deadly. Spawn "is definitely a classic!
