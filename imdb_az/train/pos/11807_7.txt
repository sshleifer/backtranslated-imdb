After seeing the $ 6.99 Dick Tracy at the Future Shop, I decided to become a great admirer of Mafia and Cinema films that did not know beforehand. A very entertaining, entertaining fun movie has been added in a strange way. The film is moving in a good way, of course, there is another great performance from Warren Beatty, but the real support of the film is Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to learn that Pacino was a candidate for his performance on the top gangster he was trying to get out of town. Madonna was as big as she was in trouble, she was very surprised and deepened her activity. If you're looking for an entertaining, smart actor and a funny script, try Dick Tracy a try. I do not think you will not be disappointed. And see for Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman.
