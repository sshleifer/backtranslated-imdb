For the first time together with Robert De Niro (although not released a few years later), this is the value of the watch. De Niro's role is not great, but first of all is fun as one of two friends trying to ban other couples, but forcing him to follow it further. Any De Niro fan who is hard to die will be hit by an early performance by the best actors today.
