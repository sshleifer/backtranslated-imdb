I saw it one year after the first American cables came in. My little one escaped, and I was only 16 years old, and this was a serious folk, a classic boy, the first new wave music I heard. The music was fascinated by Hazel O'Connor's beautiful appearance and charismatic vocal performances, and Phil Daniels's harsh, yet soft Cockney manager just stroked my heart. But my favorite character is that I think Jonathan Pryce is a fake fake player. He had come to such a group and was so harmless and miserable, only begged for his sympathy. Favorite scenes, performance scene on the lights and a love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Okay, so it's not Rose! But his limited budget and the UK's description of the early 80's were exploding with rebel youths and looking for a way out of the dole type. <br /> <br /> After a few years I went to England and found that my film reflected the atmosphere I found when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie, with some beautiful performances, music will blow you to your face. <br /> <br />
