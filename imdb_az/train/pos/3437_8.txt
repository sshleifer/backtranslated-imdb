Some genre films should be dressed. That was an exception. According to her dignity, this is a delicate version of the terrible genre. With a minimal special effect, with a simple but inexplicable theme, he / she can be a psychologist in turn - the bus hit and why? This is not a big movie, though, there are very few things about it, the story works. About the effects of strange and symbolic effects. In fact there is a contradiction in the opening scenes, but it could simply be placed there to prepare the tone for the future. I highly value the balance of men and women, and I do not recommend this story to anyone who is more interested in people who respond to physical and psychological problems. If you have a little empathy, you will need a little adventure in life and "What will I do in this situation?" You will get the question.
