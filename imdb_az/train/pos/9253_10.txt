<br /> Yes, the film is not exactly "funny". <br /> <br /> Okay, I acknowledge that there are a few HUMOROUS lines, but there is absolutely no laughing-loud noise. For example: Before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and his male costars, sh bedposta handcuffs and she can not remove the shirt. <br /> <br /> Dear, but not funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But Erika <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> Generally, 5 stars. I would give only three, not Erika Eleniak.
