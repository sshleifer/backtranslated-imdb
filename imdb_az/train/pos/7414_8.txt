It was a very enjoyable movie. A spectacular but striking look at the family and the commitment it has with it. The stories of a man from the city life in the city baths in a small Chinese village in the city. She appreciates what she has left home to escape, even loves her. The movie is beautiful because it's emotional and beautiful.
