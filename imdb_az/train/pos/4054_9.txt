For the first time in the 1980s I saw this movie as a naked barefoot. My dad really recorded it on TV. <br /> <br /> I have not watched the DVD for 20 times before the last release. <br /> Of course, I watched and watched the DVD and deceived how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version of the VHS, the film's mood was really dark because of dialogue. But the new version with Van Der Beek and others is more funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Miyazaki , the animated story and the quality are unclear, but in Miyazaki's lighter or darker storyline .....
