I do not know ... Some Muslim religious movements (pilgrimage) are an effective visit, but I felt that the film was too small. I do not believe in the film that only 223 people have voted so far since the film was filmed in 2004 and then received many awards. About the movie ... this is one of the best-selling desserts, one of the French youth films that led to Baccalaur√©at. Reda asks her to take her religious elderly father to Mecca. It is strange (if he does not know much about Islam), Saudi Arabia, one of the French houses in his family's pilgrimage, who will take his son as he wishes. The father and son's generation is based on simple conditions ('you know how to read and write, but you do not know anything), but some kind of bromidic generations are afraid of literature. They resemble their excitement. Ata Reda can be understood in Arabic, but can be answered in French. On the way to Belgrade, there is a fearful old woman living in the Bosniaks on the border with Belgrade, Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian), who helps them on the Turkish border, is the father and son of the boy who is always inappropriate. Not a lot of talking about a happy person in your movie. <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not like movies, the director says he sees beautiful images in every city they go. they have enough information boxes and can take the power of the camera's delicacies, but it's really great. Despite several unanswered details, such as Reda's unprecedented French lover, the film appeals to emotions. The great work of art and the debut of Ismael Ferroux to remember this film.
