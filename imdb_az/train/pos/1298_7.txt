The real anomaly in French cinema, there is no equivalent in modern production. Instead, look for Louis Malle's "le feu follet" (1963) (in the fire) to find something that is totally unmatched. Harel's effort. After losing all his illusions, heroes, computer scientists, there is no reason to live in life. There is no one. He praises the human race, lives as a kind of entomologist. Tisserand-Jos√© Garcia plays the nasty part of the decade - then Tisserand will be a kind of predator: all bad treatment will slip on this poor man. Hero stays in strange relationships: The hero tells the victim that his life will not always be fulfilled .... Now the film can be a more conventional shift (cluster misanthropy) but speaks for a while. <br /> <br /> The form is strange and is always one of the sounds for a hero, who always is the hero of our hero. The story is now in Rouen, Paris, Guy de Maupassant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < one parallel. For very short quotations of X-rated movies, but after watching it, you can feel the rash.
