This movie was excellent, I thought the original was calm. However, there are all the items, indeed, the Hemi Challenger factory, 1970, with four speed drives showing how Ana Mopar knows how to set up the best muscle cars! I was at the Chrysler paradise at this great block on the Hemi ground floor of Kryslski and it was a lot that he was convinced :)
