This film is based on Frank Frazetta, a myth fantasy illustrator. Some of the feature films are straightforward (Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation keeps the sense of original art. Bakshi is well known for his heavy use of the rotoscope (a live-action sequence) and this movie is no exception. However, the subject of the movie is quite real (all faces are human), it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> But here's really what I like: We've got a story with amazing characters once and beautifully functioned sequences, a really ugly villain and a beautiful babe. It is not surprising that Roy Tomas is a writer of our beloved Cimmerian Marvel series, and there is a sense of the best Conan comic! <br /> <br /> This Conan is far from disturbing the whole B-film of the movie, and is far from the casual activity. <br /> <br /> Absolutely recommend!
