Without watching this movie, I read negative thoughts and did not go, went and started watching. Since the movie is incredibly complicated, attractive and full of detail, I have not dropped a few times. This is a good thing, and it is indispensable for the culture of culture, explosions, ghosts and general immorality, evolution and character development. In fact, I use a lot to avoid paying too much attention to things that I'm on a good course. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of character development and line; we used it to analyze that we are in high school. This requires the audience to participate in the true mind. What a wonderful change. In terms of general theme, I will compare the 'General President's Person'. This is a serious behavior because of the seriousness of the "self" by the elected officials and those who have enough influence on the authorities. <br /> <br /> Unlike "all of the president's men," this film strives to give a few characters to the actual person. In this sense, the film is characteristic research like The Negotiatior with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In the film their characters are urban workers, and the plot is very strong. The plot, however, depends on their symbols to cooperate with each other, to rely on each one and ultimately combine against the Police Department. There are more gunfire in this film, and a special plot is different, but in general there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I want to say that City Square requires more concentration. In fact, I was parallel to the past, and I returned to the Watergate, the political turmoil that I had seen in my life. Certainly, the public knows that something is wrong! but it is difficult to track the details. This film is not nearly as complicated as real life, but in reality it is real to life. I think it's one of the reasons why previous posters have criticized the movie: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If you know someone wants to see it and is coming to practice, it's really good! I followed it 3 times consecutively! Acting is perfect and the leadership is flawless. The weakness of John Cusak's attitudes.
