I think that the creator of this film's concept is likely to be worth more than they ever did. Of course, it is not an Oscar movie, but at least for me, this film has been a constant impression since I saw it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a spoiler (and I hope), but affect your thoughts. Doing the first thought in your lips by saying the first words in your lips ... No limitations, no consciousness, no intelligent adults, we know that we should never say it or not, or return it. If anything, this movie just scratches the surface - it does not go so far. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood faces the challenge of re-creating old "classics" to try and make money today, it would be great to look them back on the old film of a successful success. to bring it to the next level? A little later, 20 years ago, could not solve the original crew or not? <br /> <br /> This is just my idea. : o)
