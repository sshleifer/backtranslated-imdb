Hello I was watching this movie for the 14th time in 3 days at the beginning of this day. I am a teacher of history that is most often in my hands. you need a life. I found a surprising similarity to the mountain. If I were white, I saw a lot of things like jean Lafitte. And, of course, my favorite movie of all film was Mr. Petey - "This baby can take a look at a 300m chipmunk!" oh, my favorite scene in the film was a drummer devoted to the work of the English and when it came to the British and it would not have been enough to finish the war completely. Well, I would like to talk about this whole film. OH, something more ... a few things. A purple physical physical bipolar mood, BEEYOTCH. thats it.
