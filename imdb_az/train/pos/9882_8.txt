<br /> <br /> <strong > I've seen a part of it on a start, but I really love it. Unusual, unusual, surreal stories in a magnificent West. The type of Naked City of the Westerners. Guests: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (Traitorous Mexico), Young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, and even Ann Robinson ("War of the Worlds"), Gloria Talbott ("I Have Done A Living From Them") <br /> <br /> From January 1959 to 1959, up to eighty sessions from 200 episodes until December 2010. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming, the trail driver, is remarkably remarkable as the Gil landing. He did not have any difficulty following Samurai's honor. I would vote for the president every day. (PS, there was a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) And young Mrs. Clint Eastwood is quite brilliant in his right hand, "Rowdy" Yates. She is also veteran western actor and musician of the country (immortal "One-eyed, one-horned, flying purple humans eat"), Sheb Wooley, as an experienced scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar characterizes the smell of the chef you can ask for "Wishbone". <br /> <br /> And then there is a song on this great theme, which was performed by immortal Frankie Laine. (There are Western themed songs that have passed through me all day between this and "Maverick".) <br /> <br /> We look forward to each episode; I collect all the set. <br /> <br /> Rollin, Rollin, Rollin, Rollin, Rollin, Rollin, Rollin rollin '...'
