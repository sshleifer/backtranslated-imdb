Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) experiences fear only after being accepted by a biker. He was shaken by the fact that he knew the attacker's address. As expected, Joe (James Russo) is forced to go to the aggressor Marjorie's home to insult him. Marjorie is helpless in helping her naked and bloody offspring to overcome the signs of the aggressor and spit on her throat and throat. Joe closed himself and wounded himself, when Joe came home, Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) tried to explain themselves. There is a sign of mercy, but not from Marjorie. Should He Continue to Punish? Votes violence, sexual abuse, and rough language R rating. Fawcett is moving away from traditional roles that he really cares about. Kudos directed by Robert M. Younga.
