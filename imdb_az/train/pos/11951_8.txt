Something about Sondra Pransky when entering the magician's box on the stage of the London theater. Sondra knows the spirit of the newsworthy journalist Joe Strombel, who is the Tarot killer, who is accused of committing a crime in London, to ask for a man to whom he has been sent to another dimension. <br /> <br /> Sondra speaks to the great Splendini, as Sid Siderman, while the magician is surprised, but only when a decision is made, is the man accused. go The two Peter Lyman would be P.I.s at the invitation of a club to go swimming. <br /> <br /> Of course, both of them will be funny, because Sondra will attract the attention of this hunt until it shows its secret. At the end of the film emerges. <br /> <br /> He thinks that the real Tarot killer will deceive Sondra, a bit. <br /> <br /> As a result, there is a perfect summer movie with just a few laughs. What is needed to get a perfect moment in a hot, cool theater. Woody Allen has done a better job and still this sunny comedy will confirm it for past failures. At Scoop, Mr Allen has pawing his beautiful lady out of the romantic setup. His trade fianc√©e is a trademark of this fun guy, so it's never going to get rid of. There are some funny liners that will not go unnoticed by viewers. <br /> <br /> "Scoop's beautiful star, Scarlett Johansson, looks like a perfect foil for Woody. Mr. Allen plays a straight part while making a respectable, perfect combination. Both were fascinated throughout the film. Ms. Johansson is a knockout beauty in a red beach suit, although they have been very laughing at most of the costumes on the screen. Hugh Jackman is regarded as an advanced man about a magic city like Petr Lyman. The man who made a good look in the film, as a man following Johansson. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Scoop is a lightweight film for hot and wet summer thanks to Woody Allen
