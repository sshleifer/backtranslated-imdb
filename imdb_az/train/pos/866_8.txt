Put Carla's shoes on your own. He is an unprecedented, well-executed, unappreciated administration. You know him: he taught three of the last three officials, knows where all the bodies are, and even sees you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. He always gives time to another job and, despite a serious disability, is better than the best, on the table, which makes the coffee half cup cups wandering on to the toilet. Yes? Do not you want to hear this? So you can not do it until your hearing aid is in place. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) has to make changes in her life. Work is never taken over; comrades rely on him to meet their inner needs, and begin with a crash that actually does not really strike. It will not strike - the deal is important - it is to hire an alternative assistant. Carla offers the demands that meet the needs of the truth: a "well-worked" man. This leads to the applicant's confirmation that we should pay attention to our desires. <br /> <br /> The Police (Vincent Cassell) has done everything wrong since the start of a business meeting, and hiring a caravan interested in Carla's non-business qualities. He sees the potential of this old thief, and as the story unfolds, dependence on one another's relationships develops very unusually. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul says, His skills as a thief help him win a political battle in Carla's office. But Paul has a great opportunity with the ability of Carla to read lips and draws her into a more intriguing world. <br /> <br /> This is a miserable movie that is inappropriate and likely to be appropriate for older people. Carla grows stronger, more professional, and more personal, as the story progresses and her disability gives clear advantages over the rest of us. <br /> <br /> A human being is growing up as a woman who has discovered the true side of the world while using her resources to overcome competitive obstacles. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are strange about each other. Without Paul, Carla will remain a doormat. Even though he does not make the best decisions on our way, we have our sympathy, hope, and best wishes. <br /> <br /> You will not hear the world with Carla's ears, but if you see the unusual correction of your hearing, silent sounds, but who speaks without talking, you will hear the sounds that are not so different. In a major sense, we have strengthened Carla's intuitive power to compensate for her disability. And we can all use it to hear what people are saying in this sense, and what they really mean.
