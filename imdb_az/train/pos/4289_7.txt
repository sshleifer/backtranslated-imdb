I should be 100% honest with other IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie only for a long time because of the poster. Does Charlotte Gainsbourg look so sexy and charming with this kind of smile? I'm in love with this woman! I bought what I expected ... just half. <br /> <br /> This movie should provide all expectations for those who use romantic comedy or stories about intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> I disagree with another IMDb user who says that the movie is being abandoned. ; <br /> <br /> "Pr√©te-moi ta ana" has many flaws. <br /> <br /> My main problem is the lack of screen chemistry among the main characters. <br /> <br /> Firstly, there's no point in showing a parent's romance moments or showing a point of interest to each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, both scenes are quite disturbed at one moment (both on the sofa) and will not help the audience with the possible love interests. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the film gives a lot of fun moments and has strong dialogues that support a capable point of view. <br /> <br /> I said it would be very difficult to fulfill such a whisper of a 43-year-old man these days. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a movie, and that's why it's a funny thing. Moreover, humor is versatile. <br /> <br /> There are comic lines with S & M, Patient, Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations for family women, and more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionburg's performance is top notch and she's a movie. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a great actor and a very good player. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat, decent performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . A good example of a good movie experience.
