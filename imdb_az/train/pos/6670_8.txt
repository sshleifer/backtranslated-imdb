There are many problems with Mystery Men. Above all, there is a very different character to give them all complex and even interesting personalities. The special effects deepen from the story and are not really special. <br /> <br /> Paul Reubens just disappeared with a sad, youthful role as a character with farts and unforgettable accent. William H Macy is the perfect pitch he has ever shown as three heavenly words and shows. Sphinx is a mysterious and merely a funny thing that is made up of traditional mystic fathers words. Ben Stiller is also very entertaining, showing the weak character that superheroes are trying to include in the big leagues. All the characters do this, and I'm part of this piece of fragmentation. Because all actors are Indie movie actors trying to become Hollywood's great players. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
