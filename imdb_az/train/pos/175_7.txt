It's a nice medium movie, but it's a bold, exec-maker from Ms Hawn, as a Producer and a leading role-playing tool. Even though he ends up correctly, he is ready to show himself as an unhappy bimbo. Since then, the actresses on the other list have been subjected to a wounded attack for several years? Not much. Does this mean that a female pop can not be funny? Goldie is superior to other actresses, because he will not provide screen identities and initiatives. Sandra Bullock sometimes goes there, for example Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman has never been pratfall to the police. A beautiful singer. It's good to see some of my favorite actors, especially Chris Sarandon and Cliff DeYoung.
