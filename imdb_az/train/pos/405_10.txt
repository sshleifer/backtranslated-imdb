I have been an admirer of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This movie is the best fantasy film of the year. I think that the right to move is genre, on the contrary, it has a lot of movement and KongFu scene. Wait, did you say that this is an ORIGINAL fantasy moive? Do not forget to use the Hollywood form to evaluate this movie. I do not blame you for the person who makes "poo" around, because you are still young and need to know more about "culture".
