All about the 50s Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawkers, and so on. It is very exciting to see the film with director Ang Lee in a new perspective after seeing his films. Lawrence, the Kansas attack scene is awesome. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire becomes one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is as bad as a bad man. This film always feels the horror of the war and the desperate moments of the main characters who do not know that they will survive the next hour. Definitely worth seeing.
