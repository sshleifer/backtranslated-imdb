As nine brothers unrecognized role. Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss, which causes shell shock during World War II. Sir Ian Holm plays a smaller role as his doctor treats him. Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not help, but Glenda plays a bare housewife and captain's first true love, but they come from different classes. It's not the biggest movie, but it's good to see Glenda's beautiful talent.
