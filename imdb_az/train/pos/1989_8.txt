I acknowledge that Oliver's not love! As a young child - it's a long and moving story, a bit slow due to all musical numbers. As a teenager, the entertainment of this movie has proved to be an experience. Think of it as a feast of the classic story before thinking about Oliver Twist's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this film is the music and the majority of its music. perfect and very attractive. Many or all of the stone are involved in the scenic version of the music and are featured in their performances, and I consider it a plus. The performances are more "stagey" in the traditions of older films, and they are very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the real stars of this movie. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed is also in a terrible job as a scary screensaver. Even Sykes' dog Bullseye also performs well. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will hate, like those who take it seriously. Eliminate inflated scenario errors, misleading historical information or malicious behavior, will destroy everyone's taste. Just sit back and enjoy your entertainment. As you can remember from music, it is not a ghost fantasy, but a serious adaptation around the book.
