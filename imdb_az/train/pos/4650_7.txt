As a Swedish Air Force Officer I took the scenes of beautiful Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) in this movie. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer pod, while the RB 75 (Maverick) missiles were black in black with the black letter "EWS 39". <br /> <br /> It is also very interesting that it is a very entertaining movie (last minute). <br /> <br /> <strong> Anyone who wants to see the SSG's various military units in Sweden should see this movie. <br /> <br />
