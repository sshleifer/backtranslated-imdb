I just do not stop watching FREEBIRD. My husband was additive, so I started. We contacted Jon and helped to introduce the movie, which was released in both theaters and the DVD. Even the cross-channel ferries and the distribution of promotional cards in various parts of France. FREEBIRD is an adventure-driven, fun-going and serious moments, plus a perfect combination of choice castings. Only Phil Daniels can be Grouch's role. Great privilege to get acquainted with John after the first one in January. Or, if you want anything else, Jon, or email, or phone, you can ask me how. Sue xx
