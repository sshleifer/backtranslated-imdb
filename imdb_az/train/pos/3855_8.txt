A catholic writer Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) is invited to the Vlissingen literature club for homosexual, alcohol, and frequent vision killings. At the railway station in Amsterdam, it feels an attraction that does not fit a charming man who moves on another train. Gerard has been presented to the treasurer of the club and beauty worker Christine Halslaur (Renée Soutendijk). She is a wealthy widow who owns a beauty shop, Sphinx, and they have a night stand. The following morning, Gerard watches Christine's lover, Herman (Thom Hoffman), and recognizes him as a man on the train station. He offers Hermann to spend several days together, but with the intention of deceiving a man. Christine goes to Cologne to bring her husband, and Gerard remains alone in her home. She drinks a whiskey and snoops her safety, finds three film rollers with men's names; Kristin describes the marriage of three boys and all of them died in tragic accidents. Later, Gerard Christine was a genius and asked whether Hermann or his fourth husband had been convicted. <br /> <br /> This indefinite "Vierde Man" is another great feature of Paul Verhoeven at the Dutch stage. The story is supported by an excellent scenario using the Catholic symbols to build tensions related to smart characters; Jeroen Krabben's spectacular performance as an unhappy alcoholic writer; and stunning cinematography. The mysterious resolution is open to comment as many European films that investigate common sense and intelligence. In the promotion of films there are middle men who use the nudity of men; However, Paul Verhoeven uses Jerard Reve's nudity as part of the plot, and never be an aggressor or sympathizer. Last, but at least; The revolutionary beauty of sexy Renée Soutendijk is in the role of a woman who draws a perfect gay writer. <br /> <br /> <strong>
