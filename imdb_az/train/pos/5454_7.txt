Is one of the most attractive and important films of the Pre-Code in Hollywood in the 1930s. Unlike some Pre-Coded Films, which sometimes have never been allowed after 1934-195, this movie is completely immersed in a very entertaining but funny sky from start to finish. The film, mainly the traditional morals of the 30s and 30s, has not been seen in this movie. Because the film is actually a woman who goes upstairs and does not apologize any way. <br /> <br /> This "broader" couple used to have sex with anyone who could help to enrich it - something you've never seen in movies just two or three years later. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck works with her father's talk. In addition to being his manager, he is also a journalist who is allowed to act illegally and encourages him to go to a local government official. Although it is not particularly clear here, Daddy seems to have taken his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after roughly aggression and assaulting a man with a glass of beer, Barbara's skull was enough and led the big city. <br /> <br /> Despite her depression, she did not hurt her father's killing and killing, but she did not feel that she was a prostitute and did not show it. <br /> <br /> Despite depression, Barbara uses sex to work in a big mega-bank. He started a very interesting job as a file clerk, but only a few weeks in a space, from one job to the next - lying down with the bank manager and his future boom !!! This results in a whole tragedy, but the Babs does not seem to be shaken by the death of these two men. In fact, after a while, he is able to drive himself to the life of a new CEO and once again (probably more than one). <br /> <br /> Nowadays it was a beautiful movie because it was very strange and unrepentant. Barbara played a 100% sociologist - a woman without any immorality and conscience - the desire to squeeze her out of life even though she was greedy. However, the brave writers and producers thought it necessary to "end up" and to end it. Given that this woman was bad and intestinal, her heart changes at the end of her heart was a big disappointment and she left the film firmly. In many cases, it reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL - once a bad guy "sees the light" and changes with unbelievable results. <br /> <br /> Try to watch my advice RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. RED-HEADED WOMAN BABY FACE, but ultimately there is no magic transformation - leading lady is actually a deep down skank! In DOWNSTAIRS, a movie like RED-HEADED WOMAN plays a big role and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar character. Both are classic and are somewhat better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is often a great curio in a short period of ultra sleazy Hollywood movies and worth seeing Cinephiles at this light. Both celebrate The Duke fans - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film and is very unusual for many young Wayne playing such a contingent role.
