The "chosen" to protect the Golden Child -. The young boy was prepared to escape from the evil forces of the world, but Murphy's help and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper / educator / defender are born with a clear life threatening life. /> <br /> Moreover, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience who want to think deeply. In such a scene, the Golden Boy, who wants to protect Murphy's character, is tested by the monks of the temple of the temple. An elderly priest presents a decorative necklace plaque to choose a kid, and the child is tested for their own choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy that thinks it's both good and good, and the evil forces in our world, most of whom are totally unaware of. As we have acknowledged this framework of the field, we must keep in touch with the everyday reality and prepare it to break up the earth and the walls and to expose a bad field that is waiting for destruction. <br /> <br /> <BR> This is a beautiful film, a beautiful toy, a wonderful game, and a very serious theme, a pretty worthy dialogue that combines a healthy balance between the Battle of Martial Art and Eddie Murphy humor.
