The name of this movie postponed me. <br /> <br /> A few days later, he was nominated for the position of head coach of Beckham. but I was pleasantly surprised. The film never watched with me, and I liked every second part of the movie. When you love the East you love this movie. Okay, so the story is nothing new, and classic stories are inside the film, but it's done with a very funnily and clean breath. The film is moving very fast and entertaining audiences. These consistent comic moments are not a good giggle and humor some bad attempt, and the best of all is the good British comedy.
