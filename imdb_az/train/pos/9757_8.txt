Richard Willaims is a god of animation. Prevents this movie from being managed by the producer. The final product is a very unmatched movie with a very strange story, but some beautiful animation moments (like Emery Hawkins "Greedy"). Repeated music from Joe Raposon does not help. Wide on the screen, the VHS does not show all its glory, and hope for one day's mailbox. You still have to watch some browsing animation.
