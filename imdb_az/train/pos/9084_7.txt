Yes, some people say that this movie is a waste of money, but I am a fan of this kind of hard dragon / the ultimate holy film of the world. <br /> <br /> But my stand was some of the best action sessions of this movie, which was a pretty good thing. But the fact that everything is simply toughened at the right time, or the type of film it falls to save at the right time when the evil devil is at the time. <br /> <br /> There were some funny lines and ghosts that surprised me in the movie. <br /> <br /> The 3d graphics were pretty cursed. 3d effects for this kind of movie became ALL! The great battle shown on the trailers lives up to the severity of the film. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there was a struggle between good and evil so far, it could have been long and a bit better, but still very good. <br /> <br /> Now I thought it would be better for parts. The start was pretty good, showing the portions that led to great wars. I do not mean that you do not want to see this movie in theaters, at least this is a DVD player ... <br /> <br /> Generally, I liked the movie, but the plot is just faster and just gets tougher.
