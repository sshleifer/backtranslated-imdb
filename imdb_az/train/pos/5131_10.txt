Jammin 'The Blues is a jazz-length of only 10 minutes of improvisation jazz, short of Oscar nomination since 1944. Marie Bryant sings in the part of the film "Sunshine side of the morning", and then squeezes Archie Savage to bring the most entertaining "jem session" to an exciting end. Director Gojn Mille was a photographer and this experience shows some of the two-sided shots of musicians, one of the 40's most innovative aspects. According to some notes I have read, one of the musicians was white and should be silhouetted with the reflection of social relationships of time. What a shame. Perhaps the most unusual of the time is available on YouTube, so if you love jazz, I suggest you search for it there.
