Sidney Stratton is unable to continue her work due to her experience in textile factories, mainly in textile laboratories. Stratton prepares a formula for a new piece to create the final piece, never indestructible, never wrinkled or wear-resistant. When Stratton finally creates the cloth, Stratton becomes the most hunting man in his white suit, as he leaves all the textile workers (they will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will earn money from a factory's exclusive right). The film is ideal, and only Ealing could do that. Guiness "(and great supporters like Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction turns the film into a pleasure, but the real hero is the story itself, drama, romance, and suspense.
