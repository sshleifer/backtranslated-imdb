I like this show very much, as you read a book, every chapter gives you more space. Think about what will happen in the next episode and how to fight for friendship over the years. After each episode is over, you have a sweet taste in your mouth: One - the show was good, wait for the next episode, and you really think what happened to your friends over twenty years. And two of them - the show was set for the "hiatus" and we will not exactly see it. Fox, of course, does not know what they are doing, they claim that they have lost audience in the 18-49 category, and they do not clearly understand that people do not want to see whether they are getting rid of a good show like "the Union." Although I want to raise, I have an inquiry. How do they bring the show back and go for another season since an episode has been done for a year and is based on what is happening in the story for twenty years? Your answers are most welcome. Bring reunion! Bring reunion!
