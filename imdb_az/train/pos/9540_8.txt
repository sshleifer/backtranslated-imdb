Most of the feedback I have about the Meatball Machine is quite mixed. A couple say that "sucked". Yes, I tell these people to get some f @ ckin's ideas and f. It was a very funny whistle. This story begins with this mechanical mistake, which attacks and attacks some of the deadly combinations of these Gwar suits called Naxroborns. Finally, you learn that these mechanical defects add a little bit of parasite to you, and then control your movements to heat your nervous system warmly. Unfortunately, two lover only for younger young people, they happen to pass through the mechanical bug, and before that you know that changes occur and the blood squeezes. Is there any way to stop conversion? Maybe this is a way to stop the mechanical hazard? Why are the Necrobots fighting each other? Do you want to help two desperate men to express their emotions and make them worse? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Head of the Caucasian Muslims Office: A few unanswered questions, sometimes acting on average and ending a bit of confusion are the only weak points I think. Without anime, when the parasites themselves become a small symbol with a sense of low budget, they hit more right markers than they missed. With a story-telling story that is quite interesting to ask questions in combination with sound-makeup effects and blood splatter, this should inspire a flaming admirer of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans. 8 outta 10
