Apart from the single positive comments I read, it is not quite sure what to expect with this. Well, I can not imagine this movie because "Come with White Hair" is very close, and it's a fantastic job. It goes a beautiful line between a farce, comedy and just explaining the story of a good old fashioned ghost story. There's nothing to be afraid of on this subject, the theme is a love story that deals with a bumbling guy who is experiencing a beautiful ghost, which is really a lot of problems with ghosts. Thus, the main subject is a person trying to save the soul. It also occurs in ancient China, wildly treacherous Kung Fu exhibitions and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the shutter action ghosts are pretty cool and the higher the rate at all levels of visual effects. I could watch the genre of Chinese cinema all day because they are very entertaining, great visuals and pretty much talkers. And I'm expecting this movie to be the first one to follow. Be advised.
