De Sika is one of my favorite directors, but it was a hit and miss for me. The leader of the community of illegal immigrants in an area outside Milano becomes a stupid young man. Toto is slowly transforming into a magic fantasy fairy tale as he develops superhero powers, a detailed and vivid story of innocent poor masses filled with bad capitalists and happy happy police forces. After 10 minutes, I came up with smiling Toto here and dumped out of magic. There was a spectacular shocking shooting that I thought there were not too much of a good character among my displaced people than the film's material. The combination of neo-realism and fantasy can be more "look at our appearance" compared to a fully-developed work / art sample.
