A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and Tomorrow's World? <br /> <br /> "Rönesans" Fransız animasiya layihəsi bir aylıq büdcə üçün 7 il çəkdi və bu axşam nəhayət onu görmək lazım idi Stokholmda keçirilən Beynəlxalq Film Festivalı üçün xüsusi yoxlama. Fear of my spontaneous reaction; My next thought is' huh, 'pure' and closer analysis, a regrettable 'breeze'. A fantastic victory on the surface, but it puts a little bit of skin or even as characters straight out and it's unnecessarily complicated structure appears to cross. <br /> <br /> Along with this, it is clear that people in Onyx's films have done something awesome on the surface above. The visuals are striking. They use basic graphics to capture live action motion into key-frame animation with black and bright white contrasts and heavy-shaded rotoscope background. Not with "technical lingo", it looks like Sin City full animated movie for you. Its liquid, transparent, dark, and stylized template is completed with a large lie lightning. This is a vision. In addition, many credit the futuristic weapons, silent music, heavy raindrops and glass breaking imaging is associated with noisy sound effects. <br /> <br /> The film "Avalon" in response to each other in a large company, which began as a shiny, bright, futurescape it zooms in Paris. Citizens (minor transparent screens of minority reports) and citizens with genetic engineering. Finally, the young researcher Ilona (called by the beloved Romola Garai) leads to a secret kidnapping. Our challenging boiled cop-on-stopping and cut off the protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig)? a man who accepts the law of his own hands? Ilona finds and removal claim. In this case, Illona's sister also helps her with a love affair. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance world is very remarkable. Director Christian Volckman noir just a jab to the melting of the issue, and as a result, cadlar, mice, hiding in the shade of femme fatales and full dartanların is not just an urban jungle filled with detectives. Those who create the problem would surely be "very surprised" for the main viewers because they needed clear and written archetypes in the story, or because of the strange animation of the film. Bundan sonra biz şüurlu laughing villains, sleazy cinayət bosses və onlar almaq hər şans tüstü zərbə çətin-balalarını kimi klichéd simvol bir çox var. <br /> <br /> As long as the dialogue is a little drawn. Apparently, each line has the only reason to push the plot. This is not a deadly one, because the area is more complicated after it needs a precise direction. Daniel Craig also helps here by bringing a nonsense attitude to a very tough steel character. At one point in the Renaissance, he is watching a live car, which is definitely one of the most adrenaline-pumps and top-line tracks in the film. Unfortunately, this fantastic image updates have left the car and the "Renassaince" can take a little longer. In summary, a very interesting and flawed futuristic comic book experience. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7
