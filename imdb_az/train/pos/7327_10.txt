I recently had a scene that I wanted to see when the 90s fear films could not hold the 70th and 80th horror films. I'm wildly similar to the Haunting and Urban Legend in this forum. I feel they (and others like) do not know what the real horror is. And I was dumped into our local video store and drowned some classic horror movies. I already have all my Friday, so on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Elm Street Nightmare, Jaws, Exorcist, Angel Heart, Exorcist and Halloween. Now other films are classics, but I want to talk about Halloween. Because Halloween is perhaps something else that can make a movie in a horrible movie, and therefore uses blood and untrustworthy methods, techniques, and uses them to scare the live day you use. I stayed in a room with the lights of my own and, as I know, I wanted to see Michael Myers behind me. A movie I've seen in the last decade has done this to me. No movies. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter drew a low budget movie and was afraid of a generation that filmed. He showed you in 8 or 9 figures that you do not need a budget to frighten the audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is what happens, not what actually happens. What was this shade? What was the sound above this? He knows that these are ways to intimidate and use every element of the textbook horror that I can use. I even think that he has some of his own ideas, and these people should have ideas that he uses today. But they do not. No one uses illumination and detail to avoid being scared, they use special effects and blood flows. And it's not just the same. Do not be afraid of a giant special effect that creates high noise and jumps from the wall. The moments when the murderer kidnapped, somewhere, I do not know where you're scared. <br /> <br /> In 1963, young Mikael Myers kills his sister with a big butcher knife and then holds the next 15 years of his life, silently closing an institution. Lomis (Doctor), Sheriff Brackett, says, "I was trying to reach him for eight years, and then I was convinced that he did not go another seven times, because what I saw behind the eyes was a clean e-villi." a manic and disobedient thought of a murderer will not end up in anything to get his desires. Here's what you want to kill all Laurie. <br /> <br /> What Carpenter has written and written with an error point here, cunning lighting techniques. Dreadful masterpiece of horror. There is a scene to be described. And the scene where Annie can get Paul. He goes to the car and tries to open it. Only he understands that he left the keys in his house. He takes them, comes back and opens the door of the car without accidentally using the keys. The audience chooses to do this, but it's not. He thinks about Paul. When he sits, he sees the windows are smoky. She is surprised and begins to clean the mouse, and then Myers hits her back seat. This is a beautiful scene, because it gives you a great deal of attention. We know what happens and does not have Annie. But Carpenter believes that filmmakers were afraid of hell in 1978 and last year. <br /> <br /> Halloween uses the stain looks of a killer standing in the background, pigeons have a terrible wall, dark rooms, creepy and horrifying shadows along the horizontal tracks, a dangerous word by Donald Pleasance and insulting, cruel killer. Our day and age consultation with filmmakers is to learn about Halloween. Why should I have blue printing on fear movies? Following the steps of Mr. Hit√ßok Carpenter, maybe the director needs to follow. <br /> <br /> Halloween describes everything that scares us. It is a movie that Halloween can see when it tires of all the foolish horror films that do not know the difference between devil and incision. This will not let you down. I'm afraid, I'm glad, why I know, but I do. Nothing in the 90s, except perhaps a movie (Wes Craven's last nightmare), did not scare me. If you do not scare the animals, you'll see Halloween. If you've ever seen one hundred times, go back and see again, like a Urban Legend movie. City Legend will have fun on all the beautiful faces of the movie. Halloween will be frozen with fear, stuck to sit, not wanting to move. Tell me now what kind of horror movie will you watch? <br /> <br /> After seeing only the version of Zombie, it will do more to keep track of it. This is a certain classic. Zombie has broken his version, but it does not shine away.
