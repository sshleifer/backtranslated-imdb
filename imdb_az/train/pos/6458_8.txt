It is a beautiful film, which surrounds the simple, but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect and it could be really perfect if you see that nothing is in the world, it's pretty good. The only minor thing that objectively protests is the pacing in the middle of the story. Acting is also very good, and all actors can easily bring actors to high-end films. True guidance was well thought out and beautiful. <br /> <br /> The film is a perfect ending when it comes to being the main character in heaven. a really sparkling yarn.
