I was watching Pufnstuf every weekend, about 10 years old. After Mr. City Rollers. One day I saw the family coming to the Channel and taped for my three year old daughter. <br /> <br /> This show has forgotten all the things loved as a child, magic flute, gentle broom, Witcheepo's makeup. The mayor, of course, is an example for the Mayor McCheese and everyone is a creature filled with annoying googly eyes. But kids love this stuff. They used a soup puppet rather than sitting on high-tech computer animation. There is a soft slapstick, but it's an adult theme that does not die like sex or humans, and children are taking Jimmy's schemes. The children think that they carry a bag carrying a smokes around and that they can not stand a fire on their homes, and I always love seeing a jet stream in my mind, where my daughter Witchypoo flies from the air. Music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loves it. "Different, difficult, different, different," he says in the car. <br /> <br /> My daughter has watched this show once a day at least 5 times a day and is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf works in 2000. I really hope they keep an old flavor and do something like computer animated characters. I think I love Pufnstuf a new generation.
