movies like these are the ones that you have never been to when you are growing up at school. If you love this movie, I invite you to watch your lover. I just learned that the man who played Marty (Simon) today committed suicide after releasing a shameless movie after a good job. I am surprised by the part I played in the movie. This begins when Carol's daughters encourage them to enter the toilet. When changing in the showers, Carols is shocked by the famous comrades in the bathroom and everything is ready, camera, electric shock. When Marty nudged the curtain, he realized that he was deceived. She tries to cover the shower, but the guys open it, take Marty and become meaningful when the camera rolls. They took him, frowned, and shouted, and threw his head at the peak and powered him a little. When children are arrested by the trainer, 2 of the boys are giving a partner to Marty. Go to one of the glass windows in the gym using the bricks to get the teachers to forgive. Marty leaks to the Science Lab while puking in the bathroom and mixes some cocaine-like things, but does not know what to do. The laboratory breaks it badly. Five years later, the children who were suffering from that day were invited to a five-year school meeting at an old school burnt that day. One man is killed. I do not understand how drowning really drowned. Marty could have stayed behind after leaving. He went out for the first time.
