I'm going to this movie I think it will be a sad movie. We were surprised and enjoyed it. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. There was a beautiful comedy. The jokes in this movie were strikingly original and really funny with a couple of straight jokes. The area was enough to cover each other, a woman (Eva) died on her wedding day and she came back to stop her, her voice was taken, but in fact she works perfectly. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Generally, it's a worthwhile movie watch, if the DVD goes out.
