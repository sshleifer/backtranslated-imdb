This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck is, of course, classic. The Hollywood epic, Hollywood has a great movie: birth, death, happiness, sadness, excitement, despair and so on. There is only one thing for me to race. I know it was a sign of the time, but none of the two main characters are played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor and has an astonishing job as a farmer in China, Wang Lung. Luiza Rainier plays with. He does not even look at China! He tried to get a role, but they had to put Anna May Wong into the role. I know why they do not know, and Ms. Rainier is very good in the film, but did not try to make it look "original". Especially when you read the book (I'm in high school, decades ago), take a great movie. You need to see it, just look out of the cast. I can do that.
