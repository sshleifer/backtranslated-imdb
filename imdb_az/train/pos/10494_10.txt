The full view of an adult woman will lose everything (even a productive mortgage). The way to get into the real love of this "special" business, innocence, and a small city populace is a perfect blend to give a fresh, light and comic comedy. <br /> <br /> I love European films, and my ideas are stronger with such films. <br /> <br /> The film that I was watching in the same genre was Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will love it.
