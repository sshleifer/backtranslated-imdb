For the first time in the 90s, I saw this movie for the first time. The room with the look also appeared new. Enchanted was much more than the April offer! I found more realistic and secular, and heroes believed that it was "normal". At the end of the film I felt like the BBC when I first saw Pride and Önyargı. I was enthusiastic to find out what heroes were looking for in terms of isolation, peace, freedom or love. In a sense, in Italy, you feel that you are away from everything that is known so far, taking risks and leaving behind all the criticisms and abandonment. But in the month of April, everyone's life loosens and opens (along with Victoria's corsets) and slowly restores everyone's satisfaction. A bit of the movie! How well do you know?
