I'm honest, I never expected this movie to be good. I do not like family movies. I'm an admirer of Captain Kapoor. The director's latest film (MPKDH was full of folly and the music was very boring and bland, but after my Ma Hoon Na I was Amrita Rao, Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher. Finally I saw the movie and I'm sorry that the MPC's younger lover brings us with a pinch of HAHK's marriage and we have a win, the story's story looks like HAHK, at first it's upheld by the regime, and the director is a character you can handle. is an eccentric, and I am surprised by a good performance, which is a great development and, most importantly, to his role, Amrita Rao is good, in fact it is his best performance, Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An Up Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas carried in a horrible way, no actor goes out of place. <br /> <br /> Poems are pretty fancy but when he watched them, he called out better, Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are wonderful children. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is beautiful on the course. Songs are not colorful and dance, they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, who refers to the HSSH and HAHK. What was the film defect? The film is slow enough and the end is extending completely. But the film is still at a good pace and makes it a perfect family movie.
