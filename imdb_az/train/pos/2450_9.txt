I've been watching this show since I was 14 and loved it since. I love this show because it's funny! Above all, this show is very costly, because every day shows something new and fun, and Benny has my favorite part every time about each giant's head, and then has the latest comment on George. * Laughs * I watched a comic movie with my friends at home, where I wanted to laugh and watch it, but it was like a short one. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular. This is a cool comic-family comedy series for everyone, and you will definitely enjoy it - I did! Even though you have not watched it, I suggest you to start watching it, because you will not want to avoid watching it. Even though there are no new episodes, I'm still working again. It's still funny. Never will be thrown away. <br /> <br /> 9/10
