I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats that are different from each other, but they call themselves collective "brothers". I often try to imitate the tired, creepy accents of myself, Hovis, or even the Scottish Scottish state of Gordon. There should be more episodes about Human Kimberly. An episode about cats, hiding themselves as pre-teen girls in Kimberly's dream party, is a cheerful classic to get their favorite drink, Rootbeer's thirsty paws. Do not drink roots in our home without using Catscratch or Hanson Brothers' "Slap Shot". Future classic. Where can I get my first two seasons on DVD?
