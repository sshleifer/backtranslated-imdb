This film documents a transformation experience for a group of young men and their experience of watching is transformative to the audience. Several films have even aspired to this level of transcendence and I can think that no other movie - documentary or drama - it succeeds. There is no other movie I have so much laugh and I'm crying too much. Yes, about DMD and accessible travel; Only on these issues, this is a valuable asset, but more. About friendship. You talk about life itself, about what you're living every day. And it's a great, entertaining, adventurous story. That is why God created a movie! Watch this movie!
