Indeed, I liked it. The stage was good, the story suits the place where the two series left, and here's my favorite feeling. Mary and Valerie are not painful! They are not like others in synonyms with a certain number, and then they refuse to talk about it or make possible combinations (Beginning Susanne Dee, "Family of the Sting"). In fact, Valerie was saying he was excited to shoot another movie, and then Mary said the same thing, and I was looking at something else ... but if that does not work, then they can do it again.
