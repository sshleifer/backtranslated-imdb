Easily the biggest down-budget horror film of all time. For the first time, I saw this movie at age 9 and I was afraid of hell. Now I grew up, but I really see this movie ... for a genius job. Everyone, or at least all tastes, imagine or even perceive to see a snowman going to kill a man. I've always found something really intimidating about snowmen, of course, a dream come true to bumovie for a horror loss like myself. Some people say that this movie is nothing more than intelligence or other intelligence ... a movie about a serial killer snowman, what do you expect from hell? This movie is very remarkable for anyone who sows down and returns a good laugh at a stupid one-liners and cheap gore. I do not love this movie for a comedy or the film industry, and I will keep this huge part of the terrible horrors of the indie horizontally unseen until a killer snows a serious horror (which, unfortunately, seems unlikely).
