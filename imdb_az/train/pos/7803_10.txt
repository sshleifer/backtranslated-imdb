I just finished watching this movie in the GCSE history class. It was thrilled and during the Apartheid Law, Steve Bikoya was a brilliant idea for what actually happened. I can not say that this movie is the most boring or two and a half hours since I filmed this movie from start to finish. Denzel demonstrated how Washington describes it and how it struggles with the apartheid law and the equal rights of black people. In one section, Steve Bikh tells us a police officer who is so weak and human that it is to show that other black nations in South Africa are different from white. Donald Woods was inspired by me because he was protected for what they believed and totally did not believe in apartheid. He and Steve Bico created a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and woke them up into the world. I'm very pleased with this movie and I strongly recommend it to people. It helped me that racism is wrong and everyone is equal, and their fate should not be determined by the color of one's skin. n
