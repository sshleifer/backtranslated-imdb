Vampires, sexy men, weapons and some bloods. Who can ask more? Moon Child provides all of them with a beautiful bundle of flick! Innocent Sho, who has been friends with Gackt Vampire Kei (HYDE), grows in time, but Kei's immortality in the Sho's age breaks his heart. Not all of them help the girl to fall in love with the same woman. Special effects are very good considering the small budget. It is a story that touches human emotions. It laughs, cries, laughs, and then cries. Even if you are not a fan of music, DO NOT KNOW THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 people
