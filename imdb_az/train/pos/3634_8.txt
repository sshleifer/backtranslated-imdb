I had little expectations for this movie, but we were looking for something tough for the evening. I was absolutely delighted with the event and was a little surprised. This is a wonderful baseball tribute movie and a dream to draw your dreams. Dennis Quaid plays a masterpiece in his role and touched his work. Definitely worth a full price ticket and a few hours of your time!
