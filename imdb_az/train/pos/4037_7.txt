Drive, the debut of Jack Nicholson, shows that He Said is at least a talented director of actors. Even if the story seems to be losing its way to the viewer (and the contemporary audiences appear on eBay now and more pop-ups - they seem to be shaped more freely because they think), the movie has bright, interesting illustrations. The film provides information about two college kids: Hero, Hector (William Tepper, a star of Leopards, a college basketball team). He has another girl, Michael Margot, though he is dealing with a pressure-bearing coach (Bruce Dern) and a girlfriend and friend (Karen Black) to stay in the spotlight. Jabrail is a bit more embarrassed than she possibly might have been prepared, and, in her radical mind, she does her best to accomplish her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nicholson, on the technical side, takes away dark things during the basketball scenes and many other scenes. And Tepper, Black, and even Robert Towne (the writer of Chinatown, The Last Detail and Mission: Rarely available among others), he maintains some of the most reliable player work. It is a tendency to lower his emotions in the taste. In some scenes, for example, when he acts gracefully, he plays for his value. On the other hand, Margottan has a lively, wobbled force in his performance, and then he is scared, but perhaps understood (and how far he is). Dern holds the majority of his performances, including Oscar nominations. Each line of his dialogue is right, right, and has never been smoothed as recently as director's performances. <br /> <br /> But the thing that drags the film is that it does not explain the elements that surround the characters more than they might want. Based on the novel by Jeremy Larner, a film starring with director Nicholson, I was expecting the movie to be longer. This is a subtle amount of information about sportswomen's feelings, often about the younger generation. Nicholson presents us with this character and situation and is rarely demonstrated to those who motivate them (not including protesters, but part of them can be understood quite well). Gabriel worries about what's happening in Vietnam, but what else? Hector is a man who is worried about preparing for the NBA and still loves to play, but what is his return? This whole atmosphere is interesting about the experience of college / basketball in the 60's, but this fascinating quality that leads to some non-traditionalism is kept at a point where it can not go further. Generally, the overall effect of the film is bittersweet and somewhat memorable for its good points, and it's down to it. And, of course, you can tell who each step of the lens is. B +
