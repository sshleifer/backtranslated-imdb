I would like to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. This movie was uber cute and uber cute. Ivan Reitman had all the "sex" content that was very comedy, but nothing more, CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke also have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that can be found on every scene. Both laugh out loud when you can not feel your face, creating a strange, twisted and interesting relationship with strong "sexual" tension. Anna Farris and an equal supporter play the role of each other in a perfect way, and even a very small role of Wanda Sykes will make you laugh. Such comedies are not for everyone, but I have to say that I usually go with a man who does not like these films, and he laughs like crazy. This movie is certainly not for everyone. Especially small children are very few in a few ... well-known for adults. In general, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and the end of what I saw was a bit weaker than the rest of the film. (From 3 1/2 * to 5 *)
