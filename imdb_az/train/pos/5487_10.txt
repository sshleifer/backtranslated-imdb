You did not see anything like this. After the coup is started, the most striking thing you look at when you know this result is the tension in place. And all this is true because the documentary is incredible. <br /> <br /> It was then that she was in the "Top 10" list of "All Time Great Movies". <br /> <br /> Lack of right-wing fanatics. Anyone I know who sees this movie gives it a 4 star rating. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in politics or Venezuelan politics, you will find yourself in a nervous way and you believe that you are at the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> This is a roller coaster trip.
