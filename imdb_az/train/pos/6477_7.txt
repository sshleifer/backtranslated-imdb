"Five Days" is billed as something special, and a series of episodes of crime drama is set on a single day of each polls. In fact, this element of the story is less important than initially thought, as the movement in each episode is limited to 24 hours and that many others do not differ from the program. criminal cases. In fact, one of the sub-areas alone can not help paint almost comparing the recent "Chief Suspect", just like the cynical female police approaching the approaching retirement of the police: and it's not just Helen Mirren's disadvantages of comparisons. Many suspects are sympathetic in each sense, so there are emotions, manipulation music and a number of characters that are attractive as it seems. At the same time, it is possible to feel guilty in the end, but not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but because of the dramatic structure, certain things should be true, the focus of the series at certain times in certain characters. In spite of these failures, the series grew up on me: it kept me to the end. However, it is a sad sign that the BBC, which was once "The Singing Detective," liked the "most probably the best drama of the year": here's the real truth of the proposal, and a deficit in the case emerges as an overwhelming ghost breaks down. "Five days" is not a discharge; but this is a formula, and hopes that the best thing that someone else has to offer to the BBC is something more innovative and fresh.
