This is actually the only film that is approaching the groundless 1970s of the American college practice of the 70s of the 60th century. Continue, even call a movie that is approaching one another: "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are cartoons. There are moments of "Secaucus Seven Returns," but there is a retrospective film about people (self-restrained) more than just a movie about time and place at this time and place. "The Driver, He Said," describes the sensitivity and nuances of rapidly hitting shorts on the shorts - the anti-project movement, the uncertainty of college-time sports (especially a war), the sexual revolution of the era and the general unevenness of the day . <br /> <br /> All shots are praiseworthy (like the director), but the special praise must be reserved for team coach Bruce Dern and Karen Black. The hero is very unusual - apart from then - interest in love. Williams Tepper is also a great fan of the era of student athlete, as well as playing the real college basketball in the movie (Anthony Perkins is remembered by Tall Story Yikes!) <br /> <br /> Generally, some sort of classic - the last movie of the last year ("drill", "push" - right, sonny, return to your Arnold movie) Why not use this movie?
