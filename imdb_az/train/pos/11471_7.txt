I am a great fan of cinema, and I've seen this movie because I've heard how excited it is. I'm honest, it's really interesting. The two leading actors are awesome, the film is not boring, and the concept behind it (of course, Columbine's murder and the killer's home cinema inspiration) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses in the last minutes of the first minutes of realism that really are not separated and the last one really does not give any meaning. Difficult camera can sometimes be an outbreak, but given a movie verite. But I still think the movie is very good and director Ben Coccio deserves some credits.
