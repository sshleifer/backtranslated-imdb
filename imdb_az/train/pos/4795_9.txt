Sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on. I heard when I heard it because it was not. the detector turns off. Usually, such a film is a sentimental hogwash pandering for people who do not want to surprise anything, but to confirm that the craven people are superior. Thus, when David Lynch begins to receive such assessments from the STRAIGHT STORY, it is not the "encouraging" story, especially the FILI MAN. It was more of a curiosity to get more out of the imagination and to encourage us to do good for the movie. <br /> <br /> I will not be worried. STRAIGHT STORY is not a sachel, it's an honest movie. Most of this is due to the fact that most Lynch and writer John Roach and Mary Sweeney say straightforwardly and simply. I have a few straight grains and some of the harvested grains are repeated, but these are just quibbles. There is no heavy message, no emotional strings to shake our emotions, and there is no humility against us and her characters. Instead, they are closed to the story to build their own power, and this is actually transferred to the final scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the winning part. He is really a man who has lived a lot but still looks steadfast, and with the exception of these brothers, he does not seem too sensitive to return with his brother because you can feel here for a long time and have long been frustrated. And he knows that his time is gone, so he wants some peace with his life, not just his brother. Sissy Spacek is a beautiful, business-like job as Straight's daughters. Although I'm a city and a suburban child, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes are beautifully displayed and I want to visit at least one day.
