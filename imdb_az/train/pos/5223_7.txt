This movie was able to love many people. First, many of them did not see it first (I hit it with an accident), then I estimate it according to assessments and ratings so many people do not like it. <br /> Yes, I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his appearance and charm, and although I have not considered him a great actor, I know he can do something very well (I liked Mr Jones). But this performance is different. He is not that kind and he is not attractive. Her character is completely different from what I look at - old, ugly, broken, stable. And Gere, how far so far, brings out the best performance, beautifully. I believe it's a sign that instead of performing an actor who can not do something else - think of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter or Washington's Alonzo Education Day. <br /> <br /> <strong> It was good that Gere was here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was nice for me. I think that this role will not be for the Danes, but on the contrary, he was looking for a very good job. But, in fact, he does a fine job, and he is at the top level with Gere, a small feat. Strickland easily provides the best supportive action, on the one hand, which requires a substantial number of tasks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < 8mm-work aspects, but the scholarships that are approaching the character of the girl and Gere by adding an instant feeling to save the story of "strange fiancÃ©es" and save money (like the lamb's silence). All this is a ground for the development of two main characters, because each other joins their new stations in their lives. There are so many things to do in 100 minutes, but good work is done, and we care about the characters, and what happens to them? <br /> <br /> The director and photography were enough. I could do without the contemporary music-video camera movements and cuts, but then I became an old curmudgeon and this is really bad, and I think it really helps with the atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> The value you see.
