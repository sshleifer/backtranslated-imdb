Two years ago I was watching my Internet connection - now I saw the movie! What a picnic! And finally a trip to get acquainted with Darius Weems! Such a brave, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a crew! Listening to the smile of Darius in the city of Panama, seeing the fear of being too close to crocodiles in Louisiana, the miracle of his eyes while browsing in a hot air balloon, rafting through some rapids, spits a spoonful meal and calls the phone home, and as always - boys boys. This movie can be seen by everyone - young and old. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. Crew members are committed to the heart of the younger generation. They gave Darius a new wheelchair; Documented accessibility problems; Darius took over the course of his life; They touched many lives. By promoting DMD awareness and research funding, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West's DMD treatment.
