Gung Ho is trying to express many thoughts and at the same time entertain an intelligent comedy. The result is uneven but generally fun. Keaton's balanced all three aspects of his lead character. It's better at Wantabed. A warning: George Wendt is very weak in his supporting role. Otherwise, this is a pretty pleasant time capsule.
