Over the past few days, I went to the theater prepared for a subpar trip from Woody, as I read various Scoop reviews. Fortunately, I could not be wrong. Woody, the singer, slows down a single touch or two, but Woody is a fine form of the writer / director and found a reliable way to add himself to the 70-year-old story. From laughter and guffaws, the audience did not see the Allen one-liners and dialogue for several years. <br /> <br /> The program's approved stories are a source of satisfaction and inspiration to watch Allen's high-grade and still rewarding feature in a film-dominated, montage line form for twentysomething tastes and children.
