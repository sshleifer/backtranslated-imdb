I do not think this movie is for everyone. But this weekend I saw Seattleda and thought it was so funny. For a long time, during a movie, I did not laugh at this difficulty. I thought that all the players did a great job. From the very last stage you laugh at yourself first. I suspect that some movie makers (especially those who took them seriously) will be quenched with this humor brand. I do not. The film was a real surprise. And the whole theater smiled and smiled, thinking that many people are happy and happy to have a good time in the movie for a change. I will not wait to see again! If you are in mood for LOL, this is for you. Funny funny funny funny!
