Although I can not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that there is less dialogue on dialogue and sky or intensity and emotion. <br /> <br /> I would like to explore the novel because of the great interest and emotion that mixes this masterpiece in me. <br /> <br /> I have to explain nothing to the structure here. I tell you: If you do not have to watch or read the beautiful story of Jane Eyre, I do not want you to doubt it. <br /> <br /> In this film, Jane Eyrein's power and magic, as well as popular classic English literature, have been successfully captured in this film. <br /> <br /> BrontÃ« did not bring herself, Clarke and Dalton could translate into the spotlight with magnificent intensity. The success of the film is, of course, no doubt about their toy prowess. Love Jane Eyre loves or hates her, but appreciates the wealth, vitality, story reality; I love the characters; actors love; as you love the bigger movie theater.
