When I read many other comments and reviews, I do not believe in my eyes. <br /> <br /> There were a number of films about film shootings. <br /> <br /> The film is great, funny, embarrassing, at least in spite of violent, basically energetic. I loved most of them. I do not remember such a crazy thing to show laughter and martial arts. And now the most important thing (at least for me): computer effects are free. I understand that some Hollywood actors can make any * beeps * * * when explaining a word in a high-budget "fuflo" ("bull * bip *") in a modern high resolution and grace - you can fix your wires to the phone, add some cute PC effects and you can convert it to an action movie. It's different here. I do not think that at the end of the film or in the "Chinese football" game, many physically-accelerated moving stars around the world can repeat the war. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And just a little Hong Kong movie, fun, prepared to act like Star Wars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Some will not look like this. As for me, it's fine. Take a look at the friend of Dragon, who spoke boldly to the conspirators, and suddenly blows a blow on the left side of his head. Her face expression turns into something strange and comes to Dragon with a baby expression. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a great rating and thousands of people around the world. <br /> <br /> This movie,. I am very grateful to the Russian industry for the release of classic Jackie Chan films. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the winners of Eurovision Song Contest 2012 were awarded. Thank you for your attention.
