This film has everything you need to have a fantasy film, romantic, smart charm, great motion and magic fair dose. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with this movie and I was attracted to the original designs and colored characters (based on Neil Gaiman's novel I originally read). <br /> <br /> The most striking thing for me is actually the story itself. <br /> <br /> In fact, unlike many fantastic fantasy films, it was a pure fairy tale that left open-ended, which no longer needed. <br /> Original. Entertainment. Feel-good Fantasy.
