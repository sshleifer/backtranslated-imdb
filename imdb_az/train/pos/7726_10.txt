I often feel that the majority of science fiction films really have intergalactic westerns or war dramas. As you can see, Star Wars, one of its central images, has a futuristic "gang" that can not shoot directly. <br /> <br /> I wish I had read more science fiction and would like to have more films for the person who thinks. The Planet is one of the oldest in the genre, yet one of the best. The story is a long-lasting civilization, Krell has created machines that can boost intelligence with quantum jumps. Unfortunately, what they do not negotiate is a center for the brain's thinking, apart from intellect. The primary aspect of the brain is allowed to remain uncontrolled, as it is called Id, Freud. Sleep is released, a bad dream come to the body. Dr. Walter Pigeon, Dr. Morbius built a machine that invaded this level and stepped on to the horrors of his own horrors with him. His thoughts create a horror that can not be defended soon. Krell, a superior one, could not stop it; destroyed them. The Development Party has not been interested in me. The rest of the actors are invaluable. Ann Francis was beautiful and naive and, of course, would react with 50-year-old adolescents. His father's life is his innocence and salvation for fifty years, with his astronauts (because they are more like the real astronauts). They always try to work on "dames". The chef has a great character. Robbie Robot, most of the crew possesses more personality, and Mr. Spock is a miracle without a relative for a thoughtful thought of this artificial creature. The whole movie is very satisfied because the situation is a star. Morbius can not escape back and is therefore ready to destroy everything he has with him. There are several science fiction movies worth seeing several times; this may be the coastline of the 21st century.
