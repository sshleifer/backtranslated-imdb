A strange funny and original show. Casting started with Hysteric Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen Got A Gun) is simply a perfect one. I always laugh at this show more than I've ever seen, always add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim), a lesbian who argues with her partner and partner (Asian Wok-DON "T RUN) (including Newhart Cindy Williams, one of the best moments of the show, finds a picture in Cindy Williams' dress. This picture is a moving image of Cindy Williams with a bowling pin It's amazing to see you as a player like Cindy Williams, acting like a lot of surprise tweets in a short time like the opera.I can only hope that the DVD will be released with many bonus special features today.The funniest series I've seen !!!!
