<br /> <br /> This movie is very awful - very badly good. <br /> <br /> The story is removed from many other films so I will not envy that I describe it. It's a sword / witchcraft, a child who wants to understand how important it is in the world, a "migratory" adventurer, a bad helper / sorcerer, a princess, a living creature .... you get the point. br /> <br /> This film was for the first time during a very harsh winter. <br /> <div> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < is a lively, but nearly profitable and fun to watch. Someone brought white mud carpets and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes where the actor can not move or eventually falls. How many scenes, though not in that movie! Solo-Chewbacca attempts to communicate with Bo Svenson consciously, bringing comparisons to a higher level. <br /> <br /> In fact, I bought this movie for that character and is still in the same place! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may seem like a tumor, but she made this movie! The only reason I did not even see him or even call him was his absence! Perhaps a final movie that completes the trio, Gulfax will make a much-anticipated turn!
