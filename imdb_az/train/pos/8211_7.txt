I have never seen the original Dirty Harry, and I have evaluated this movie as a pure healer. And I must say that I'm very glad. Of course, some of those who were driven by Sondre Locke made me a little bit - but hey, it was 80. But it's worth it only for Dirty Harry, even if it did not pass through the past (and almost did not know) or the revenge of revenge (a bit like). Or at least, the bull's keen pleasing name "MeatHead": P 7/10.
