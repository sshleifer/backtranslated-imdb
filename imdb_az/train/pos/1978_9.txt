Oliver is a master who produces the worst layers in human spirit. It is a strange, unseen character that makes the story remarkable. He deepens this darkness. No, Oliver is in the valley of death, but no one is afraid. There is a stick and a staff to relax. Finally, he is saved from human abilities. There's the worst Faque on the bottom. Fagin does not want to repatriate his ways twice, but once he does not want to pay the price. Well, Bill is worse than Sikes because he collects small wheels that turn into killers. There's Oliver in the middle. Irrespective of his innocence, he had not been settled at the same time. The best Nancy. The absence of a court order, he deprives Bill Sikes of the intense nature of his deep love for love. Unlike Fagin, he can repent of his sins by rescuing Oliver Bill from the cost of his own life. Things are not what they seem to be. In my opinion, this quality is something worthwhile - unexpected. I'm going to give this movie "10" but 70 of the noise and ambience it has made for television. Generally speaking, a beautiful illustration and a good story for all audiences.
