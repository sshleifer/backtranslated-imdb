I was amazed at the innovations in the animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see details on the grass and surface structures. The detail, color, and shade are at least a bigger one than Toy Story. I will never know how to get out of shadows. Hopefully, PIXAR will present a documentary on how the movie is made, so we can understand all of them. Based on this film, I will evaluate my cartoons based on this movie in the future.
