"Still Crazy" is undoubtedly the biggest rock comedy of all time. It has nothing to do with the wrong comparison with the "Spinal Tap". "Spinal tap" is a satire (and, very clearly, it is not very good, though it's "rocking" for many rocks). Unlike "Tap", Still Crazy lives with great actors, great songs and great human situations. Please contact people called "Still Crazy". All this is important. Oh, yes, the music is very nice, from the very beginning, written by Mick Jones and by Chris Difford Squeeze. The American audience was already acquainted with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but later would be acquainted with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter).
