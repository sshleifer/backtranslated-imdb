breathtaking, this undoubtedly produced the best anime animated film. In the late 80's, I saw a tower in heaven as a child and created a lasting impression. Years went by and I forgot the name of the movie, and I accidentally found this witness while browsing the Internet. I'm not surprised and sorry that after reading other people's reviews and analyzes, it makes a similar impression. The true fantasy adventure is a must have for all children and adults. I'm going to explain this movie, so I'm not going to distract the story, and I'll watch this movie clearly and clearly. If you treat your children this job, I will love you. There is not much to say about art, but if you do not see it, watch it and enjoy it.
