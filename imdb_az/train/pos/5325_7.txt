The idea of ​​filming about the Beatles is sound because no production can actually capture the idea of ​​Beatles. It's best to create an illustration that works best with the other existing Beatles material, not to recreate the past later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beatles- warned that graduates were not exactly as expected. The Beatles performs songs that are hardly ever written. The Beatles "Ask Me", "P.S. I Love You" and even "Do not Worry Me". If the Beatles-based Beatles perform on the film only in Hamburg, young audiences will not be able to recognize the Beatles they already know. This is the only "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe's "Love Me Tender" from the original Hamburg repertoire. <br /> <br /> Children playing Beatles in this production do not seem to be genuine, but the film's still a good look because the rest of the movie is quite accurate. Lennon's man works well, and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is great and it is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film when he pulls Pete Best's sacks. And as a bonus you will get acquainted with the original Cavern club.
