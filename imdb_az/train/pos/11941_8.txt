They are strawberries from journalists Ms. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell "His Girl Friday" or Mrs. Ms. Myrna Loy, nicknamed by the gentle detective William Powell and Thassy Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are strikingly charming as Scoop amateur. Their footprint is more postmodern than depression, and Allen's writing is filled with laughter and plain old New York curve. The shadows of old minds rarely occur, such as Sid, as the Great Splendini magicians, answer his background: "I was born into the Hebrew faith, but when I was old, I transformed myself into nonsense." Yoxansson is just like a miserable girl, like Allen's Matching Point, here is a relatively good, sometimes dictatorial journalism student who holds a secret crime in London: a serial killer. The site rebuilds the location of the new Macaua Match Point, London's high-level fault and the "crash" on the "American Tragedy" / Sun Boat. In fact, Allen re-creates the Manhattan Murder Mystery and Black Rose to name just a few other examples. I pay attention to working again; <br /> <br /> I would like the new material to be at least the originals, and it is, unfortunately, something that reflects its small size. <br /> <br /> Allen can not hide his love as director and actor. actress Diane Keaton could not be inaccessible, and for this reason, he drew a middle class comedy to the Allen Canon, but it was a great, but fun, sometimes brilliant satirist: Sid (Allen) quips about the suspected top-level killer " I was surprised. " This vintage is allen humor. As in the majority of the film, there is any brilliant literary aluminum, although Woodman did not lose the touch of the class, to tell us Scoop with music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss.
