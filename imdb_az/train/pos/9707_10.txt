A year ago, I finally gave up American television. I decided to completely abandon the television before showing a number of programs within a buddy office in the UK, the Extras, the Blackbirds and the Gentle League. Then I decided to switch to English TV. Among all the above-mentioned demonstrations, the Gentlemen League is easily the darkest and bent, yet guilty of laughter and material found in another comedy I've seen. Characters of the most unpleasant married couples are a butcher, who puts ingredients for unaid (the best) brownies, a mysterious couple looking at a local storehouse serving only the local people and the worst veterinarians. This program is one of the best I've ever seen.
