Breaking Glass is a movie that anyone who wants to be in the music industry needs to see more than once. A record is a very dark tale about the way in which a singer manipulates the singer to make the paths and earn as much money as possible. Always remember this movie when looking at television programs in the UK and abroad, searching for today's 'star'. Although not a specialist on the subject, the winners of these shows hit a very big first hit, then down from there. Although the effect looks the same, this movie shows it. After being rescued from his manager, we played fairly brilliantly by Phil Daniels, but the words of the company, which gradually made a record, put it on the stimulants and ultimately exhausted. The potential stars of tomorrow ... THIS USE THIS!
