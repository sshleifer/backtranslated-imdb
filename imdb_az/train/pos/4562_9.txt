I saw this movie on DVD yesterday and the gob smacked and flabbergasted. The DDL's impressive player was like my idea and I was surprised by the whole castle and its superior value. The whole character was very dependent on me, really bought DDL for her mother for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker. Go and see! You are crying, but you will live a beautiful catacomb! Moreover, it teaches you an important lesson: destination is everything. You might be a crippled town in poor cities, but when you are in pain, you will not have any problems. If you only manage your left foot, you're still good enough to be a painter or writer. The worst thing you can do when you challenge your mind is to regret yourself. He will not go to your place and you will be the only one who will regret it.
