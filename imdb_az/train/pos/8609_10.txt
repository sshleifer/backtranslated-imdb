I thought it was one of the best films I have ever seen. It was a great story line, and showed that people are all too complicated in every way. I've recommended all my friends! I always enjoy a good story line and this movie has one of the best I've ever seen. I have not seen a girl myself, and have seen things that Natalie did to learn more about her life and what she loves. This is just an indication of how we live with our families; <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And also part of our lives We do not share them with them. Because we are not the best in knowing all the details of what we do not do too proud. /> I'll wait for another movie and realize my eyes.
