Corny! I love it! Corny - TV show is about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt are never updated with unprecedented chemistry! They reset their old memories, and it is interesting to know the scenes that followed the actors playing in the 1960s. In the 1960s, television was back to many audiences and if you get acquainted with the original TV show, this DVD is no exception. What's Fighting with Written Boofs and Bams or What's Fantastic! The clips of those who died in the movie theater scene are shown. Finally, Frank Gorshin gives a look. He would have died long after the DVD was prepared. I believe he has come to play a disgusting game for Adam and Burt, just like Batman and Robina many years ago. He had not lost his touch! Thank you to Julie Newmar for being a killer. In the end, I think this DVD is for great memories, and I thank you for returning Adam and Burt and re-creating those memories for those who remember the original! Thanks, Guys!
