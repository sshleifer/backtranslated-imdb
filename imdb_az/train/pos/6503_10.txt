Music and Laurence Olivier's bone shipment gave a perfect vote for this outstanding documentary. This is still the case of WW II buffs, an offshoot of the conflict participants, foreign policy, an airplane carrier (George Bush? Do you hear that anyone who is interested or in need of knowing who and what to give some aspects of the conflict?) 26 episodes are nearly chronologically or even less self-contained, it is a new idea for a new audience to present the proposed volume.The actual images of the wars interspersed in interviews with those who were involved in stories: Many of the interviews were addressed to the second line of officials - key heroes, individuals, captains , secretaries, witnesses etc. <br /> <br /> So far, I have watched the DVD version of the original TV documentary, which, according to the tension, comes with unexpected, multiple VHS offers already on eBay. I have paid $ 120 Cdn for DVD discs, which is a bonus and full screen mode, menus are easy to follow, the choice of different parts of the episode or the episode they chose to play the entire episode, and then the first choice. The menu menu, which is understandable with such a wide presentation, has a small amount of navigation, but after 30 years, the effects of what you see will not be reduced, even after 60 years after the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I remember watching the first release of Buffalo PBS station in 1975, when I was in London in 1975 and wanted to be a copy since then. <br /> <br /> Check out this documentary. Tell your friends. Get a copy for your library. Remember the sacrifices and challenges of America, Russia, Great Britain, Canada and all other nations and peoples participating in the final victory. What is eye-opener?
