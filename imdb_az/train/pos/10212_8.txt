All this film is worth watching only the spectacular end point - the best ending of any movie I've seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> I found this movie full of French, with very serious meanings. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I liked the way the Cezayans touched - in the meantime, music is great during recent loans. I would like a CD!
