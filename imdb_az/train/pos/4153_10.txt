It was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip on YouTube, and I said that I should show it on television, so I would adhere to the set myself to watch. I had a ride with a friend, managed to be gay, and we both cried at the end. It really was a heart-beat episode of love, which was forbidden between two police officers, "happy people" (with the words "Cooper"). This is indeed the episode of the "Cool Invitation" that has become one of the most loved and loved works of television magic in GIS. I'm looking forward to more episodes with great anxiety and I'm working for Forever Blue because I'm always gonna re-watch it and watch it again.
