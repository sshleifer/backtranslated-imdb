Recently, after seeing the FANTASTIC 2001 live action version of the movie, I leased the animated version of the Lord of the Rings on the video. The trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, led by Peter Jackson, will surely be the 21st Century genre of fantasy films that George Lucas will have better than the Star Wars prewel (Episode 1-3)! <Br / <br /> I remember reading the animated version as a child, and then I did not fully understand the depth of the film.I have read books and understand what the story is all about - undoubtedly some of the characters are quite foolish (Samwise Gangee, Star Wars Episode One, Jar Jar Binks, but I have to explain my book very closely, and part of the two books are included in the Two Towers Good things that move a bit, and some part of the animation is a sign of this time Bad things, as a result of Frodo's rings destroyed without any result, dropping two towers and animation is today <br /> <br /> Generally, it's not as bad as it is, but the live version of 2001 is a new sign of the Rings of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi accepted the script seriously! Peter Jackson said that he was encouraged to read the animated version of his book, which has caused the creation of one of the largest fantasy series put on the film, so at least I would thank Ralph Bakshi for that! <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> !! For diehard fans of books and movie versions of the Lord of the Rings.
