I'm a pretty pedestrian, a little tasty. However, sometimes I try to increase the cultural awareness in the bar. This movie was one of my attempts. I was scared all over the movie. I really liked that I took my assignment, so it could be seen again. This is a very thoughtful and emotional stunning movie. I saw it as a great question to the viewer: What is the depth of sacrifice for the task, can it be accepted and accepted? As a military member, of course, this is an important issue for me. This question comes to the audience from this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
