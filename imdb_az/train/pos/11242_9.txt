Everyone who is interested in pop music and who does not know the English music trends of the late 70s should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film perfectly captures a search for a young woman to trace her musical world, from open sexism, from a rugged economic era, to a ridiculous prank, from pop culture to strangers and from strange punk. and ambitious Futurism / New Romanticism. Music and fashion styles created in Britain in the late 1970s are still rediscovered and reworked (nothing happened since 1980). It was a brilliant time, and Breaking Glass also explains a very personal story and explores the cultural landscape and is also very good.
