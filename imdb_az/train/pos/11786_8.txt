It's almost typical Lynch. But for Lynch, the thing that made this movie a bit unusual is actually very amateur, almost ambitious. <br /> <br /> Lynch, however, is trying to get a bigger stake in this reality. However, there are so many typical Lynch motifs available: floating camera work; haunting music; long (stop) pauses; hanging curtains; Sluggish lights develop slowly (almost inevitably) at pace; extreme proximity; the subject of women facing the problem; <br /> <br /> The majority of the people in the Caucasus are frightened, temporarily oblivious, in darkness, and so on. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything until commenting. <br /> <br /> Many questions remained unanswered, and it fueled the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort from Lynch. I just hope that his son gets some shorts with the playstation 2 advertising lines. They were inspired.
