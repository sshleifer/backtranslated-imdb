This movie sat up in Tivo until the week I watched. I thought my wife was bad. I was wrong; <br /> <br /> This was an enchanted excursion to screwed libido of New Yorkers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A man in Brooklyn's street corner begins with a whore. He was taken by a general contractor, with whom he maintained a sexual contact with the car's head, but did not come. He refuses to pay for it. When he quits, he answers a cellphone and receives a message. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this story is a professional call from a rich, compressed New York woman playing with her until she works. He says how hopeless and happy he is; he says how good and lucky he is. When she goes, she asks her to have sex with her. He sits on top of it, falling from the top. <br /> <br /> The woman and her husband give fashion friends a meal. Hubby (Robert) speaks, his wife (Ellen) gets bored and turns the subject into sex and how men and women think about it. Big talk is wrong. Later, after leaving the guests, Ellen seeks to put Roberts in its shape. Robert does not want anything and puts a jazz record. Ellen turns over radio; Robert opens music; Ellen joins the television; Robert returns to another television. Cocoa is formed. Ellen stands up on the roof, and Robert joins him. Ellen acknowledges that more than any man other than Robert is forced to live. Robert says he has to live with men. <br /> <br /> Then we watch Robert when he talks to an artist Martin, who has been playing by Steve Buscemi. I wish Buscemi to have such scenarios, she is a sexy, intelligent, completely desirable man. Robert is worthy of Mart√≠n's work, he deserves to get a show. Robert was excited, as Robert talked about his groin, all of which was a bare dance. Robert is trying to kiss Martin's lips and Martin says he's not gay. Robert claims he is gay too, and Martin deliberates. Both acknowledge that paintings are bad. Robert wants to leave when Robert allows him to kiss. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Rosario The receptionist by Dawson is shaken by Anna. <br /> <br /> We follow Anna sitting next to a friend.
