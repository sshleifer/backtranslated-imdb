I thought it was a beautiful movie. Theme song is cute! Anyway, the only thing that slightly disturbed me was when everything was normal. It was very strange and unreal. A great cable company is what I'm talking about. In addition, the film was very creative. I believe that all actors are well-worked, actors have perfectly fulfilled their characters' identity. Everything is in a good place. Indeed, it's a shame that they are not a soundtrack. That would be great! Since this is a Canadian movie and my favorite, I'll give this movie 10 to 10!
