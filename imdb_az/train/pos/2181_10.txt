<br /> <br /> Draws artisticly, the actors fully describe their role. You see Lucien a real feeling toward poverty from the very best girl around you. The feeling of victory over the tragedy. I've seen this whole movie at least 10 times. And I can say very well that Prix De Beute's (Beauty Prize, Miss Europe) is one of my greatest favorite in my silent movie collection. The expression of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend everyone who appreciates the artistic beauty that connects this movie to a tragic storyline.
