From all these years, I think this series is the best example of the II World War documentary. Negotiations with many participants from all countries drew him from another project. A modern documentary document (Ken Burns?) Would be great to gather information before entering this topic and collecting all the information it has gained. An upgraded version of this series was welcomed with modern technology to upgrade the old archive images and many details that emerged after the World War II era since 1974. The Historical Channel has made some remarkable demonstrations in many aspects of the Second World War, but a series of World War I genuine was not genuinely sought after. If you are interested in this period, do not miss this series. Tracking is required.
