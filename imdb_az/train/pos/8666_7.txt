Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-class mobster who turns himself back to the police or fugitive gambler (for obvious reasons). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thief who releases a pool hall and frustrates Frankie in his spare time. <br /> <br /> <strong> Tony Frankie is arrested and sent to prison ... They create a bond that can not be quite friendly, but they will do it right now. <br /> <br / Film This movie came to me under the name of Frank and Tony. This is a negative moment. Because "My Frank and Crazy Tony" would help to sell the movie in a more effective way. I'm saying "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry," but what do I know? <br /> <br /> <strong> Economy> </ font> </ font> </ font> </ font> is a real shame to this movie. This film is an "unfair" film. This movie is unfairly transformed into b-movie (or worse). With a cleaner sound and picture, it might be a Hollywood hit, I doubt. I found the story very interesting, the plot (and actors) is better than the average, and the plot is different from "Violent Professionals" - it's not a very moderate character. <br /> <br /> Mafia movies or criminal films should give this one a try. In fact, you can ask a movie about the band from Italy (what you want more original?). Of course not, "The Godfather", but it does not happen. It's not a drama, a bad comedy, a heavy-duty friendly movie ... like "dying with the ban" in terms of bad guys. Well, okay, not really. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not something else, this movie wanted me to check and film other films from the filmmaker. "Van Escape from New York" (VanCleef's "Hauk" plays) and other films than ordinary cult movies. What's more fun than finding a lost classic?
