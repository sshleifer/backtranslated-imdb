I saw this movie at Rhode Island International Film Festival and it was completely blown up. The structure and execution of the movie were fantastic ... I know, but it really deserves the Oscar's nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as two pesky classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial and has problems with many people who are involved in shooting at school, and especially those who have been murdered. However, despite the tough and skull theme, Zero Day is worth the look. I'm expecting to get this video, so I can get it - it's fine. Very strong and intense ... the last shooting sequence is almost silent because it is very realistic. Their uncertainty, "notes," students' imagery and panic can not be completely described. I really hope he will pay attention to what he deserves. The Blair Witch Project is designed to look like a real home video documentary in the same format as the handheld camera - but God is better. Very impressive, the hat is for everyone. If you have the chance, you really should see it.
