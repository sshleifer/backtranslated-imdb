In this saturated and intense pulp film, Foley noir is in perfect harmony with the apparent "together" quality. When shooting, editing and editing, the film opens itself around an uncomfortable boxer who finds his goal (or deficiency). Other explanations may indicate that they do not have money, but I personally think this is a beautiful piece of cinema!
