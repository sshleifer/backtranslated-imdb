I tried not to rely on IMDb ratings, but they enjoyed 5.4 points when looking at one of my childhood favorites. At the age of 17 I do not like it but it's a sweet and good movie as a family movie. Children will definitely love it and will not ignore the flaws, and adults can predict the actor behind each of the characters, and are surprised by the nervous messaging of the movie. None of the film has been promulgated in any way, in fact it has a great message added to its sweetness. Although the story is on a slim side, several scenes (still amazed by me) like Screweyes's death may be a scary party. But the animation is better than the average level with beautiful colors and good character animation. James Horner's music is a very beautiful and playful song memorable, attractive and entertaining. I really love the characters, Louie is probably the depth of all of them, but the dinosaurs were at least attracted. Martin Short's clown was both cheerful and empathic, to Screweyes, "I'm out!" That part. they gave me sewing. My favorite Screweyes, though, is insidious and an impeccable liar who thinks I'm smart. Although I'm a movie, I want to keep the movie while explaining how she lost her eyes and why she was scared, because she could have been more advanced in terms of depth. The scenario is not worthy of Oscar, it has comic and warm-heartedness and should entertain children and adults. What sounded the movie, moving for me. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall, and Yeardley Smith all gave speeches, but Kenneth gave Mars a special promise. Because it was pretty good as Screweyes and it was almost unrecognizable. All this is a good movie. I did not get a rating, I'm not honest. No doubt, this movie is not perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land Before Time, but it's fine. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
