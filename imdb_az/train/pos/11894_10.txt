A really beautiful hero who surprised and was surprised when he turned around and was surprised by the mattresses, completely covered behind the door ... A few moments of shame on the "The Naked Truth". I love the things I keep in this show: a happy area and some good support characters have been prepared for the show - like Nora Wilde 'tea leon; cute, clownish and incredible accidents prone - no wonder miracle Hollyood does not look like to throw it - how to revive a clown actress. But where is-WH-WHERE DVD broadcasts? I believe that the amount of bleep they are releasing will continue to bury this small ship. (Correct me if I'm wrong).
