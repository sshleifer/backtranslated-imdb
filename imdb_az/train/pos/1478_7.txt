<br /> <br /> I liked this movie, but after half a year, I could tell who the secret admirer was. <br /> <br /> I also have the "real" people at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is also a man going to my wife's life. <br /> <br /> In some cases, in the United States, in the US, I easily understood it. Was he stupid or what?
