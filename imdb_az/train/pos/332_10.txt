Although I have not seen this mini-series for more than twenty years, I can remember how the balance between the character, structure and story of a lot of adventures has succeeded. The use of special effects, instead of explaining the story, has become more poetic. Two versions (English and French) were dubbed, but actors only speak their language because there is no problem synchronizing. It does not explain the story. Casting like Penelope is among the most famous for North Americans among Irene Pappas. It is offered to all non-return audiences of Odysseus.
