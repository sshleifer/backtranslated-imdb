The first series of Lost started with a bang ... as if slowly slowed down. Some viewers may turn off and start watching half of them, either boring or straightforward. <br /> <br /> I advise you to watch the Lost World begin from the beginning and avoid pt-layout with slower episodes. It's in perfect motion, but why is it planned for 5 series ... WHY? All this means that there will be no answer for at least 4 years, and if good, tension and dialogue flows, I will follow.
