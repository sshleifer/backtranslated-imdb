This movie is beautiful. Always will always be. I really like a servant in a home that is falling in love. Walt really did it himself here. And music! A dream is your desire to be beautiful! What else can you say horrible? Unable to wait until the private edition is released, it will be so awesome! I will not wait to hear all the deleted songs! This movie is beautiful and smart! Beautiful. What about cute mice! I know the same things over and over again, but hey this is a great movie! Woods was terrifying in this wonderful beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie
