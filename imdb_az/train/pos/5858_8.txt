Spider-Man is the best superhero in my opinion and this is no good superhero game in the game. Although it can be a little easier, it's easy to pass through this game, you have to play several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers. <br /> <br /> Someone may seem difficult to control first, but once you have him, Spider-Man will be web-slinging himself. <br /> <br /> Bosses are a little easier, such as levels, fun. Scorpion Spider-Man is one of the most deadly villains, because the first boss, Scorpion, is incredibly easy to beat because it knows fans of comic books. The second boss Rhino is also very easy. The third boss Venom, in my opinion, should be the easiest cartridge in the game and not necessarily. The 4th director is Venom again. This time it is still easy, though it is a bit difficult to defeat. 5th boss Mysterio, I think the funnest manager to fight in the game. He is one of the more stringent bosses, but once again, it's still pretty easy. The next boss, Carnage, is someone who's guessed it, easy to beat. But Carnage is really some kind of fun to fight. The 7th Director is Dr. Octopus, one of the deputies, but it's not as easy as others because there is a shield. The 8th and last boss is no special, no funny book or cartoon game. You will not be spoiled for those who do not play the game, but the head coach is the only boss in the game that is not very easy. <br /> <br /> When I hit others in the first or second attempt, we tried to beat 4 or 5. <br /> <br /> Generally, a very good game. I gave it from 10 to 8. The reasons why 9 or 10 did not give up are quite inaccurate with comic books or cartoon shows, buying all the suits and dragging a comic book (although all this is for a while), the bosses are very easy, and Hobgoblin and / or Green Goblin should use it as a boss, I think it would be entertaining for someone flying in the air !! They have not used this game anymore! Well, Green Goblin is an outcast in the upcoming Spider-Man movie, so hopefully we'll make a movie based video game.
