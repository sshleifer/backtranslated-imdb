I knew it as a program like Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes in Freeview, and this is more extreme. Basically a three-wing kids and a crazy English bloke met with skeptic love and a complete barrier-free masochistic taste to hurt themselves and their health and safety. Many more crazy people who can cause puking, pubs-covered pizza, sparks, naked dye jumping, little boys jokes, sleep / snoring, stunts at work, for example, army, cowboys and purple, bumps, blood and vomiting Stunts, maybe not just for themselves. Lee Dainton, who has done quite a lot of things to Matthew Pritchard, Dan Joyce (English) makes it harder for many physical things and has an OTT flower, and Pancho (Mike Locke), much more known to be short, greasy and lazy. It was something at 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very Good!
