Of course, this film was rapidly uneven after the movie, but from "rentals" to "Rent", Roman Polanski was always considered to be an interesting and unique thing. Despite the many issues (lie, paranoia), both of his films are really similar to each other. This event is similar to Repulsion ten years ago, but its voice is completely different. The "tenant" manages the balance of darkness as the absurd from darkness (some of the heroes' strange behavior and dialogues are sometimes laughable, though I'm a little hesitant) with really suspenseful paranoia. Polanski was always an artist who was anxious, and the moments in this film were nearly creepy. The film's overall strangeness too. <br /> <br /> The rest of the castle and crew make a great contribution, except that of Polanski's usual direction. Polanski actor is frequently shattered by director Polanski, but his works really capture his characters with inadequacy and isolation. The topic of social discrimination is not strange for this movie to be strange. The rest of the rash, in particular, is a sympathetic turn of Isabelle Adjani, who demonstrates the proper performances of Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters. The "renter" is often underrated due to how well the ready-made people like "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby" to collect as bright as those classics. (9/10)
