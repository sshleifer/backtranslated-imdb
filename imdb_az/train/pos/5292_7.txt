After a "dirty embarrassment," I did not think I would see another John Waters movie. This movie was really bad, and I was convinced that it would be all the movies. But when the DVD of this movie was being reviewed in a popular magazine and it was a perfect movie, I decided to try it anyway. Only a few days later, the television was shown. I was curious about it, and now I've seen that Pecker is better than "A Dirty Utan√ß". <br /> In this film, a young 'nobody' from Baltimore becomes a nightmare in New York's art world. A sandwich shop worker who photographs his strange family or what he sees as a hobby on the street. When he holds his first 'exhibition' at the shop he works, he sees a gallery of his strange and strange-looking pictures. Her photographs are sold at great prices, but if she sees her family, friends, and foreigners' success, she will come to her if she decides to go to New York and want to see more. . <br /> <br /> "It's hard to see why this movie is so much loved than what I love." A Dirty Shame. "First, this movie has a real story, which is really something to say and it's not just about shocking as many people as it is, but for those who do not know what's in the art, I believe that there are many people who think about contemporary art, but no one understands why they admit such ideas, but it seems that we all should like it. The second reason I love this film is that it works better Everything you see is great, but at least some of the meanings of characters like Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci have some meanings ... <br /> <br /> Generally, not a big movie, but with criticism and some good jokes - really a lot x is not a good movie - it's a good movie, but it's not the best comedy, but I liked the "A Dirty Shame." I'm giving this movie 6.5 / 10.
