<br /> <br /> I found the movie fairly clear, but it was clear how the main character was gone, but at the same time, some things in life. <br /> <br /> He was tortured and you loved to torture him! <br /> <br /> There was this wrong side in the Caucasus, but we are happy to see it come out of the shaking again. </ p> <p> I love watching him under a sniper attack or fire, but in the end we are happy to see him stay alive ... <br /> <br />
