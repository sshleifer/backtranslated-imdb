At War, Inc., we find a logical extension of the existing outside supply of all war-related activities currently in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with the foreigners of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root, and Blackwater, you are now half-home to fully evaluate the final line of Cusack. Cusack plays a corporate hit man named Brand Hauser, which is organizing a trade show in a new free country in Turiquant while waiting for his ultimate goal. There he is in a position where the anti-organizational rapporteur, played by Marisa Tomei and pursued by a very sinister pop star, starred by Hilary Duff. Getting acquainted with the history of Hauser, the tragedy that has been taking place since then and, in fact, the Marsha Dillon, a corporate assistant (and enthusiastically played by Joan Cusack) Some moments are played overlapping, they are not always the moments you are expecting, and little touches often take you by surprises. All managers speak in harsh speeches. Duff's accents come and go, but on the contrary, he does a great job and takes a long way to destroy Disney's image. Tomei is comedian, but it's simple because they're on Cusack's nearly every scene. It is a good thing to be fair. Writers are turned into a good script, so they have enough curves and rotations, and visual gags hold giggling along the entire path to the foreseeable outcome. In fact, the outcome of the end is the only thing that keeps me above a rating, and this leads to the expected outcome. <br /> <br /> If you want a comedy extensively and physically, it's probably not enough here to make the whole film interesting. On the other hand, if you like simple comedy and wide satire, this is for you.
