Sly is the best and performing action movie. Some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlins direction are a very nice movie. Stallone, in action films, is not interested in this, and she is, of course, looking at some of the moving scenes. It was one of the best action movies of the year and was the most thrilling and pleasant song of the 90s, a certain genre was classic. As a Stallone admirer, I look at my favorite memories. The perfect move and plenty of Sly's main actress. Action lovers appreciate this film, because there are all signs of a good aciton film. The movie looks great and has great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
