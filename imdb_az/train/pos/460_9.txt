This young, a career-oriented Amanda Redman, is a wonderful new crime series that combines three British television stations (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detectives who have been brought back to clean up old incidents. Three interesting, perverted old police officers, using a twenty-year-old detection method in a police force that has been acting for a long time, sometimes produce a radical group of horror at times and at other times by senior officers. The three are sympathetic, describe warts and all. There are many funny scenes, and all three of them are moving in the same way as old and their legacy. <br /> <br /> The first six-part series (next year is promised several words) developed each character. Widow Jacob Jacob does not agree with his wife's untimely death. Lothario learns Denis Waterman's role as father. And even obsessive Alun Armstrong assisted by his new friends to battle with the demons of his past - and keep taking medication! Amanda Redman faces a very familiar confrontation between life and career. Story lines are interesting if it depends on the miracles of the DNA test. But this is the fourth of Britain's best actors making the series unacceptable.
