So far, I agree with the comments. I remember this documentary as one of the most beautiful and informative I've ever seen. As I mentioned before, I began to think that I was just exploring a nature - it was interesting, not absolutely special, but I was wrong. Only the story of the colony was incredible, but I remember that music was a part of his appeal. As I remember correctly, Native Americn pipes (music on Cookoo's Nest at the end of one). I'm looking for a copy. This is a requirement for anyone to look at schools, especially schools. It should be re-released.
