I'm delighted with all the versions of this story, but it loves me all the time. George C. Scott gives Scrooge the character, while others do not. Why is the film so painful? Changes in Scrooge appear gradually as they come across different spirits and compare with what they have seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is the best Tiny Tim. It's the right age, not just the place where a young person plays, just as in other films. Anthony Walters still has all or some of the baby teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner Bob is as cool as Cratchit. He is a versatile actor. He describes a man who loves his family. He plays his role as a unique man who controls his role under Scrooges'tumb, but puts it in a stylish way to provide a family. Susannah York and other actors are doing good things to bring life to life. Edward Woodward is the best Christmas I've ever seen. Often it is played as a charming Santa character. He shows anger in Scrooges' relationship and really looks back to Scrooge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie.
