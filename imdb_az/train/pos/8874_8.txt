Higher education is a slap in front of those who have lived in a very long time regardless of ethnic background. despite the fact that we want to ignore many issues, we will not be able to pay for being a real progressive change so that we can diversify and understand the diversity. This film is criticized as hatred or dumbness. The point is that the ruler of ignorance in the world is dominant and many of our societies they help to give preference. Everyone in this movie has done a good job to show what steps will be taken to avoid creating movies at a higher level. A pipe sounds like a dream. But you need to start somewhere and this helps.
