I'm very pleased with this movie, mostly because I'm very pleased to see Sean Connery actor, and he has additional bonuses for Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne. The story has a grandmother looking for Connery's help. Because her grandson remains in prison and says she has been mistakenly convicted. At first, some of the racist aspects of the case could have been, but then the prosecutor's office was black, and he did some bad things to force the boy to confess. The boy also seeks to kill another murderer, who is locked in the same prison. He is a particularly bad person, because he has a lot of joy, writes his relatives' relatives, and tries to send people to them. This is a bit unexpected with some of the many twists and turns. I just enjoyed the character of Sean Connery and tried to understand all the difficulties. When the film finally found out that it was finally happening, it made me crazy. Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne would get a good deal because all of them are good. Finally, this is a good tension / tension.
