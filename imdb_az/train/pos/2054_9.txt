When I first heard the title for "The Simpsons", like many other reviewers, but when I saw it, I was totally surprised that the actresses of the great character would be that! Above all, Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction) has McBain playing a leading role. He rescued a Vietnamese Armed Forces camp. One of them burns DOLLAR DETAILS IN SOCIETY with Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), McBain (Vietnamese soldiers loaded with money) and tells him that after 18 years, Santos and his sister Cristina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) combines insects. <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> McBain </ strong> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align : Justify; 'Good friend to help her' asks Vietnam friends: First, is the strange black man of the American Ninja, Steve James, the director, James Glikenhaus, the former film Exterminator, Eastland, and the real name of the adventurer's Eastland? I do not think, when Christina saw her for the first time, because McBain is wearing a welding mask, there are many other references to Exterminator, among other things, a bridge that works on a source! <br /> <br / > The other guys in Vietnam are: Rich Man, who can supply all kinds of equipment to the team, Frank Irwin, Total Recall, Starship Troopers, and then doc, Dalton, (who does not appear to be a person who has no relationship to IMDb and played by Jay Patterson I knew who it was I did not see it in other films), but not the last, but there is the police, Gill said Luis Guzman, head of the Caucasian Muslims Office, Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), as a small drug dealer who can not get a good job. In addition, Dick Bocelli also has a McBain bag as a groom who is dealing with a drug-hungry crane. Almost the same, it depends on the meat mill by John Eastland. EXTERMINATOR movie! I have never seen Glickenhaus's "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop", but I'm ready to bet on a half-dollar bill that Boccelli hangs on in that movie! <br /> <br /> Well, when they return to this movie ... they go to Colombia and keep the day off! But whoever cares about the area, the cast is great and the action scenes are very good and we're never bored when watching this movie! Highly recommended to all those who love action!
