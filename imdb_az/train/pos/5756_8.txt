When Aaron and his brutal cronies decided to seize Elk Hills after they had escaped all the bad elements, the plan was over. Before leaving Harun a lot of things, stand up to Aaron's dearest brother, Ben (played by Jean-Michael Vincent). Writer / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage attacks a dangerous, unpleasant, immoral, frustrating and abusive driver who benefits from the contemporary West: it creates a sensitive noise, keeps its speed fast, moves away from the sliding and transmits multiple moving scenes (especially strong and blending) with significant muscle aplombs.
