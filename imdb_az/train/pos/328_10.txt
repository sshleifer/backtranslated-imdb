Interestingly, I approached Curious (Yellow) and it was a big piece of frustration. I read numerous reports about her widespread disputes and clear sex. What happened to me was not, but unlike any other, a thoroughly thoughtful and attractive movie experience. I believe that the majority of commentators in the film are approaching pornography in a "foolish" or "boring" movie. Perhaps pornography is something intended to irritate pornography, but it's not deliberately erotic. The protagonist, Lena, is simply a persuasive and persistent realist and humanist, pushing his whole performance. Her breasts can be saggy, her nipples are unusually large, her thighs of fat, and her face, chubby. But before the end of the film, the audience gets to know him and his mistakes are accepted as human beings. This tactile provides more reliability than its necessity. The director, Briget Bardot, would have the effect of destroying the impact. I can not recommend the part that provokes this idea. Be prepared to spend too much thought in this intentional upcoming movie. Patients and spectacular viewers will be rewarded in ways that they can imagine most of the other films.
