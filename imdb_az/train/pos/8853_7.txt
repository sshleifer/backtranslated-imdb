In New York, Andy Hansman (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an associate executor of a real estate office that takes on a large amount of addiction and costly lifestyle with his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei). If an audit is scheduled in the department, it is hopeless for the money. The baby's brother, Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke), is responsible for a three-month-old child support for her daughter and is a complete loss of affection for her every Thursday afternoon with Gina. From morning on Saturday, Andy plans to pack a group of her parents' jewelry without looking for a weapon and wait for an old worker to come to his parents without any financial damages, as the insurance company will pay for it. On Monday morning, we'll raise the money needed to cover her theft. She is invited to take part in Hanky, as she is well aware of the jewelry store and the well-known shopping center. However, Hank yellows and thieves Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O'Byrne) invites you to steal your store, but things are wrong when their moms come to work for the employee of Nanette (Rosemary Harris) and Bobby secret weapons. Nanette reacts and kills Bobby, but she is also killed. After Nanette's death, his ancestors Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) decided to investigate the robbery with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> An erroneous comedy, before the "Devil knows he is dead". The originality and the difference are scenarios, with non-linear "Pulp Fiction" concept. Eighty-three-year-old Sydney Lima has a great deal of work, and the longevity of this director is surprising. Philip Seymour Hoffman results in the role of a non-commissioned person who has a traumatic relationship with his father. Because it separates the world from a dangerous and mixed brother. Marisa Tomei is still beautiful and sexy, showing her magnificent body. The severe conclusion is that the world is a really bad place. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red; ">
