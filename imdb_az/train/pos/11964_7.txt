This afternoon, I went to the movie theater waiting for Scoop to be afraid. Fortunately, the film exceeded expectations at least. Nothing is heavy, deep-rooted - not a good place like any real Allen kingperson - it's also a pleasure as a light, and the comedy is insulting. There is something simple and sweet in this regard. "Sweet" was the word I heard from the audience following the show. Allen does not feel as if he started creating a masterpiece here, feeling a little comedy and a desire to have fun. Compared to everything Hollywood produces, Allen's products tend to be attractive. Even fluffy things. Today, going to a movie made by a real person is updated.
