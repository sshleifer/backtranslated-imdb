<br /> <br /> This film took place in and around the 19th century in Okabashi's red light. I'm not sure if I missed this movie for the first time. Japan. <br /> <br /> This is a fairy tale of women who are strong in prostitution, caste systems, and a society based on the power of Japanese samurai code. <br /> <br /> This unique Akira Kurosawa! Although it's dead before you shoot the movie, the scenario is aligned. The influence on the Japanese world and the cast system is well-known and it illuminates how these systems interact with each other. The heroes can turn around one another, but the caste system remains unchanged when each of them returns to their world. The samurai fighters who are dragged into the near and cheerful prostitute are in another life with a man who is part of the caste system. Many prizes are superior to the rest of the world, but still low-intensity people who can support each other and enjoy it without restrictions. The samurai in this film goes out to be weak, and those who love class prove the honorable ones. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher rating. Feodal is the story of the survival of women in Japan. During this time it was thought that men were the survivors ... but women were just thought of as stupid and weak property. <br /> <br /> This film highlights the power of Japanese women and what they need for their survival, and that their power continues as Japanese culture is. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Akira Kurosava, who is "Seeking the Sea", and even if it is not a fan. It's a lovely, quiet, and inspirational movie, and it's precious to any movie collection.
