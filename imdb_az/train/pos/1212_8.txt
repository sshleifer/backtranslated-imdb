Care Bears Film 2: New Generation is a bad movie. In fact, I love it. Yes, I acknowledge that the dialogue is poor, and the story is a bit weaker. But Darkheart is a person who has changed a very awkward, convincing, and Hadley Kay did a wonderful job for her. Talking to the voice, it was great, it was wrong with nothing. The animation is colorful and sometimes some of the visuals were breathtaking. Songs and accounts are especially growing and endless young, the last one has always been my two personal favorites. The bears I care about are very nice and human beings are doing well. And the latter is a real tearjerker. All this is harmless kiddie fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
