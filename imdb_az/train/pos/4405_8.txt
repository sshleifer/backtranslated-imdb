The war between states was perhaps the darkest hour in America's history; His brother's brother will not have a war that fights against his family and family, and that he still does not cure them today. As with any story about any war, it is a personal contradiction that is beyond any historic significance. Ang Lee, a Civil War drama that draws attention to personal trafficking that describes the revolution itself, is a human element showing the context for the director Ang Lee, one of the most bloody episodes of war, Lawrence, In Kansas, Quantrill and his raiders, he is able to succeed in presenting an assassination attempt in terms of Confederacy. In 1863, the influence of the Union dominated the state of Kansas, and even the things that could be regarded as "regular" Confederate troops to the Norther, which had been scattered across the neighboring Missouri border with Confederate slogans. When everything really begins to warm up around their own towns, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) are creating a group and harming the merger, wherever possible. Jack Bull and Jake do not like the war and do not like to kill; but they stand up for what they believe to be true. <br /> <br /> However, there are young men like Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who use the conflict as a tool for personal gain, and there is nothing more prejudicial to the innocent victims in many cases by expressing their violence against unnecessary cruelty make. That's why Jack Bull and Jake, at the same time, are the ones that will be tested for loyalty and moral judgments; It's a time to spirits in blood. <br /> <br /> Along with all of his films, director Ang Lee is approaching her by exploring her story traditional, subtle, traditional, and culturally. describes the relationship between the interests of the population and their morality, the vast majority of that time. And so Lee understands his work, which is related to at least one subject, and eventually, perhaps his characters and the drama he deals with them. (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), or the tradition and tradition that takes into account the relationship between a father and a daughter ("Eat Drink"), class difference ("Sense and Sensitivity"), the relationship between honor and code of a warrior, above all ('The Ice Storm'), the moral uncertainties that lead to deficiencies bring insights into the human condition that brings the films to a higher level. This movie is no exception; and (as with all his films), Lee presents his story with breathtaking cinematography (in this film, by Frederick Elmes, as well as the "The Ice Storm"), a clear poem under his leadership. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jake adds a conscious, reflective sense of any story he says, specifically Lee Touch, because he brings something to Tobey Maguire primarily. the film's young sense of innocence, this story contradicts the maturity that develops and shapes together with it. Most importantly, Maguire generally responds convincingly and convincingly that he believes in additional events emphasizing the reality of the film: the stoic adoption of death and the "killings" in the news and battles; the moral confidentiality they encounter even in these troubled times; rarely betrayal due to the nature of the conflict; and loyalty and beliefs, he and his friends are firmly bound. All of them provide the performance of Maguire, and this is not a small success. Nevertheless, research, attractive performance, often given, failed; <br /> Skeet Ulrich turns into an exciting action like Sue Lee, as Jack Bull and Jewel (in his debut), and is also effective. Shelley. Additionally, along with Jeffrey Wright's well-known supporting role as Daniel Holt, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who poses the danger of Christopher Walken for Pitt's role is also remarkable. <br /> <br /> In the conversation, James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Tom Guiry, Tom Wilkinson, John Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Ms. Chiles). Civil war will be an open wound to the nation forever; but hopefully, as time goes on, it will result in the objective thoughts of filmmakers like Ang Lee and the "Devil Ride", which ultimately will help to close the body and heal. In light of recent developments, this is a world-wide necessity. Film is a powerful tool; but may also be entertaining and entertaining, and maybe encourage and promote the sense of unity with the more sophisticated filmmakers, events and sensitive images of our relationships, such as Ang Lee. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
