Booth puts a new twist on your typical J-horror movie. This movie puts you on the heroine of the story shoes. The master wants to see what the hero sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> An antique radio station DJ stand is the story of how our hero perceived how the hero worked, lived and loved people and surrounding people. The story draws the main character backdrop as a flash-backed onion, as the film is running, and we've learned that this is not what it's all about. The film originally took place in a small, long-term radio studio with a very bad history, which was forced to broadcast its show because of the character of the radio station being in the process of re-placement. This film is growing out of this limited space and is very claustrophobic and feels very paranoid. From time to time, when the hero was unable to imagine strange events in his old studio, his imagination had been made by some of his employees or some assassination, or all that. I love the movie about the movie artists that encourage you to see the main character and make it like a hero like a paranoid. This film is very flawless enough for a 76-minute movie.
