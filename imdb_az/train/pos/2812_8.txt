"Silverlake Life" was documentary and straightforward and simple. In fact, if you were more than a home movie and you want dramatic illuminations, watch something else. And no tearjerker. But I express it in a positive way. Two men who love each other and suffer from AIDS affect the quality of their daily lives. It's hard for me to tell if it's a good quality movie for me, because it's so robbed that I've been forced to look for other ways to answer. An astonishing movie, in fact, is one of the most admirable, sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have an incredible lifestyle because their lives are in the most important parts. In AIDS, empty wood production appears hip and defective. These guys have made this movie one of the best reasons for creating something for themselves. The scene where Tom is telling Mark that you are my sun and saying goodbye to him is a real thing.
