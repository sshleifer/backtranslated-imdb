A surprisingly well-run comedy was a small effort by "British Lady X Divorce (1938)". It marks the first pair of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon before a small film about passion for uncontrolled 19th-century English moors. When Olivier and Oberon do not fit into the vidal comedy, they all run smoothly. Oberon Leslie is a young woman who completes a divorce divorce lawyer Logan's (Olivier) suite by preventing a bad English tongue smoke. She does her best to irritate her - but she falls for her in an attractive way to go to movies. And he falls for it. However, whenever Oberon's "Lady X" (all that Oliver had left behind) was a serious personality, Olivier was thinking of becoming a married woman. To make matters even worse and more fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier, who wants to divorce his beloved wife Larry's Oberon! There is a beautiful frontline dialogue and attractive intelligence on sexuality. You can see Olivier's lack of confidence in comedy, but he is really a professional and professional in Olivier. And he turns the height curves, and maybe not easily, with gusto. Oberon was not as big as a actress, but he was generally quite authoritative and well-off with Olivier, despite their well-known off-screen. Today, it seemed very technically that today it looks very primitive (everyone is white than Michael Jackson), but maybe an anchor is needed.
