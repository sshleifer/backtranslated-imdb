The former CIA assassin and current spirited human being in Mexico City is hired by the advice of old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) by John Creasy (Denzel Washington) art critic Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony). young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and her husband Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes cold Creasyin's behavior, resumes it and smiles again, and feels great love for her. <br /> <br /> When she is abducted and killed by criminals, Creasy is swearing to kill anyone responsible for theft. <br /> <br /> It is a work called "Fire Yanak" and, of course, a classic in the future. The story is not great, it's never irritable, and it's 146 minutes running, but the audience does not feel the passage of time. Casting is made by outstanding actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, and Radha Mitchell. Cinematography has amazing moments and scenarios have stunning lines. Christopher Walken's character, Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini), when I explained that Creasey's specialty was death and prepared a masterpiece, I personally liked it. I agree with the user who commented that he is one of the best films if it's not the best of the genre "Fire Fighting". <br /> <br /> Brazil: "The Flame of the Revenge"
