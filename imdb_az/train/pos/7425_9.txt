Barbra Streisand, this is a cycle of Hollywood story. His performances and songs are one of the kind and special in the big movie halls. It is one of the best examples of the film, when it comes to Christopher's acquaintance with an unexpected viewer, only the song "Ayda Woman", which is against the wishes and will of the people only to turn them around. The performer can win over an audience. This is true. Evergreen's scene is the best in the business. Everything is alive, no lip-sync, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being diva, but speaks about it. He was awarded Evergreen at the "Once Upon a Time", "Oscar" and "Paul Williams". He also talked about most of the film "Christopherson" long ago. Although this version of the Born franchise was one of 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic Mart), I will use Judy Garland and James Mason's music reconstruction in 1954. I have not seen the DVD yet and did not know about its quality.
