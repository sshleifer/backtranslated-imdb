Sequels actually live up to the original. This is definitely true in this case. However, if you are a great admirer of the original, give this an absolute time. Although the camera work is incomplete, Brian Krause's character is boring and land clicks are more rewarding than the first one, and I find something fun about it. <br /> <br /> This film does not expect the same performance as in the first movie. It is very clearly different. Instead of sitting in the scenario of cabin writings, Stanley attempts to divert the dream project into the Lake of Lake Hollywood. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
