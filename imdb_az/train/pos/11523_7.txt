It's one of the funny movies I've ever seen. I watched him on the DVD and had no special feature on the disc, even a menu, but it was not my focus. <br /> <br /> If I was a big studio film or a smaller movie, I tend to judge films depending on other things. It's a small movie and I'm ready to forgive little things. <br /> <br /> I believe that I have one of the most creative and original titles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I like the role of all major players. Especially Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the most funniest lines. The character described by Claire Forlani may come in an unusual way for some people, but I know people who have emotional problems that make decisions about my life. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for children, but it is not dealing with sex and nudity. There is a great language, but sometimes it can be very funny. <br /> <br /> See also the bride of prominent actors.
