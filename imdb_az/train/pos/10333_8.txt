It was also a remarkably small American propaganda film that was openly debating the Nazi tyranny before disclosing extremely creative and beautiful mortal camps. In contrast to other films that reveal how bad and terrible they are in the late 1944s and until 1945, this film is the most terrible honest film ever since when I saw the Nazi tyranny. The film begins in the future courtroom - after the war ended (film 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fantastic world court, a Nazi leader is charged with war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is calling a witness who has not completely changed his mind and revealed in Grimm's life a number of flashbacks since 1919. First, the film will be sympathetic or Grimm is trying to join the Nazis. However, after a while, Grimm appears to be a sadistic monster. <br /> <br /> These episodes are incredibly well developed and will definitely keep your interests and look like a legitimate drama, not as part of the propaganda. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film is a great deal of stars considering the film, but second-rate players. There are many modest scenes and speeches - especially the destruction of the Jewish scene can not help but end with tears. How interesting were some of the super-creative scenes that used the cross to make the film unobtrusive around the same point. FÄ°I - This does not mean a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler's "hanging paper". Hitler is referring to the myth that he once earned by putting a wallpaper. In fact, this is not true - from the very beginning, he was a "hunger-striking artist", a homeless man and well-served in the German army at WWI. A terrible man, yes, but not a paper hanger!
