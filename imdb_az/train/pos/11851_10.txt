This movie, which reminds us of the concept of "True Spirit," comes at a time when it is making money by showing Hollywood's weaknesses, despair, murders, medications and wars. If you feel beaten, this movie will release your mind and speed you up. We all know how difficult life can be, and sometimes we need to be reminded that we will be sustained and courageous. What has this movie done for me and I hope this will be for you.
