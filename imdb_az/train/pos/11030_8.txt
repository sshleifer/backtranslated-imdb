Watching Cliffhanger is nostalgic in the early 90s, and almost every new action movie can be described as "Die Hard". Cliffhanger says "Not To The Mountain" and why it is so good. <br /> <br /> However, according to Passenger 57 and Resistance, Holy Die Hard clones differ in their circumstances, Cliffhanger <br /> <br /> Includes the feelings and scenes surrounding many action films, with their magnificence There is a danger of eliminating and trivializing the conflicts between the peaks and the dying nations. <br /> <br /> The Simple Plan and <br /> <br /> <br /> </ font> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All this is worth it: its intensity allows us to forget the richness of the camera and the actors, and we just can see that it really happens. Even Harlin's powerful impact, but still a lot of jokes (and recurring in Deep Blue Sea) or the falling animal that threatens to be a ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face can be the power of the knee. <br /> <br /> The next impressive unit is the armed forces inside the jet. As Stallone and Michael France wrote and Harlin directed, the audience was initially ignored by what agents were involved in theft, and the bloody double crosses were completely unexpected. According to Roger Ebert, the stuntman, passing the middle air passage between the aircraft, deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Then, during an avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists / thieves seems to be falling in the snow mountain. As far as I know, no one was killed in the preparation of this film (a small miracle, given the extreme nature of some people), so it was an open rule for stroke. <br /> <br /> After calling for military service, they called for military service. <br /> <br /> Persons detained in prison are heroes of action every day of the week, because she is one of a few film critics who are totally convincing in terms of many physical and emotional pain and at the same time feeling pain. The role of Gogh Voker complements Stallon's powerful movements: he plays an older, more sensitive action hero, giving him a low impressive impression of a mountain-savior who needs to save himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Today's post-Matrix, In Cliffhanger, the hero immediately frozen his death and begins to show tears because he runs away from another dangerous situation. <br /> <br /> When split, it is painful when cut off, especially in the cavern line. <br /> <br /> For the first time when I see this movie as a teenager, I have rooted in every step for the good guys, and another bad person smokes dust (or rather, ice) I was waiting for dinner; <br /> <br /> Lithgow's English accent is unlikely to be a movie model or model helicopter, but it has become one of the most cold-wing characters in the film. one of the few people in principle who can read a good actor and a simple dialogue: at one stage, looking at hostages Stallone and Rooker, which of them has decided to give up, really, "You, stay!" "An even better player like Anthony Hopkins Cliffhanger sometimes makes it even more enjoyable for a show, even if he puts it at risk. </ b> Earlier, for example, Lithgow said to one of his own men, "Returning [Stallone] "No real criminal could even make this mistake unheard of: his carelessness allowed Rooker to give a warning to Slyga on the rock, and that led to a war between Stallone and the wicked who wanted to pull him down. <br /> < br /> Lithgow could have given his order a more subtle way, but open to Rooker it would not have been fun to watch in sequence if it did not allow it. <br /> <br /> One Saturday morning sequence or (sometimes) a western style, Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it will get rid of very weak elements. <br /> <br /> Along with the painful detectable aircraft models previously mentioned, there are several scenes, including bats and the other two scenes, which are really cheap in the hall with fraudulent snow at weak points. an unnecessary monster in a motion-filled narrative. <br /> <br /> As a result, Harlin's decision to move some of his scenes slowly is meaningless, because the technique has no effect on scenes. Stallone is now very old for action movies because its character is very reliable in this movie, and I'm surprised to see what happens next year. Perhaps, Cliffhanger is, in the long run, the best thing to stop herself: there's already a fairly tired and obsolete movie franchise. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Price: 8 (Very good, especially most other Stallone movies. )
