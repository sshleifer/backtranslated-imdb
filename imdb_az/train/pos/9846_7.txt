Ok, at first, it looked like "Shrek" - a comrade with a comic relief of suffering. Then, as the base is determined, it becomes really attractive. And the result is an unpleasant movie that I agree that very little dramatic to watch for children (Manny's past). The goal has been for a long time that they will succeed in building a movie with almost no different set (ice caps and rocks) and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they are able to do something emotionally. As I said, it can sometimes be tearful, as the children are warned. True frenzy animation. This toy does not wander and shows like storytelling or shrek. People are unreal, and we've seen better CGI examples before. But do not spoil the stain: as a single effort, "Ice Age" deserves praise. And many fans will gather, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, moments with this little mouse are priceless and show-theft.
