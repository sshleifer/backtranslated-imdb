I saw it as a child in Disney's Beautiful World, so I did not remember most of them. <br /> <br /> When I looked in the post later, I thought, "This is the most strange thing I've ever seen." Scenarios look like something that causes LSD overdose. Animated characters, Jungle Book and Robin Hood are mostly colorful / versatile versions. <br /> <br /> Some things I've seen are children in danger of the body and prostitutes (during the Portobello Road). <br /> <br /> Even though the music numbers were too long, the kids were tired of them. Additionally, the subject was a bit dark, as was the case at WW2.
