Koo tamo peva is always the best comedy. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedy, but every time I'm watching her I say what to smile. But the truth is that humor in this comedy is special. It's a karate for Serbia. And all the former Yugoslav Republic knows it very well! So I think the rest of the audience (like Europe) does not like it. Because the subtitles ruin the hole. But they should at least try it !!!! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best fit in Serbian history and the world does not understand it! :-) If you have a chance to see this one, do not drop it!
