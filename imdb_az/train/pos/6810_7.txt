After reading the book I spent $ 3 for Wal-Mart on this DVD and thought that hell ... I entered the DVD and watched yesterday. When I started watching, I checked the working time and was about 90 minutes. I thought it was good ... He knew very little about the story and how much it was. When I came to the real killings, "have I been so long?" Who was it? Checked in. "What's a minute?" <br /> <br /> Along with this, I'm glad that the DVD contains part 1 and part 2 of the scene selection menu. it was an hour and a half! <br /> <br /> I did not admit that I saw the 1967 original film (despite my sincere desire), and I'm very satisfied with the second half of the film. But he read the novel and felt that it was a very weak film for a two-part television program. I think that removing Perry's role was completely wrong, and a few minor contradictions were thrown on me, but she still did a great job. The first half is a little drifting, the latter is a bit more aggressive. In my opinion, Capote should have its own book: 1/3 of the killings, then 1/3 and the killings should be more than one-third of the film. Instead, the film is about 1/2 of the killings, then 1/4, and after the killings are about 1/4. However, the second half is more interesting, but at the same time it is less attractive when dragging the first half ... <br /> <br /> Now I look and I understand that it's a mistake to drag and mislead things, so I'm going to hell. Watch the movie and prepare your own damn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
