I love horse horses and amused the animation, so DreamWorks's new animated film, Basbug: I did not expect anything strange about Cimarron's sting. Maybe you can say I'm a little disappointed. It has a nice animation and may seem like a perfect story first. A story about nothing but a horse in nature. Animals can read or even sing your favorite songs - a great plus. Unfortunately, the movie is uncalled to narrate by Matt Damon; A soundtrack loved by Bryan Adams; There are enough moving scenes to compare to Jerry Bruckheimer's production. If film artists will simply stay comfortably, there is a work here. It's a nice movie, not a good fun for small children. I would recommend this film to families because it has the right place and is now a thing that is not insulting to a small child. Not good, but it would be better. Even though there are many beautiful images.
