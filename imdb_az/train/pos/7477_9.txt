This film is made up of such a great emotion, especially with the noise soundtrack overlapping with the movie. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of the enthusiasm for filming and entertaining. It was not the best movie I watched for the first time, but I decided that it was one of the best films I saw about 3 times. It is held in New York City and is moving forward in lifestyle. The girl finds a delima in her life (Diaz). He goes through depression and then disappears. This movie was beyond my expectations and was one of the best films on the cruise!
