It was a coincidence that I was behind the movie box I thought I was renting, so I did not learn until I left home, and I was still watching her. Absolutely FANTASTIC! a beautiful movie and the best three times of all time, I advise everyone! <br /> <br /> If the story is enjoyable and easy, it could easily be blurred, but the players and the filmmaker do a great job of keeping it together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, beautiful, and have a good job. <br /> <br /> Need to find a copy somewhere ...
