If you have not seen Eva Longoria at the television show Desperate House Wives, then you're missing. Eva will be one of the biggest Latina stars and soon you will see her in theaters. It was Evan's first film, and he did a fantastic job. She was 24 when she shot and then looked hot. As for this low-budget movie, for the first time, the film director Juarez, Mexico, for the first time in many film festivals in the United States, is good for the next filmmaker. In fact, some news stories may have limited theater freedom. It would be good to look at Snitch'2 with a better budget.
