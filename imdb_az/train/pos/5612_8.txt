In Paris, the shy and dangerous bureaucrat Trekkovski (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment with the former tenant, Egyptian Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange) who committed suicide. Shelley Winters and the hosts, Mr Zy (Melvyn Douglas), define the rules of conduct and feel Trekkingy's neighbors twist. Meanwhile, he visits Simone in the hospital and is friendly with his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After the death of Simone, Trekovski feels painful and prepares a scheme to force homeowners and neighbors to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Strange "Le Locataire" is an alarming and creepy story of paranoid and negligence. The only story of Trelachowski's story and the process of insanity and loss of identity are slowly developing in a horrible place in the terrible place of sight, and the events that really happen are completely unexpected. Performances are intense and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
