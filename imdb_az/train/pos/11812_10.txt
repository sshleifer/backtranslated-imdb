These movies are the best movie to watch the comic book feel. The set, suit and color are alive just as inside a comic book. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives funny relief like Mumbles and can not help Madonna, but if she does, she feels sorry for Madonna. , and failed to win on Tracy. <br /> <br /> This film covers all the classic mob clich√©s - the desire to bury people in concrete, capture public cars, shut up a good boy and blow up a girlfriend's house. <br /> <br /> This movie cries the word, even the camera angels comic book. It's great to go back to a bigger movie and see how a comedy can be done for a movie after seeing some of the mistakes like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> FOR THIS MOVIE!
