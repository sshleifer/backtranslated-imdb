The film has a great written genre story. It consists of ordinary Columbo ingredients; Lt. Columbo is approaching and closing his suspect, the mystery opens for him, Columbo's dog, cat and mouse game, which is good, and fortunately, it's a good relaxing humor covering Columbo's character. Even though it really does not have the original concept, it's written down. Columbo has been a Colombo movie several times before hunting down a detective / crime novelist. <br /> <br /> This is a very well versatile film from James Frawley, which later directed 5 more Columbo films, 70 and 80's. <br /> <br /> Film style and some really great and unforgettable sequences provided. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a long running time, it's one of slow-moving Columbo movies. This style and approach always does not work well for a Columbo movie, but it's probably not the least because of the film's performance. <br /> <br /> The most Columbo movie starring a film star, starring a star or a star from the beginning of the film's shoot. This movie does not recognize 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. She has not been involved in many movies during her career, but she still plays for Rosemary's Baby and has won Oscars. There was a realist who did not like some people and there were some unusual behavior. <br /> <br /> In 1969, she won four more Oscar nominations during her career before winning Rosemary's Baby. <br /> <br /> The film also has a series of interactions with Peter Falk. still a young GD Spradlin stars. I tell the young man, because he is only 57 years old in this Columbo production, but I know him from his latest career. <br /> <br /> <strong>
