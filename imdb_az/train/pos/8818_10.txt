It was evident from the very beginning that 9/11 will be inspired by films like World War II and Vietnam; But most of these films are a great threat to good (or rather, bad) Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> The first international version of 9/11 is a collective work of 11 directors from around the world, not a love story that is played by many beautiful faces. <br /> <br /> Does not intend to say that all 11 episodes are too big (Youssef Chahine, for example, having an unnecessary prologue with a large number of cuts and a really strange ending of Shohei Imamura) or segments (Imamura's only one direct link to Twin Towers should not be opened, it should not end, Alejandro Gonzales must be the last of Inarritu's, because this is the most effective one). <br /> <br /> A few days later, Samir Makhmalbaf is an effective effort and an interesting illustration of reaction to the split of the towers in other parts of the world because they are trying to explain Afghan teachers in their opening segments. his students fail in New York City for a minute of silence. Or with Idrissa Ouedraogo (which features a real bin Laden pair that will be shocked when you look at it), 5 guys are thinking about the good things that can be done with premium <br /> <br /> US President Barack Obama on Tuesday welcomed US President Barack In a meeting with Obama, he said he was killed in Allende and Pinochet established a dictatorship - with Henry Kissinger and CIA's generous help. It might have been a terrible effort in anti-Americanism, but it turned into a sad tale, and it was an Inarritu (mostly sound impressions and phone calls from missed airplanes, sometimes a few WTCs and, finally, with the brightness of the screen and a tower that ends with a question), and Amos Gitai tries hard to get into the air when a car bomb exploded in Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> All these different segments (yet I did not mention Claude Lelouch's deaf, Danis Tanovic's show about Mira Nair's Srebrenitsa Women - strange, but from September 11th, the Muslim family under the severe suspicion and with Ernest Borgnine you can imagine Ernest Borgnine (Sean Penn) as a widow who lives in the most terrible life) and not to forget a unique movie to forget. I'm sure that this movie will be classic for everyone that is known to everyone in thirty years. Hopefully, it has started a long tradition of world cinema. Unfortunately, you will be remembered as the only effort of a film. As one of the few 9/11 films, do not drop a love story to please the audience to end this terrible event with love.
