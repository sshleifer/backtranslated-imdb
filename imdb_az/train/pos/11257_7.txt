Erotic movies of the 1970's were better than today's triple X romps. Because there is a good story around naked rituals and sexual scenes. Of course, I want them to have vampire effects on their own, and the breed has somewhat reduced their lives. Also, some habits were difficult to understand in time, but it is worth watching the ever-edited version of The DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you do not think about dancing and having sex with naked women, this is not a movie for you. But I loved it and I gave it ... 7 STARS.
