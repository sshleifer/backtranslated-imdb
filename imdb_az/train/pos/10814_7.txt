Given the controversy in 2009, this film is really black president, and this film has a very strong historical significance. For fun, I found this movie to be attractive and modest. Of course, I was definitely taken back with clear racism, and I found the music and dance incredible. It's pretty cool to see it as a very young child player like Sammy Davis Jr. She plays a young boy Rufus Jones, who is comforted by Mammy. It is said to him: "Why can you be president one day?" In 1933, these frustration and lovers were thought to be charming and funny. The film is a fantasy sequence of what the government will do when a large part of the film is run by a black man. <br /> <br /> It was a really good and very entertaining event when I ran to this movie the first day. I believe that if we look at the edge of racism, it will bring us this movie. In fact, it is not normal to have a black president, but it is normal that this film is more important. This is a momentous moment for our collective consciousness.
