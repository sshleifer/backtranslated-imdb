Love is great ... All of these manifestations ... Gorgeous, absolutely beautiful ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a story about the impossible drama of a truly dramatic story, about the impossible ways young hearts, Tudor Giurgiu's skillful on life-driven life and lost innocence. Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche are all surprised by the spectacular noise, love and affection are behind the taste ... It's really remarkable ... In my opinion or Romanian cinematography slowly but definitely advances and gets respect? This is a brilliant movie ... Everyone joins two bars.
