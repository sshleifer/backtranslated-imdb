I think the film is very good, after all this, I will add to my "classic collection". I believe that some of the pikkiers have seen some other posters reminiscent of a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points do not have a "logic", but many religious issues that are "accepted by faith" do not pass the odor test. Of course, you can accept a movie if you accept any of the subscriptions you have subscribed to. Lamonte Cranston suffered a great deal of difficulty in the "Shadow" detention if only one or another person realized that Aja-Yee Khan was a knife. I'm not talking about anything in the Cinematography section (IMDB), but I'm going to cost $ 1 a dollar, which is the same source.
