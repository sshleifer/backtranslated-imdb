This movie has an hour or so good entertainment and has really funny moments. I liked Matt's character and Tiny. The most entertaining and funny characters, of course, seemed to be the most interesting. Matt is very good (as it's his best cousin) and the police provide some pleasant eye candy for women and blonde biker ladies. I saw similarities between Matt and another Aussie actress Eric Bana. My favorite personality was a hairdresser scene, and I loved it. In general, I liked the film and got about 8 ratings. <br /> <br /> <strong> The number of people living in the Caucasus is high. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> :)
