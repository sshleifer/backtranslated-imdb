Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a 18-segment film. You can do 18 parts of math within 120 minutes, each director has seven minutes to tell her or her story. The film is based on the basics you can actually tell a story in a short time. Stage works. Almost all segments are strong, full and happy. Each of them presents a different aspect of Paris's experience, and almost every actor plays the role of big and big actors. <br /> <br /> This movie has very strong drawings, so choose one or two favorites. Perhaps the most memorable for me is Juliette Binoche, "Place des Victoires", "Quartier Latin", Catalina Sandino Moreno, as an old lady of the "Loin du 16Ã¨me" segment, as Gena Rowlands and Margo Martindale, a French-speaking Colorado speaker in Paris. ("14me Arrondissement" segment). <br /> <br /> Geverver Hecq is likely to be specifically mentioned by a middle-aged boy who is supposed to put pressure on an American tourist at a Paris Underground Station (in the Tuileries segment). <br /> <br /> A notable movie. My husband and I decided to lease it for a few months, as we could, of course, keep one of the glaring points we missed. But Paris has made a very nice photo that I do not want to see on a big screen. Anyway, do not miss it!
