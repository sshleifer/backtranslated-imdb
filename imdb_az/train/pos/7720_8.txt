Something I knew about this movie was Robby Robot. My prerequisite that the prophet who was mentioned in the 1950s is something else in a long line of scientific figures. How wrong I am. Large studio, large budget and great production values ​​are at least an ambitious source for the best-known film of this era. <br /> <br /> Because Warfare is darker and more intense than the Planet, I've been able to see it and probably better adjust its back to the outside world. <br /> <br /> It was a colorful presentation of Cinematography immediately and covered detailed and detailed details of Dr. Morbius's (Walter Pidgeon) home and laboratory. But this was just preceded by the icing on the labyrinthine underground cake serving as the Krell castle. Krell's technology says that Star Wars is better. What I was thinking of was that when the film was withdrawn, the audience was faced with the same fears as the "Foreigners" or theater artists in 1977 or SW in 1986. <br /> <br /> Looking at a large television television in my living room, I had the same effect and resisted the hyperbole. <br /> <br /> It's not too far to imagine "Planet Planet" directly ahead of 'Star Trek' TV series; Gene Roddenberry said the film had a great impact on the vision vision for the show. The short-term audience will easily recognize the elements of the Star Trek. When combined together with the Planets Cruiser C57-V men in a transport room, we had to do double. Robby will not be able to respond, it is impossible to answer, so it was an element used at least two or three times in the ST series. <br /> <br /> The movie was about the idea of ​​"monsters from idols" where he took a cerebral turn. The use of subconscious intelligence to protect Albiere IV from Morbius was, of course, a unique concept for 1956, with every science conquest of time belonged to Marsians or other strange cosmic creatures. <br /> <br /> As you know, when looking at the calendar, understanding that Morbius Altaire IV is a protection, it has shown a spectacular magic to the audience. Not more than 2200 years. It can be that the film really is relatively accurate to explore and live on other planets. I think Robby will look more brilliant.
