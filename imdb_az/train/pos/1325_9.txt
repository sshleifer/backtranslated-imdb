I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and took care of all 106 minutes. I love documentary films, but I often find that they will drag about 25 minutes to go. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film was Jordanian woman Norma Khoury, who was famous for her fame and dedication in the 2001 edition of the Forbidden Love book. a kind of Muslim friend killed by the family because of their relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, several journalists threw in the story and the public believed that it was fraud. At the start of the film, it's just about full coverage, and we often spend time with Norman. <br /> <br /> Author Anna Broinowski has found a really interesting woman to learn and she has endless meetings with Khoury while looking for the truth. As always, truth is not easy to find. Norma was afraid for her life, and severely damaged Jordanian Muslim romantic portraits. Refuses to return to Jordan and to show the facts. Broinowski is still not punished and slowly puts pieces together. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look in the artist's mind. Of course, the things we find there are very few, and it is extremely difficult to watch and eventually we do not know we do not want to believe Norma. She is an unjust woman who is either listed or wanting to be a fantastic spinster. <br /> <br /> The film's lies, truths, and semi-truths are brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses dramatizations to describe many interviews, as well as its story, and Broinowski uses it to show us the dramatization. How can people like Norma exist? We want to be conned. Every day we go to the cinema and believe that what is happening on the screen is real. <br /> <br /> Because of some of the movies, I could read a little bit, but did not come up with Brionowski at Q & A after the movie, but it was far from me. <br /> This is a great Australian film and international release and you will receive an award if you ask me. Of course, the best film I've ever seen in AFF07. <br /> <br /> Go, if you take your chance.
