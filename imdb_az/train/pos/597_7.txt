March 1836 was the best film John Wayne 1960 epic THE ALAMO in the battle of San Antonio, Texas. <br /> <br /> As a director of the movie, temporarily funded by a filmmaker, Wayne showed that she was talented in the film beyond the ability of the West to act as a symbolic person. <br /> <br /> I was reviewing another night, and I pointed out that Wayne and James Edward Grant (screenwriter) took only a few points in the previous movie about the battle. They brought the issue of slavery. They also discussed the role of a local Mexican landowner, Juan Segui, as an important leader in the war for independence with Crockett, Bowie, Travis, Austin and Houston. <br /> <br /> But in the film there was a weakness (good secret). Wayne has worked hard for many people to think seriously about their role. However, the leader of the enemy forces, General Antonio De Santa Anna, did not handle it properly. An unmatched actor, played by Ruben Padilla (whose roster shows three credits listed). Padilla did not have any spoken dialogue (even the Spanish language). Although he has one of the latest shootings in the film, he has just been seen as a quiet oppressor watching the burning of the corpses of Americans and their allies. <br /> <br /> This movie is the best film in the manifestation of a man who is leading American politicians (from 1836 to 1854). Raul Julia was a wonderful scene actor. I was happy to see him as Sergius in the production of ARMS and MAN in Manhattan (in the late 1980s). <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> anything that is incompatible with Santa Anna's wishes and activities can not be accepted. There may be a failure in the army to bring any item in the army fast enough, or it may be because of "foreign brigades" (as he sees Americans), "Napoleon West". <br /> <br /> Santa Anna was president of Mexico between the years 1830 and 1855, five or six times. He claimed that he was involved in the overthrow of the first president, because the president did not live up to the constitution of the country, but it was the force that lasted for years. It is a sad comment that Mexico is the leading historian in these two decades. In the late 1850s, no politician or military person, as did Benito Juarez, did not abolish it. At first he claimed to be a great liberal ideals, but once acknowledged that the people of Mexico were in need of leadership hundreds of years before the Mexican people managed to control themselves (and thus, as in Gilbert Roland's Chris, Jose Ferrer). The good thing about him is that he succeeded. His policy was disaster. When we know of his attack on Texasa, he tried to expand into Guatemala (and perhaps he saw himself in control of Central America). Alamo won, but he spent a great deal. Colony was abused by the murder of Fannin's men in Goliad (one could sue for the destruction of Alamo's defenders, the last one, surrendered to Fannin). Then came the San Jacinto tragedy, the army was deported (did not take the necessary measures to follow the American troops). He was captured and insulted and forced to sign Texas's deliverance. <br /> <br /> The spider looked like him: the soldiers wanted to blow him. <br /> <br /> In 1838, he managed to avoid injuries in most of the wars, except for one foot in one battle against the French. He abandoned Texas's compulsory delivery, but did not pushed it military. Instead, he led Mexico to defeat the Americans in Mexico in the 1846-48 war. The United States was "decent" enough to pay $ 15,000,000 for the Southwest, but lost half of Mexico's territory. In 1853, Franklin Pierce could have been president recently to give up his bad leadership - Santa Anna sold the Arizona and New Mexico borders (Gadsden Purchase) to the United States, even to the Mexican president, even to Porfirio Diaz (Diaz sold to foreign business interests, but created Mexico's economic muscles.) He was exiled in 1855 and settled on the island of Staten. He succeeded in finding his most creative work: he presented a flower to the United States and began chewing gum. Some achievements! <br /> <br /> Julia's Santa Anna is smaller than an experienced cynic and scheme, America's best dry buyer. He will not stand up for the opposition, and jumps to an angry tantrum that warns at once. Senior Colonel Col Black (David Ogden Stiers, an English officer here) - does not want to be in front of a possible shooting squad. But Stiers is secretly less than magic by his boss. In the end, alone with the dead Alamo defender's new widow, Stiers thinks Santa Anna really does. And they did!
