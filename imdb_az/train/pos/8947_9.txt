Kim Novak is a witch with a sorcerer for a deadly lover and James Stewart's choice. Free comedy comedy from Broadway stage; Witch Color was shot by James Wong Howe and played with a sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is as beautiful as Redlitch, a writer who is not always angry. I love this movie, though many may seem. Who only wins my book. Yes! My 5 films in 1958.
