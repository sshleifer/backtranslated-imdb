Do not be fooled by people who are stupid, this is a cute journey! Tetsuo is the true successor to Iron Man and Ichi Killer, this gem starts with a bang and lays the thickness of the credits until it loses. As you can see, aliens capture human organs and turn them into a war machine, and then fight for a kind of game for their own entertainment. The winner of the battle eats what he has earned. This is mainly for the area, but who looks at the goodness of this body? I had no idea how many bouquets were used on the bone, but it was not worth it. The use of stop-motion when the movements continue, are all the creatures and makeup effects that are interesting and effective in using and loving care. CGI is a bit limited, but in fact, at least for me, it does not fall slightly from the overall quality. It was a really fun and stinging film that really deserves praise and really won the Cult Classics meeting. Find and watch, you will not be disappointed!
