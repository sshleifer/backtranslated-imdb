Pecker is another smaller film than John Waters' Serial Mom. Pecker's hoodie has a hobby to draw pictures of everything he sees. It is unclear whether it is dirty or shocking when taking pictures. He uses the photos he draws and displays them in his works. Pecker lives in a semi normal middle-class family. His father works with a whipping machine in a drinking bar, but does not earn enough money with a lesbian peasant bar across the street. His mother loves to dress a rescue shop and dress up the poor. His older brother Tina works in a gay bar where he is trading in his specialty. His small, Little Chrissy, sugar, sugar and sugary dining is the habit of eating. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of Mary and plays with him ventriloquist. He also has two friends. About your friends, Matt is a chore shoplifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a dirt like a dictator. Soon a tourist from New York receives his pictures and shows them in an art gallery. The picture acquires fame, but pictures reveal an unusual lifestyle of the lives of friends and family. For the R-rated film, Pecker is fully confident about previous R-rated films and even most of the Pink Flamingos. 10 to 10!
