I loved this movie! While I was waiting for it, I did not do our best to break the tears, but it is really refreshing. Ray Liotta's performance hit me, but his ability to portray Ray's twin brother, who was slowly brainwashed by Tom Hulce's tragic and terrible childhood event. But Tom's character, despite his heart failure, is no regrets and is full of hope and life. Do not miss this great movie!
