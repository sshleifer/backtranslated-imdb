My left foot was an epic feature film about the life and epoch of Cerebral Waterfall, a heavy disability and the use of the left foot, but it was flawless, able to become a writer and artist for all artists. /> I've seen this movie many times, and every time I see it, I think it's just as bright. This amazing movie surprised that it did not win the Oscars for the best picture. It's something with academy awards. Jim Shirdan is one of the world's biggest filmmakers. Scenarios, music, and anything else are great in this movie. As the film continued, you would feel as if everything in a brown house. Ryan MacAnally and Brenda Fricker Cristies helped Dr. Fiona Shaw, who helped fight the Christy. Eileen Cole is equally brilliant. The Irish film industry paid much attention to the name of my left foot. My left foot was the beginning of a beautiful era in the Irish movie. The movie was as powerful and brighter as my father and Michael Collins crying on my left foot. Irish films are considered to be very high in the world and nominated for many Oscars <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-lewis plays crippled Christy Brown in a very good and very brilliant manner as well as Hugh o Conner, who plays young Christy also going for it. I'll be the first to watch two of the best movie shows of these two performances, especially Daniel Day-Lewis's performance, and Antoni Hopkins's silence. Daniel proved to be a great actor in day-lewis career. <br /> <br /> This is an outstanding work in this movie, look!
