This documentary about Schlockmeister, William Castle, features a few cheap ghostly 50s-60s environments that are characterized by the most sophisticated works - watch funny, foolish people with exciting goggles - but love and alive, in particular with a vivid interpretation from John Waters, and the castle daughter of her grandfather, as well as her ability to master her work is quite striking. (We never know what happened to the other Gala descendants). The movies were not very good, but it was clear that their marketing was brilliant, and it seemed like a sweet, hardworking family. Amusing people continue to grow, like Anne Helm, which looks like Straight Jacket's Diane Baker and replaced by Star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman sparks a happy memories of working with the castle called "The Tingler" and has enough imagery to give us an idea of ​​the level of castle skills - not very high, very energetic. It's a pleasant sight when watchers are more enjoyable, and it's nostalgia for easier movie days.
