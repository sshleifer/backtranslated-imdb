ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM music that fans of the genre will enjoy, but I will not rate the SINGIN IN THE RAIN or BAND WAGON classics there. It was Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, the first of three musicians to come together. Kelly and Sinatra are Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors to leave in Hollywood. They are friends with a young girl (Dean Stockwell), an actress who fights an attractive young adult (Kathryn Grayson) who works in addition to MGM. Although both children are involved first in Grayson, she eventually sounds better for Joe, but Clarence then sits with a waitress who learns from Brooklyn, Pamela Britton. Paper-gentle composition, like the abandoned ship, "We hate to leave" places a number of great music numbers similar to Joe's and Clarence's pregnant sailors; Grayson's "Jalousie" is in the process; Sinatra's "I'm a Lover of Love" (a series of dissatisfied ones) and "The Worry Song", a fantasy dance performed by Kelly's Tom and Jerry Fame by Jerry Mouse. "Kelly also later wrote Pirate at PIRATE The Ballet is a kind of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet, with Kelly being a pic of the strongest and energetic performance of the Oscar nominee for a shy character with the best actress and Sinatra's lover, an entertaining sabotage for fans of the MGM musical factory.
