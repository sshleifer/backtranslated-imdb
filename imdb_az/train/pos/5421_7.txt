I use it to spend my time as a soldier in Majesty's queen's home at the Indian Sunshine Residence. "Rudyard Kipling's famous poem is the basis of the film Gunga Din, if you are lucky enough to watch this legendary classic, The author is a story from the writer and poet's work, a Hindu Hindu Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), who worked as a "poisoned milk" during the occupation of India during the occupation of India in the 18th century. His greatest desire is to be a soldier, a part of the British Calvary contingent that Kali's death threatened with the death of a famous blood cult named "Caucasus", which was celebrated for their courage and friendship with three special soldiers The first is the beautiful and debonair, Cary Grant Sgt, Archibald Cutter, later Victor McLaglen's brave Sgt. MacChesney and finally Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. All three and others are full of mountain pigeons under the guidance of a fanatical leader, "Guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). He is a brave son of war who finds a place in the army chaos. A solid story for an old black and white film that needs little fuss for anyone who wants a classic pleasure. ****
