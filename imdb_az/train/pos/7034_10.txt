while adding all aspects of the film --- dance, singing, actresses - Vanessa Williams, just like the best footballer, is a perfect role for Rosie Him, her dedication, energy and timeless beauty. I have never seen anyone describe Gul like that! Vanessa's talent, beautifully illustrated with all the songs she plays, and her acting abilities do not end me! It is incredible that some people dance to say that choreography is bad - its dance skills have been better demonstrated than ever before! Although this version of Vanessa has been working for a long time, I'm above 63, because it's not as impressive as Jason Alexander and the rest of the castle are impressive. <br /> <br /> Well, this version is awesome and this version of everyone I advise you to see!
