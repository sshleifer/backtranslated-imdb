Personally, I have seen many Disney films in my life, although none of them are compatible with Bedgnobs and Broomsticks. Although I did not have a live animation animation personally, it was a development to decorate people as animated characters. The film is evacuated from two countries in the World War II and is sent to remain silent and socially oriented in the country. I have to say that the cast is brilliant. Angela Landsbury made the perfect Miss Price, and David Thomilson showed great interest in a great hopeless fame. The last words always amaze me and this is no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, though I do not know if it's deliberate. Dialogue was not good, but good, given that it was meant to be a baby film. Generally, from the ninth to the ninth, I will give her, her nineteenth ninth, and twelve with her suits.
