It's the most delicate film I have ever seen. The actors gave beautiful images of the characters in the movie. The story is accurately described. This story begins with a young woman traveling to the British Isles and her father, Nauvoo, Illinois. He became a member of the LDS Church and he did not. He thinks it's ridiculous for a trip and is attractive. He encourages us to read about the Prophet Joseph Smith. The story of Prophet Joseph Smith begins here. The film also accurately describes the lives and history of the LDS Church. Sometimes it was graphics, but it was necessary. Emotional expression was very convincing, causing my emotions to leak. The film was awesome. The way the story was presented was touched. When the movie was over, it was not just moved. I was surprised. I would like to see this kind of people who know that the Blessed Prophet is very little. There is nothing else to understand about your life. For those who are members of the Church, I would encourage them to do so. This will increase the testimony of the most incredible man. You have to see that.
