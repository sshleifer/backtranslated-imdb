While many people are unfair to this series, a couple of Guinea Pig videos are quite entertaining. Especially Satan's Experience has fantastic effects - not just a stupid eyeshadow scene, but rather a realistic skin tone and a slippage break - especially for the video vintage and low budget. <br /> <br /> Let's start now for those who do not know: This is a "extreme" torture / counterfeit film that emerged in Japan in the mid-80's. This is a simple area: a young girl is caught by a few people and subjected to cruel tortures to see where the breaking point is. This leads to brutal violence - all the effective real effects, including the last paragraph, as well as the painful appeal of hot oil to the arm of the captive girl and the placement of maggots on the next spots. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences is at the top of the video and touches the girl's paradise as the three people fall and consists of an unconvincing slapping session that puts the three men's daughter in the second row and pushes them to the ground. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays "The Victim of the Experience" is painfully painful and takes a good amount of money. abuse and rough things on the camera. Her reactions have headphones on her head, and loud sounds loud throughout hours. Some of the other abuses he has made are once a tree. <br /> <br /> And there is a stage where the giggle holders have been dragged into an office chamber on a sleazy scene and forced to drink in a bottle of Jack Daniels. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this series, I hope you decide whether or not you want this episode to be shot. 8.5 / 10 for the Devil's Experience.
