I came from Nancy Drewa, the worst of people because of everyone's bad looks. I thought: Even though I do not read books, I do not see anything like Nancy Drew I heard. But I made a mistake. Of course, there is not a single copy of the books, but when you remove something from the movie, you have to change it to have a great screen entertainment. The conspiracy was very exciting and a lot of excitement was a real fright, and I thought Emma Roberts was truly a believer in his own way of describing this classic character. There were a few funny moments and in contrast to many statements, Nancy is now a ditz. It was smart, conservative, polite and original. This film was also a good thing to do with everything combined with comedy, romance, decline and heartbreaking moments. I liked this movie. What flick, what a flick! And if you're smart and decide to trust me, and if you see it, be prepared for some SCARE to be ready for the heck moments! Let's go or get a bum-bum and just decide what other people think about this movie ... almost a mistake. I love it, I want to have this movie! Now I love Emma Roberts. Like mini-Bree Van De Camp from DH. I love, I love it.
