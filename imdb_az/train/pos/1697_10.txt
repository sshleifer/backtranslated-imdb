Basically, this movie is one of the rare films that you hate and think as a better thing than sitting within two hours of suicide bombers. Or, as in my case, you see it as a culprit, one of these films is humor, plot, moving, in fact, very secret, but for those who want us, it is the reward: U is your laugh! He has to find the abovementioned thing really makes the film even more funny, because the film director is probably invisible and under the leadership of this splendid project called Intelligence, because he did not know how funny the film was. Spaced Invaders!
