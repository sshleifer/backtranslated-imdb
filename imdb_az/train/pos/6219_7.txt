What a fun movie. Astaire and Randolph Scott are in the Sea. Astaire has to return the chain in San Francisco, and Scott says he should be happy with Harriet Hilliard's spouse. Everything works well. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is argued and I think Scott's romanticism with Hilliard is unnecessary and slows down the field. Particularly painful is Hilliard's love song reads love songs. I could do enough without reading it, but it touched romance more. Hilliard is a film music teacher, wearing a few glasses, no makeup, and ugly dresses that are known to humans or animals. No wonder Mary keeps her until her sister Ginger and slinky Lucille Ball gores up to his sexuality under heresy. The problem is that his makeup appears to be a plain woman who does not recur in the past, but with a glowing material. Insufficient for a ugly man. But at least one person can be rich, strong and popular, and then he can collect women even if he looks like JoJo Dog-Faced Boy. But what does a plain woman look like? The same paths for romance are not open to him. There were groups of Henry Kissinger. Margaret Thatcher? Being an ordinary woman in a culture should be terrible. As a type of footnote, Randolph Scott likes to bisexual with Hollywood gossip, requires a nod to chew and this is the following line in Hilliard's simple "Women are not interested in me, my sister". The film is likely to give Ginger Rogers more time than any other movie with Astaire. And he is beautiful. She is a beautiful, sexy, talented actress and dancer and the script also gives her good comic lines. Astaire says, "Let's kiss and prepare." "Let's make it right," she says, "she'll give you something to work." A film made with Astaire also gives the solo number of the choice. (Choreography by Hermes Pan). His performance was accidentally postponed by Astaire. It is very indelicate for some time, even when hiccups from its number, even some of Alka Seltzer or water. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dancer, First, let's go to the dance competition during the competition, which is the most strange thing I remember. And only the dramatic duo "Let's Face the Music and Dance" should be among the best. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about myself, I love the movie. For the first time in a theater in the center of San Diego, I recall that he delivered to sailors near a shop called Seven Seas. At that time, I was wearing uniform and affected by Astaire and Scott's marine care. I do not mean that here we have this sparkling musical comedy, which is not absolutely owed to historical reality, and still pays for its costs, unlike most other teams. Jumping ship, Astaire calls a "water taxi". I bought myself a water jet. Uniforms round the clock (unlike the "City"). They were properly dressed, their eyebrows were up to two finger width and did not twist their back. And there are two incidents involving a problem with the Astaire Marine Officers and they are both perfectly managed and thoroughly convincing. A civil servant, Astairei, dropped out of the jazz band during the verdict and reported the captain's report: "They played when they were called, but I am convinced that there is no disciplinary violation." <br /> <br /> The phrase "Watch the Fill Fill" is a little bit repetitive, as Fred did not put it at a high level, and an officer - a good officer - and no one would laugh. the community and a tuxedo turned it into a swabbie sweat instead. It was a good idea. And dance numbers are up to the concept.
