Although the "special effects" of this movie and the technical specifications can actually be laughable for some, I never wipe the pictures that admire my young and impressive minds I've seen in the first 8 years of this movie. The story of this girl surviving and the difficulties she has experienced has been with me for all these years, and I've been thinking about how she has removed her from a far cry from something I've seen. <br /> <br /> This is a real story and when I first saw one of my children I could not appreciate this movie. This film, broadcasted in the 1970s and 1980s, could be blended with television, and at every stage, it was interesting to me that I could not explain it. I guess this is not the first time that an adult (and the world of distress) is watching, and some are unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Because I can show this movie to my son, I went out of my way to get a copy. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, like many films. Perhaps it is partly Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazon, when you are surprised by the spectacular life stories, and then I believe it will be a great pleasure for you to have this movie unpopular over the last 30 years.
