I absolutely love this show, but I've seen the second episode. After watching the first episode, I could see the reasons why people first quit. The first episode's humor is not good and they try to start the series correctly. But I love the show's light and humorous position. Heroes are developing more and more after the episode, and really enjoyable. Like the first episode, it does not accurately reflect the rest of the show, which really is really good. Episode is not bad in any way, but the show is even better and better, so watch more episodes before making any judgments on the quality of the show.
