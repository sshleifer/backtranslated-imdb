The love between father and child, beloved ones and friends is accompanied by delicate and tactful performance. Mabel does not try to beautify rock music as an artist, but instead tries to restore the real life on the screen, collects information about the project over the years and collects information in Beijing underground pockets. <br /> <br / Daniel has made the best performances in all films ever made.
