Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the latest film showing Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not like an organization or co-star). The killings have taken a blessing over the Springwood settlement. The small town came to the point where it became a city of virtual imagination. Parents who killed Freddy Krueger many years ago paid for the basic price. The city lives only in hell and the survivors are dispersed everywhere. But Freddi does not begin to look for his last revenge. It always comes more, although they try to stop it. But this time she finds a bit more about her old life. Can children stop for good Freddy finally? What is this mystery buried in Freddy's twisted mind? We have to follow Freddy's dead. <br /> <br /> A favorable way to end voting. Freddi learns about himself and his life, and goes out with a bomber! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger are the stars in this latest charge. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special speeches. Better than the latter, but full of jokes with a few dated. <br /> <br /> After the conversation you do not want to run away from this movie. <br /> <br /> For Freddy fans I recommend this movie.
