I read some reviews in this movie and asked, "What's wrong with you?" I'm saying. It was a wonderful movie! I thought this movie was beautiful from beginning to end, and the story was very well explained. I'm convinced that people who do not love this film do not pay much attention to the film. There are many important scenes that if you do not pay attention, you will be mistaken and the following scenarios may be illogical. I would like to invite everyone who does not like this movie to really watch this movie again and watch it one by one. The story gave me a perfect meaning and, as I said, was described in a very good way. Each stage in the film has a single point, and at the end of the film everything comes together. <br /> <br /> All actors have done a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was as superior as Tanny Brown playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a nice touch and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, but I did not expect much from him, but he did a great job. Ed Harris was the real stone in the film. She really plays the individual personally and sees how she really worries her character. Wait for her eyes on her scenes, just beautiful! Also, in one of his first role there are many young Scarlett Johansson (like Kate) ... not a bad place to start. Great cast in this movie! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves any of the cast members or just loves the excitement. This is a great movie and should be seen. Do not listen to all these people's ideas, see the film and come to your own conclusion. I hope you will see the film and I hope you love it like me. Thank you for reading, <br /> - Chris
