A film prepared for modern audiences. The masses begin to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, sensual scenes. The whole family is not a movie that will be comfortable to watch. Not for children's eyes. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Songs are attractive. <br /> <br /> But the film's message is not universal. It emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. So if you do good, you will be good. If you do evil deeds, you will be exposed to evil. The fruit of good deeds is good, and the evil deeds are evil. <br /> <br /> In real life this is not always true. It is known that most people can not get justice in this world. Although some bad guys are experiencing bad results, there are many people fleeing. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there are many people who do good things, but they face a mutually abusive end. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in the message and avoid all the secular truth you want, this movie is a good artist.
