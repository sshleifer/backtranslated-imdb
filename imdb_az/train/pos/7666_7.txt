Two wizards are in the fourth dimension: one (like Brian Thompson, Kabal), trying to destroy the place, and the other trying to save (Anton Mordried, Jeffrey Combs). "Doctor Mordrid" offers a very nice fantasy. cheese The surface is quite silly and gore is absolutely nonetheless, but the film is very short and entertaining. If you have enough time to kill this give a look. My rating: 10 out of 7.
