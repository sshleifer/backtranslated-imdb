Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is accused of killing an innocent loyal wife. On the night he was killed, he went out with a mysterious woman who refused to give her name. After being accused of murder, the police visit all the places where he is with him, but only people remember that he is alone. <br /> <br /> This is made up of Universal movie B (see all players). He is dying to die and finds his murderer (Ella Raines) by himself. and a star - Fran√ßoise Tone - downhill). The budget was small and mostly unknown to the castle, but one of the best films of the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic article from William William (a pen name for Cornell Woolrich) from a perfect book. It moves fast and looks just fantastic. <br /> <br /> There is a punished session with the Memory and Elisha Cook Jr. Only extinguishes the screen with incredible sexuality (I was surprised that censorship was not cut off). <br /> <br /> Just a few of the drawbacks that make it perfect. Tone gives a fearful performance. She looks horrible and she is just terrible. Like Curtis Henderson, it's tough and soft. You are really surprised that Raines loves her - it's not that bad. But the role of Raines is pretty good. He is beautiful and full of life. It is not actually his actual fact when the final scene killer. <br /> <br /> I still give this one. 9. In fact, a big movie - aside the defects.
