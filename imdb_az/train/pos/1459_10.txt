Amazing! Wow! Amazing! Wow! Amazing! Wow! After seeing MARDI GRAS, I did not see a documentary film about globalization. This film has zero narration and sensitive negotiations with 4 Chinese teenagers living in a factory. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. But most of their days and nights are from work, work, and work, but it is lightening and surprising to watch the images of their work. The owner of the Chinese factory is strangely clear that he is "damaging" the workers to the effects of globalization. Carnival, who has been steadily watching the Mardi Gras beads from China, shows how the film is reinforced by the global population and shows how interesting and compelling images both cultures have. One of the most interesting parts in the film is that mining workers and Mardi Gras are familiar with the culture of mining workers through pictures. Here, the full circle comes in and pictures can be a communication and transformation point. The film is not a matter of honesty, it does not blame anyone and allows everyone to come to the point of view. Finally, we - the audience - arrange the results of the film's complexity and globalization.
