Its typical melodrama, typical of its era (mid-1950s) and the corresponding matin√©e meal. Rock Hudson is always in love with everyone, plays a common stereotype, but when Giant is at a moderate level with his material and co-stars (Taylor & Dean), it's hard to imagine how difficult it is to be rich and happy in this movie. is not good enough. The devastating brother and brother (Robert Stack, co-starring in a drunken stupor, filming Dorothy Malone, a poorly-resorbed girl), ends the victim and takes Hudson Bacall - who does not have enough character in this section or The board, which is smart to get. Oscar Wilde, a good end to the happy and evil bad, is not an artistic meaning. But I was interested to read that the film was based on a true story that deserved the plot. Like other films of the period, homosexuality is also hidden from heterosexual point of view. Perhaps the movie will be re-established: Stack's character, if he hides homosexual senses to marry Mitch, is more or less rich. Todd Haynes is directed by the Circus at All The Heaven Allows, far from hell. Perhaps the Haynes Wind is written in the Wind and can give us a truly memorable movie.
