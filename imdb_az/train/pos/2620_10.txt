What is a pleasant surprise: Disney DTV (Direct Video) is ultimately good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy work that includes everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. Timon begins with them by following the original film and commenting until he complains, "We're not here yet". After a long battle, Timon and Pumbaa decided to explain the story to their audience. <br /> <br /> He says he's hoping for Disney. The majority of their direct video-capture was terrifying, and the story lines generally came in cash to make money. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: This explains the original story from a new perspective. Okay, it adds something like Timon comes in and talks with Pumba, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella have perfectly regained their friendship and friendship, which we have just mentioned in our first movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some pure movie parodies (including 'Good, Bad and Ugly' and 'Cool Hand Luke'), and full of funny memorable lines of script. Timo's mother, Timo, lives in trouble as Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") and Jerry Stiller Timon's somewhat bare Uncle Max. Matthew Broderick looks like Simba and his "teenage" scene reminded Ferris Bueller. <br /> <br /> Everyone, like Yoda-speaking Rafiki, works well in this movie, especially Robert Guillame (how do you write it?). <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is the perfect alternative for those who are tired of animation coding. 10/10
