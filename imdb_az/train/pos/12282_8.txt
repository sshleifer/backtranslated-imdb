First of all, I did not really like it, though. <br /> <br /> Love between Blanca and Pedro was well explained, and some actors were different from my imagination. <br /> <br /> Then I understood that if she was more loyal to her book, it would take five hours and it would be very tiring. I love it now because it's like I've portrayed my favorite characters. Clara is really like a living angel and the story of the story at the start of the film was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I have described him in a similar way that you do not just mourn for all things. Esteban finds enough. I have never liked his character, and although he was interested in it, I hated him more often when I hit Clara. As in the book, the latter is also the most interesting and there is a real history. <br /> <br /> The film is really good, especially this Latin American book. How famous are you, do not believe it?
