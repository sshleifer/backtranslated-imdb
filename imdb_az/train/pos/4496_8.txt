Just enjoyed this movie to put it. My interest and pleasure are not related to anything other than the subject itself. My mother and grandmother heard stories about how North Britain used the working class life and behaviors (as they did) and this is an interesting illustration that lends my words honestly. In particular, this paternalist who knows the best for his family when he challenges the paradigm, but the father who digests it. (Later, there has not changed!) <br /> <br /> People in the game are probably disappointed with the story, unless the story is easily transferred to various media. But in a sense, the movie is a historical document and I'm personally glad that it has just delivered a public phenomenon.
