I found this movie to be attractive. When I looked at the characters, I thought it was developing, and I took care of these people. This is part of a period that occurs during depression. A mother, who has been picked up for the city (for that reason), puts an ad on the paper for "hubby". Christopher Reeve plays an ex-con, going to the job seeking city. He is advertising and goes out to see him. She will hire her. I've been really scared because of my relationships, because it's easy to put myself on my shoes. Everything really happened. He needs his job and he does not apologize for it. And he needs his help, but does not want to get his upper hand. They dance because each one really needs them. Things begin to warm up until the big explosion. You can not spoil it by telling what happened. But the solution point is perfectly beautiful. When it came to life, I found it very convincing. I think this is one of the better "relationship" stories there. Perhaps the younger generation can not "pick up", but if you're over 40, I'm glad. If you love Christopher Rivi in ​​"The Time Together," you will love him as well.
