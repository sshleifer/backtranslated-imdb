It's like Murder, who is one of those shows that I sit in front of the television after a stressful day at school. Why? Because I truly love it, and it's no longer in the air. Dick Van Dyke is surprised by Dr. Mark Sloan, a doctor who has been dealing with murders with his son. He is a very unknown, but very supportive player, that is, his real life was joined by Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every series changed her hairstyle. I liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially liked Michael Tucci as Norman and was surprised as he suddenly stopped. This show is very fun with great entertaining stars, like Colombo, but I always giggle about something in every episode. As a result, a large series is two fingers and 10/10. Bethany Cox
