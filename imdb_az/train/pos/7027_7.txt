"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best music of all time, but very entertaining and accessible to many audiences. The original film, Dick Van Dyke, could have been great with signing up with the role of Broadway, but instead they looked in the field, so the film was very dissatisfied. This re-structure, which was released in ABC in 1995, is more loyal to the original script, and Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (with whom) starred this movie, choreographed this film. <br /> <br /> Jason Iskandar is a different kind of Dick Van Dyke, but is well-behaved like Albert (he started at the Musical Theater before Seinfeld's days). Vanessa Williams is perfect for Rose. <br /> <br /> Their work is great as Tyne Daly's role as Conrad Birdie (national role play), like Mae and Mark Kudisch. <br /> <br /> Without this movie, there is no problem. The main responsibility is China's Phillips. However, it looks attractive, just because the teens are Kim and looks too old. And George Wendt, as his father, is a little bland, throws up a number of "children" (staged a series of original cast members with Paul Lynde). <br /> <br /> But all this is a good movie that is worth the money.
