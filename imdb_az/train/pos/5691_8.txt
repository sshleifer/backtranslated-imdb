When I went to the theater for the first time, it was very interesting to see this movie, but I was not able to go around it. So, finally, he hit the shelves and I took him. We do not know exactly what to expect, drew a DVD to the player, was assassinated in an evening and pressed the game. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> bloody end. I was surprised to find that the film was focusing on real murders and previous events and investigations. From the very beginning a few showers of blood splattered walls and an actual show of murders towards the end, the film was little or little less than a great dialogue and an exciting show of great actors. Val Kilmer sells me as a watchdog porn star and even "nice, but it's all right", Bosworth was happy to wait (and just for his appearance) <br /> <br /> I personally felt the best I've mentioned in the movie aspect , the lack of clear evidence of crimes. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so the cruel bludgeoning apon could not see the fourth bed completely. In addition, the sound effects of these murders were far enough to strengthen my appetite. <br /> <br /> My only problem was Carrie Fischer's short look. The description of an extravagant person, I think, was a bit more than his appearance. Perhaps that person was really part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold, and for some reason, Fisher seemed a little "akward" in his description. <br /> <br /> Generally, a perfect movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
