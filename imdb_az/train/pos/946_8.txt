Since Christmas is developing over the years, concentrating on religious or secular traditions, it is time for people to behave in a better way. <br /> <br /> In the 19th century, an Ebenezer Scrooge in London passed merchant and money debt. <br /> <br /> If his nephew pointed to his son, Scrooge humbug feels all the things because he does not catch Christmas in any way. <br /> <br /> However, humanity in Scrooge was released a long time ago. She is in the difficult situation, as a 20th-century colleague, like Mr Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> However, as Charles Dickens said in this story, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we should not forget that sometimes we should not forget. England's social commentary of the 19th century was Oliver Twist. The characters in the movie are middle and lower. The peaks are a few peaks on Oliver Twist's street people, but are struggling to stay there. There is still no love for Bob Cratchit boy, who spread love and happiness home. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who has done a very good job in her life and just needs to be reminded, Ebenezer Scrooge said he still needed a call for the potential to do something good in the business. old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart took quite a lot of part in Scrooge's live performance and shooting game. But George C. Scott plays the old ant in this movie very well. His consistency, but with a sense of sadness, which has led us to radically change. <br /> <br /> Scott Scooge's great interpretations include Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, a beautiful man. <br /> <br /> Among the roles I support is David Warner's extravagant spirit of a delightful Christmas such as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, one of the 32 versions of A Christmas Carol has been archived and is the best.
