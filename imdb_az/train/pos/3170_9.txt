Writer / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones is directed for great work. It was after seeing his "Cross Eyed" feature film. Rarely, an independent film feels as good as it feels to me. The clever and skillfully-driven "Cross Eyed" protects from the beginning to the end. Adam Jones can not be a good name yet, but he will. If there were one or two "named actors" in this film, it would be part of a Box Office. In my opinion, if only one film distributor takes the time to work on this movie, there is still a chance made by the mainstream viewers. You will not be disappointed if you see where you are, wherever you are.
