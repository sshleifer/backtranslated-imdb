New York's dramaturg Michael Caine (like Sydney Bruhl) is 46 years old and fading fast; As the movie opens, Mr. Kaining's latest play on Broadway. TV reviewers have fun in Caine and she's drunk. Long Island railway line, Caine, Montauk, is not a residential area in East Hampton. Finally, coming home, Caine, unfortunately, comforted her by Diane Cannon (Myra), who was a heart failure. There, Caine and Ms. Cannon is a talk of a new game called "Deaththrap" written by Clifford "Cliff" Anderson (Hunky Young Christopher Reeve), one of Caine's old students. <br /> <br /> James Reevan's Deaththrap believes Caine is a trick to revive his career. <br /> <br /> "Trap Set A Wickedly Funny Who'll-Do-It is set for you." <br /> <br /> Long live Broadway hit by Ira Levin, run by Sidney Lumet, is far from the scene of the scene. The cast is pleasant, and the twist of the story is still weak. Something that does not work is that the curtain call has come to an end; Of course, he played better on the stage. "Deaththrap" is an entertaining movie to watch again; The performances have died - but so far, Reeve must be loyal to Salaam by smiling at Caine at East Hampton train station. The location is really not East Hampton, it looks like a windmill and pool. And very ballyhooed love scene shockingly intense. But the game was very good, even a gifted director could not destroy it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <
