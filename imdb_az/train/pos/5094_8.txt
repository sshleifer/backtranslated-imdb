If you are a purist, do not waste time - on the contrary, hold the hat and enjoy the adventure. I liked the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - ten times I saw it, but this movie is good, just different. I will not explain in detail the differences to spoil the film. Also, it's great to see Alison Doody again (I'm a great Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is as good as Quatermain, and he's a supporter. I found the quality of one of the trademarks of Hallmark Production, and this movie was no exception. Cinematography is beautiful and the score is perfect. If you are looking for fun, you will not be disappointed.
