1.) This movie was amazing! When I was in the city next to someone I grew up, I watched it! I went and saw the buildings in the story. Generally, I liked this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal's best! My favorite parts of science were fair and always with their father. They were very sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dreams, and his father was not looking at one another. This tag line is correct. "Sometimes a dream is bright enough to illuminate the sky." 2.) Although the filming was flawless, it could have been recorded in the 1950s. Dressing was accurate and their arguments were numerous. Do not hesitate to recommend this movie!
