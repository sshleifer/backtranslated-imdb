Stargate SG-1 turns out to be Stargate in 1994. I was very glad that they decided to expand the issue. The show goes from the first episode, retired Jack O'Neill, his ex-wife. Daniel must cross the gate again to meet Jackson. Through the first two episodes, we are facing Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who should not go over it, and there is a quiet, compassionate warrior, Teal'c, who fights against the wrong God. <br /> <br /> The main evil guys are called "Gouald", parasites that enter into one's brain, thus managing them and doing evil deeds. Any Gouald who has a great power is often considered the "Lord of the Rings". Gouald's warriors are called Jaffa in the house of parasitic Gouald's corpses if Gouald is included in a human brain. <br /> <br /> Through episodes, we explore a worm-hole, which rescues SG-1, Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam from other planets (called Stargate), and they meet new cultures or bad guys. . <br /> <br /> Some episodes are in the world, that is, they will not pass through the Memory gate once in the episode, and they are more involved in important earth issues. <br /> Over the years, you've seen a decrease in SG1 - the team is closely clad and the more characteristic story story line. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- Although this show is very good, do not pay attention to the fact that some of the events have the character always when it's over and over the last few years. But still the top notch science fiction!
