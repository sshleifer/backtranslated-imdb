If the movie "Men in the Networks" is not necessarily one of the funniest, at least I'm not the most funny, comedy movies ever! (and I was watching too much!) about the two men who wanted to be "white men" and then to stop an occupation from the ground. This is a parody of classic films such as "Black Men", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove." Everyone who says that this film is unhappy is something wrong with his head. There are tons of funny gags and jokes that can really hurt your mouth (and me too!). If you watch this movie on TV, you can watch it now - of course, you will not be disappointed!
