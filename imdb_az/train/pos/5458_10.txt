I liked this movie very much. I thought that the sound of the film was in real time and in any American history. There is always a woman who does what she needs to do to get out of the classroom. I feel that Lill's character is properly described and does not work better. The one thing I really liked was that it really was love. All the men who fell in love with him during the film, fell in love with him, gave him everything, and even lost his career. Until she met Cortland, she did not understand that these men were giving up everything for happiness. The end of his life was far from expected. I'll recommend this movie to mature audiences, so we can understand the content and subtraction of the movie and the structure.
