On September 2, I collect at least a few people at the TCM. Did you know that Hedy had to rename it in order to avoid being associated with this movie when it came to the United States? It was a big scandal and I was practically inaccurate by scenarios because I was originally released in the United States. I just saw a documentary about "bad women", but actresses in the pre-film censorship of the United States early in the 30s. They looked at me when they were farther away from Hedy's most "sensational" shots in Ecstasy. In fact, Hedy was positive innocent according to today's standards, and it was nice to see her early lifeless beauty. It was a nice, lyrical movie for listening. I liked it for what it was: a simple romance. I was watching it while celebrating it in an early nap. I would like to see the first version published in the United States for comparisons.
