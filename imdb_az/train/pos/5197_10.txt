This movie completely fled around the original Dolemite. There was a great deal in the movie. (Ernie Hudson alone did it and you know it! LOL) I acknowledge that this movie kills our first video assignment and plans to buy a DVD version as soon as possible! This movie has such attractive lines, it's indifferent! I am ashamed to say that I know the theme song is back and forth! I love the character of Jimmy Lynch and he won the best supporting actor at Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were not so ready! This is a random movie made of torn police, breasts, shades, bad edit, and, of course, martial arts. (It is 70 years old and we can say that everyone knows a kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and shown at night in the middle of the marathon at local theaters!
