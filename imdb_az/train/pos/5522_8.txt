Two parts of the party ... is not where the last film was released. As Steven Soderbergh is a part of a epic 4+ hour event, Che's two stories are described as classic "Rising" and "Fall" scenarios. In the second part, Che Guevara, leaving the position of a bureaucrat in Cuba and leaving a failed attempt at the Congo (only after being filmed), go to Bolivia to try and start another jungle style revolution. Undoubtedly, China is known to be a communist and revolutionary, and later on to be part of the Government of Bolivia, it is likely that Chain would later be an unhappy world, and, of course, Castro, <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Guevara is a man who has a lower morality of life than men, adulterers, strange mistakes, and closely related peasants It looks like mistaken errors with military power. But no matter how difficult it is, Guevara will not give it anyway. It can be an incredible power or a fatal defect - both of which may be - but if not completely complete then it is rolled like something more sympathetic. True, he killed, killed, and justified himself in all the way. Although it starts to work with the feeling of regret on the audience; <br /> <br /> Along with this, Soderberghin's narrative command is very strong, as the health of Guevara's health is the most memorable and enjoyable one this year, which has led to a shocking stabbing of a horse. Sometimes it is a bit embarrassing (understood from the big working time), and one or two scenes are completely strange (Matt Damon?), but these are small commitments. This is a straightforward color camera approach, which is almost purely a national-style battle, with great care for men in the group, as well as the Lord as Gevara as Lord and how the results fall from the final stage. And, as always, Del-Toro is approaching the embodiment of the game, at every stage, to every one who knows this man well, to be good and evil. In general, two parts of Che are an effective package: history, drama in a modest style, if the Chinese do not know it is good for the audience, or better, if they do not consider it high. It's special. 8.5 / 10
