Prix ​​de Beauté was put on the noise after a little later in Hollywood for a quiet silence. First, a silent French actress was freed with a dubbing soundtrack, speaking of Louise Brooks's lines, but silently released in Italy and other parts of Europe. Within the framework of the Tribeca Film Festival, I am lucky to see the perfect restoration of Cineteca di Bologna through Italy's silence. I have not seen the Talkie version yet, but I think I should consider the silent version more satisfying, because all the duplicate information is not correct (Louise Brooks speaks English, so no lips can be used) In addition, the movie is completely silent, and without the need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beauté explains the ability to visualize the exciting, creative camera work. Opening, quick-cut scenes of urban life and swimmers are instantaneous kinetic, splashing on a public beach. The film focuses on visual details such as visual details, clothing, cars, scenery and cats, torn photos, and stainless wristbands. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is, of course, responsible for releasing the film from darkness. If you see that, it is more heartwarming to reflect that he has played a last role. Stylishly beautiful, the film prefers its charisma and delivers a perfectly naturally, but highly conscious performance. His job here is more than just a well-known Pabst movie, a woman who can be fully understood and sincere. He plays Lucienne Garnier, a talisman who has a successful, immediately enjoying a life of beauty and a secret beauty contest. He then splits into the excitement of his glamorous new life and his love for a person who loses everything or loses everything. All the characters are drawn with nuances. She regrets her fiancé and is not simply rude: She loves Lucien, but she is a limited man who can not build another life with her or attract others to her. <br /> <br /> If the "other man" in her life is, her intentions may be as fiancés, although it's not a simple slimeball that we took her first time. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** WARNING: THE FOLLOWING AWARDS ************* <br /> <br /> There are many beautiful sets in the film, which shows Lucienne's victory at the Miss Europe competition, including the comic reactions of different audience members; slackening the color of his slider as he marks his time as a housewife, his torture, potatoes; Lucienne, Lucienne, who was depressed by her husband's wife and her husband's macro anecdote, was laughing at an entertaining exhibition (in a silent version, the film was delayed); and the final scene in the projection room, especially to carry his talkie screen test. Louise Brooks did not look much better than the shooting. The projector's lamp trembles in his alabaster profile, and his shoulders are covered with white fur, and his face is covered with a black helmet, as he sees on the screen. His graceful corpse, and his still unprecedented appearance on the screen, are particularly spectacular: Louiseen Brooks's description of Lucienne is immortal, even though she is removed from her frustrating movies.
