In 1975, I saw and watched this movie at the London Cinema. I found it fun. I liked his originality. <br /> <br /> In short, I once read a book called "The Black Hotel" and as film-fan I always like movies. Do you know, Kinda "adapts" them? <br/> <br/> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ div> </ span> </ span> <br / > <br /> <strong>> But then I thought, why? Of course, Sunday was never shown on television, but the movie, which shows the film, what is HARM, who knows what's in it? Iron, my civil liberties have been crushed here. One director needs to adapt the lyrical movie "Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In a perfect world, adult movies should be censored. But when I am sad, I can admit that this liberty can be harmless when I admit intellectuals, and who will not be rationalized to distinguish between fantasy and reality and who will always be attracted to hate <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's hard to see how La Bete is falling into this category. <br /> <br /> In the UK, the English censor took her away. <br /> <br /> Taking into account the theoretical theme of the film, he said that despite the '69 rest of nudity, any censorship passed, looking for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> There was an alternative in those days. G.L.C. <br /> <br /> This was just a local council council with a department that was authorized to film for London. He was more "sopistic" than the people who lived in the bar when the audience was counted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But then the "board" consisted of only four people - three voices, one "chair". One of the daytime voters was ill. So the remaining two voters and chairpersons sat down to see La Bete. <br /> <br /> One of the voters was cheerful and hard to encourage the movie by any person like me. There was no other imagination and just considered the piece disgusting. The chairman of the court did not understand this, so FREEDOM decided to make a mistake. <br /> <br /> When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they also considered it abominable, but it was too late! The film received the "X-London" certificate and made a mixed reaction. G.L.C. movie censorship panel soon dissolved! So La Bete opened in London just named the best FLUKE! But I'm glad. GREAT! If you have not seen this, do so. This is a FANTASY and therefore less concerned than what you see today in the news ...
