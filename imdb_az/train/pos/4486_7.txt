SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon that has a perfect idea and almost every short cut. I want to say that this is definitely lower than the other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, you will not be able to hate this animated film. Of course, it is possible to say that this is one of the worst episodes of Tom and Jerry episodes, and I can say that I agree, but the point is that Tom and Jerry episodes are all great and better than others. Yes, it would fit "others". <br /> <br /> Here's the Fraidy Cats area. Tom is listening to the old scary radio broadcaster and easily frightening. Jerry is watching how he is scared and tries to frighten him more. He creates a scary argument for Tom, and Tom is afraid of his thoughts and lives. Jerry then puts a layer over an electric vacuum cleaner and controls it, thus making a ghost look like a vacuum. Tom Jerry did all this and followed him. Tom then accidentally bitten the house servant. However, Jerry was scared after seeing his referee in his trophy until the end. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is far from the best Tom and Jerry, but it's still a fun and entertaining piece. It seems to me that there are such cartoons. These rods and gags, making Tom and Jerry popular, are as good as it was in a short time, but some of them were missing. I felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. Anyway, this is not a good shortcut that does not live up to another Tom and Jerry cartoons, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> 7/10
