This is a crime because of not doing "another teenage movie" for school. After the war with each other and with each other, they laughed all the way into two groups of gangs. It's a comic comedy, using open jokes and gags that drive me all the way. In my opinion, the biggest gate of the whole movie was that he never left the traps that had been trapped in the 1930s.
