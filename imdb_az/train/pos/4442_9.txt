Ogre is a television movie made in Italy and Lamberto Bava recalls in an interview with Sheirk Show DVD, but was not Demons to participate as Demons III demons. Demons and Demons 2 were music of 80's rock music, which was more creepy music and the first two were scary horror. Demons III: Ogre is an architectural horror, so is not a good result for Demons III Demons, but still as in this movie. <br /> <br /> Music is creepy and adds tone to the castle, which is why the movie is set up, something else that Ogre likes. There are two films classified as Demons III - Black Demons (Demoni 3) and the Church (Demons 3). Demons III: It's a good movie if you do not compare with Ogre Demons and Demons 2.
