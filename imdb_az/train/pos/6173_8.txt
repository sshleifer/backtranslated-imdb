Great movie. The player - from the doctor to the sidewalk, was very nice, except for very little prostitution; I thought it was best to have very clever (mrs.noble) and less known actors in vrajesh hirjee (saurabh). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many other things, <strong> He said the Caucasus lived in peace, prayers and small circles. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of a wall that turned into a khanate and then decomposed, and philosophical artists accepted it. <br /> <br /> It's good to see good movies on Hindi topics.
