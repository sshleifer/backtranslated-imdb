Critics do not know why she threw this movie out. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a bit scary - I'm not usually going to Horror Movies! I even had to do my own evil to see the day. I should not worry! ;) (The movie was full of children, heh!) ... Liam was always as great as it was. I liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The special and sound effects were awesome. I liked the music honey, especially for Eleanor, to get rid of the delicate tunes and children, to grow from his calm everyday life and his life, and eventually gained strength, peace, and freedom.
