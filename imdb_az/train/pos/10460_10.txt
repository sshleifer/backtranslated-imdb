It was a good movie with a strong message of love and joy. I liked the transformation of my brother and the consequences of his horrible illness on his family. Well-behaved and well-directed. If there were any shortcomings, I had to say that the story again reflected the typical suburban family and their troubles. What can be said about all the people who have all the cultural roots? I would like to see a film showing all cultures - as in real life. Nevertheless, the film has grown in terms of its values ​​and its understanding of how one of the illnesses will bring it to its own producer. I loved the movie and brought tears to my eyes
