I enjoyed every moment of this wonderful movie and I was interested in this woman who never heard before. So I started investigating my life and future. As expected, I learned that the film was historically not accurate. But for some reason, I was a little disappointed with the negative comments about the film. Come on, kids are not a movie and should not be a biography (or a novel). Any historical film breaks the reality because it must be a work of art. A film director is entirely entitled to use elements from the reality and history to create a complete world. Artemisia is a beautiful movie, and I think many people (some of those who now have negative comments) have come to explore the life and work of this curious artist.
