Rock 'n' Roll High School has become one of the best films ever! I think it's just awful because it's Ramone! You did not make the same movie, and you could not get a Sex Pistol, or Clash instead of Ramones, and that would not be the same. Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the hall monsters were added to the movie only. All movies about Ramones ... especially Joey! So, if everyone would see Rock 'n' Roll High School, a great admirer of real PUNKs. Ugly is not new shit ... but high and fast type. This kind of can only make Ramones. RIP (Recreation in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
