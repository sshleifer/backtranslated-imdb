Jean Renoir's first film, Activism Whirlpool, originally drives us to the world of the world, the rivers, the villager's life to continue to explore, only his second film, most of the rich and privileged, those who want to throw higher grades and ways. Put together the symbols of the first two films and have great seeds of "Grand Illusion" and "Rules of the Game." Although this beautifully-shot film is often shot with unobtrusive cameras full of strangely large flats and loungers that favor the interior of the movie, Werner Krauss offers some beautiful moments from Muffat. But first and foremost, the glamorous and sensual lady Ms. Hessling, who appears to be able to pay for the money in the vampire, does not exceed the description of the selfish whore. Perhaps this is partly a problem with scenarios focused primarily on high points and angry emotions; So far, differences between Nana's suitors are well-drawn, and I especially like the relationship between Muffat. and Jean Angelo Vandeuvres - like Vandeuvres's story at the bottom of a great staircase by Muffat, the last fate and loyalty to one another, that tragedy concepts and violence would emerge. br> <br /> <br /> This film about the past is still valuable for Renoir fans and those who are generally interested in silent cinema.
