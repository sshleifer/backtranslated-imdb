This is an amazing movie. I can not remember the last time I've seen a decent Swedish movie. It's funny, this tragic, part of the attractive and, most importantly, small town of Sweden. It blocks and deepens the clich√©s. <br /> <br /> A great city girl went through her roots to her little old town to celebrate her 70th birthday. People who have not met for several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a fresh approach. Story center is a relationship between the three sisters (at various stages of life), not too close. Otherwise, at least they do not understand how close they are. <br /> <br /> In this film, one of the main reasons why people connect with each other is clean. First of all, I'm delighted that in this film, the Swedish players called "A-list" are definitely not in question. Usually, there are several actors in Sweden who have access to almost every major product. This time, the production company has really succeeded in keeping it up with the actors who love their profession. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Dialogue is more convincing and Compared to last year's or two Swedish films, it's ahead of the millions. Maria Blom controls everything since the beginning, and if you do not know, you will not guess that this movie will be the first to write a lengthy movie. <br /> <br /> When you begin to see him, you really want to see him.
