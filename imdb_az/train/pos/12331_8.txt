Before I'm the third person in the five best-timed movies of all time, and I'm the one who likes this student's movie parody, I think I should not defend this movie in the face of prejudice. This short but sweet legend always knows that those who are still a jazz love genius fear and science fiction film marathons have become a crowd-pleaser yet to get a very serious zombie movie. This film is not a genuine insult, not an insult. It's going to be funny and I'm calling on others and I'm happy that it's agreeing with me. Especially for those who do NOT see 50+ times. Look at the director Komeo as news reporter Jeff Drexel and if you have the opportunity, keep his Alien parody, Loaf.
