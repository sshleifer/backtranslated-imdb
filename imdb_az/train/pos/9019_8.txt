I do not want to give anything here, but I would say that the technically perfect, immaculately moving and encouraging reel will reward the audience with an excellent hour and half entertainment: it's funny, surprising, and sometimes embarrassed, and almost in no time clich√©s or unpredictable, inevitable but uncertain, stands in the heart as it approaches. <br /> <br /> The first user's comment is from 10 to 8 of the movie and 10 to 10 for outstanding performances by Branagh and Bonham-Carter - totally agree.
