David Zucker led one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this delightful fancy. Yes, the taste of the taste and the sophomoric gags depend on the richness of it, but it is continuously funny, unlike some recent comedy efforts. You will need to pay attention to everything you film or miss them. Humor flies nearly every second, as previous attempts, including "Aircraft!", "Superior Hidden" and "Naked Gun". There are many unexpected moments, and it's easy to see a few plain people. What makes this movie different from other critical imitations in the genre genre is this true storyline. While others may depend on entertaining many famous scenes in almost random movies ("Mafia!"), This movie tells a new story with likable characters. This is generally the case with sports films, as well as not lamping specific films to sell the real sports industry. Even the leading actors of natural chemistry make a good pair of people for those who are not interested in the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. The film also utilizes collections of hilarious composers with athletes, sports speakers and other celebrities, especially Robert Stack, "Unresolved Mysteries." By the way, go for a recent joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All this, Zucker, perhaps, appealed to the film's sports blend and made a home call.
