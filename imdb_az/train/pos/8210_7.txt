Clint Eastwood remembers his role as Dirty Harry. This time, in a case of a vigilante (Sondra Locke) who killed people who were raping himself and his brother in Carnival many years ago. Eastwood's complaint is that his role and film are largely ignored after more action. The immediate impact is really entertaining fun.
