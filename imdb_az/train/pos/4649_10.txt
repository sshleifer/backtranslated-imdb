This first installment of Crispin Glover's personal magnet opens a little thought and can not be recommended for any audience who does not want to sit on Glover's drawings and do not want to be puzzled or surprisingly simple, but strangely obfuscated? The subject of the Prophet. To a more casual spectator, it is likely that, for the sake of the look, it will be astonishing, ridiculous, as strange, astonishing and disturbing imagery. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> Glover's case and its work the desires of nature and the views of the audience are discussed in detail through the unusual question-and-answer sessions that respond to the following questions; <br /> <br /> The easiest way to interpret and release a movie is to describe it as Dada or Nihilist, a young teenager in the modern film industry. as well as acting actor. But before the show of the film Glover has a reason to perform a slide show and not just sell books; books are similar to each other, and Glover talks about the images and texts that are united and what is it? Something similar to images shot from western culture. <br /> <br /> What is this? She is a sweetheart and an attractive way to watch in a difficult way. There is much to do with the use of Gowderin Down's syndrome, and is one of the most striking aspect of the movie. In fact, many are just a type of direct use of the handicapped, whether to see a more realistic and / or dignified description of the disability of film and television or to the other end of the spectrum. But this is perhaps part of the film that is very disturbing for many: the agenda is not political or hatred, but an outsider of foreign culture. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie about Down's syndrome, but it's also a movie belonging to actors with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> I look like ugly and strange, so beautiful that it is beautiful; For me, luckily, what exactly is this? to the audience. Glover uses snails, stranglebacks, and deadly images because he wants his viewers to feel anxious about the cries of an anthropomorphized snail, or the visual reactions. In some cases, what is this? Unusual (and sometimes obvious grotesque) elements? Would I like to recall the work of Francis Bacon, artist? unhappy prophets, yes, unequivocally unequivocally strange and distorted looking people who want to look. As with Bacon drawings, Glover's film is directed to being rich and modest, grains and polished, chaotic and well-executed? and contradictions help to make it even more sensitive. But it's still not a serious movie, and it manages to avoid the biggest traps of claiming using humor that comes from the use of (and later) items, pictures and names that are largely familiar. popular culture. And when? <br /> <br /> Generally, what is it? as a director and writer, is an impressive first movie, and his involvement as an actor in the movie is not an issue that he will not expect. Tracking is not exactly good or bad in a dream, but is it a strange observer? and when you wake up, it creates a sense of awe. Here is your favorite art, what is this? you have to overcome your great expectations and be proud of your efforts to keep you in the theater with the great Slide Show. All of this is a practice that you are most likely to forget at any time.
