Ilona Tasuiyev, a geneticist and researcher at Avalon. <br /> <br /> Karas, Ilona and Bislane are less well-known than SIN CITY, but have been praised by a better movie and more. The French comic will be more meaningful to those who need it (I have enriched my French comic book last week, even though I'm not up to date). Atmosphere, music, symbols, lines, plot is all beautiful and lovely. A Parisian top police officer, Karas, is being shown to find a young woman with a rising star of medical genetic research. Illa Tashuev was a soft, blond blonde that used her hot brother Bislane. <br /> For me, is an old miracle of comic and television series, RENAISSANCE, a beautiful cartoon, like WILD WILD WEST episode repetition? Here the mythologically replaced the ancient mythological future. and blas√© but as a thrilling sense. NOT to be updated nor look good especially; but it's cheating and hypnotic.

On the other hand, this cartoon breathes an edge of more public air, a flat adventure, and in a word SIN CITY is good for kids, naughtier kids say, 'because there is a little nudity on the screen. According to what I have said, these features are characteristic of the appearance and common places of the growing comics of futurists; quite true and old Miller has shown these things and RENAISSANCE was here and there some similarities. Now every RING needs to be ERAGORN, so every city of sin is its renaissance. I know these horrible futuristic legends, quite a few extraordinary specialties.
