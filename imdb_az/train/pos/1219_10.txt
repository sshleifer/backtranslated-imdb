Second Care Bears is far better than the film's predecessor. A deeper field, a better character development, and melodies (in particular the closing song) are both tempting and warm. We believe the film is caused by stress, but be sure that a Care Bears movie. This movie is a beautiful picture to show to kids, because it is friendly, loving, and still caring. Care Bears does not mean just a very charming word!
