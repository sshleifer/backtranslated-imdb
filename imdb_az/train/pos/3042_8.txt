The film has been postponed to October 20, 1944. Here we are part of the great Philippine "I'll be back". General MacArthur was on the coast of Leyte, where he had fame? <br /> <br /> First of all, Gregory Peck won the image of the great general? This step is a set of shoulders, intensity? Both are common: intensity, total absorption, fidelity? Was it for the military with MacArthur? Was there a toy problem with Peck? The Oscars nomination for The Kingdom of Keys, The Yearling, Gentleman's Agreement and Oscar Prize for The Twelve O'Clock High, is for the movie The Kill The Mockinbird. Amnesiak who intimidated a crusader journalist; from a troubled armed warrior to an obsessed attorney; Captain Horatio Hornblower from biblical David? Has he brought all the subtleness, character, sincerity, warmth, and love he has, and especially his humor? <br /> <br /> "MacArthur" has a scene that stands on the deck with the president of the Philippines. We can listen to the dialogue: "Generally, I hope the water is not too deep," says the President, "because I can not swim my people". Then Peck's voice came: "I will not be able to walk on my people!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur," Peck justified a giant element in the film industry again? Through it, we felt the feelings of MacArthur: we knew his anger, his happiness, and we understood his relationship with the whole family?
