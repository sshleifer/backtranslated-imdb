I really do not expect much from this movie, but it's not bad; it was really good. This movie included a few funniest writing bits I've seen from my movie. Now I'm one of the most funny movies of all time, but in some parts I laughed very loudly. "The police said they had committed suicide because of my father's death, and said a lift had hit a bullet." Now this movie is not for everyone but most stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hate these movies, I would probably recommend the steering wheel. Generally, this was a delightful movie about the subsequent superhero wannabes, which eventually turned into real heroes. A lot of people are still unbelievable comedy, because it's expected to be trash before seeing me. After seeing this movie, I finally realized why this movie collected this superstar breakdown with Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and even a good burger. The Mystery Man is from 10 to 7 comedy writing cycles. A great surprise.
