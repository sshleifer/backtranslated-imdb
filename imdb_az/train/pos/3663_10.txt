Perhaps, his latest film, Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (from his novel). There is indeed an oxymoron, a neorealist fantasy. An elderly woman finds a baby in her cabbage trunk and boosts her as her own son. After a few years the baby is a baby (called Toto) and the adoptive mother dies. She goes to an orphanage and leaves after 18 years of age. She immediately finds out that she does not have a home. Toto is optimistic, though nothing can get him. Instead of getting rid of a luggage, a man loses a suitcase, and Toto becomes his wife and goes on with a small khan. Toto takes some initiatives and builds many homeless in the area and creates something better. Soon, landowners are trying to sell this land, and citizens of Shantaya should protect themselves. After many attempts, the hostess closed the police force to save the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a complete fantasy (previously a comedy / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). These things are very strange and shocking that others see for themselves. It's pretty nice and very funny. Certainly there are protests that can not be raised about the miracle area in Milan. Fellini and Visconti were very critical when they started to move away from Neo-Nealism. I think that after my release I have been criticized extensively. At this point, though, it is very nice - I loved it. Although Umberto D and Bicycle Thieves are very close, Vittorio de Sica's films can be mentioned. 10/10.
