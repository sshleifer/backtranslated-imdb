DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit movies - it's still an interesting movie about suicide, and it has reasons and effects. Those who want or use NEKROMANTI movies or SCHRAMM style will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely a "craft house" style film, so it should not be applied to the line, a story to be explained ... <br /> <br /> The main concept of DER TODESKY is an episode for him <br /> < br /> Every day of the week, a strange chain returning around the letter appears to cause suicide, slowly integrating with scenes of corpses ... <br /> <br /> There are many good and thoughtful provocative scenes, life talked to his wife with "problems" and, unfortunately, lost some of my power because I'm laughing in a unique group on the stage ...). But serious - it's sometimes nice (the scene that shows the various angles of this great bridge is especially effective - especially if you understand the importance of the scene, and those names are actually suicidal by jumping from the bridge) sometimes foolishness, sometimes foolishness (SS horny SHE WOLF pretty entertaining), sometimes harrowing especially when she was in the park on a boy-speaking girl in the park about her active spouse), because many of these "art" movies are meant to be "fun" and then just fun. Still, I could not find DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIQ or SCHRAMM, and I would probably even have my "level of pleasure" compared to NEKROMANTIQ 2. Absolute value for any Buttgereit or admirer of "art". If you get these types of movies - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion, I saw the BEST art house / horror movie. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
