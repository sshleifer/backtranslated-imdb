This is a very heartwarming and very well thought-out drama. I was not impressed not only for the plot and perfect operation in the film, but a unique movie. Most of the films related to a spy or a war are full of Britons or a big battle, but this is not. This is not a war, it will not forget anything about a person's state of life and his position in life, as an American spy in Germany, as no one is a bad person. After the end of the war, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but the true heroic position should remain the secret of government. While returning to America, Campell also met with Nazi supporters, as well as speaker hateful, both intrinsic and exciting conflicts. Nolte pulls out of this role and works well for what he wants.
