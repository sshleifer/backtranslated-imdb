The only reason I did not give these 10 stars was the DVD format - menus, additions, etc. Functions, additions, etc. If you want to do something with your life, this movie is for you. Do not allow anyone or anything to stop you if you believe in yourself and your dreams. This is one of the most vital films I've ever seen. And magic. Acting is perfect, the plot serves purpose, and the sequence of opening is fantastic. This is one of the movies used for the "cult" status. I have recommended this movie to all my friends. Someone loves it, some of them finish it. If I think or feel it, I think that something is impossible, I think Alan Wall's role in this film. Of course, I would like to shoot more films.
