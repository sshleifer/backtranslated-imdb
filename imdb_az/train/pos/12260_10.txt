This is a good start to Mickey Rooney's film career. His talents show that a long career is ahead of him. Car and truck tracks are interesting for the year 1937. The beginning of this series of Andy Hardy is my American treasure in my book. Spring Byington's performance is always as superior. Please contact Mr. Rooney or film rights holders, get a chance and get production on DVD. I think it will be a winner.
