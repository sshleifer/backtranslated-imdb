Nick and Kelly are ready to get married, but Travis (Kelly's dog) takes Nickny Kelly to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon. Richard Burgh and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelli and make a good pair. Nick likes to drink, smoke, and play pool with fun guys, but Nick suddenly avoids such entertainment. Sex is something that a child loves because he wants. We find that an alien race needs to be interbreed with women from the Earth to die and save their population. It's a battle to stay alive among the people and the aliens that populate the dog. Beautiful movie.
