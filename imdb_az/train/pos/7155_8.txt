Not just a "children's movie", but the "Holes" tell us how past events affect us today, or we know them. When Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where she has to win all day, she finds many things about her camp and personal relationship. Through Flashbacks, we understand that many things are better (when you see the movie you will better understand it). LeBoeuf, like other cast members, is doing a pretty good job: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.
