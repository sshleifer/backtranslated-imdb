Paramount, the '34 'took all the stops for the scene adaptation: Mitch Leisen, a big budget, a big shooting, exaggerated production and director. What's going on? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for the same fake rock and murderous mystery he did not deserve to be the same trash, the worst Charlie Chan pushed the first street. Since the Great Duke Ellington number is a fatal birth, I have to believe that this breaks out of Leisey's hand, but this does not mean that it is not worth the eye: the idea of ​​a "Sweet Marihuana" with superfluous chorus girls is a horizontally thought-provoking code, There is Toby Wing (unfortunately, unhappy feeding terrifying lines and playing prototype straight blonde) as a hot choir for you. Carl Brisson's actress is as soft as Melba Toast, but she is an authoritative singer. MacLaglen is a stereotypical horrific detective, reaching new highlands. And look at the chorus Lucy. This interest is 7.0 percent. Think again in February 2010: I recently gave a different look to the movie and now feel I'm wrong about canceling the deficiency of Busby Berkeley production numbers. We can understand Leisen's argument for more real production numbers in the context of the field. However, there are still big problems with editing. Paramount, the city's largest studio, faced the most difficult time of production history, financially producing code, and produced all stops on this subject (went into search of Beauty in 1934). You need to see pre-coded enthusiasts.
