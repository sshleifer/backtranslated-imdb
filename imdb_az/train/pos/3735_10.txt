The Truth about the Employment Camp in America, prepared by young men for the Vietnam War. When it comes to war movies, human research has always appealed to me because the warfare, the individual, the subjective thoughts, the warlike movements of the movement and the technical information are analyzed for the prejudice of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The film has been trying to put a new spin on an ancient theme and goes away from ordinary war movies, especially with anti-heroine, from the point of view of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozzin, who escapes from the human warfare machine, and refuses to give up control of his destiny, and refuses to fight for something that he does not believe, he spends energy to seek ways to prevent it, and sends himself abroad for himself and his friends, he finds only one reason for the war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> Acting is truly exceptional and a documentary-style shot almost feels like a movie. Also, the film will provide nutrition for ordinary war movies or for those who are mobilized for war games enthusiasts, hoping that the generation of a generation that has escaped terror is a wake up.
