Rainer Werner is the best of 43 films prepared by Fassbinder; at least the most successful. <br /> <br /> After World War II, he was one of the leading leaders in Germany. <br /> <br /> With Hannah Shiggle, Maria Bruan, who lost her robbery, lost her husband's war, had found her after taking the American soldier, as a lover, after losing her to prison, and eventually found her painful. <br /> <br /> This is life. Things have gone and gone, and you will do your best. You can give up or adjust your thinking. <br /> <br /> Maria made her think and stopped her love for Hermann, even though she needed to do so. This ended the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Perfect drama.
