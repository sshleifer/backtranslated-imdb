Claire Denis's debut is both brave and self-confident. This description of the French colonial Cameroon's life explores the relationship between black and white men and women. <br /> <br /> The black servant enters the taboo area from the beginning, as the main object of the film "Prot√©e". Denis builds a life-style through a series of character-catching relationships that keep the informant audience stabilized. <br /> <br /> The mood of the movie was sufficiently captured by camera work and lighting. <br /> <br /> A great conversation.
