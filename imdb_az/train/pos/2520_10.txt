Despite what others have said (* cough *), this is the most beloved film of all time. I do not know how long he waits to see it, but once I finally did, I immediately fell in love. Of course, it is strange, but it gives a more enjoyable flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of Gackt's and Hyde's first films. They did nothing, maybe 3 or 4 each. So give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not good at first. I believe that they throw some unusual situations there, but I'm looking at the best points of this film, the emotions and the neutron displayed. That's why I've given it and I'll always give this movie 10 to 10.
