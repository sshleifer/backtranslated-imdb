For all Swedish speakers: This original Swiss name; "RÃ¥narna" turns into something in the "Gull's" line. This fact is the main problem with me, because there is actually nothing about robbers. About a young woman working to investigate the Swedish genocide. You would think of a regular workout, but this girl often gets into the field, taking her hands, tells the story, even throws one of the robbers ... Exactly: we've done it before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> it is true that the actors are quite large and can not be surpassed, and the director really thrills the excitement as the story is the most. /> <br /> It is a fact that I really love this movie, that music is a true mood when it is needed, but it does not have the rest of the time, which gives a great deal of film shooting and truth. the car ride along the film has spread. A nice touch! Michael Persbrandt, as often as you know, is one of the few Swedish actors who are often prone to typecasted, just as you know that the hero's friend will not play in the background and will not support in the background, but that's something <br /> <br /> Generally, is an entertaining movie that stole more money. 7/10
