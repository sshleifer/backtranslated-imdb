Shenanigans though I'm the biggest fan of wirework-based martial arts films when I'm going straight to a tele-fantasy, getting more fun from me and being one of the best in this movie fantasy plot and crazy flying point. Ching Siu Tung has done a wonderful treat here with a beautiful beauty and a beautiful beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung remains in a late-night temple and plays the hero of a tax collector, dealing with a bewitching spirit and unreasonable Taoist. Cheungs's performance is full of naive but respectable charm, and Wu Ma is a good impression from the wall as the Taoist monk who shows some swords and even receives a musical number. Perhaps the best way Joey Wang, as a spirit of fox, really enjoys a charming, charming action with every action and gesture. The film draws on fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all together into a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung gives a series of neat telegrams to direct and manage choreography and floods the movie with mystical shadows and delights in the neat forest colors, giving each forest scene a beautiful charming atmosphere. At the same time, if I'm not mistaken, because Joey Wang's hair is like a feline ears, sometimes it's a perfect touch, with sensitive hair stylings and feminine characters perfectly flowing. Even though the film has been relatively inadequate and sometimes ill-fated cheese pop songs, it's a fun piece of fun, with swollen characters and cunning. . An ethereal treasure is highly recommended.
