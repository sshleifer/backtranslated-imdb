Amicus is a classic, intelligent 'four-fifty' little bit with a classic proposition, strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) by producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffellin ('Far Pavillions' Despite the low budget, which results in 'non-exclusive effects', it delivers all stylish performances. In addition, the most important contribution is the 7-year-old Chloe Franks, who has made her part of the blood cool. For a film that has been dropped off by the film's distributors, it's a film that has been released unreasonably for a strange film 'blood' on a 'bold' shock movie, for those who appreciate a little bit of horror.
