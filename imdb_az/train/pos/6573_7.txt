The film is part of a very beginning game - so I think the movie will give you a better shape, because the set and dramatization movie looks a bit more artificial. But it is still very well done and the story and especially the dialogue is interesting. They fully understood the dialogue as true play. Perhaps this is a good introduction to Shov's works. <br /> <br /> The main character Raina has head and dramatic flair in the clouds, and Helena Bonham Carter actor is doing a good job here. His fiancee is very caricaturized when Serges is really a very good surprise figure. His parents enjoy a lot of fun.
