When I first saw this movie, I remember being a child, it was my first horror film (perhaps I can remember some of it). I do not remember much about toy, drum scenes or anything else, but I remembered a boy who was bursting with a grenade, flipped on a tree and fled under a truck :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). Jennifer McAllister, I remember the last scene when the killer came out of the stomach to get the truck's keys. It's a scattering film and looks like an eye. But where do I find? How do I download?
