Firstly; I am an admirer of modesty and since I was a kid I read novels and found previous films that were dissatisfied with our hero, but where it failed, this is a ROCKS! <br /> <br /> No, then we go here: Mrs. Blaise works for a casino, a bunch of robbers comes and gambles on the lives of her friends. If a robber wins a round, he should tell him about it. One of the members of the squad is free if he earns twice a succession. <br /> <br /> She tells her that she is helping her in a war zone, without a parent or a spouse, that the elderly and refugee in the refugee camp live in accord with her own rules of nature. They are caught for food and he teaches them to read and fight. <br /> <br /> When they get closer to civilization, they stay in the war and are fired because they are taken to the rebellions, and the old man leaves to meet the city. <br /> <br /> Then he talks to the man who works in the casino, where the story ends. <br /> <br /> Please note that there is an awesome battle and the line is absolutely cool. Alexandra Staden TERRIFIC a modesty Blaise! <br /> <br /> In some cases, it remains as an actual, respectful, comic and comical comedy. to speak loudly, but of course, there should be some accent. (Everyone speaks English in Balkan language is strange.) <br /> <br /> Acting is really good, and praise for the young Blaise praise! <br /> <br /> My favorite thing should be the place where she is wearing her robes to hit the donkey's donkey! Completely awesome! : D I will not wait until the real adventure begins at the next movie! <br /> <br /> Watch, you're frustrated!
