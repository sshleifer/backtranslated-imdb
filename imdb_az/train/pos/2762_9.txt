This movie is part of my favorite celaloid. I really need or want to say here. Maybe this is a neat, funny, and heartwarming story about you, "Watch this movie" and "Enjoy Daniel and Pascal's excellent work!" On the "Eighth day - Spend your day"! <br /> <br /> When I saw this film, my eighth day = serious thought to how I spent my life! As you can see, some of us think we should do valuable times. Either he likes his career or just plays TV shows and top games. The reason we miss this is to make sure something else is happening - making a difference. About self-esteem and time and time to live - NOW! (the eighth day) ... At least I had the 'Eighth Day' from me.
