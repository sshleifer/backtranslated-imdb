Some thirty years ago, the author Numa Sadul published a book length interview with Belgian comic book writer Georges Remi (like Herge, the creator of the Tintin). Recalling his music, Sadulla is taking this movie today, and we listen to the cassettes (Herge died in 1983) and sees the appearance of several old photographs and people. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book by Herge's request, and we know that because of one of his employees (who will be a second wife a few years later), he leaves his wife. . An interesting thing about the movie is that Tintin's books were turned into a fairly anti-imperialist book after several years in the books of the first right-wing and imperialist books (Congo Tintin, Tintin, Soviet land). Blue Lotus). Generally, this movie has a few things about Herge and I have not seen it a bit more difficult when I come to the theater.
