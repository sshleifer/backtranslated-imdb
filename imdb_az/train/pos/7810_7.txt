What is "Cry Freedom"? It's just a great and unique experience of building South Africa and repressing black people in the country by white people. The main character of the story is the editor-in-chief of South Africa's Daily Dispatch, Donald Woods (Kevin Klin). Woods writes several critical articles about Steve Biko's (Denzel Washington) ideas. Soon, Woods talks to Biko and changes his ideas about him, and he begins to understand what he has done to black peoples in South Africa (and even from the chief of police). When Biko died at a police jail, Woods decided that he should write a book about him and not to publish what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Attenborough has succeeded in making a good film with people, but in order to get published, it is necessary to escape from the country and put his family in the second place. black and white is the same message as we are all human beings. The story leads us to South Africa and this is a great way to learn what's happening around the world, and I was disappointed that only 3,200 people rated this movie. This is a movie that we all can learn. Although it was a little longer, this story could not have been shorter because the filmmaker wanted to show how difficult the book was for Woods after the death of Boxing. <br /> <br /> Also, relationships between Woods and Biko have been shown to be as big as the families of the two nations and all their problems. Sometimes it should be sacrificed (Biko's death), so the truth can be explained (Woods book).
