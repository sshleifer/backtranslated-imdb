I'm not surprised that Soderberger's pressure on Cuban, despite the advance of the schedule, was premature. Reading only a few statistics does not plan to reach the younger audience. Still, it's a part of the woods, especially when it crosses the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro to interpret Che Guevara's identity. And Castro, Bitch's actor also did a great job. Obviously, Soderbergh does not look at these people, but we will not defend his work until he is far away from the past. Some of the more important historical sources are contrary to what I read. In my opinion, Castro did not sue the Soviet Union until his attempts to accept the US were exhausted. However, in other respects, it also refers to the looting of foreigners, especially as the other rebel insurgents took control of the island. The treasury of the country was empty.
