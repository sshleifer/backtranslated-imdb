I do not know how glad she is about this movie, but when I first saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a great admirer of Paul Winfield and war dramas, but wondered how and when Winfield's child can be found. She knows that her son has green eyes. Actually, I have not seen this movie for many years, and for some time I did not show it on television, but this movie is a man's odyssey after war. Winfield reflects a very sympathetic and heart warmth of a person who has lost his memory. This film contains a key message that explores the reality of human morality in the post-war era and the reality that they encounter. Why this movie is still a DVD or video is not a secret for me.
