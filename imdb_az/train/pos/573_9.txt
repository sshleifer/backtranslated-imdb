I always liked the movies that describe life as always. Life is sometimes dull patches, no real space, and definitely a happy ending. "A Point of This Sea" is a perfect name for this movie (and Norman Maclean's novel). <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot of things to the film. In his narration, the picture has a perfect friend. As a director, it is free and quiet and attracts amazingly beautiful scenes. As for the players, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work as strangely as brothers. I will not be able to explain the performances of Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn, but I feel the truth. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8.6 years
