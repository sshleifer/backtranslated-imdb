A comedy gem. Horrible moments, shops and pub scenes were funny, and they controlled me uncontrollably. Heroes are well-known and the dialogue is well-watched - I know such people! The humor was strikingly subtle and memorable with the movie Ealing Comedy (which may sound strange). It is a very interesting film. Of course, there are some ideas. I have looked a few times (I have shown all my friends) several times, and every time I heard something new - a part of the dialogue, something I did not choose before. I can be really selective and find some drawbacks in the film, but it's a very funny movie because it really likes anyone who has a watch and a sense of humor. This is a movie that will find his friends and I hope there are many. Oh .... and it's a great soundtrack.
