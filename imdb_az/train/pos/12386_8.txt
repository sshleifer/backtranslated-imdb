'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best film scripts ever made in the film industry! I think it is very intimidating as very little movie. Alison Parker is a model that has some reputation. He is a lawyer named Michael Lerman and he has another best friend, Jennifer. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it was wonderful to live alone and to rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many guests are very strange Suddenly, Alison begins to experience health problems and frequently fades away; He recalls a number of painful facts about his past, that he has nightmares or illusions. But there is one reason why everything is connected to the new home he lives in. <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm the 'The Sentinel' creepy movie and 'The Exorcist'. They're two of the scary movies they've been watching. When Alison's house was invaded by a priest and discovered that he was frozen! It's a terrible thing to see that monsters need to be blind in the end of the film to become a new screenplay to get away from our world.
