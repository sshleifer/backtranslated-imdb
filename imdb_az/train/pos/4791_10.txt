Could a movie about a man who lived a few hundred miles in the grass to see his brother, perhaps a good movie? Of course, I did not. I knew I knew what to expect: one of the most boring experiences in my life. <br /> <br /> Because I'm one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood movies to make a short break, I'm still not wrong. Straight Story is not too difficult. To lend a visit to an old and stubborn man, to fix his lawn mower, and to hear that there is a heavy sting on his brother to another country. It is already special, but it is even more special that he had not seen his brother a couple of days ago. At the same time, he has a share of failures and problems, but meets many people who, in a way or in a way, influence the philosophical approach to life. <br /> <br /> Your spouses will not be able to look at each other. <br /> <br /> That's why, as in this movie, I'm not telling if these people are not a heart or something ... This movie does not have an embarrassing scene of action, like a lawn mower slowly driving, You do not have to watch for good noise, because there is nothing. But why should I watch it? Yes, it's a simple answer story. I have never seen such a touch screen with such a powerful story and it really makes it even more special to Hollywood and to make things better - from the Disney Studio (this is sugar sweet nonsense). I am not ashamed to admit my eyes in the eyes of my eyes several times, but for a few years, a situation I have never seen before is very realistic to me. <br /> Some people will claim that this story is a very subtle, but I do not agree with reality. Probably the only old man looks at the driver on a grass-grass and does not want to think more. This is because you know that you are closer to the one you understand, just because of his dignity, and he wants to see it all, so they will not make the same mistake. If this is not deep enough, why should a story go deeper later? <br /> <br /> I also want to add that this movie really existed. Some nice landscapes (finally the American movie showing something other than New York, Chicago, or any other city's skyline), Richard Farnsworth, some of the coolest movies imagined by Sissy Spacek ... and this is a David Lynch movie. Now I know that this film would not be my taste. It's one of the best films I've ever seen. This movie hit my heart and the bull's eyes. I'll give you a full 10/10.
