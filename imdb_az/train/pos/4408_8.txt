In the previous films, 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'Ice Storm', a Taiwanese director, Ang Lee, has become the American Civil War for its last character. <br /> <br /> Based on a novel written by Daniel Woodrell, Northern Ireland comes after the use of a group of Southern guerrillas struggling against the jayhawkers in the Gulf of Missouri. There are many visceral moves, but the war focuses on the tension placed on young men entering the war - many of them have fought against their former neighbors and even their families. Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) was such a man, or more precisely, the boy, when the fight reached Missia only seventeen. He is a German immigrant son, but instead of pursuing an interlocutor and forming a trade union, he comes with his lifelong friend Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and goes with bushwhackers. Although his surname and unarmed Union were not accepted due to the fact that he did not want to participate in the killing of men, he remained loyal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> In favor of action and this is part of the film's war reality - is to enter among those who are fierce fighters in long-term weaknesses and expectations. According to the secretary general of the Caucasian Muslims Office, Hosni Mubarak, High and progressive Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, It's especially cold as a bloody killer, and Skeet Ulrich is very gratifying and arrogant. Lee never runs away from the reality of war, but his actors are doing a decent job of showing good-by-heartedness - increased friendships, courageous demonstrations and, more broadly, the freedom of the oppressed peoples. Ride is a beautiful and deeply compassionate movie with a constant shock to Satan, but always the audience.
