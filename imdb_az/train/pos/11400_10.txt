<br /> <br /> I wrote quotes from original banners, but I was sure that the comments on the front page of this movie should be answered. it's the "comments" index, and it's not a message board (although we used it before adding the IMDb movie clip board), it was good to take it into account, so I'll edit it to make it unnecessary. <br /> Yes, you know it first, but Gene Kelly plays Pal Joey in Broadway originally in his original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin "panorama", he wanted Kelly to be more complex than the two best shoes she had played in most films (except for For Me and My Gal). . Alan Jay Lerner instructed to create a new story in Paris on the basis of the story of Pal Joey. Kelly Warners gave her a chance to play Broadway's famous role even though she left MGM for her "Pal Joey" rights. In my opinion, the WB film "Pal Joey" became an accident, though it was appropriate for the role of Sinatra, but other problems drowned the movie (script changes and poor direction) ============== == =================================== <br /> <br /> You are complaining about Kelly's pictures even the art is not something you have to prove to your point of view. But do not waste your time worrying about Kelly's bad art, and that this story is a must. Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even though Milo knows it is almost as sweet as her. But it's important for the audience to sit there, but it's a great artist. Therefore, we want the audience to be fully aware of their shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then he sabots his interests in the show, he refuses to feel himself gigolo and because he knows he is not really ready for the show. The enthusiasm for the exhibition is, of course, not as great as Joey's enthusiasm to "start a night club". However, it serves the same functionality in the field. It should not be forgotten that Joey is important at the Pal Joey game after he understands that he does not deserve a night club. It's the same as an art show. If Kelly's paintings are really good, this can be reduced to all points. ================================================== <br /> <br /> Then Caron and Kelly have no chemistry. I think it's in the eyes of the scandal. But I agree that it is not as strong as chemistry among them, but it was good for me. Comparing with even worse "binding" romances, as in "The Pride and the Passion", among Cary Grant and Sophia Loren. ================================================== == <br /> <br /> He says that the great dance philosophy has nothing to do with this film, and that he is not dragged into the symbolism of the film under the surface of the film. Many elements in the dance sequence are associated with stories and characters and are dictated through plot pictures and symbolism through dance. About love, love, and losing love (looking around and lovingly). The movement of the symphony reflects a separate stage of the Paris Art and a separate stage of each of the dance areas. If you see that you do not see it, it's not a mistake. This, of course, is not a "burden of burden." ==================================================
