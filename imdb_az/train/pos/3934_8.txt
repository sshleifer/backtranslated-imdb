Young Mr Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most respected figures in American history. Henry Fonda was a difficult task to describe the mythical figure and at the same time enough to care for people. Perhaps the best performance of actors. See how he stopped, lonching-mob.Alice Brady alone. Alice Brady's a simple farmer's role is fantastic. The last part of the film is played in the courtroom and there is only one negative thing about this movie. The referee is given a very unpleasant line of scandals, which gives a great deal of confidence to the characters before the audience. But humor is a Ford trademark. Parts that are supported by Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
