It's hard to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress must be spectacular and imperious, on the other hand, she should be weak in a difficult situation, and almost all the films about heroes are the basis of this basic trick. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is quite brilliant as Victoria, but not as complete as she wants, and has no fault for her. I do not feel like adapting Mills & Boon novels compared to another darker, more dramatic film about another young queen Elizabeth. Thus, Blunt knows that queenly is not the gamut of emotions, at least not exactly because she is young Victoria. Check Mrs. Brown to see Old Victoria. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice for the movie. He is extremely exemplary and brings it to glory, by C.R.Z.Z.Z. It was a very different movie, but I remember this beautiful appearance, and it's probably a major similarity between the two films. However, Vallee C.R.A.Z.Y. It was a Julian Fellowes when writing, and although I really love Gosford Park, the story of this movie was less interesting. Soon I lost all government policies. Maybe it was less busy because the monarchy had no potential interruption. I simply say.
