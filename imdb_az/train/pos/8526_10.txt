I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! He is not just an incredible actor, but he is beautiful in a beautiful body! He did a great job in delivering his lines, and made George better than Fraser. Great performance for his first big roll! This movie is full of cheerful scenes that every child loves. From the day we went to DVD, we watched our children many times. In addition to the movie, the extras on DVD are entertaining. These two fingers! I highly recommend to everyone!
