Greetings from the darkness again. What a relief ... really exciting tension! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Toy Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominated this wonderful little classic tension tension screen when the famous hero film director Wes Craven ("Scream" movies and "Nightmare on Elm Street"). Craven owns even one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What this makes a job, is the reality of the first 15-20 minutes, because we see McAdams interacts with 4 or 5 people. person or phone. He is natural. When it comes to Cillian Murphy ("Batman Begins" Korkut), as it is seen in the incident, the film actually begins to fly. If the audience knows something is bad, it's amazing how to shoot a movie with two yuppie-type flirting! Air travel frequencies accelerate and 30-minute accuracy is excessive claustrophobic. Craven values ​​us as someone else's presence, and if someone is saved, he will remain. <br /> <br /> As a lot of excitement, the lamb turns into a superhero, only in hostility. An interesting plot device leads us to believe that little Rachel needs a proper pent-up disorder to see it, but we can not help, but we're a little smashed. Most scenic scenes include a strange guest of the hotel, an angry airline passer, Cillian's injury, and the hotel's FX. The film's strength is the potential for development and psychological games. Unfortunately, Brian Cox is a nice screen gadget, but in general, it's a top average voltage tension that's worth seeing for the finale of everything.
