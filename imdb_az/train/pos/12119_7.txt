Today, actresses are happily gaining weight, painting their hair, wearing slobs and losing their charm. Bette Davis was probably an actress who started on the train. <br /> <br /> Davis was sometimes ready to revive itself to create a character from outside and inside, like a young woman with costume designs and Constance Bennett-like makeup. <br /> <br /> She is definitely in the "Human Bondage" here, uniting with stars like Leslie Howard and Philip Carey. Davis plays Howard's masochistic, club-footed Philip, a mild, manipulative, greedy, low-life, Mildred. He meets with a waitress and he allows him to dine and dance while shouting at a large elderly man (Alan Hale Sr.). Mildred was thrown into the truth by Philip's club foot. He also seems to Philip open his flirtation and enjoy his abuse of cool against him. He allows a financially landed lover among the lovers who abandoned him when he beat her, some pretty women in Mildre (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee). <br /> <br /> Mildred threw her out and pushes her away, forcing her back to school and losing her place of residence. <br /> <br /> It looks like the "Human Deportation" seems very visible today. Although Leslie Howard is a beautiful actor and seductive, his way of life is a more formal school, and eventually he is prone to history. Like the role of Davis, he can use the type "The Petrified Forest". His historic player is even more evident here, because Davis has created a new place with a flawed, strange performance he could actually name. Moreover, sometimes he appeared from the top, and he had to go out of the stage, and the inclinations of the film would have come to him later. Compare this performance with Henriette's tranquility, warmth, and subtlety, accompanied by "All This and Paradise Too" or "Dark Victory". He was a true actress and a true artist. Davis really looks like a hell of hell; <br /> <br /> Mildred's deterioration is completely miserable, because Philip seems to be gaining strength as his spirit goes down. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to see the Burqoom of one of the greatest stars of the movie.
