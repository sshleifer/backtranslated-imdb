Indeed, I have never seen a couple of episodes of Roda and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. <br /> <br /> Mary returns to work. <P style = "text-align: justify; Rose gives a chance to become a comedian ... Rhoda is fighting a photography career and Meredith ... what else does it do? These three stories, which last longer than two hours, <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Last few I've seen Moore and Harper in other films, and I thought it was very good, but I did not know that this team was working well.Jeie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their role well, but they do not do it when they make their share to perform the title of this movie. everything is great, like Yunus, Cecile and .... <br /> <br /> When this comes together, either I would still expect this show to be an admirer of the show, and I have come to this little one from the non-fan, and good story lines for each character and two main characters make this movie very good. (The new version of the MTM theme does not hurt either.)
