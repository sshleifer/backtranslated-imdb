... but above all I enjoyed this show. I've been reading some of the comments that the reviewers have to say about this show and I'm having a hard day breaking all of my criticisms (except one: the show was old, this program was nothing but stale). Many things about the show are related to money: pretentious; forced; deliberately; hopeless for attention; he was pleased; anger story story. But what do you know? I really liked it. It was different, the original was really TRIED; and all the minuses were created. The show was brilliant, verbally, fast, virtuoso, interesting, entertaining ... You know, once a week, I could take it once a week and wait for it. I'm gonna get sick of her. But I do not think anyone will bring it to life.
