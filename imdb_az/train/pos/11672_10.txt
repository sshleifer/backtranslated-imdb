Excellent pirate entertainment! There are all good ingredients to draw attention - a fraudulent cunning pirate, called the Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), who has led the secret mission to the upcoming Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn - <br /> <br /> Mildred plays the role that Natvik's very familiar face plays as a supporter of her young daughter Patma (Alice Kelley), Mrs. MacGregor. <br /> <br /> Ships, ships,. Sword-fighting clashes, ship fights, and Errol Flynn (Robin Hood boat ships' bold jumps). Once in an interview with Maureen O'Hara from the flaming red one, I heard that he had a great command in the whale and could go to Flynn in the sword battle in those days, but there is no need to put the test here. <br /> <br /> Very happy movie.
