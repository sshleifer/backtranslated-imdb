I have a two-year-old son suffering from the same situation as Jonny Kennedy. He did not have the chance to meet him, but I never heard anyone say bad things about him. Now I hope that this program will help companionship by extending awareness of this terrible situation. This person touched people in a way that millions of people could not make a charity bulletin. I believe that this should be a must-have in schools. I agree with other comments - why am I involved? He took everything that he could take on life and still had a sense of humor. God bless. She could not watch the piece that showed her changing her clothes. I have enough trouble with my son.
