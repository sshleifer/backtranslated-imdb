Read Eric again. He described this movie better than I knew better. <br /> <br /> I've been watching television many years ago, I think, I think. This is a unique film about avoiding comparisons. It was shot in Northern Mexico, in a desperate, bad region of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is really a very open and wild place, not Sedona, Durango, Mexico (not from John Wayne). I need to find my novel to check the story's original location. Like the place, this film is unusual for everyone and is wild and beautiful and strange. <br /> <br /> It's almost the kind of production that motivates me to study the film. <br /> <br /> I really did not forget this movie and would not be deleted. Probably for many years I forgot his existence. I know anyone who sees it and never reads it. Erendira had such an unusual name, even forgetting the title. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If the above-mentioned article is a great admirer of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and I regret not reading it before, I will continue to receive one copy. <br /> <br /> Compared to the following MsMyth commentary; The film was shot in Mexico, but the author was Colombian and did not comment in Mexico and Mexico in any way, though Marquez lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. Do you like the movie? You need to read the story and then read everything that Garcia Marquz wrote. And, in the meantime, the first place in the story was Colombia.
