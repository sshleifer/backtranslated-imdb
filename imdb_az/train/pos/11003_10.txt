Listen, I do not care what anyone is saying, because Cypher is less than a 5 star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat, film B. Cypher is definitely a work. Almost I know the world's best spy movies, and this movie is less than the top flight. I can not say how extraordinary this film is. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever made and designed. In this film has exceeded the horizons of technology extensions. In fact, I must admit that Cypher has completely surprised me with hell. In fact, I have recommended this movie more than any of my colleagues. Some critics have shattered some films, and they have no idea what hell is talking about. Do not listen to the prison. And in fact, in most cases, Cypher reviews have been very positive. It should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie, but also a fantastic movie. Cypher is a kind of film that is so sophisticated and magnificent that it is the focus of most critics and all kinetics. There was nothing related to Cypher. Again, movies, backgrounds, technology, stories and players are all 100% world-class tops. Of course, I will not give you anything. This is not spoiler. Despite the controversy of several critics who have to be in the Cyprus cinemas, I believe in the contrary. The Cypher movie is a DVD movie that is not just a DVD and is not a bad thing. Cypher can be the biggest underground spy flick to hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan Run, Jason Bourne, and Impostor, and Deja Vu ... See! Cypher earns the same amount of AONN Multimedia Research, a 5-star Eternal Spy Film Festival. Cypher is definitely against it. Hands down and hats off. There is nothing as it can be seen, and it is even more strange than reality. The future is now.
