I love it for my last personal experience. Ideas that everyone is free and everything is finite. The heroes of the firm did not really love their "real" life, but they enjoyed what they themselves did. The film did a good job while doing a good memory on this simple day. A good memory refers not only to romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but also to a profound discussion of the values ​​of life. Many movies are the subject of discussion of life or love or relationships or problems that exist in life or of a kind of debate. Sunrise pauses the viewer and regulates his breath before continuing to do it, and continues watching the film. Sunrise did not try to give you a special idea before. It encouraged you to think about some issues in your daily life and gave you some alternative options. He made interesting conversations between the characters, just typical crying complaints or foolish ideas. You are still thinking about these issues for yourself and you will be interested in the next line of the story. The latter result was not significant. You can have something and you can feel good or positive about yourself after the movie. I like the movies. It is a pleasant movie and worth the time to watch. I am also a visitor. The film represented some of my kind and answered some of my questions.
