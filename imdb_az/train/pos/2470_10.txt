After the initial shock of Mr. Branagh's courage to shoot this film, I was shocked by the excitement of this epic mood. I'm not disappointed. So Shakespeare is still accessible. That's my opinion. I always love to see or love to hear, Branagh and me were great ... this film called in other countries? It can be painted on a mustache in Mona Lisa.
