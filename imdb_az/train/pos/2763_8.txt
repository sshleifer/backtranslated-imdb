People complain about the number of films about people with mental disabilities. I do not see it as a kind of criticism, not a lot of movies about any human. Jaco van Dormael is doing a fine job with script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne, Duquenne, work perfectly with the player who plays. The film surprises a surprisingly large number of events and does not favor the work done in the "Rain Man". <br /> <br /> <strong>
