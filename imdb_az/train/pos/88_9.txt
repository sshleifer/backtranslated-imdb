It was one of the best films I've ever seen. The film is about real life and how big the drugs will play. Although this movie was produced from a low budget, I found it to be exciting to watch it. <br /> <br /> Someone does not like the story and can say that the scenario is not direction. However, when these individuals enter deep medicines as a symbol, there is no direction in life. <br /> <br /> This film clearly expresses what can happen to a person if he faces extreme desires. <br /> <br /> Most of the pumps are newcomers to the industry. But all of them were very good. Everyone was well-behaved and adapted to the character. <br /> <br /> I think that this film was loved and used when dealing with a person or drugs, and spiraling came out of control. This movie can scare them just enough to change their way.
