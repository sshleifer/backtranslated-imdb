Updated from previous comment. Great and unfounded, Marion Davies shows her beautiful comedy in the late silent comedy (1928), which shows the beautiful William Haines. Davies plays a toy from Georgia, crashed by Haines, a little player in the treacherous comedy of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Marion's "cheap" comedies are "discovered" and a dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A large lamp in Hollywood and its claims. Davies & Haines is a wonderful team and Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you should see it) is a hoot. For any serious film buff or for anyone interested in Marion Davies still unjust! Dell Henderson plays his father. Polly Moran is a servant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Rally is a slimy leading person. <br /> <br /> PERSONNEL BOOK MAINTENANCE Giorgi Swanson's model (near Mae Murray) is thinking. Davies and Swanson were friends. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is parallel to Swanson's real Mack Sennett comedy Charlie Chaplin's shoots at the age of 20 and early 20's in STAR for Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> Davies and Haines are great MGM stars and friends. Perhaps, the MGM has never discussed them. Together adults! Early Hollywood sweet romance and unpleasant parody. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are celebrated, but they do not appear.
