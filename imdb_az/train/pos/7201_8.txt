A dramatic comedy about a playwright is trying to figure out how to keep his head on the water after escaping ideas. Without a story, I can not say a lot about this movie. Imagine that it looks like you are taking a picture. Everyone has their own agenda. Finally a nice surprise - after all the other surprises. Well written by everyone's good performances.
