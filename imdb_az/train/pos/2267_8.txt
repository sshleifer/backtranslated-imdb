I have not read the novel or something else of Kurt Vonnegut, but now I plan to start. It takes you from the first frame and does not allow the latter to begin spreading. All the plot is interesting when you're not looking for places you do not expect. Pacing is a stain, nothing will last long, and it's a perfect job of balancing between unexpected curves and allowing the viewer to work on what we see. Well spoken and well thought out. I have never seen a movie that I can not compare this movie. Strong and excited, but also funny and sad. The point is perfect, Nolte is completely illuminated, Goodman proves that she does not have to laugh, Lee and Arkin are awesome. I can continue, really ... can not play any role. Editing and cinematography are wonderful, and all vision is great with a few memorable and surprising ones. I'm going to the other two films that Keith Gordon directed, as well as the other two books that are related to the author of the book. There is a scene of sexuality and it has content that is very uncomfortable and disturbed. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates it; not welcome. 8/10
