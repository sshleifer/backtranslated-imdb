Here are a few story lines interwoven around the different female characters. The shoes he has been wearing serve as an indicator of their troubled lives. All this changes at the end of the movie. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; Her daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) has a delayed and limited life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer who has problems and loses her husband; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) lost her husband and now gives birth to an old friend who has died. Isabel (Angela Molina) is a rich lady. <br /> <br /> Other symbols are used to connect five main women's characters. Not everything starts in the story: Some relationships are surprisingly delayed and adds to the experience. The subject of the shoe causes creeps: Leire, for example, when she works as a shoe designer and shoes shoes, she breaks one of her heels. <br /> <br /> Makes small relationships between scenes. Phone rings, cigarette burn, a song, etc., to connect and fast cut. Is used. Frequent change of the story line protects it from digging or reaching TV levels. Strong music and sound tone and atmosphere. Madrid and Lisbon cities serve as the basis for stories and shooting of these cities is used to remove the story from the symbol. One of the more moving shoots, Anita, who rides the same day every day, expands her walks and limits her life to a richer way than the relative quietness of her street: the restriction of the place is well-prepared for visualization. Like many Spanish films, many storytelling are just as simple as a simple soap-like storytelling. <br /> <br /> Ramón Salazar lasts a long time in love with her material because she has a romantic and sentimental poetic end. Some scenes include kitsch and soap, including acting (Adele's love life, Isabelle's doctor). The shoe theme is inflated and has a weak metaphor. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is unique. But they are different. Magnolia is technically enough, but somewhat mechanic. This gives you more opportunity to turn emotionally and atmospheric visibility. Once you see this, you have to immediately switch to the new movie city: Madrid.
