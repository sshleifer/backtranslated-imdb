I'm tired of the people who filmed the "historic accuracy". PRIZE LIFE! The writers and directors need to put their spin on the story! There is a series of films that are completely inaccurate with history .... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, New York Gangs, Geronimo: American legend, the end of Mohicans .... all the fantastic movies are inaccurate in terms of history. If you want to see what some of the great actors do, do not worry about seeing this movie and accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality, story and the greatest actor of our time.
