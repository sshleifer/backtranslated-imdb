Do you have to hold the hand of a ladder down the stairs? Do others eat your meal before you eat? Are you facing a mother? This film is one of the few obstacles that young Victoria is dealing with with this movie (including various ongoing power struggles, as well as attempts at her life). <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is a very interesting and informative point of view. <br /> <br /> I first met the devil's Emily Blunt-i Prada (and somewhat differently). He is here again, as in the film. I was amazed at the description of young Victoria and understood her role very well. At the beginning of the film, she passes to the young Viktoria, where Victoria meets Victoria and then becomes completely convincing. Blunt plays a perfect role, showing all the different sides (from the young Victoria, who is sensitive, strong, mistaken for the Queen who controls it). This role is not enough about Emily Blunt. He is quite simply - gentle, commanding every second attention on the screen. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Actors have a wonderful chemistry and you are fully convinced of the development relationships. They have differences, but you can understand with love. They are perfect on every stage where Blunt and Friend, Victoria and Albert are interested and share what's happening. Other actors in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson City Duchess, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy, and Jim Broadbent as King William. This movie does not have a bad performance. People with less focus are well-illustrated with small screen duration. Even Victoria's dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel called Stone) is really memorable and influences the film. <br /> <br /> Although the film does not go beyond a few aspects of Victorian life - especially in the end, explains what happened between us and Albert, and most importantly, what we really see. This is a film about "Young Victoria" (not "Medieval Victoria", "Old Victoria"). <br /> <br /> Although decorated with decorations on the history of the film, this is why it has been put in place - explains the story of how the young prince came to power. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt has the ability to see suits, and adds only music to music, never protecting it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> -> Extremely drawn and today, in contrast with many films, this movie is a really good length because it does not work for a long time and if you're losing interest, Emily Blunt says how beautiful this movie is. This is a very important / historical role that an actress who raises this movie, leaving a great performance, giving it a beautiful shape. This is a well-prepared movie, which is definitely perfect. If you appreciate an extremely important woman in history, this is not a vision.
