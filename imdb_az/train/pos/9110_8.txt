You know? Our soul is based on the revolution, asleep ... I can explain, I think! Well ... Until April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have freedom of speech, but when we were in the revolution, the Portuguese seemed to have lost their opinions, freedom of speech! All this is a result of the revolution! I do not know what it is ... About the movie ... There are some mistakes for the actions of some characters, but it's as good as I used to watch Portuguese films! I love so much!
