When I first saw it to be honest, I did not like this movie very much. But for this reason, I did not see the problem in a theater. Great mistake! Because # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger and # 2 cinematography. Try this movie to see the biggest TV possible and a great sound system. Music is good and puts the film at a high level (and commercial potential). <br /> <br /> This is one of Reny Harle's best films. This man knows about moving. Die Hard 2, long kiss happiness and so on. And it is particularly good in this movie. The special effect is great and magnificent. Stallon really should get the film back. It's good to see him!
