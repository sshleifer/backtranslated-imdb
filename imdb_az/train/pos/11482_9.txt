This film is shot mainly on the camera held by the players. In some cases, a video clip from the killers is another kind of cheating, because of the Kolumbin style attack. This movie does not answer all the great questions, though it gives you an idea of ​​how easy it is to get away. Through the film, actors have been shown to shoot illegal weapons, to lay bombs and create an action plan for "Zero Day". Actors (you can say) were brilliant, obviously borrowed more than their own lives, but I'm actually moving them on any stage (Tom Cruise should do something). At the end of the CCTV and 911 operator, it was genius, but I'm sure we need the latest scene? Despite being a very good movie on a very difficult topic.
