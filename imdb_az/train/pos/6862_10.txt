When people ask me why they love such films, I usually reply: "Did you see the De Palma's Art Gallery in the Kill's Apparate?" Only one scene represents everything I want to see in a movie. If I were the director of a movie, it would be something I wanted to do. "Pure cinema" is a way to explain this sequence and it is truly amazing to see how the director De Palma works on the scene at the same high artistic speed. A dream movie is clever as hell, and comes in many movies with a richer and more intelligent mind. In my opinion, the film always raises an important point that will be the subject of a hot debate: Can a movie be only equipped with a technique and still be an artistic achievement? The film has no message to talk about, it is good to move, but it is in style and the script is short of logic. De Palma's film is a really good situation, stating that it can maintain a feature-length movie while working properly. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, and Keith Gordon perform superbly, but this is the director's film all the way to fadeout. Sensational demonstration of film partner opportunities. I can not say what Hitchcock is like in the film (I do not want to be surprised), but I think it overstrips the story of De Palma's story and she is able to create a movie that summarizes her career. Not for the sake of the soul!
