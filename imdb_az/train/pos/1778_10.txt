I just want to say that someone was happy to beat the beans in this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This is a ridiculous difference in filmmaking. Especially a student film! I just want to give a credit to Spazz to show the absurd amount to find such a rare photo, and then comment on the İTKI! Most people I know do not give such a time, especially when reading less. Kudos is your secret! In any case, the movie is at least incredible and just a silly watchful storyline. I understand the idea of ​​Charlie's Angels to create a satire, but why such ignorant actresses work! Also, the director also tells which director is acting, writing, producing and editing! Choose a job and put the whole person on this person! This is a shame because I've heard that a killer pulls a good movie about a toothbrush. Nevertheless, thanks to Spazz, the people like you are a unique result in this movie to retrieve the curtain.
