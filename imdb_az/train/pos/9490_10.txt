This was the first time I watched the movie eighty, but these thrillers, which are now reviewed, are still relevant. Some new films pay attention to similar topics, but they do not fit into the French stage. <br /> <br /> A president - open JF Kennedy - an open car during public appearance. The resulting large-scale investigation found guilty of the movie Lee Harvey Oswald, but one member of the jury insisted on more research. Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK, a movie with the same film - it does not play with emotion, but it's an interesting description of a conspiracy and all together a new picture of the conspiracy that shows how fit. This disclosure is used even for a real psychological test. Compared to JFK, this film is more reasonable, intelligent, and exciting. The pieces of the site can be found in many new films, and sometimes there is some kind of deja vu in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "I ... comme Icare" is a "must see". Its uniquely bright and beautiful by Ennio Morricone. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a very good ranking if Hollywood production is quite popular. <br /> <br />
