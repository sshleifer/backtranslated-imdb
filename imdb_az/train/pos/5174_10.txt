I drink this movie and drink it every weekend. Every aspect of human emotions is literally magic, with players, script, direction, and common feelings of this movie. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that is actually drowning, saddening, and feeling a sense of each piece that comes from the finest work! We need more like this !!!
