As filmmakers prepare and distribute their DVDs, you should not expect much of a disc like Broken. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the most important thing is that James Cameron comes with enough additions to surprise the DVD and is a really good presentation. In the latter case, Broken comes from a non-anamorphic transfer. Otherwise, we will get the film in the original 1.85: 1, we will not show any technical defects and look for much as expected. <br /> <br /> Ferrari can bring these discs together and, if you take into account their hand, can provide such a truth. <br /> The same thing is true for the soundtrack. Here we are proposing both DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​blends as well as the fact that Ferrari should not be involved in both vehicles or at low levels when I am indefinable because I am considered a "real". Indeed, although the DD5.1 ​​account uses more atmosphere-based experience, both are equivocal and have no technical deficiencies. <br /> <br /> As for the extras, the disk is positively drowned. See the sidebar on the right side of the screen, and see many comments, features, and loads of different galleries. Indeed, considering the method that causes everything to split, not just the accumulation of everything in a long time, it is hard to really discuss it. For example, the "Stunt's anatomy" almost claims, and the same part refers to the remaining parts. So, we cover a large part of Broken's pre-production, production and post-production. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that it has become one of the many countries in the United States. The numbers are probably desirable for any discussion. However, there are weather predictable for each conversation path. An event involving actors is very cunning and does not take the film seriously. Ferrari's numbers are incredibly enthusiastic about everything. And the technical ones are good, extremely technical. Of course, there is a crossover we encounter in other locations, but within just 19 minutes, none of these sections will be welcome. Indeed, all this is a nice extra package.
