This should be a movie while trying to capture the essence of truth. The film has rarely a strange overtone, it feels like a dream sequence, and actually transforms you into a dark, exciting memory. The kids were extremely convincing and I'm waiting for some things to come in the future. I'm very naturally interested in this kind of young people, and I know that Bill has done it well or only well, but at least it's good. What does Bill say that he is concerned about me and what KevNJeffin said about the bad behavior of Mr Paxton? In my opinion, he played a very good role. It comes from saying that Hamlet is good (Ethan Hawke Version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. Great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable? Cinematography is also superior to the average rating.
