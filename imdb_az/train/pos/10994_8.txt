This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I watched all of this overnight on television. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a B movie for 5 minutes, but later I realized what a beautiful product it was. <br /> <br /> I suggested some of my friends watch the movie, but I just said it was a bad movie. How wrong is it? Surface Criticism. <br /> <br /> I think film is a genius product! The famous director has done a great job here, and it's a shame to say that he is out of play at this time.
