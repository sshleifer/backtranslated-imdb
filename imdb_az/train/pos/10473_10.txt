When I see this movie for the first time, I'm in a bad part of my mind. For some reason, it corresponds to all my levels, the tension in a family, the companionship, and the desire of someone who wants to share your life. Someone to share your life did not hurt that it was a beautiful girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also took money for this movie (it was very difficult to get). I hope you love and will go to the DV one day
