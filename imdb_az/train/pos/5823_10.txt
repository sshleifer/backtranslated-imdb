There are good stooges in Micro Phonies. In a short time, the trio is a recording studio worker. They watch Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) performing their summer voices. The sound is incredible. Dragons are heard by Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls Curly Cucaracha. The three stooges will go to the party, which causes them to wear the drift. They play a record of spring sounds and go well until the Moe Curly scores record. Baritone uses the lucia shop until they recognize them and cancel them. Alice Van Doren screams the boy and hides behind a veil to help them. Baritone is good enough to find Alice behind this curtain without reading the cord without the help of a phonograph. Three stooges are found for fraud, but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and she agrees that she must be a singer. Stooq goes out of the room. Excellent.
