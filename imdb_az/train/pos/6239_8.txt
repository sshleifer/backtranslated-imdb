A film / documentary about a variety of people in Austria at the hottest weekend in August. That is what they do and maybe they do not. This temp is very calm ...... so you have to rest ....... breathe ... breathe before you see ... <br /> First think .... but no there is nothing wrong with it and you get a little angry about it .. because the film's mood and the really beautiful public pictures that are beautiful in this movie ...... ... many people will say its disgusting ...... but its not bad ... I think it's used for more marketing .... and there are some really funny moments ... peeling an old 60 woman ..... I'm providing the most stereotyped striptease in film history ... ... the movie that is actually ... I think this word is literally ... .... and a little scary.no computer manipulation is here ..... its real life ... and we all know the movie as sick things when it comes to reality you can win ...... ... because it is very bad in the real world ....... <br /> <br /> If If you are right from the film, you will begin to look at your neighbors and maybe ... they may be filming ... I have lots of betting there ...... sick ... crazy people living with a beautiful facade ........ after watching the movie, I feel more interested in it <br /> <br /> Perhaps you should not see this movie at the first date ........
