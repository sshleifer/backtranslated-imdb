It's definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. The first time I saw it was 9 or 10 years old. I started looking at the aggression some time ago. When I saw it was really shocked, "What is a movie movie?". Today I've seen it before and really realized how big this movie really is. It's strange, scary, shocking and uncomfortable. But the best thing is that it is the ending that the viewer will convey to the rest of his life the characters of this practice. We will torture their conscientious objectors and worry about the bodies found in this river for the rest of their lives. And there is nothing that can do about it, there is something to live with. This latest film is one of the happiest moments of film history and is very smart, bright and horrifying. And acting is particularly great in John Voight and Burt Reynolds. This film has a great deal of activity. All this, John Boorman, created one of the best films in film history based on Dick Chaney's novel. All movie lovers need to see
