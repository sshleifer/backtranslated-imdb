I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carn√© ... almost everything is said about the movie, but I would like to light a few things: du Nord (I have heard that it is still destroyed) It was rebuilt on a whole set of scenes, and the main reason is that the St Martin can not stop the traffic on the channel for several weeks.
