I only saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked it, so I thought I would check it out. I really thought it was a beautiful movie and I did not wait to go back to look again. the actors were really good and loved all music! If there were not many conversations that we felt a bit strange in the film, but once I was in it, I thought that the story and the player were really emotional and meaningful, and I thought there was much to think about. I would like to see the movie again, because there are so many things that I forgot about, but I know that the film is about theater. beautifully drawn and everything was really unique.
