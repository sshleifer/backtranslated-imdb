Michael Kallio gives a powerful and convincing performance like Eric Seaver, who is a bad man by a terrible, insulting, spirited father, Barry (depicted by Gunnar Hansen as a really scary). Eric is a compassionate fianc√©e (played by his beloved Tracee Newberry) and has an autopsy report on a local morgue. Eric, who missed Jack's lying Demon (really cool creepy Michael Robert Brandon), and his mother's last death, comes out of the deep and begins to killing brutalities. Kallio (also intense, astute script) Lieber, with improbable play by noisy noise (Jeff Steiger, as good as Angel's wannabe assistant brother Angel Michael), pretty rude but general polished cinematography, a moody, strange account, a terrible ending of the complex, grungy Detroit, Michigan places, a heavy tone, fear of this powerful and strange psychological hero, frequent savings and anxious views, the occurrence of shock and intolerant violent violence, is for you. A real dream.
