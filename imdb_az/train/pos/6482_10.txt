When I first saw this series, I was at the age of thirteen and after thirty years I looked at the DVD. Pictures on opening credits have never left me. It affected my attitude to peoples around the world and beyond. My parents who watched the series with me were satisfied with me, and we always discussed the program. Sir Laurnce Olivier's voice and delivery time is perfect. I feel that people living through it will feel that their version of World War II is their own version. I can not imagine an unexpected look at me. <br /> <br /> Maybe we can look at a series like the Cold War, though who replaces Sir Laurence? It's hard to imagine.
