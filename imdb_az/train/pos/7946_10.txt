This film is really a work. It is rare for you to find a heartwarming flick, fun, laughter, heart failure, and a little drama for your toes. <br /> <br /> A real family movie, Homeward Bound, tells the story of the three brave pets that set out to cross the Rocky Mountains, their changes and the obstacles they face along the way. One really striking thing about this film is the ability of animals to give human identities - the moving voice is good. The shadow is a beautiful character, old, wise and courageous and a very strong moment when trying to save Sassy in the river. Chance - Who does not like a dog like a Chance? He had to be the most hated and charming pupa on the big screen. Sassy is very witty for a cats - he sewed me sewing while mocking the goat; "Here's cat catty kitty ... it's not your life, it's boring." <br /> <br /> Sassy (who was really afraid of me) went to the waterfall, the shadow of a geometry (almost tearful), and then a fantastic end, when all three animals returned home ... a good old shade! <br /> <br /> Loving all the time - everyone who does not love this film should only love animals. Buy or rent now and leave you with happy memories that will last a lifetime.
