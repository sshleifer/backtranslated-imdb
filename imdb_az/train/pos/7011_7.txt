First, I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, everyone was doing well. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the comments people have heard about the end of a surprise. I did not know anything about this movie, except for a few "visionary" tricks, but I knew where the apartment was located in ten minutes. (I do not remember how she tied me in order not to break a good movie for others). Nevertheless, although it was obvious, I was watching. <br /> <br /> While predicting an early end of a movie, it would be great to see how everything is played, filled up and characteristic motivation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> I just hate it when it comes to the decisive road to the ancient sayings.
