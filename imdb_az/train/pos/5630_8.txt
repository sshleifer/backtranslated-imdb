Marjorie (a remarkable and riveted performance by Farrah Fawcett) runs off an attack by a weaker serial pilot Joe (a very well-behaved vehicle with James Russson's fear and intensity). But Joe stole his wallet and finds where Marjorie lives. He pays a visit for a lifetime. After Marjorie was exposed to a very worsening and psychological exposure, Marjorie tried to turn Joe into tables and try to lock him in the fireplace. What is Marjorie doing with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone prepare a story of harsh, furious and often disturbing, immoral sex that can endure aggression and aggression against violence and aggression. Joe accepts women as objects, Marjorie sees just like Joe's "animal." However, this film refuses Joe's admirable credit to just a degree of procrastination; Instead, he is a horrific fact with a spouse and child and a human monster (especially Joe's climactic confession is really strange). Fawcett and Russo also dominate; Passive Terry from Diana Scarwid receives great support from Alfre Woodard's sympathetic police officer Sadov like Patricia and Sandy Martin. Both Curtis Clark's agile cinematography and J.A.C. Redford's shake, skin screening, dramatically increases claustrophobic tension. A real powerhouse.
