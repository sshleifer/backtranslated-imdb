This movie is fun! I watched him with my friend and we still have to see him. This movie is not for you, but only for filmmakers who are watching movies for the Academy Award (you know who you are). I will not write for you because of all the other analyzes. <br /> <br /> "Whipped" made me laugh, a light hearted comedy. He does not take himself too seriously and should be watched with friends, not with your girlfriend. No prize will be awarded, but it should be appreciated. True, some jokes are toilet humor, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can sometimes use some of them. <br /> <br /> Some people have to light up and see why they are "whipped." <br /> <br /> ***** From 1/4.
