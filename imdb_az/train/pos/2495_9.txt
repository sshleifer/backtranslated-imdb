Strange, delicate and beautiful images of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall has written something exciting, sometimes horrifying! Yes, 2 points 4 kids do not be fooled by cheerful melody and bubbly characters; The show has a dark side and can sometimes be quite cold. And what's good about the show is that it's not just a sympathetic sitcom (with my Family) that each character is a 2D comic device. Instead, the characters are completely individuals who demonstrate the complete role of human emotions. Sometimes dark moments, therefore, cursed and wounded in a strange village, Ben, are two examples of a surreal, dark shift that helps add a few depths to the show. Of course the show is also incredibly funny and a guarantee for smiling. Eureka Video ceased release of this funny gold on DVD. Veoh.com is the ultimate hope to make episodes in their shops invalid.
