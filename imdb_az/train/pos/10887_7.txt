A fear film is shot and everything goes well. About a masked killer. The director talks to the castle and the killer in front of the crew. He's crazy and kills two people. He killed himself and the movie did not end. Twelve years later, film pupils decided to try and finish a group - but there was a curse. Those who try and finish it kill themselves. Students do not see it. <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> Well prepared by a young and talented young castle. No one is great, but no one is afraid. This also prevents the forced (and unnecessary) female nude scenes. Coming soon, your eyes are beautiful and bloody, and your script does not offend your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Molla Ringsworth plays a pale actress who has finished her time in life. <br /> <br /> There is no great shaking, but not bad. I'll give it 7.
