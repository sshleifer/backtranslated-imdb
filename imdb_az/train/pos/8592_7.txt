One evening is good for a fun - but the plot was incredible. The first lady's relationship with Garrison was unreal and passionate; President's cardboard was cut off. Who were the real villains? Nothing develops and is not explained enough. I still do not know how the president's killing or the molecule involved. His spouses were unknown and unreliable, so he never entered your territory. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to capture the reality of the story - chase and conflict were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were incredible in their role, Basinger did not have the character and could not be any Longoria Secret Service agent. It could have been a very good movie, but in some way it missed the path, gave very little questions. Despite some pretty scenes, it's generally disappointing. And used the "West Wing" for White House scenes? - I was waiting for CJ or Charlie to appear!
