Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley shoots a film for Syriana while maintaining her signature image. <br /> <br /> For a few years, I have not seen Hal Hartley's film, but with a little cautiousness. The striking production of the ninety nineties affected the critics and the audience with a unique style and dialogue. In the film's previous films, colorful symbols were sounded and presented close traces of life - often in Long Island, New York or New York - were unusual and delicate. <br /> <br /> My first reserve was the "spy thriller" from the description of this movie. For a pleasant surprise, Hartley maintains a well-built style and focus in the international arena to create the ultimate original drama. He works more in ways that he can imagine. <br /> <br /> Hartley's film, along with its own cinematic style, retains its trademark and dialogue center. <br /> <br /> In addition, the current situation in the world and the state of war have been supported. dark elements on each side. Hartley has brought all of his skills to a new level - a political film worthy of the same breath as Syriana. Indeed, it comes to itself. Casting is a good job to interpret Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posein's fan will still see it with us, with a staircase and a brighter look.
