Tom wanted to film for a long time and did it. he has seen a dirty and worn out notebook with a great deal of thought that he has been loaded and transported for 10 years. No transformation of the character character, no Hollywood item just a little bit of life and magic. hesitation, speed, comfy, and drama with strangely elaborate. this movie will take you on an ending trip before you can understand how beautiful it is. music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. this movie is nothing but a sequence of sketches of people who are just connected to one of the symbols is very enjoyable and surprisingly fun because it's empty. this is between the lines that occur. Whether to see or not to see it?
