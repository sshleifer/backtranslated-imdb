How can you go wrong with actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke, and Margaret Scott? Very unusual scenes, especially contemporary. The implementation of modern machines is very effective. There is a ray-top burst of vehicles that helps to clean the area, so new structures can be created. Despite being younger in this movie, it is not difficult to identify who Mrs. Pumphrey is from the BBC series and all creatures from the Big and Small! Both Raymond Massey and Ralf Richardson's "reappearance" effectively. The musical account is given by well-known Swiss composer Arthur Honegger, which is also unusual. For the time (1936), they are really used, large sets or effects appear to appear in this way. Finally, a really good story.
