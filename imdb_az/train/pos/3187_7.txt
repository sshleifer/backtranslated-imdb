A few years ago, I bought several DVDs of both films. One of them had three Broadway Girls (there was an alternate hood for the Greeks) and it was Happy Go Lovely. This is a comic comedy that is based mainly in Scotland, and is concerned about the misconception that one of the tenants of the millionaire's limousine is involved. Vera-Ellen dancer and woe, feet! Ceasar Romero gives her a chance after she leaves the original lady because she thinks that the car she meets with a millionaire. And David Niven is a wealthy man who needs an interview with him while looking at Vera-Ellen, but by a Romero journalist. What I was saying from the beginning might be confusing, but it can be logical if you're ready to check your brain while watching this charming charming comedy with beautiful music sung by Vera-Ellen. Romero may be a bit embarrassed here, but Niven is cunningly frightening. The print I was seeing was really good, considering the fact that it was actually age and public. And Vera-Ellen is not really an actress because she's pretty good with her lines. In the note, Happy Go Lovely is great for movies that love old comic comedies.
