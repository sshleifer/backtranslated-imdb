This is a BLOCK-FLOWERS AND A CHAMPION OF OXFORD, consisting of two films. SAPS on the sea is not a bad movie - the best comedy (created by Laurel & Hardy, unless it is JITTERBUGS or the next movie). Only the BLOK-HEADS crazy devil krescendo or the "real" identity of Stan in a CHUMP at OXFORD is a little bit of a movie, though it's no surprise. The other two films in 57 minutes are a little bit, but in fact, this is not a bad point. There is plenty of time to get the right notes. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In this sequence, Chaplin part of the impact (I just suspect this is a montage line in MODERN TIMES only four years ago). Ollie's nerves finally abducted and he continues to be a sluggish. She goes home and, of course, does not help her guest room Stan - there is a music lesson with the eccentric professor on Stanun's instrument (you have it - a trombone). After knocking down a poor professor, Ollie is facing a problem with an inadequate janitor / engineer (with a nice short view of Ben Turpin) and then faces his doctor (Jimmy Finleyson) and his nerve tester (a balloon inflating when the air is removed). Ollie stomach). Finleyson announces that this "hornipobi" is a bad situation, and Ollie is very calm and needs goat breastfeeding. They are going to a ship, but Ollie and Stan do not know anything about navigating - they plan to sleep on the boat. Unfortunately, the goat combines the rope up to the fork and the vessel is filtered. Unfortunately, Richard Cramer, who is on the boat, is a dangerous offender. <br /> <br /> SAPS (like a CHUMP) could have three shades in the sea: one at the factory, one in the apartment, and one on the boat. Each successful would be short, and they all took a comic film - but the pieces were planting. There are many entertaining moments in the film: Discoveries revealing that Turpin's persuasion has led to various mishaps in the apartment with water pipes and stoves; When Sten or Ollie worked, the manager of the building, Charlie Hall, accidentally spoke with words and said, "Can you help me find a basement? "Stan asks," Of course, you can not lose it - it's down there! "), and his ill-treatment against Cramer's two hostages, including" Dizzy "and Stan" Daffy "(Dan Dailey, Dean's Brothers in 1930, St. Louis Cardinal Teams) She looked at ST LOUIS PRIDE. "Cramer cooks a little meal for the boys and they make synthetic meals (for example, a spaghetti plate) to get sick, so they get to eat when they understand what they are doing. <br /> <br /> The seafront does not coincide with the SAPS Laurel & Hardy, but this is a good movie and a good result for their best years, when filmmaking (1927 - 1940) with Hal Roach. just a few years ago, Boy and Roach generated serious problems with their production costs (Stan's filmmakers), artistic problems (SWISS MISS and the contractual arguments appear in conjunction with Harry Langdon in Zenobia.) Stan and Ollie are back in the Flying Dukes, not the production of Roach, but by Boris Morros. Finally, OXFORD and SAPS summed up the arguments and challenges of the two drawing contracts of A CHUMP - the boys left Roach with high scores. Unfortunately, no movie connection with any producer was so satisfactory.
