<br /> <br /> I watched this movie late in the night on TV, but it was an experience I was concerned with staying with today. Stage may look slightly unoriginal - the hollows on a hill above a hidden city due to an earthquake are damaged by a poisonous nerve agent's underground storage and microscopic quantities of matter reach their food supply. <br /> <br /> The residents of the city are always looking at our minds with all the attraction and desire, and we normally know that we should not just move. <br /> <br /> The speed of the film is slow, but for me, it just added to the creepy merger, just as the people in the city began to slow down their behavior. <br /> <br /> There are some surreal and disturbing scenes that I remembered at that time. <br /> <br /> Creates interesting questions about what we can do for everything we give the most. Did I like it? I am sure that the word 'enjoy' is true. How would I think? Indeed. I still think. Scary stuff.
