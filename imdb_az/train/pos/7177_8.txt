I enjoyed this deep documentary and I waited a long time to pass through the pipes (local video) and it was worth the wait. I want something good documentary / special interest, but it was absolutely hearty, honest and nostalgic. A child's imagination is interesting and a great story begins. If you want a good, funny and fun documentary, rent it or buy it. Mr. Stein and his company have found a way out of the vicinity of the gay-rings at Cambridge's Video Capture and homosexuals at a glance. They seem pretty successful in respectable areas and it was good to know that all of them are good friends. The DVD has several additional trailers for other good documentary films, including many of Darren's most outstanding production, including Crazy News.
