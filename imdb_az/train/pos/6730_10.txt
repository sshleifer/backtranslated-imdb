I wrote comments on the IMDb, but I do not do it anymore. This happens that IMDb has become massive and ultimately violates subjectiveism scores. What would I say? Everyone who does not love the movie and does not have any experience with the subject looks at any crap (or vice versa) and if he likes it, it gives it a 10 and if it is a 1, this is of course not the right thing to measure. Now for the movie. I'm sorry to say that I'm delivering no more than 10 films to a movie. There is something else in this documentary that I do not want to watch in another movie in my life. It's just amazing, and that's not just a word; indeed. The last 25 minutes of energy load, visual joy and wisdom - what the children say - really ... there is a match possible. When I do not film, I rarely find something meaningful to do, but this is the kind of movie buying and storing, and sometimes over 10 or 20 times. There is nothing more to say. This is a true, objective thing for me.
