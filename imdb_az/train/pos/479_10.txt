Emily Watson's Natalya is the most loving and romantic structure I've ever seen on a single screen. The protagonist of this movie is above all else. Or is he the king's head? The touch of chess games and the struggle of families for control, strength and victory are striking. Like the chess masters in the film, the director plays a lot of games with many minds, but all big or small touches. At the beginning of the 20th century, the period, costumes and images of the Italian lake region were magnificently captured. <br /> <br /> There are many spectacular scenes, but I can not say it all again. I recommend allocating enough time to watch this movie twice a week, as you will not be able to handle all the poems within a frame of 64 frames per month, but in a multidimensional frame. <br /> <br /> I read Nabak's book, but what I read is reminiscent of Barry Levinson's other movie, a romantic poetry poem, to test his fate. Bernard Malamud's fatalist book ended in favor of a romantic impression of a unique American. Well, the director has clarified this work as a background to clarify this case with the moral and complexity of Russia and Italy. The true story here is the zero-sum of games; There are winners and losers before the two contenders are involved. But in the context of life, and especially in the context of our immortal spirits, we limit ourselves to restrictions and life conventions because we violate our souls. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson's praise of Natalia, genuine love can extend and allow even the gifts of all of us. <br /> <br /> This is a magnificent film (10/10).
