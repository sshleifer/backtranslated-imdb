This sweet little comedy has a lot to love. Anyone who has built or purchased a house, or even has an empty space, will find that Mr Blantyng's difficulty is more than just a grain of truth. Melvin Douglas, a great comedy, and Blandings' lawyer and the reason is the voice. Myrna Loy is as good as a good, but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is Grant. It is particularly relevant when the film is released when the country's housing shortage is over after the end of the war. Themes are universal, lack of money, work tension, fear of blasphemy. That is, it is done in a very good way, but it was a time when the world was getting rid of only a terrible war. happy ending. Today it is still relevant and therefore I look at poor theories. The appearance of the movie is small and some big bits of comedy are good at first. If it had lost some public relations, about sixty years after its release, it was still a stone.
