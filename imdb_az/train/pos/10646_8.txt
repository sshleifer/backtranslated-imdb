This great movie is based mainly on documentary footage, currently stored on a DVD with the Prelude War. The great American director and filmmaker, Frank Kapra, made these films simply clarifying the key points that led to the rise of the Second World War and the Hitler. <br /> <br /> Every schoolboy, ney, every American, because of the sadness of the movies today. History repeats and repeats! Lord Chamberlains is still alive and wheel; <br /> <br /> After coming back to Hitler in 1935, the tactics used by the persecuted and later communists and the fascists in the leaked Muslim terrorist groups are still working. <br /> <br /> Aggressive - France, America and Britain have killed more than 50 million people. <br /> <br /> Americans, French and English today would do the same for Hitler, even though we learned from history what happened when you broke the dictatorships. <br /> <br /> These great films are very simply a miracle of the World War II history. They will not talk about the horrors that the Soviet Union just caused, because America then fought with Hitler in the United States. This film explains the facts and motives that lead to a terrible war.
