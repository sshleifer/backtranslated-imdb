Two days ago, I watched a part, and today I saw the latter. Of course, the two worlds are separate, so I see everything I see is a bit shaken. I felt I knew Che's death was inevitable; For me, the whole movie was mixed. I suppose that Soderbergh wanted us to feel and slowly grow inevitable. The Party was more flawless than the two, but it was inevitable, but it was positive in Cuba and it was a negative in Bolivia. The Bolivian Movement's policy was aluded but rarely encountered didactic. The memorable scenes for me were at the end of the film: confrontation with the prison and soft talk with Bolivian officials, about the failure of these official requests to support the peasant revolution. I did not think that Argentineans played a great role in the national differences, just as in the conflict with Bolivia. I was amazed at the inevitable problems of the Soderberg revolutionary struggle; How do you feed the villagers without mixing themselves up? I was surprised how difficult it would be to try something like Cheyenne. I think everyone was timely; Is there enough rage for the government to act? There was no Bolivia. In his letter to Fidel, which he read at the beginning of the film, he carried out a terrible coroner of revolutionaries: now 50 years later. A very thoughtful and sad movie; Show every effort to see it happen.
