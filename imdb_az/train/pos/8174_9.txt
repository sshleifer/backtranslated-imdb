I love this movie. As a child, I was inclined to be one of the first films I saw. Of course, it is soft now, but it is back in the daytime, it was awesome. Dentists are something that many people are afraid of, so do not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cheesy, fun, sometimes scary, but it's awesome. And I always love for medical horror. Corbin Bernsen played Dr Feinstone perfectly, nobody could do anything better. And low budget fears for the film and so is good. And I also love the theme music, it goes well with this movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also a strange cop and plays a great job. There are fair amounts of blood and some really cool torture / death scenes. Check this out!
