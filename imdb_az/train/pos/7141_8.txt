Because of the death of Siskel and Ebertin, the show has remained in the hands of Richard Riper. Roeper is not a film critic, but criticizes only something that he does not like, that is, the country's music, "I do not like country music!" and children's films "Now do not see, wait until you get on the DVD and rent it for your children!" Roeper can be a good stupidity, but in another area. For Ebert, weekly guests are better off, but who wants to get a daisy in the middle of a cow patch? All this is the only demonstration in the city, and it just makes it look. As for Roger Eberte, Stephen Hawking can talk, so you can! We have many desires and ideas. Do everything you need to get this extortioner who comes out of his throne.
