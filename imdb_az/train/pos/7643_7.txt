Spoiler !!! This film is based on the concept of "what's happening". Of course, Mr. Destiny can answer that question. The main character, like many of us, is going through bad times and asks this question. The Chaos Theory states that a butterfly in China can affect one chain reaction. The main purpose of this film is an event during a baseball game. This event is one of the action; The table uses "The Butterfly Effect", excluding Destiny, on comedy drama like Ashton. The results are a fresh, slightly original film. If one's philosophy is compatible with "The Butterfly Effect", one will have to enjoy Destiny. I'll give it to 10 to 7. It was incredible that I saw the first half of this film three times and finally saw it in TBS.
