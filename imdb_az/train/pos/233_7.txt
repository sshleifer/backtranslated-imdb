In fact, I found this movie 'exciting'; Finally it is worth watching and renting. True ... some scenes are emotionally charged, screams, and so on. They remained, but what film does not emphasize their agenda, genre, or "stream of fools"? Not yet! I was surprised to find that in another research site, I read a review on a S.Franger's reviewer, but I found a more accurate description of the "self" view of the film; is not a movie. Everyone watching this movie will understand that it is great to recommend family and friends; no car will follow, Yea! As an Italian family, I am fully committed to the environment described on the screen, and the film has teardrops that can be real life in such an environment.
