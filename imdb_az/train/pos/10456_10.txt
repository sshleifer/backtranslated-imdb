This is not a movie that is fun, not even a movie that wants to spend time. This film is really a demonstration of true love from God. It can not help but watch out for this movie. There are some love that follows the value of this movie. There is a divine love of God depicted in a beautiful way. God's love extends the heart and mind, and is patient and eternal. Marriage is love. The main character struggles with his wife's illness when he understands God's love that his wife never imagined. He knows that he and his wife are one and will never leave. Finally, your child and your parents have love. Children from the family come together and know that love is not important, so love favors. Dear friends, God's will is not love, because God's love and love belong to God. Talk to someone and let them know you love them. Love is not a good thing as long as it is given to someone else. I can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees this movie. Amen!
