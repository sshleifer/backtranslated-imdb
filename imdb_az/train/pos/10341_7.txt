The true shouting of the 70s of the 70s comedy Persian this movie was a great hit for 5 minutes and disappeared from the earth. Some comedy films have a great release for a week and then disappeared: HIGH ANXIETY, CHEAP Detectifique, BLACK BIRD, NOW LOOK NOW we SHOT ......... and you do not have any profiles today. NORMAN was in the comedy every month in 1976, and everyone would see it, laugh about it and never say anything like that at all. Drawing and shooting in video filming A well-known, timely experience, NORMAN is a politically unscrupulous scam, claiming that Farrelly Brothers should look for re-build today. If they did not do it first, there would be no complaint or sensitivity to its content. Very funny and YES is very rude and hilarious all the bug. As it should. In fact, this terrific 1976 movie works really well with all these horror colors and dresses.
