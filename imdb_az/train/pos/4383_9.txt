** Spoilers Caution <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell you that Rob Roy is one of the best films in the 90's. This was a great success, especially for all the people Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones drew a beautiful portrait of honor and compassion that men can represent themselves. But, unfortunately, ... <br /> <br /> Regularly and unjustly compared to "Pride". These are two completely different films, probably the same as they are with the Scottish Scots in Scotland. However, this comparison is often bothering me because "Braveheart" is a better movie than Rob Roy. I love Braveheart, but the idea of ​​comparing Rob Roy is a bit insulting to me. I like Braveheart to put it very easily, but because of my love for Rob Roy, it's a pale shade. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy "belongs to real people". </ Strong> <br /> <br /> However, William Wallace "Braveheart" is not a real person. He is a legend, a martyr, a life bigger than life. For those images, he is a perfect person, never mistaken, and mainly shows his Scottish homeland to the promised land. When he finally fails, his fault is not. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the most trustworthy people. <br /> <br /> He is very well-portrayed and effective Wallace's image. But it really does not inspire me or intrigue me. I find human faces more faced than human perfection. That is why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better movie than "Kings of King," and I think that Rob Roy is better than Braveheart. Rob Roy can be heroic and courageous, but he is not perfect. It makes many mistakes that affect many of his favorite lives. Now I am sure that Argyll is not a lie against Duke, but a nobility and courage, but at the same time selfish and self-centered. It should not be forgotten that his relative, who claimed to protect, remained homeless until the end of the film for this film. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Though we start with what we look at this movie. Of course, she is beautiful, but she does not wear makeup and she basically gives her a natural beauty. Compare William Wallace's "Braveheart" with two favorite (or, depending on your opinion). Now these two ladies are hot, but a hard indicator of how women looked at the time (especially the lay people). Maybe it's not a fair comparison, but Rob Robin's attempts to prove that Roy's behavior is another example. <br /> <br /> Cunningham, Mary, who takes her along "Rob Roy". He has to explain Rob's struggle, but not because he knows he should take revenge on Rob's aggression. Such revenge is definitely Rob's death, and Mary is not ready for such sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The plot in Rob Roy is equally compelling. Though enemies of "courageous" are well written, they are genuine. Robert de Bruce, both courageous and coward, is full of moral decisions to your family in the so-called world. Should she take her claim as the king of Scotland, or should she betray Wallace to ensure her family's safety? Bruce is the most terrifying character of "Braveheart," but from "Brotherhood of Julius Ceasar" to Brutus, "The Godfather Part II", these characters are not really original. Longshanks is a very dimensional one, despite being a compelling foreigner. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, start with Montrose Marquis. He is a man who manifest himself, ready to suffer for an innocent man. "Look at what is not mocked at me" is his favorite "favorite" words. He is a man who thinks that a great noble carrier such as the Argyll Duke would be considered a supplier to him. He is a person who insults and is not trusted. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are assassins at Rob Roy and Roy's direct attacker. Callarn is so strange in his comedy that he's funny. We will do everything to protect the good will of Marquis. Cunningham is a modest character that has been raised to do his best to get the status and the love of the Marquis. She needs a father, knows that Marquis is a true father. Therefore, when he comes from Callarn, he seeks wealth, even seizes it without questioning it. <br /> <br /> It resembles the evil of modern man, as it is a governing body that does not influence the actions of others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized Tim Roth's work in this film at a high level. I say Hogwash. Cunningham is not just a bad movie, not a psychopath. Cunningham is a very unusual character in a world where people and their children can catch up to casual people to entertain imaginatively? We live in a society where people value the value of human life. "Rob Roy" teaches us that simply changing the circumstances of this reduced value. In human history, it is a problem that will not allow the compassion of the human heart. <br /> <br /> Rob Rob and Mary hope that they will be kind to us, but snakes will always be in our world. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about me is the Argyll Duke. He is a true nobleman and honesty and courtesy values ​​are different from Marquis. Rob appreciates Roy and Mary's courage and is directly affected by Marquis and her factor. He gives hope to the people of the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> People like Marquis are no exception, but I'm tired Sometimes, people are saying that it is a better movie because of the "Courageous" battle scenes, and above all, the battle scenes are hardly original. "From Spartacus to Gladiator, Hollywood historically has a long tradition of European battlefields. there are some of the best fighting scenes, but they are suffering from a major problem. <br /> <br /> There are no contexts in this battle scenes, except for the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, do not take me wrong, In fact, there are 10 times more duels than the battle scenes, but the duel context between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all, in these dwellers, the battlefield and the symbols of the two characters are perfectly illustrated. Cunningham effett and dangerous, Rob Roy strong and courageous. Cunningham uses a springboard, Rob uses a broader word. <br /> <br /> Roy's battle mode is more clear. <br /> <br /> The whole film is slowly moving up to the present moment until the exciting second half of the first half. This is a powerful thing and it is clear that Rob must destroy this dangerous evil that protects the world. Rob is finally one of the greatest moments in film history when he comes to the top (literally and figuratively). Rob has won more lives, and his honor is more than ten Cunningham's. The use of music on this stage is absolutely cold. A man who is really good at evil, "FREEDOM!" He is stronger for me than seeing he can close it. <br /> <br /> I'm going to follow one of those who follow one of the Caucasian terrorists. </ P> <p> People in Rob Roy, but I think they are trying to catch up with their speech patterns. I feel that many people smoke cigarettes from Rob Roy, just because they do not understand what symbols are. If so, read some Shakespeare or close each other. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the biggest writing films of the 90s. Many of the dialogues are clever in this movie, but maybe you should watch the movie several times to understand it. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the "Braveheart" dialogue is not very interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is an Australian Scotsman? This is a legend, and there was no attempt to capture the words of the time. This film takes place several hundred years before Rob Roy and is still speaking today as a human being. So, the reason why many people are better. Presenters are becoming more and more lazy today and do not want to have the time or patience to understand the complex ones. So, as in many epic films, swords are waiting to see the well-known English accents of the villians while speaking far beyond our American language. Undoubtedly, Wallace Shotle, however, does not sound like Scotty from Star Trek and has been acknowledged by several Aye that Scots, who is in this film, is a Dutch tradition suitable for the Dutch tradition and believes Skots will sound. br> <br /> So, are these drawings proving that Rob Roy is a better movie than Braveheart? Very hard. But if proving something, he knows that Braveheart is a better movie than Rob Roy. To put it simply, "Rob Roy" is a film that has a very important theme in today's world. "Braveheart" is a film about an inspiring but very realistic legend. <br /> <br /> Level - A Score - 9
