Lovely Danish actress Sonja Richter keeps this movie under the nose of everyone, taking into account the horrible performances surrounding it does not do any small job. <br /> <br /> Richter is an independent, thought-provoking Anna. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walent's everyone he refuses to answer - until he faces with a talented Anna, who reluctantly and dignifiedly denied the old old rotten devil from the death sentence imposed on him. /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Erik Clausen loves a father who did not accept it, made a strong film about difficulty, son of a tough businessman (Jorgen, played by Clauden). The film ends, but Clausen has a number of important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how a man can change the course of human life. Be advised. Sonja Richter's performance is worth the admission price only.
