It was a little long (2 hours and 20 minutes), but there were many of the famous Pearl Buck novels. In other words, you need to cover many places. <br /> <br /> It was sometimes a work of soap, but at the end of the film there were also dramatic moments of a series of visuals covered with a locust attack. It was surprising to see it. Given the fact that this film is about 70 years old, the film has made a spectacular performance on this film. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer are the award-winning actors and they will not be disappointed here, but will give you stronger speeches. Only one problem is that all Asian people are played by the Caucasus and not depend on some of Walter Connolly's loyalty. I would like to see this movie reconfigured with the Asian actors, not for PCs, but just watch the story and sound it more reliable.
