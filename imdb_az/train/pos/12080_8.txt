Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take over his wife with a wealthy Hughes family as a secretary to leave her companion. Almost immediately drugged and sent to the Cornwall family's property. When he woke up, he continued to say he was Marion Hughes, he was ill and he locked him ... why? <br /> <br /> Along with "Disturbing margin" and "Masks behind", this is one of the best B pictures. (B pictures were low budgets and budget figures with no stars). This is (only 65 minutes), well-directed, fast-paced, and interesting. <br /> <br /> Fox (a good actress) is just fine, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and scary). You need to catch up well. A perfect example of how to make a big movie in a small budget.
