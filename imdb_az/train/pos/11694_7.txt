Warren Beatty's Chris Rock stars (which, in 1941, are coming to Mr. Jordan), awaiting Paradise Life, is a new (temporarily) body of comedy and adventures about a man who died before fulfilling his dreams. In the Beatty version, the hero was then a backup square for Rams in Los Angeles. In Rock's hipper version, our lead character is a young man struggling and is a highly talented standup comedian. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous to see Ruth's rogue Rock playing the role of a bad comedian. It's like Tom Hanks's playing a bad player. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non-amateur night. But every time she prepares her material, she becomes "Booie" with the luxury name, so the scene booed out lustily. His jokes are naked, and pain is painful. In short, Lans is everything that is not real Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bicycle messenger, and she comes to the street on the road to try more material when it's BAM! He hit a truck. Perhaps he was taken from a second tenth anecdote by a slightly angle angel (Eugene Levy) from his body, but he was going to shoot anyway. No dice, Lens is not in paradise until 2044. So what do we do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), who is the parent of heaven, does not want to find a new body for dead Barton. Trouble, the body they find is a smart, old white man. This is Mr. Wellington's all-it's the 15 richest people in the country! Good luck! You can imagine how Lans did things around. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the wealthy Mr. Wellington's body, Lance falls for a beautiful hospital worker (Regina King). We know how difficult it is for men to find a woman who gives us our body, but when you're a dark, old white man, try to win it suddenly! Worse when you are not surprised at your money. <br /> <br /> This is the first shot Rock plays in the main role and I am amazed at this. Of course, if he wants to take on different roles, he may need to stop the routine rhythm of the stand-up scenario - but that's not really bad. Rock personality - its driver, delivery, behavior and ambition - how much fuel this film is. He has many fun in this role and looks bent to make sure you're trying to have fun.
