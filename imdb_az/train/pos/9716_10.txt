To love this movie, you will most admire: a) Love (without a marriage) b) Be amazed at your sweetheart and witty life c) Be smart enough because the authors had the opportunity to laugh and cry over every minute of this movie and only "b" and " c ", you can recognize and use the author's entry. d) You should love women like Kirsted Dunst, natural, sweet and irresistible. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> I have not smiled as much as I looked at this work. And even in some moments when I was laughing I was able to cry (good things are always sensitive when Kirsten Dunsta's happen)
