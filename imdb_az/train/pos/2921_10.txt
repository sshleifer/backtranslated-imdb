One and only great movie. I finished watching at EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler and I think it's a good idea of ​​life as a professional wrestler. Now this movie was prepared 4 years before I was born, but I do not think that the difficulty of traveling with professional wrestling has changed all this. Sad, funny, and great all around! **** 10+
