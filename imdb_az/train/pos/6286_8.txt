60 seconds have passed. where to start, with some good moves and some cool machines, keeps you in the movie. People say that there is not a good movie, there are some cheesy parts, but I do not think what the action movie is. I've given more than 10 reasons for this movie and a comic rehabilitation of 8, and found a good job with one of the best actors I've ever thought of - Rock or Face Off -Roy Lindo. Sometimes people are watching movies several times when they enjoy the movie and when they ask you after some words they reach the place they show. It is almost a motion pack when it comes to action. Where did the films go and where they were trying to film to change what they were trying to earn every award? I think they did their action movie, do not give a chance and do not apologize.
