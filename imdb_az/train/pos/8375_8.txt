Robot is a great little movie, some of the sets are bad, and the player is not that big, but special effects for this size and an adult movie are very good. Let's remind, this film is now more than 10 years old, and the first place is a cheap price. So you do not talk much about bad things. So just sit back and watch a cool movie with great big robots.
