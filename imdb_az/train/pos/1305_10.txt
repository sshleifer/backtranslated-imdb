This film is decided to be something to eat in the Arizona Café and Richard Grieco (Rex), "Dead Easy", '04', and a hot and very hot, sexy waitress. When Rex leaves the Café, he sees a State Party and says to him: "You are quick and then all hell is wasted more than once." Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt) is a television reporter, 'Killya Outfit', '80', and has always been published Maggie is full of wind in hot wind and Rex calls her to say that she wants to show her Western style with the city's best police, but this is a different film, but Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only actor to help shape this picture!
