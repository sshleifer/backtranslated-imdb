Apart from a few names and a new Sherlock Holmes movie, I think I watch Guy Ritchie's every single movie. Twice. Needless to say, I'm a big fan and Revolver is one of the reasons why. Lock, Stock ... and a very different approach from this movie Ritchie compared to Snatch. Revolver builds us for some sort of psychological excitement, because a group of unwelcome waiters finds himself guided by the picnic for the walking trip because they do not know the mercy and necessity of the angel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The awesome casino owner, When earning a card game and collecting good money from Macha, Jake finds himself on the brink of death and is diagnosed with a disease he left for three days to live.

Along with earning money and earning money to earn a living, Jake should also be involved in hitting a hitman who hires a hitman Macha. When it comes to the depth of story, Jake only comes to realize that some prisoners, with whom alone spent time, may well have a good credit-loss team to take away because Jake has worked on all the unfortunate incidents they have. enter. Zake (Vincent Pastore) and Avi Jake, even when they are faced with this fact, showing how it turned out to be the only self contained in mind and ego, even Jake's real existence. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify" represents and represents the characters, although Ritchie's previous films have many nods, including dialogue, The gangster gene is still a great venue for humility, and you know easily when an ego or predetermined understanding is able to accomplish what you need or to overcome.Heroes are well-prepared in this film and all sides are released and Ritchie <br /> <br /> I would like to talk about this movie and its unique nuances, and I would like to, but still have not seen it, I do not want to go far away from it. <br /> <br /> They hold meetings to pass through several complex layers, but this is a great movie and If you're lucky and you have not seen the release of the diluted US, see if you can get the original English version because it will be a big discussion between friends as you try to meet with.
