I used this movie in my class of religion. The golden fish floats in a bowl in an upstairs apartment. Young boy and his mother are far from home. The boy was given money to buy milk. When he goes home, he will play a carnival. There is a man in the black suit that looks a bit strange. The boy puts the glass in the milk. This breaks down. The man in the black suit gives him money for the milk. This scene is an alternative to what's happening at home. A black cat ran into a fire escape and entered the apartment. He finds the fish pie (?) And watches it. The fish remains energetic and comes out of the flask. Nowadays, I'm in love with a group of young people and fish. The cat takes fish in the mouth and we all breathe. Cat fishing coats. There are two suspects in the storyline and a suspicious black cats. Both inspire prejudice. Both are innocent. It was a great debate in my classroom.
