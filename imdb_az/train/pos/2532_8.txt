The third collaboration with Carloff and Lugosi drove away from Poe and became part of science fiction. Prof. Dr. Carloff, who created a device capable of capturing the light rays through the telescope in Carpathian Mountains and transforming the visual history of the universe into images. Janos Rukh plays. <br /> <br /> Before a few guests, an astro-chemist who previously mocked theories of Spirit. Lenin demonstrates the existence of a radioactive element known as Lukas, where he lived in a meteorite on Earth in the dark African several thousand years ago called Radium X. Carloff joins the expedition to prove his theories, but Radium X is a complicated compound - shapes the mountains at a long distance and creates blindness in a short time. Rukh is nervous and poisoned, shimmering in the dark, like the current Breck ads! Dr. Benet is ready to make something harmless for radiation, but the Rukh insanely paranoid combination of poison and therapeutic apparatus. She is convinced that she has been deceived, that she has a great deal of relationships with her fellow ambassadors in Paris, including her husband abroad and her death in a radioactive state. <br /> <br /> A description of the murder of a dead man (a very different Karloff!) is an old lying-scientific idea that Radium X, which was used to symbolize burials of expedition members, was written. <br /> <br /> The Invisible Ray is interested in moving the Universal movement to Africa and Paris next to the Gothic opening. The film does not have a pace, but it is always swallowed. Carloff slightly fits his performance, but Lugosi is in control. Universal, this time with Lone Chaney Jr, has used the Man Made Monster's basic reporting concept as a shining physician compared to Lugosi as a shining threat (this time by electric power) and Lionel Atwill. The Invisible Ray is a very effective and clever movie to admire. It is not as popular as the Universal Fear, it works and is very entertaining.
