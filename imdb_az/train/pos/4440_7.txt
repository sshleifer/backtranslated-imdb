Ogre does not appear to have gained a reputation after leaving her in 1988 and could therefore be a reason for subtitles 'Demons 3' to help sell a reason better. Yes, the film is directed by Lamberto Bava; the man behind the two first demons, the ogres and the demons resemble each other (both are 'monsters') ... but besides, this movie has nothing to do with the other two films. But that's fine! Italian filmmakers are famous for cutting off popular films and this is not entirely clear; it seems to me that it was a fair deal from Hellraiser. The plot stands on a woman scared by her husband and her son in the Italian castle. From the time he was a child, he went to memories and found Ogre, who lived in his basement. <br /> <br /> In some of the films, after heroism, these visions have remained long after returning ... and may be more than just a coincidence because it came to believe that it was a murderous bull in the basement. <br /> <br /> It was a budget and it was prepared for the Italian TV; it would be unrealistic to expect something bright; but for that, of course, this is a very good movie. Lamberto Bava can not be like his father Mario; but it takes time to create a formidable environment that really appreciates the movie. The setting of the center is a great castle, a perfect place for a story like this and Lamberto makes the best; Moreover, even when the films are meant to be demolished; As an inferior style pool scene. The area itself is not as good as the atmosphere, because several scenes take a long time, and the relationships between characters are quite strange (especially between husband and wife). Very large amounts of blood have not been shed, but Bava will not do a bit of work with special effects. Ogre himself looks really foolish, and it's a good job to see that too often. We have a high level of predictability, ending, and generally we have to say that this movie is better than expected and has been recommended.
