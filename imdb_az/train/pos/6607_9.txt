I would give it from 10 to 10. However, there are several sections that are mixed up to the film's movement / sustainability. The story line is large and well designed; you would definitely want to keep quiet in order to fully understand it. Heroes are complex, and so the story line is waiting for enough information to stop the scratching of your head, which is a film that ends at the end. The animation is very beautiful and femme fatal and the movie noir combinations result in a great movie that is different than anything else I've seen. In a few scenes, black and white film and its quiet darkness are worth watching a good T.V or plasma. Characteristic sounds keep this movie in the English version, but it would be more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize Paris's happening, and I liked it more with English subtitles. All of this is worth the purchase on DVD or BlueRay! If you like this movie, you'll love it personally; Waking Life & Ghost Shell 2 Innocence, this is just a personal offer.
