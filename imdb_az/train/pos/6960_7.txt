A man who is trying to hit a beautiful girl on a bus is helpless. He refuses them, but when they follow someone who wants to steal his bag, they are all together. And it starts there - a slightly damaged relationship with being a jealous and neurotic super hero. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that promises to get into a cold film. And IMO is able to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> not a princess, but in tears many times laughing - two hero characters in a love festival, which intermixed each other,> So. Thin story, however, is really funny and, thus, is worthy of the film process. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken heart
