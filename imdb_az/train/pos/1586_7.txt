Rosenstrasse is a more intimate film than epic proportions, and it could keep many filmmakers looking for a similar pianist. Fortunately, a good scriptwriter, Von Trotta, chooses a feminist perspective for a period that shows too much of its colorful appearance, but analyzes from the point of view of convergence in the ordinary Aryan German rather than in a few Jewish perspectives. Rosentrasse finds strength in these heavy loads as trapped by the traumatic condition of the victim. The speed of the film is introspective, fast slow, meditatistic. In addition, the characters are very lively, cross-links between the generations and over time. Rosenstrasse is a masterpiece and some narrator defects are well different. Another mistake lies on a small cinematographer who can not capture the intensity of the inner drama by symbols. Nevertheless, this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the German film, part of the latest trends in the past's dreams, as well as legendary films in Africa and recent controversial collapse. I would recommend this movie to those who can read the footage.
