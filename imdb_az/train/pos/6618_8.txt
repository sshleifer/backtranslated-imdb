Classical Noir stories depicted by Frank Miller's Hyper-styled black and white visions of Sin City. It then reflects a dystopian, scientific fictional tension, such as Steven Spielberg's Minor Report or Richard Scanner's A Scanner Darkly. The above merger is a fitting way to look into the future of a prominent French filmmaker, Christian Volckman, in a charming and atmospheric filmmaking. Volckman's work is undoubtedly referring to the above-mentioned films and similar ones, although such a simple hybrid Renaissance, the end of Volckman, is not fair - the film itself is a much more complicated piece of work. Hybrid Hybrid is a relationship, especially in a contemporary context, with the ability to hit and miss the good of the increasingly depleted individuals. Thus, Renaissance deserves at least one kinematographic experience with its unique interspersing, which serves to describe the strange nihilism of the Neo-Nir detector tension and the terrible allegorical terror of dystopic fantasy drama. conventions in a strange way. The scenario is smart and interesting (though many of the lines in the script would be more effective than the English language in English - the title of the movie is even tougher). While many elements of the site are familiar to those who frequently visit science fiction, the script is unexpectedly twisted and at exactly the same time that the audience should be kept in their feet to create a work that is realistic. Volckman's film is truly outstanding in its visual component, and the stunning black and white animation is easily emphasized by the movie - a highly treacherous and stylish two-shade, to show a great aesthetic effect, which can be a simple use. With a great detail paid to the composition and appearance of each stroke and the use of rare shadows and exciting passions, the film looks straight from a Frank Miller comic, but with a single twist, eventually a consistent sightseeing style to emphasize the scene's emotional tension. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The crackling of Daniel Craig is a terrific, stoic cop for Tottenham Hotspur, and Catherine McCormack's strong presence as a mysterious woman who has lost her brother. Despite rapid English accents, Romola Garai has done a great job like a miserable brother, and Jonathan Pryce is harshly frightened of Avalon's shady head of the malicious mega-corporation. <br /> <br /> Ranessance has all the direct, outstanding, and magnificent futuristic tensions. It is as smart as it is fun. It may seem like those who often want to stop this question from being a moody masterpiece and often have a weak line film, although the peculiarity of the animation makes the movie more casual. <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> To have a little less conventional futuristic tension for the film's nesting genre or fans of one of Frank Miller's strange graphic novels For lovers, br /> - 8/10
