I can say with honesty that if you see both the "Do not be afraid of the black hats" and "The Spinal Tap", it is true that both films should really look. Will be in Hysteria for several times. Not surprisingly, both films have such a great culprit. "Fear" will soon be on DVD. Rent, if necessary, but the only way to enjoy this movie is for you.
