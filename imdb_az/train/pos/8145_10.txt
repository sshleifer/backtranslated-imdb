I first saw this movie four years ago and was expecting something similar to CB4. I was blown. It's so big when I'm laughing on my butt. Better than CB4, symbols, songs, plot, everything. The best notch independent movie given by Siskel and Egbert "Two Stops Up" (and if two old white men can understand humor in this flick, you know it well).
