I went to see Vanilla Sky in a great, big, great way! .. Tom Cruise, my extremely cynical brother and girlfriend ... what can I say .. I was totally blown up by the film and especially from TC's performance, "I thought this movie was very moving and I did not expect anything. " <br /> <br /> I read what I was looking at and decided not to go and see it, and I am very happy to see it. I can not say anything strangely, why can we say that I was totally involved and could not stop thinking about the next day. As for my feelings about the movie, we can say that small events such as fantasy, psychodrama, whatever, and how to enter the car can change people and their lives. everything ...... <br /> <br /> Critics say that maybe the second was a stunning 2nd movie for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this was a completely different comment on the subject, and in no way was Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz a narcissian remake in favor of. </ strong> <br /> <br /> Even if I do not even want to post a few posts, send the glib sentence to describe the movie! <br /> Yes, I know that this is not a balanced thought idea, it is not.
