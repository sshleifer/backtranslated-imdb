It looks like a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to take advantage of it and goes to the beach. Unfortunately, the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor his child can help him. Woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes a car and searches for help. <br /> <br /> John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is strong because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a man able to help, but for that, he has a price to pay. There are two questions in the film. How much do you want to help your loved one, on the other hand - to watch Stanwyck's strange behavior - do you love her husband? Like a good short story, this film is separated from the audience by questions that can only be answered.
