True. The film is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love my book. But the film is just better. The film is best Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall. (Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd have never seen anything else). Some ideas used in this film are better than those used in the book. But I have already talked about what I have in my comments. But I missed a little. The film is shot in a better place than a mini-row. REDRUM scenes are more intriguing than the books. So, if you are looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining movie. But imagine having nightmares every 3 weeks
