As others have commented, Siskel and Ebert celebrated it as one of the top 10 films of the year. What a gift. <br /> <br /> Dwight Yoakum stops the truck when someone realizes that it is above the cabinet. When Cage gets up, she apologizes. "I apologize for scaring you." Yoakum's assignment to Cage's face "Does this look like scary?" <br /> <br /> A major part of humor after exciting (and temporary) running. <br /> <br /> Well, it was a fun feeling for her. The permanent sign of the Welcome to Red Rock shook a cow and smiling head. The music creates eerie quality in the film, reminiscent of Twin Peaks. Unlike "Twin Peaks," it breaks things by moving away from the "need for" upwards. <br /> <br /> I've been watching credits 15 to 20 times. As you can see, Yoakum had "a thousand cohorts" (perfectly chosen) from anywhere. . with snowy mountains at a distance. It was incredible, liquid frame. In addition, I have never seen a better picture of vision and sound in the film. And the story is entirely in line.
