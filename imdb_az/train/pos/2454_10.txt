Cinematography is the rate and kinematic skill level that disables the audience and then hypnotizes, compared to "Pehlivan". <br /> <br /> Acting - dialogue is minimal, but full of pauses and silence The story is the Balkanized Danish conflict, because we have seen recent riots in the Netherlands and riots in France. <br /> <br /> The director of this film was able to mirror the two communities in a false way, and this is in line with nothing. Aga has become a champion, not as a crowd, but as a whole. Even worse. . . I'm here to escape spoilers.
