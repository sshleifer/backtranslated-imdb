You know when you look at Brian DePalma today, and there are criticisms about how this happens. And about violence. When I was 20, when I looked at this movie in VHS, I thought it was fierce and faultless. <br /> <br /> How many years do I know how much I do not know in this movie? This is the reconstruction of a beautiful film shot in the 30s / 40s. How can you grow in a classic way? Or do not. But for the most greedy decade, you are talking about a fairy tale made by the "new immigrants" in the '80s. DePalma, Stone and Network is an ambitious, worried and darn right film. <br /> Yes ... The disco was dead and New Wave / Punk was taken, but Cuba could not explain the difference in a new home in Florida. It was interesting, they wanted, but how? <br /> <br /> Tony Montana to me like the "small train that could be". How amazing is your lead character for America: fighting, killing, stealing. <br /> <br /> Tony said he saw America as a dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted, did what he wanted. they did not see any error in the way he lived and in his circle to get him. Tony Montana's English-language command was saturated with the word "f", but did you know what Emily Post was expecting her and her colleagues to do after graduating from school? See how they come to America, what they know and what they are exposed to. This has chosen Tony and his crew to be "everything they can do in America." It was all about power. <br /> <br /> <strong> Tony Montana would succeed and succeed ... all violent, lying, stealing, croaked, theft fame. <br /> <br /> A part of the film that took over the 1980s is money laundering. Tony's crew brings drugs bags to the bank. Are those around Tony and his crew interested? In the clubs he drank and drank? Nope. The money was money and you got money. Toni dropped off. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montanah's coming to power, she really finds hurtful things. She is riddled with suspicion, she is a hole she finds in her cup of 80-am blonde blonde drug-addicted spouse, she is drug addiction, she is paranoid, surrounded by those who want to take her to a bloody take-over, she is her empire ... falls down. <br /> <br /> This is a film about the 1980s, aware of the misunderstanding of America's dream. insult It's fierce, bloody, over-reaching ... but it's pointing to the house that disturbs the point. All Cubans thrown out of Cuba, which falls to Florida in the 1980s, are not something like Tony Montana. Give me some time. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, the United States' only measures were directed to deception and money because they were "no one" and that these poor personalities with power and living in America. <br /> <br /> Curiosity - there is one thing here - learned today?
