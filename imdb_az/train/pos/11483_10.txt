What makes this film intimidating is that Andre (Andre) and Calvin (relative) are described as normal children. Undoubtedly, they are not the ones who do not want to be professional filmmakers because they have forgotten the lines written by the script after leaving the camera. They just make a video everyday to show how they can save their lives from normal life. Think their parents are drawing kids just for a family home video. Andre and Calvin learn how to investigate the attacks of other children in their schools (usually this is an old 'The Old Home' way), buy any 'Andres and Calvins' bombs, weapons, and Zero Day (on the day of attack) do not catch.
