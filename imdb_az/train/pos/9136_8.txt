This is not as bad as a movie like some reviewers, and I say this on the IMDB page for this movie. Why? First, in 1984, filmmakers were quite brave enough to deal with family violence as one of the plot elements; therefore, the editors complaining about the plot unfortunately do not lose one of the key points! Secondly, the musical summit will not work without the relationship of the prince's cinematic father - so only the reviewers who just said that the music is good - especially why it is so good ... Because in this movie all musical music is still more effective which has a background element background. Third, give this movie a break! For the first time for filmmakers and director, this is just the worst! The perfect movie guys are out there very bad movies! Finally, the reviewers who said that music was "good" - the style, style, music, and stage performance of the princess - in a way that was not really happening in the 1980s, and in the style of other artists (clothes and movements: The costume elements came first, Michael Jackson or Prince?) The Prince is in front of the movie when Quentin Tarentino does not come to Pulp Fiction. It's not a bad movie as its sum total.
