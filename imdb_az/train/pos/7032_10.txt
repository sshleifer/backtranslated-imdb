My school drama club will feature this show in the spring of 2002 and we can only hope that we are so good! I watched this movie recently as a "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez) and I want to say that Vanessa Williams is the most expensive! <br /> <br /> Wow! The filming was right (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my gawd, is there something I can not do? He was the most beautiful Albert Peterson - especially "Put a Happy Face!" I liked all the funny facial expressions and dances. He's so big! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is of the best quality. He was a beautiful Rosie, and his secretary's enthusiasm was absolutely convincing. Tyne Daly was just as stunning as Mr McAfee, a humble mother of Albert and George Wendt (but I love Paul Lindy's 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau Ursula broke me like Merkle; he really is the limit! And Marc Kudisch was a terrific Conrad Birdie ... <br /> <br /> I had a cast that I understood, and as many of the previous statements seem to have, many people did not understand. Who is Chinna Phillips like McAfee - what was it? I want to say that he is really nice and very talented, but ... looks a little old for the role. Well, maybe I'm delusional. <br /> <br /> If it's good at all, I strongly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> You will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
