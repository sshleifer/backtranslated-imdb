Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. Story: A businessman is blackmailed by 3 criminals. Roy Schieder should go to John Glover, who plays a minor psychopathic type, and does not do a good job like a special character. Note that the cruel characters are very complicated and interesting - a very rare thing for the action movie. some beautiful and sexy women have features - the most prominent Kelly Preston, like a young bate for Schieder's character. Vanity gives a very good performance and looks like a prostitute with three blackmailers. Ann-Margaret has not yet lost her - this woman is really a wonderful thing. Do not look at this movie. Indeed, I did not know what the public and some critics were doing against this movie, but my suggestion was to ignore them, and this is really a flaming and furious movie. You will enjoy it, this is a promise. Recommended A +.
