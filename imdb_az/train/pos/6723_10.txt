Riding Giants are an amazing movie. These people really show you how to surf. They were surfing, living, breathing, and enjoying their lives. Money, work, girl, or anything else did not care about it. Waves were a girl to them. I have never been on the surfboard and looks so challenging when I do not understand how to stay, does not make any sense. It's a beautiful movie and you really should watch this movie when you're on the surf. If you are a surfist and want to learn how to start surfing, how did you get into life, really famous or well-known, then you really should see it. It might be a documentary, but it's really good. - Tara F.-
