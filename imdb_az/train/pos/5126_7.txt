John Travolta for Urban Cowboy plays one of the strongest alpha men on the big screen. She is a wealthy young man who has abandoned his parents' home and attacked Dallas's big city, where his uncle Barry Korbi promised to find a job in the petrochemical industry. The bomb began in 1980 and Texas was a must-have place in the United States. <br /> <br /> Travolta does a good job of caring for the character of his character, the sex pig. She meets Debra Winger from the same background and marries, but there is an idea that women do not have shadows. <br /> <br /> <strong> It has become one of the refugees and refugee camps in the United States. In the Urban Cowboy, a real snake takes Travolta's goat just in a look and moves on Winger. Travolta deals with a wealthy girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, a liar in Gilley. <br /> <br /> Despite the cartoon, Urban Cowboy really was a giant trader for the largest white tonka, which is essentially the same in the world. Gilley's is no longer in the suburban Texas state of Pasadena, but lives in memories. The best thing about Urban Cowboy is the beautiful account of the country / western songs shown in the film. I'm not sure some of the songs are written for Urban Cowboy, but Motion Picture Academy is the only reason I can think of why it does not see the music aspects of this movie. Especially if you are writing for this movie, Johnny Lee's Looking For Love especially liked it. <br /> <br /> I love the character of Debra Winger, the best in this movie. She does not lose a trace of femininity, but stands up to Travolta and makes her in style. And this review is still dedicated to one day professional Bull Riders as an unknown woman who will be the first female buc-rider.
