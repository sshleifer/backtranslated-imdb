Writer / director Henry Brommel has done a great job with the Panic film since 2000 and includes his selection: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman. "Panic" is a story of a cunning man Alex (Macy): "Bommel" was a rogue of Ullman and Ritter, and he was working for his father in fact (Sutherland). The postcode encompasses the true profession; With all his images, he and his wife (Ullman) and his son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Dissatisfied with his life, Alex is looking for help from a psychiatrist (Ritter), whom his mother (Bain) said. In the waiting room, she meets with a young woman (Campbell) immediately attracting her and makes her situation even worse. His mother broke his promise and talked to his father about a psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Of course, knowledge kills to please his father, but he can not resist it and can not. His anger grew so deep that he lost all his feelings for everything except his son and his son - finally, the son of a lifetime. <br /> <br /> When the "panic" moves, it's quick. <br /> <br /> Panic does not appear in panic. In fact, it is moving too slowly. Moving slowly, slowly moving - slowly gradually fog, Alex reflects his psyche. Campbell's decision on Sara's character, showing her personal psychiatrist as a lively, breathing man, Alex began to build relationships with what he did and how they did not. <br /> <br /> William Macy gives a brilliant performance as a loving father, a distant husband and a cold killing. <br /> <br /> This is not a dramatic game, but a kind of game, not monsters for their own feelings or desires, in a movie theater. Very mature, very small, very subtle, character-based, and very good.
