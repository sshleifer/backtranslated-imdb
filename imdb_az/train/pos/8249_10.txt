My goodness. This film really shows the talents of actors. Billy Connelly twists the moving muscles. Indeed, he is an incredible person, if you look at him as a rebel in the Absolution, you see Boondock Saints as a madman / killer, then a zombie in Fidou! The character in Fido looks strange, totally unbelievable! Cariie Ann Moss or no hack! Matter and Momento, as a darker character, jumped into his career and warmed up the 1950's housewife! <br /> <br /> It's rare to see that these days the actors will not be so unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Now the story line (No Spoilers, do not worry). The author of the film Max Brooks (Zombie Survival Guide & World War Z) would be delighted with it! <br /> <br /> If you love zombies, do not love zombies, just be tired or too busy, watch this movie!
