I really have to see this boat twice to really appreciate all of this. When two children are thrown together with a revelation that shocked the widow, she is not a believer but a believer. As the horrors of this story unfold, we learn a lot about the father, two sons, and their fate. With a shocking twist after a shocking twist, this movie does not allow anywhere to calm down. Bill Paxton plays his father, but his most outstanding performances are Matthew O'Leary, played by Jeremy Sumpter, and his eldest son, Adon, the son of Adam. This is one of the best exciting events I've ever seen and you want to watch it several times to evaluate each of the complicated aspects of your efforts. I'm in this movie 9/10.
