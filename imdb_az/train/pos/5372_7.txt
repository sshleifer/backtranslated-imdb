In the first five episodes of Hammer's short "Hammer House Fear" series, this fifth episode is undoubtedly the name "The House of Bled The Death". For many years, as a great fan of Hammer Studios's "Gothic Horror", I wonder how long it took me last to watch the series soon. So far, I have only seen the first five episodes and have a strong sense of having come to the best yet, but as the first five episodes remain as entertaining, I'll be content. Although the second and third episodes are great for watching for their bad and strange dark humor, this fifth entry is one of the first to give the most real Horror. An episode begins with an elderly man killing his spouse for unknown reasons. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) go home with their little girls, Sophie (Emma Ridley). However, shortly after taking action, we have to find out that the family is a very bad thing at home. It seems like this is delayed ... The second episode managed by Francis Megahy is better than mediocre entry: Growing Pains (Episode 4) and pretty unknown actors give good speeches. The film is well-designed in terms of effects, cinematography and score. "The Bled House for Death" is a solid episode that provides elements that my fellow Hammer fans want to see in the Short Horror tale. The film provides a creepy atmosphere, real moments of intimidation and intelligent folds, and is fun and enjoyable from the beginning to the end. Generally, it is highly recommended to fans of Hammer.
