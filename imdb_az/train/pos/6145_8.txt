Mary Poppins is definitely better, but it's a beautiful movie. Angela Lansbury, Engletine Price is such an extreme as dotty and David Tomlinson as Mr Brown. Their chemistry was also brilliant. Although very funny and sweet, the kids did not have the same sparkle at the same time. Some people say that the "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact all the songs are beautiful. The special effects were great, very magic, and the story was fairly original. Like Mary Poppins, highlighted events were cartoon sequences. The submarine was beautiful, but it was my favorite football game, and it was absolutely cheerful. Not only did my other criticisms end when I first saw it. All this is a difficult movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox
