Okay, that's why it's a place to work. Yes, therefore there is a random song and / or dance sequence (for example, Adam's concert and Henry's scene). <br /> <br /> In short, "Americans in Paris" are all polished, like first-class music, mostly by Gene Kelly, based on incredible dance and choreography, and Caron's imported charm truck as a truck. <br /> <br /> The most successful and technically awful number in this art is, of course, a 16-minute ballet. movie It's stunningly beautiful and Kelly and Caron are dancing beautifully. But my favorite number, Kelly's character, should be a character, with a group of French schools "I have the Rhythm", then into a series of American dances. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not only is it beautiful, but not at the classic level, it is proven that you do not need a special effect with "Singin in the Rain". Nevertheless, we stayed there. Great for hours!
