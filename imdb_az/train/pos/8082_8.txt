It has been a long time since I watched the LOTR. I am currently hunting a copy to buy. Baker's works are completely compatible with the original work. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is mixed or mixed. There is one or two times the storyline slows down for scanning. But in general - Take this movie. Great for kids, adults and collectors.
