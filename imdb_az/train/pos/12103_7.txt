I have never seen a Barbara Steele movie that I never liked, and it's always a good haunted home story (especially beautiful pictures like "The Hell's Legend" and "The Haunting" and "The House in Haunted Hill"), so "The Castle of Blood" I felt it would be right. And boy, never! These French-Italian compositions, perhaps the first scary movie of Steele's "Black Bazaar", is classic even though it's an extremely cool atmosphere in the spook genre. The black and white film is really creepy. The film is about a journalist who can spend the whole night at All Saints Day in the castle of Qalvud, a writer with a Lord Blackwood and Edgar Allen Poe. The spirits of those killed in the castle protect their fate. The observer begins to see these deaths and most of them are terrified. The film actually squeezes the back of the viewer and I've just watched the amazing DVD in Sinapse - a surprisingly topless scene and some soft lesbians! Barbara is beautiful in this movie; her other beauty is preferred by playing a nice sympathetic basket. Only his presence turns a creepy dream story into something truly memorable. Nothing was said to be the King of Heroes.
