I was very surprised when I read this film very little ... Why do some people understand that you do not like this movie? Its speed is slow, characteristic of Japanese films. Nevertheless, if you follow a movie like me, you will not have any problems with it. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Is not it a dance?" often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. Hollywood, e.g. Austin Powers or Terrible Films, every few minutes a stick is guaranteed. <br /> <br /> I love the film, because it feels "real". Land is simple but pleasant. I was delighted to see that Suqiyama (the main role) played the meaning of life in dance. Before I watched the film, I was a little depressed with heavy school work. I lost it. But this movie started thinking about the bright side of my life. I believed that I was on the same boat of Sugiyaman; If he could find himself with his hobby, why not? <br /> <br /> I recalled that my "quest for my future" and happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> Actors are not professional dancers. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If some of you can find the dance scenes as perfect as you would expect so I feel like a cinema that the characters really are "alive"> All this movie is hearty and heartfelt. As a comedy, she performs her work perfectly. <br /> Yes, Aoki is funny :-D
