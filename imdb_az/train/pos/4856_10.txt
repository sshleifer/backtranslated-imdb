I first saw this movie a year ago and I did it several times when I got an opportunity. Along with some classics, I have some of my favorite movies. If someone said that, it was foolish or outdated, ignore them ... This movie is for everyone who loves music and music. The dance is not as important as in other Astaire movies, so the comedy and moving shine. Look at this movie may be lightweight, but it's still fun. I know that many people know that they hate black and white movies, and they think that old films are not really funny, and this movie should change their minds. I do not know anyone can watch this movie at least with little fun. The only problem with the film is that Fred Astaire sings a song without dancing. He can be a great singer and a talented singer, but it is not interesting, and creates a great hole in the middle of the story. Comedy is sometimes a little clich√© but G Burns and G Allen's vudevillesque performances can only provide someone who is looking for a perfect and easy laugh for the fabric. Give this movie a chance despite the fact that you do not like old movies, this movie can be ridiculous.
