This movie is a good example of a good storytelling. Acting is superior. The story inspires without excessive manipulative or fake. There were several points that probably were really good or bad, but given the Hollywood movie, they had a great deal of pressure. Although there is no explosion in the film, even if it's an opportunity. The film has not been made a moving film with suspenseful tracks. The story is, unfortunately, made to pay attention to an extraordinary person at times. Beautiful works!
