Some movies should not be re-established. This is one of them. And this movie is not bad either. But in 1963 he could not capture the taste and terror of the same film. Liam Neeson was as perfect as ever, and most of the castle remained, except for Owen Wilson, who did not bring the proper approach to Luka's character. But the main benefit to this version was much lost from the story of Sirley Jackson, so we tried to make her great, and the excitement of the previous movie for some tasteful special effects. Again, I can say that this is not a bad movie itself. But in the previous version you will be very pleased with the friction of terror.
