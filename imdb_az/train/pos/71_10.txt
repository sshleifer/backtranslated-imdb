<br /> <br /> I do not believe in the comments on the movie. <br /> <br /> When I read horrible stories about the movie, I really wondered what you really did. <br /> <br /> What I saw was incredible! <br /> <br /> Some actresses and director have done a fantastic job in the film. <br /> <br /> I was not pleased to see the actress before, and I have to say the most convincing movie I have ever seen with an incredible job. <br /> <br /> The thing I've ever seen is that everyone has a problem with the choice of the medicine you have chosen for Deanna's suicide attempt, because of the choice of actresses and her stupid choice. I did not understand that it was a movie directed by someone else and it was a mistake that actresses could be wrong. I think it's a real convincing movie that I'll see and recommend again. What is the idea and how bad it is because it is too close. <br /> <br /> Famous Philipps will be one of the top paid actresses one day and I hope everyone laughed at her who criticized her! Girl, you go!
