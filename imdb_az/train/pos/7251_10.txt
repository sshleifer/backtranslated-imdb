I've seen this movie only once in 25 years ago, and so far I have told these people the best movie I have ever seen. Given that there is no oral dialogue and there is no dialogue, I found a film that excited the movie and even saw that I was breathing to stop voting. I would accept this movie at a high level, I would like it on DVD.
