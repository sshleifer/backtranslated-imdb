Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is one of the strangest indie films I've ever seen, and it's hard to believe that Cross Eyed is a debut film. I would like to say that I've come to IMDb to find more movies by this writer ... Because the Cross Eyed has a unique signature - you want to see what else you want from this writer. It is rare to find a well-written, well-directed, well-edited and well-functioned movie in recent days. For me, the movie Cross Eyed combines the best of all the elements of the actor to create a clever, fictional and fairy tale. Please do more.
