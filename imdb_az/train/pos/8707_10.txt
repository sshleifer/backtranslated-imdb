"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic films I've ever seen. The film can be translated into English as "sword". The main hero (Sasha) was born with exceptional abilities: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword under his skin. On the other hand, he may seem to be a more foolish hero than a scandalous movie about unusual events and emotions. But not about Mechenosets. It is even hardly possible to say that anti-hero. In my opinion, he is a man who has lost his faith in his life and belief, justice and love. He never met a person who could understand and love him in his life. Each step is painted with blood; he receives revenge for the damned gift. And suddenly she meets her. He does not need empty discussions or explanations. She loves what she does. He does not pay attention to what he does. It is more important than anything else. But soon he finds his secret: he kills two people (his former lover and bodyguard) to protect him in the eyes of many. After that, he could not escape from his emotions. They try to escape, but there is a hart to hide. Finally there is a serious accident. He is a cage; he is in a mental hospital. They do not know anything about each other, but he believes he will save it. It surmises many obstacles, but finally finds it. They run away, but they are sensitive. He must be injured, he must rest, but the police take them. He does not know what to do, takes it to a corner, and then swords start to cut trees, the surrounding helicopter, but he does not need it because he has already died in a gun and he is the only man in the whole world.
