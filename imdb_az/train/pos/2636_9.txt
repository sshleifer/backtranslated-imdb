The Lion King series is easily the merchant achievement in Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest work in the animation. Lion King II: Simba's pride is FAR, the best direct-to-video extension prepared by Disney or any other studio's animated feature. She was awarded the freedom of theater. It can be the same for the movie. Elton John has a genuine voice, song, exciting performance, and a song that touches character moments. Everything you expect from this series. Not a very new story, but a filler over the Timon and Pumbaa and the extended background and the place inside this story. The most impressive thing about me was the care of animation. Often, Disney shorts focus on the animation quality of video and television efforts. Here, however, they perfectly blend the new animation with traces from the original film. Scenes never appear on the floor. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella act quickly as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly play their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala, respectively. We can even get a return trip like the Hilares by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin. This movie has great laughs. So, if you love Lion King, you need this movie. The story was not finished without it.
