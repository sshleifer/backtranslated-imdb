The thing I remember most about this movie is, in fact, on the local KTLA TV every Saturday during the Christmas season, so it's just because of the fact that the true story took place on or near the Christmas Eve, it was a little uncomfortable, a plane crash in the Peruvian tree, a graphic of the young girl's infallible footsteps, which made her very impressed with the scene, and it was a favorite Christmas celebration for me to see, of course, a Rankin-Bass production.
