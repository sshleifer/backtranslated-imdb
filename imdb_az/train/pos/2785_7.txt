"Bending Like Beckham" recalls the best dance movie of over 80 children under the direction of John Hughes. In a bubble-chewing world where everything is attractive to everyone, there are some easy-to-reach conflicts that sometimes go from very happy processes, and large-scale truncation ends with assemblies assigned to bouncy pop melodies. However, nothing is wrong. "Beckham Bending" is a must-have treatment from beginning to end. My husband and myself, as well as our fun, got even corn cheese, and we applauded that we were embarrassed to welcome it (and we did not see it in a theater). <br /> <br /> Watch and enjoy this movie. <br /> Level: B +
