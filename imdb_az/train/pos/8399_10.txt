The love trap is not short, this is a full-length feature film with a precise precision of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> I can tell you a little bit about Love Trap when I write it. <br /> <br /> I often asked what distinguishes Love Salt ... How I answer these questions: 1) The movie, which can not be seen during the time - 2) About Love more truth, and more deeply into the notion of love than any US movie, according to my esteemed thoughts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as on the road 4) Offers extremely timely concepts within the Black community and across different cultural issues. <br /> <br /> In time, people will see the original and honest Love Trap, which will rejuvenate with joy as if it were the original work of this time. <br /> <br /> For full and accurate information about this movie, visit www.lovetrapmovie.com.
