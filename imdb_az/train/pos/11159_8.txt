<br /> <br /> This is a beautiful film ... First, cynicism and crassness manifestations are a fun demonstration of how quickly the main motivations of men and women (Vive la difference) are different. <br /> <br /> sometimes because of their weaknesses. People really have a little trash, but we have great hearts and we do our best despite our desire. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is not our fault when we can not resist the temptation. <br /> <br /> From the start to the end, there is a constant charm; a beautiful picture when you laugh with beautiful music and loud comedy, when you add charming photography and sharp composition, provocative content, very well suited music. <br /> Look just for the very young "single clever voice" ... bright; wisdom from the humane state of innocence balancing comedy.
