"A Dream desires a heart", "So This Love" and the lyrics of the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" tells the story. This my favorite movie has grown and has never lost its charm. The original Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The latest DVD release is the best way to rate this movie, including movies, movies, deleted scenes, music videos, vintage radio programs, and a restored release of the movie!
