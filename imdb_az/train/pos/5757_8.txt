This movie can only be released in 1970! A strange action film set up in the small California worker town. One kind of mill or plant is destroyed, so suddenly, bad behavior on the streets! The population of the city is fed! Thus, Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to get his brother Harun playing by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vet of Vietnam and is a little visible and a bit running. It depends on a number of other vets living in Vietnam. They come to the city to be purified, but under the good deeds gambling houses run away, protect their money, and so on. It's time to catch people and take a while in Biblical Cain and Abel, and Vincent should take his brother. This movie has an interesting blue collar sleaze atmosphere, which is interesting (pay attention to cock cockpit!). Vincent is a very angle in this role? He thinks his brother is too high, and he tells of his bad deeds. Is it finally coming to her senses? Her girlfriend, Victoria's director, is in a miserable way and is beaten at home. Kris Kristofferson is a creepy creepy like Aaron. He threatens his father's life, while all smiling, talking about a mistake, and even talking to a younger daughter of conscience ("Harun Uncle")! Vincent and Kristofferson have good chemistry with each other. Bernadette Peters gives an interesting look like the 'salon' daughter, attracting Harun's attention. This is a good 70 action movie, you can find it! Not available on DVD?
