An entertaining and exciting man story about jealousy and intentions covering an insect marriage is a fun early animation of a Russian animated pioneer Wladyslav Starewicz's "The Cameraman's Revenge" or the "Cinematograph Camera Revenge" <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Mrs. Beetle has a completely unwanted marriage, and both of them wish for more excitement in their lives. Mr. Beetle's desire can only be provided by a beautiful exotic dancer at the Gay Gingerbread Nightclub, which is browsing only when he takes a "business trip" to the city. The only one who understands him. An admirer of this dancer, an aggressive locust, is jealous that Mr. Beetle stole his lady and is a filmmaker because she has fate. The naked locust tells Mr. Beetle and his acquaintance. <br /> <br /> Besides, Ms. Beetle also won a friend to add excitement to her life. He is an artisan and both are taking pictures in order to introduce them before placing them in the wall. At that moment, Mr. Beethle returned home and witnessed all the performances. As Mr. Beetle climbed from the front door, the artist climbed into a chimney, but Mr Beetle first missed his anger and frustration. <br /> <br /> There is some irony in the following statement: "Mr. Beetle is generous, he forgives his wife and takes him to a movie." He was generous enough to forgive him and was still loyal to him a few minutes ago. But at this point, it is not surprising that we have not yet forgotten the jealous movie maker that has been preparing for the revenge, and when Mr and Mrs. Beetle are involved in the film projection. Joining the movie, he is a vision of Mr. Beethle's invincibility, and his angry spouse begins with a tough candle before crossing the theater screen in search of a land that is difficult and angry. Mr. Beetle, who is more grateful to each other on the final stage, is serving as a prisoner for the fire that he was looking for during his last revenge. We really hope that insects will be less interested in home life in the future. This movie can be just a story about a small insect, and it's just a story about the departure, but Starewicz communicates more than that. This is not a story about beetles? This is a story about us. And it's not surprising, is not it?
