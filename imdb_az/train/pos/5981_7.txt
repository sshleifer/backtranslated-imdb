TRICK AND TREAT, Tipper Gore and his Washington-based women began in the 80's (this is a "terrible" BLACK ROSES and unhappy GATE, including other, less successful entries in the mini genre). When I went to the trick or treatment, I was in the second grade in the middle school. Until the end of the 1980s, video cameras disappeared, but recently I bought a budget-precious DVD copy and brought back many memorable metal memories of the day. No teenage metal could finally link Eddie's "Ragman" to the Weinbauer (Marc Price "Family Ties") court, because her heavy metal is being pursued by "beautiful" people at a secondary school for fashion and music pleasure. Eddie's beloved rock star, Sammi Curr (looks like Tommy Lee from Motley Crue, who died in a hotel fire at the start of the film). Eddie Sammi's radio DJ (short-lived Kissin Gene Simmons) is not as polite as he would not accept the latest, unreleased album's experiment. Eddie is soon able to communicate with Sammy Curr's soul when it's back! Soon Sammi advises Eddie how to get preppie with torturers, but messages are in a miserable state ("Waste'em ALL ... no false metal!") Eddie is trying to destroy the album, Sammi returns back through Eddie's stereo speaker carry. Sammi gets into big dances at Eddie's high school and Eddie's scene and dreams come to the scene to break the heart of the crowd and some unlucky "incorrect metal" before arriving to save her daughter. (SIGH) No, not very scary in 2006, not so scary in 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will bring a smile in front of any 1980's metals and this movie's kick-ass soundtrack courtesy of Fastway Faith. Do you have a taste for never having a headache or a B-grade horror movie (or both of you, me)?
