This is really a fine cinematic achievement. From the start, I was really telling a story. Lt. Victor Burakov (Stephan Rea) cried when he had an autopsy on the remains of the child's organs. Later, Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile) is a charming story of Andrei Cicatilo. In fact, he plays so well and very effectively that the audience regrets how much he remembers. Dr. psychiatrist Dr. Psychologist Dr. Max Von Sydow Aleksandr Bukhanovski was absolutely convincing in every detail, and his point of view on the Paranoia in the Soviet Union was very clear, as was the case with the Communist Commissioner Bondarchuk, Joss Ackland. For me, an outstanding performance proved to be Donald Sutherland, once again a really characteristic character player. When Burakov told how the FBI was closely followed and admired his works, I was tired. This film shadows the silence of the lambs from the atmospheric and ridiculous Soviet landscape, which shines the superb performance of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the 10/10 film
