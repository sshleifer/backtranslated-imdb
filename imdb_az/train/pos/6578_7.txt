Sadly in a film or video that can not be used for a long time, ARM and MAN have been steadily on the stage since early 1894 - heroism and warfare, as well as a solid satire in nature. When it comes to conflict in the world, ARMS and MAN are always rising as they are in the timely and appropriate way. <br /> <br /> This is Oscar Strauss' successful operetta, leaving most of Shaw's best ideas, CHOCOLATE SOLDIER (Hollywood's * * * * * * * They left Shaw's latest vestiges to pay for their rights - then he was the owner of the Oscar award). Although the show is always more open than its ideas and its naked areas, the ARMS and MAN sparkle, and the master manages everyone's happy ending. A police officer and daughter of the richest man in the city, Helena Bonham Carter, is engaged in a ceasefire officer in Bulgaria and all of them are a bedraggled Swiss soldier (Pip Torrens, on the other hand, in the drainage window As always, there is nothing like the first time in the show, and social conventions stand on their own for a simple and straightforward reason: There are no "good guys" or "bad guys", only different classes have the best idea of ​​people it's just as good as life - of course, with Shaw, the mind is a wonderful thing to anyone. <br /> This is one of the most traditional and traditional comic Shaw's scene satires and the first one to make a real hit on this side of the Atlantic first (1932) Shaw own scenario, has long been among those missing did not sell screen rights to his plays - licensed for only 5 years and emerged with the rapidly developing sound technology and the 1932 movie did not renew its license to show the show for the first time in a few years. As a result, the BBC's debt finally dumped the 1987 release in another DVD box with 9 other brilliant plays. <br /> <br /> Some of the best of the pupils, together with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers, are a bit unlucky when they come out of this band, PYGMALION. <br /> <br /> Like the DVD, Helena Bonham Carter has made a less impressive move after switching off her teeth in television roles, into a major movie career. this will bring many viewers to this early role. Ms. Carter should not be disappointed as to whether she deserves a worthy performance, but James Cellan Jones's (and the BBC's unequaled and well-trained physical production) about 80% of its potential is given to the bank. <br /> <br /> The real star of the piece like Switzer, Bluntschli, may well say Pip Torrens. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful performance, but it does not refer to a physical comedy that prohibits a young soldier from being lethargic despite the deadly danger. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the production of a beautiful game transferred to the small screen with Aplomb. With Wilde's IDEAL HUSBAND's latest designs and styles, it's widely viewed and re-perfected with a great live screen. Really * Any ARMS and MAN will be able to see the original 1932 version with love and possibly with many luck. 'Up to one or more surfaces, this production will ask everyone who loves good Shaw.
