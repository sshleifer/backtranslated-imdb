Like many Americans, I first saw "I'm away from the dream" and got acquainted with Hayao Miyazaki's works. I fell in love with the movie and saw it many times. Now, I am looking to see each movie by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works is "The Towering in the Sky". <br /> <br /> A young man named Pazu (James Van Der Beek), although still unpleasant, was not as good as the "Rahat Away" (this is either a movie or a movie that is unfair, in comparison with 2002) . while working late at night in a mine, she sees the girl fall slowly from the sky. When he wakes up next morning, he presents himself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheetan has a secret and before you can do that, Pazu is thrown into an adventure that will endanger the city with pirates, the army, and the lost one. <br /> <br /> Hayao Miyazaki can expect something: a miracle and a sense of magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create magic or fear of Miyazaki. Watching movies by Miyazaki is like a fantasy dream from childhood. <br /> <br /> The movie is animated and does not have much trouble dubbing it because it is impossible for lip action. It also helps translate the dialos well and written by talented actors. Effective sound is different. James Van Der Beek gets the best. He brings an excitement and excitement with the role of Pazu, which is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. He was afraid of the events around him, but he knew what to do. Mark Hamill is not known as the bad Muska. He is dangerous and wants something from Sheeta and we will do everything to get it. Other sounds are bad. Cloris is terrible as Leachman Dola. Leachman could have won the Oscars for the "Last Picture Show", but he's been abusive as a pirate leader. Leachman gives the character a damn pathway that is nearly always monotonous. It's so bad that the film will be damaged! Jim Cummings is an effective voice player, but he is worse than a general. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend seeing "The Castle in the Sky". Maybe I'll buy it myself. But even though it is not as good as the "Prophets," it is still very good.
