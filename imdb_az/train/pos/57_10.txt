I have to say that it's one of the best films I've ever seen! I was missing and t.v. and I found the "living room" and it was about 5 minutes already. It was very interesting and moving. This shows what everyone can do in life. If possible I give more than 10. The director / writer and actor did an incredible job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and learn from it. It was drama, mystery and more. I cried for a few hours! I think that the director / writer should write such films. I loved it! I did not even know about this movie, which I'm very good about. I can go to movies to see more people.
