It is based on a French farsa, almost an unknown stone - it shows me as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) asks her father to marry a wealthy Argentine (Roland). But Caroline was already married to Anthony (Colman). He approached the plane, and for the last time he thought he was in love with someone else, he began to remember the director-director: a scout-work sculptor (Gardiner). The film plays the story of Anthony's sculptor Caroline's strategy of evacuating, and how this experience helps Argentines. <br /> <br /> The perfect scandal: Ronald Colman's most sophisticated and charming, Reginald Gardiner is his most terrible, Gilbert Roland's most exotic, and Anna Lee is just subtlely rewarded. The film is produced by Lewis Milestone (also producing); all production is like labor. Colman crushed frames and cameras, and the exceptional use of the door of the sliding bar cabinet. DVD is an unredeemed crime - this is a film that can be distracted by showing interest to the classic film.
