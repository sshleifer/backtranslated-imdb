Let's start with the theme by Christopher Cross. The song is between "Moon and New York City". After all these years, there is even a great theme and song, it is not tiring. This is really a great song in New York City. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore is like a spoiled drunken millionaire who deals with Jill Eikenberry's character in the CBE film. Jill will later become a star about LA Law. In any case, he is best served by Sir John Gielgud OM, Sir Brit., Winner of the Oscars for his performance in the film as the best supporting actor. Arthur is in love with the character of Liza Minnelli, which is perfect in this film, and besides his performance in Oscar winning in Cabaret. No, Lisa did not read. She plays a waitress. I love Geraldine Fitzgerald, as the Bach Mausoleum of a family that lacks the fortune of my family. Anyway, she was incredible and should have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Barn's Martin plays Liza's father, who is known as Jerry's father in Seinfeld. It's too big. The film was well-written, acted, and delivered to more and more audiences.
