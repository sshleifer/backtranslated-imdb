Taking into account the right conditions, there is a fairy tale somewhere that can really happen. A street artist who draws attention to the famous opera star and friendship. Finds / purchases a child to pass the art of aging. From there, we are chasing them along the river, but with the violence of the free life. Having traveled to the city, he gains some reputation. Despite the time and effect, the person is good and good. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, speeches are the first degree, especially Xu Zhu, who describes the street performer. The child (Zhou Renying) is beautiful and luxurious and is talking about open-mindedness. These two heroes, along with the opera singer Master Liang (an exciting and elegant Zhao Zhigang), also have a very interesting fairy tale about forgiveness, sorrow and love. Some movies tell about the similarities of this movie for BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); <br /> <br /> Articles My only wish with King is to end. It was slim, like a slim, clich√© and sledgehammer. The audience was already wrapped in a story, so why was it unnecessary manipulation? What a shame. To bring such a distant good movie, just to surrender to emotional (and mixed) pathos like that. Obviously, this film should be made well, instead of classic. THE CHALLENGE OF YOUR MATURITY is still worth your time. I'm glad to see Shaw Brothers still making good films. Be advised.
