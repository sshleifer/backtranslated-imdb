I thought this movie really was really great, because all the lessons you see in cinemas in India, music and bad behaviors ... in this movie you can see some tradition, ethnicity and at least an error ... although some parts were a little dramatic, they said? This is all Indian cinema! After watching this movie, at least all the loud music or any violence, it does not have the headache of truth, teaches love, and, of course, cares about your loved one ... I think it's an incredible movie ... you can watch it without any doubt and the adults will benefit from the simplicity used to make the Indian depth accurate ... until all of these rap hits, rhinestones and skin looks.
