Although it is part of Sherif Hodges's role, I still have a few places to go and I do not believe that I'm easy. You can say that I am biased about the film, and, okay, but I did not see the finished product on 12/27/2006 and I was very pleased. I am not an admirer of a Horror movie, but I love old B movies and black and white Sci Fi movies. This movie is "think" when you know something, and then, and then. It will completely stop your balance. I will watch the first film, the director's notes and special features. It's so well written, directed and shot, and I can personally say that you are very happy to work with this shooting and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
