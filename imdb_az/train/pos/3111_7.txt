Now there is a name, identity, some memories and a lost girl. He did not have anything he wanted, but he still watched him and destroyed the world he had set up. Now he wants some explanation and wants to show him what people are. Yes, Jason Bourne is back here and this time with a revenge. <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie does not have the world's most developed script, but its purpose is very smart and give serious questions about our society. Of course, from the late 1990's, like the Hollywood movie, Bourne Suprematy is a super heroic story. Like Jason Bourne's Captain America project, it's completely wrong. In the first film, the hero discovered his talents and accepted them the second. Now, after being killed by a close relative (a girlfriend of Suprematy), she fights against what she thinks is bad. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is part of a super heroic story, including super-powers, including realistic, but still ineffective. <br /> <br /> An interesting point is that the American is an enemy, as is the case during the 24th season (Bourne has no boundaries in the movies, the heroes go from one continent to another). his country completely blinds him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Deputy Chairman of the Caucasian Muslims Office, the useless and the dialogue area, the direction is very uncertain. But all of this is not really important, it's an action movie for Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> Everyone here speaks about the Waterloo scene and the Tanger profession and everyone's right. Especially in the Battle of Tanger, I am very pleased that this invites me to exaggerate and work with Tsui Hark. Visionful Views, Many Intelligent Movements and a Good Defeat in America's Context: Bourne Ultimatum is definitely the best film of the series and a very interesting and original flick.
