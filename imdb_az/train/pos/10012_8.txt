Nightmare is probably not one of Williams' best roles, but it is a very strange, but very different film. I can guarantee that you have never seen such a movie before. Some people do not like the slow pacing of this movie, but it's a big part of the movie. It is undoubtedly one of the best films in 2006. This is an interesting thing in a movie with a dramatic, dramatic feeling. This is not an American movie. This is not an expected movie. You just feel that it's a movie with some difficult time to find out what the consequences are. It's not a good movie with everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original film.
