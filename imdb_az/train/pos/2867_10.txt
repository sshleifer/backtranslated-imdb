I lost my father in a very young age. In fact, at a young age, he has no memory. For years, I learned a lot about him. One of those things was a ritual for him to love the West and to watch Bonanza every Sunday night. I remember the end of my series queue when I was eight years old when I stopped production in 1973. Over the years, watching this show has drawn me even closer to the lost father. There are all the good things you can do to show an impression: the smile, the tears, the edge of your seat, and even your anger. The beloved "Hoss" Cartwright came to the remembrance of the show, shortly after Dan Blocker's death. The end of a special episode and closing credit, he smashed a picture of the Blocker and dropped into a black color, and I can also remember with my eyes a tear in my eyes that of my oldest sister. We can remember this as yesterday. I also say that I love Bonanza, not my father's name. Cartwrights.
