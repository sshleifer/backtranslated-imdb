- SMALL SPOILER HERE! <br /> <br /> Today, when I look for votes for "Reptiles," many IMDb users rate this movie at "1". I wonder: what are people expecting from this kind of film? <br /> <br /> Creep is a HORROR movie and is a very good thing! This automatically means: there is an absurd story full of spaces, ugly dangers, and a one-sided character. Why are you complaining about this? Just a few popcorns and coca, relax in the seat, and then enjoy the fear of death! The first 60 minutes are incredibly scary when Kate and nothing else except the metro station. There are screams and fears in every corner of the screen, and just a little silence due to the sudden noise of a blinking neon lamp on the back. <br /> <br /> Kate has diminished the quality of the movie while watching her follower, but is still a poor film. The second part of the film is intimidating, but the effects are good and the story is very well developed. (... do not forget that watching is a fright film, not the Discovery Channel!) So if you want to make yourself a very, very intimidating hour. Just watch the first time of "Creep" and then release the movie or TV queue. Do you know the rest of the story yet? The bad guy will die and Kate will only survive. But if you watch this movie until the end, you will not be dreaming <br /> <br /> If you want to bring anxiety to the next level, do what I do after watching this movie. dark night movies, go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
