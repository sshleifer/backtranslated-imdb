Think of Pierce Brosnan and suave, dapper, smart James Bond. In this film, Brosnan plays against the type and is very fun (like the audience). <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with very good scenes (one rivet, Brosnan on the edge and one hand). well, fitting off "off" Kinnear has some good lines). <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> My only exhaustion, Hope Davis, oh-very tolerant spouse ("I can see your weapon ?) Playing is not often: it can be a nice foil for men. /> This movie is like a matador: playing with the audience, "going to kill". The last line of story (with positive spirit!) Is awesome because it is a cunning, strange and entertaining movie worthy of a large audience.
