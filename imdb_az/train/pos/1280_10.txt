I did not see it during a film festival, and I'm fortunate enough to see it three times for the next night. Every aspect of the mid-level entertainment has been overwhelmed by the funniest, fearsome and sharp gear attack, the slowest common denominator of the single-avenger journalist, who has been a member of the guerrilla war on slow-track predictability, and all of the film is still hopelessly erased and the original films the excitement that you can leave after the excitement is done in an unexpected and refreshing way. Anyone who is dissatisfied with expectations to alleviate his emotions would be good for hunting down (and hunting) this insufficient item. For fans of the Fight Club and any Charlie Kaufman movie and looking for someone who has escaped from the multiplexes like an old dog.
