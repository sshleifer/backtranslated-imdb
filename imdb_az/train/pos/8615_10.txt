I waited for this movie to appear in Canada for a while, and eventually I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at the beginning it is a very sad movie (and New Year's Eve - even just) - but with you. The next day, I would think again that, even though emotional discharge is around something, you realize that this is a wonderful story after a few days. A person can be viewed as a lot of people, but sometimes you can blind many things. And how Diane Keaton survived the rest of his character. And how they keep it in the process. It was a great movie and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides a great comic relief. Certainly, a movie that needs a texture tissue box, but you will really stay with you for a long time.
