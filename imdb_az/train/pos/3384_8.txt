My assessment: 8/10 <br /> I love this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong > The daytime surprise of a person eats the "flesh" of the human body. It is possible to see how indifferent it is to all events and people in this planet. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is only a few years old, but the idea behind the film is still relevant. Rich in Paradise, and in hell. <br /> <br /> Today, there is a deceptive chance like television and the "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> Television is a good washing machine. It is a pity to see that human intelligence is not developed as technology. <br /> <br /> If you show the truth, this movie is not for you. You also believe in all politicians. If you do not, now ask yourself, and never look into this movie in the future.
