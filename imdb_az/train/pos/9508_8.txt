In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luján) lives with an asthma companion Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old home. Lola is still surprised by the death of her son, Autusto. For nearly twenty-seven years, the Colonel waited for the warrior to retire in the war against the Catholic Church. But for the political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old fight. Without any prize or money, but without a precious gamecock, they are struggling to survive through government expectations of the letter of protest, the adoption of the law, and the late payment of pensions. This slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial status of the majority of older retirees in third world countries. Most retirees in Brazil should live at around $ 80.00 a month. The colonel's debt to the story is bound to pay for his son's cemetery, but on the contrary, he would be buried poorly. Superior performance of the game with a very sad story, which is a reality in poor countries. I have eight voices. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): ('Não es Escreve ao Coronel') (Do not write to the Colonel) <br /> <br />
