This movie was absolutely beautiful. The front of time and culture have been beautifully rebuilt. Urmila still has a brilliant performance. Of course, this film is unfortunate that it does not appeal to Pakistan, which does not spread in cinemas such as Qadar and LOC. As a divisive background, the film does not transfer to political issues or is violent or just and incorrect. The film is always around the tragic story of Urmila's life. The fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai is perfectly illustrated. The film actually shows how people in India and Muslims suffer from this division. There is only one religion in this film that has really spread.
