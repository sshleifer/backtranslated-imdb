I'll be honest with you ... I like this movie very much. The action is a huge zombie flick, filled with genuine ideas, good toy, but full of bad Zombie effects. Part IV after Death is also good. <br /> <br /> The fans of this amber must love it. Check out the puppet master, brave liveliest, slag party massacre, sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
