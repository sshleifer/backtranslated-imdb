This is one of the best films about the serial killings I have ever seen, and it comes from someone who absolutely loves the Lamb's Silence. HBO jackpot here. It is attractive to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has very important issues to give you the precise information about the main topics. It records the search for the Russian murderer Andrea Cicatilo for decades. Stephen Rea is a brilliant security expert as an inexperienced court expert and is the only person in the Russian government who wants to help Donald Sutherland, his gravely superiority and more. The performance of both of them is subtle masterpieces --- Rea is loyal and does not start to compromise when starting the patience and making the situation less intrusive. <br /> <br /> If Sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealist, Rea becomes more secular and beaten to the system. <br /> <br /> The rest of Sutherland's performance in any other movie, but here he is self-competitive by Jeffrey DuMann as a serial killer. DuMann brightly creates a character that encourages empathy more than the hatred that we can find - he is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we claim that he likes it as we do. <br /> <br /> If you can draw an incredibly dark theme (and very worried), you should see this movie.
