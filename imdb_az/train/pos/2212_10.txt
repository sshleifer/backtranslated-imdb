E! TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is so funny, you can see the episode change in the flash. You want more comic writings by Stan Evants, the best writer .. The boss of the foolish masses ... He is a truly talented, talented writer, actor, comedian, producer, director and creative consultant. Anna Nicole liked him, but he was separated from the billionaire because he was not billionaire billionaires. Many super stars wanted to film with actor Stan Evans, who acted as "Humphrey Bogart" (Clark Gable). She should shoot more films. Maybe with Stephen Spilberg, or perhaps with many other talented manufacturers. We wish for a moment of FAME, a great fortune to win it. Did he create any miracle-U-drama? or maybe any docudrama ??? A project about Bernie Madhoff will be a big television movie by STAN EVANS. How many scenarios did he write? $$$ $$$ billion dollar deal with Disney? He must earn more than $ 50 million ... He can write a TV movie about the POP KING'S SUBJECT .. Michael Jackson. We want to see more and more Stan Evans on TV and on TV. Thank you very much. Elvis came out of the building !!!!!
