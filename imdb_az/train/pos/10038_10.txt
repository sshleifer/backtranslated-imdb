Titanic should be one of my favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> When I get to someone who asks me why I love the "Titanic", my first reaction is "wait a minute or not?" I know many people who do not love this movie and why I can not see them. "The love story is very good" is good, but it is not pleasant and moving? All this, the story of love between Jack and Rose is very real, and everyone knows that such love does not exist. But this is a movie, does not anyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that allows everyone to fantasy for some time? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I admit that they do not follow their full potential. But it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors. Personally, I think they are very striking actors who are famous for a stunning movie, but do not believe they play a great role. But their role is simple and the character is quite realistic because they can think a little about you. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with many people, and it could have been expected. <br /> <br /> Finally, if someone is thinking of complaining about this movie, they hate history or tragic films, then we apologize, but why did they leave the earth and show all these things clearly? they saw. They are a bad movie because they hate action movies as people who complain about Dark Shark. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < <STRONG> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> I know some of the writings fail, for example, shouting each other's names throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Hikmet The flash part may sometimes be pretty weak, but in general, it's an incredible achievement in making the look of the Titanic and feeling drowning in epic. <br /> <br /> Why do not you like most people? <br /> <br /> I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including the day when the memories took place and, as a matter of fact, it is not a weak structure, but rather a love story. this film keeps a few historically accurate mistakes, one of which is that copper tubes <br /> <br /> Because I'm not just because I love romance movies 10/10, but because of the success of an outstanding cinematography, it's a terrifying part of the real adaptation of the events, creates.
