Wrestlemania could be the 2nd best PPV of the year WWE became a good surprise! John Cena made a perfect match, and he upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy maintained his IC title in a short match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won Benoit & Guerrero's extremely fierce desktops match. Jamie Noble had a really good game with Kidman, which is amazing for me. Booker T defeated Big Show in no DQ match, at one point Booker T scored the Big Show and sent it to the right from the table. With the WWE Christian and Lance Storm's foolish decision, jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with the help of Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock filled the night match with a great high point, and I was happy to have RVD head over because it protects the ic head. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means nothing less. In the main event, Rock became the world champion for WWE's world champion for the fourth time and defeated both the Wolves and Subtaker in a three-match threatening match. Generally, this is the 2nd best WWE PPV in 2002! 7/10
