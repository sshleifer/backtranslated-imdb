I chose this movie based on quotes based on plot summary and critics' box. I'm not bigger than foreign movies and I did not know what to expect. I also do not care about subtitles. But I absolutely loved it! It's a simple, lovely quality you feel good about life. I repeat it many times. I'd recommend this movie to everyone, even those who love foreign movies with subtitles. It evaluates the effort.
