Sitcom has many new styles, but the best employees are the old fashioned way with the audience and indoor sets. The 70's show is a great example. When it came to the show, no one really had heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, more than ever was played by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both of them went out this year to pursue other interests this year). The show is characterized by Eric and his close friend started with a circle. Ashton is our time, John Travolta. Remember When Love Loves Eight Diana Hyland, Imagine With Ashton Demi Moore. The form of actors has never been known to us because it's a good thing because a famous player can ruin it. Missing Mo Gaffney, playing Don's daughter Joanne. I miss the Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, but the replacement did not match her and I was sorry about that. I had fallen in love with Steven Hyde, but I did not like Tommy Chong. I watched Tanya Roberts other than Charlie's Angels. I like Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mother. Before heading to Broadway, he actually showed his acting skills. This show is a pleasure to many surprises. I hope this show is going on even more, though 2 out of their cast members are coming, but I hope they will not be too far away. The creators of the presentation, Bonnie and Terry Turner, as well as my other favorite show, the Third Rock from the Sun, have been more successful in Fox and wish them to be in NBC, sabotaging their performances. Turners are not dummies and I hope to create more shows like this in the future.
