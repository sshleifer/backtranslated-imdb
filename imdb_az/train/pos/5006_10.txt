I remember in 1965 when I was stumbled upon a channel surfing. I had not heard Barbra before. At the end of the show, I thought, "This is the best thing on TV that I'll ever see in my life." It was 42 years later. It is so beautiful here, as there is nothing surprising as the talent shown here. <br /> <br /> You can talk about the superstar you want, all of them are the best! <br /> <br /> You call it, it can do it. Comedy, Pathos, Violin, Ballads, Barbra is truly a storyteller. His ability to pull things out is a legend. But this was at the very beginning and helped to create a legend that quickly emerged. Despite so many upsurges so quickly, he fulfilled his promise and revealed more than his fate. But since the beginning. You will not be disappointed to watch it.
