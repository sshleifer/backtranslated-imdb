Possible LIABILITIES: Not sure <br /> <br /> When watching the King of the Lion 1 1/2, I could not get a mixed feeling about the whole film. It's definitely a good way to spend an hour and 15 minutes. However, there is nothing to be ashamed of what the King of the Lion has done. <br /> <br /> Life is about how to deal with Timon and Pumba, and how the original Aslan will affect the events of the King, for those who have not read other analyzes. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many funny jokes for the movie. My favorite feeling was Simba's time. But the worst parts for me should be shown when Timon and Pumba are directly involved in the original events. I can not rewind in the same way with the "Circle of Life" or "I Can Make a Tone of Love" ("I Can not Wait to Be King") <br /> <br /> Sound talents are very good. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, Matthew Broderick, Rafiki and Hyenas are doing a great job. Even the young Simba actor called me like Jonathon Taylor Thomas. But why did they include a voice actor for Zazu? It was literally just 2 lines, and it was not so important. <br /> <br /> <strong > In fact, when it comes to the end of the proud, it comes to mind. <br /> <br /> I believe that the DVD has no special features for 2 CDs regardless of itself. They could easily fit a comment or other aspect ratio on the 1st disc. I love the game "Who Wants to Be King of Jungle", even though I have the most embarrassing example of mutual encouragement I have seen. Some questions are really hard. <br /> <br /> Generally, a good movie is not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
