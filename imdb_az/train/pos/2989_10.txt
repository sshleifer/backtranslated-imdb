First, I just want to say that I am a great fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very beautiful film (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). This is one of the most favorite films of all time. She deals with a mother who has grown up with a baby, and goes through a lot of ways to bring her beautifully played by her daughter Jenni Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you take a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And 4 is worth it! Great! I'll give you 4 out of 4!
