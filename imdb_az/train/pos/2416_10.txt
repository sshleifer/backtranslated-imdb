Yes, this is part of a stupid movie, so if you're looking for an oscar performance ...... But if you like John Candy's humor this is a must see. Before we lost his big comedy comedy, we lost John Candy and he's better in a movie: Airplanes, Trains, and Cars (along with Steve Martin). A perfectly supported performance by Eugene Levy, perhaps the hottest work of Sal DiPasquale. Also well run by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills and Pat Hingle. If you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy, you should see this dark and out-of-the-box movie.
