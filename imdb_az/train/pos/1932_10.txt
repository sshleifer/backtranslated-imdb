I think film festivals comedies are usually "weird" and that any humor can only be achieved by the simplicity of the characters in front of a complicated context. What is the exception to Big Bad Swim is that the film director could continue the integrity and development of the heroes of the film, finding the laugh-loud humor on the stage scene. Perhaps I have seen in a single indirect movie because of the dramatic work of the DP, and more rarely seen in a comedy. Here's a special note: Paget Brewster's turn as the math teacher Amy. I do not understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a wider audience after seeing this performance. It brings a mixture of fury and liquor that is needed for the role that helps to achieve the picture's potential. It's a great job worthy of a bigger audience. I was expecting more from the director and it was cast!
