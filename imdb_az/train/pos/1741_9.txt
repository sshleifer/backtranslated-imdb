A dramatic film in all sense. Tells a tail that we live in Greece, and we understand how heartwarming it is in everyday life. Of course, there are some threats ... but now and then in real life, sadness is superior to art. We are deeply critical of the goals we have accomplished and all the social structures around us. The film has deeper insights into Greek lifestyles, stereotypes and social structures. Unlike most Greek filmmakers with a fast-food-mainstream audience, this does not target everyone, but when you look, you feel that someone puts the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music, but I do not want to hear anything else when it's played in the movie. <br /> Someone tells me that I do not want to say something against this movie, sometimes the transition between the scenes seemed to be sudden or short cut. In my opinion, the edit was forced to cut it for 2 hours and to fit a little theater. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could write more to express my thoughts about it, but that's why I need to see it and discuss with a friend. A must see
