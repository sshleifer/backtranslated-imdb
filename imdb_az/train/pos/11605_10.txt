The biggest reason I have to see this movie is the stars Susan Swift, a prominent and very-very-underappreciated actress. When traveling films are usually not interested in me, they do not even have movies about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and creepy. He did not rely on numerous special influences and did not pay much attention to his travel time when the viewer was missing and confused. It was a really creative movie and it's simple and has a great deal of action by everyone.
