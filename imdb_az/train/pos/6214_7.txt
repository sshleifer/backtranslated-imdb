Land is a strong point of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but the scenario "Watch the Filey" is extremely mediocre. Fred and Ginger still go all the way - Bake plays Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, dancers who have their personal and professional partnerships when joining the Navy. When they encounter again, the hatred of love creates some entertaining comic moments. For most of the film, Sherry's sister Conni (Harriet Hilliard), Marine Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott), Bilge's love for another woman, and her love for Anne's former shock inherited from Connie. <br /> <br /> Hilliard is surprised, but this area is uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the "fill fill" is blessed with an irving Berlin account, which gives a great deal of chance to show the talents of the stars. . Astaire took two best solos with "I saw the sea" and "Previously, I took a group". She is expressive and, of course, dances - and the sailor's suit makes her look a little more boys and athletes. Rogers reads the song "Get Yourself Go" and later solo tape in that criticism. <br /> <br /> The three duo really keeps the movie, but all of this goes straight into the field with foolish excuses. Fred and Zinger win a dance competition by making an energetic rhythm for another rehearsal called "Let Yourself Go". Then, they say, "I put all the eggs in a basket," and dance that it was the early rehearsal of the comic imagination of choreography. In the end, the film finally describes how to get Fred and Zanjan in their evening dresses for a romantic duet - this is a show-show. In spite of the situation, "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the finest things Berlin has ever written (reminiscent of Cole Porter) and dance is elegant. Quintessential Astaire and Rogers. <br /> <br /> Once again, watch the "Filoyu" will be a job to sit in most of the dialogue sections, and in fact this is not necessary because the area is rarely musical numbers. But I could watch the songs again and again.
