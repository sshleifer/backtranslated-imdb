I did this job completely and did not expect any episodes. His wife lived with the effects of the loss of a family in the family, the more emotional he had and the closest to them. The only problem we are experiencing as a family was how quickly it was 'explained'. We did not hear what they were saying, and what was Gary's part of all things? Why did Kyle close her and why she went with her? After investing in a five-hour series, we felt we were kept to get a five-minute lead. I asked about it and none of my friends following this was foolish. Too strange, but maybe we left something important?
