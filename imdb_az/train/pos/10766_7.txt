A subtle story with very beautiful shots. Eyecatchers are here in D.R.E.A.M. three ladies. team. And, to a lesser extent, the accompanying person. Traci Lords convince a woman of a bad business couple who intends to poison the world with antrax. In this film, the original bomber is a captive member of the BPAM team. Of course, three seconds before the explosion, the co-rapporteur rescues. Even though James Bond's "Goldfinger" and "You Live Only twice", such a summit always works well. All in all a good time, James Bond was replaced by three Charlie's Angels here.
