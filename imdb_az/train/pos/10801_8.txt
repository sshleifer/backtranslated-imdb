I'm honest, when he saw this movie a few years ago, he wanted to delete it. When I sat down for the next 10 minutes, I realized that the player playing Navin stole the show. His facial expressions and comedy behavior shake my head for not having more comedy. There is a coming "Marty Feldman", but in the HISTORY, MORE more ... It does not take anything from Marty. The movie actually shocked me, as it approached to the original belt, but it was still a lot more. I really saw the first release of this movie and I saw the 2nd class of Steve Martin film, thinking that there was a cheap break in 2. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it's true. In fact I love most of Steve Mart√≠n, but his performance is second to The Jerk Too actor. For my collection, I can copy it. If you find it, I urge you to see it.
