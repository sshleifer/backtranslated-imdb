Using Buster Keaton in his twilight career was an interesting choice. He could be the most talented comedian in silent age. This gives him a chance to show these talents in a short journey travel story. He has tied up with a modern-day boy, and we find ourselves in the best way that Keaton can make his vision very good. I heard his voice before. I believe some of these Beach Party films that play some important characters to earn a few dollars. Serling respected him and described it in this way. This is not a bad story. It does not exist and shows us what we want to react when we want it.
