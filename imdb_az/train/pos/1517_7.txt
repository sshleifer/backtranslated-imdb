Robert Bloch, from the "Psycho" fame, comes with the fourth tale of this Amicus anthology film, which I liked very much, but it does provide some good genre entertainment, even though it is not very unpleasant or terrible <br /> <br /> It is a great actor is related to talking about the very suspicious Scotland Yard detective (John Bennett) who has been investigating the disappearance; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Elliott) talked about his latest creativity, which came to life with his appearance. <br /> <br /> Waxworks star stars Peter Cushing, a retired stockbroker, like Philip Grayson, with my ex-wife, is not an outrageous friend. Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) dives into a beautiful woman image found in the macabre wax museum. This episode is the most effective sleep sequence, though it's always as great as watching Cushing. The recent footage presented to us in this story is quite shocking. <br /> <br /> Another favorite favorite horror star, "Sweets for Sweets", Christopher Lee, Jane (Chloe Franks), a very fond of moppet, met very kindly, and the new friend / tutor Ann N Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter ). It solves the secret of the special episode; filmmakers do not cut their foolish hands, and when it comes to the full truth of the unhappy family, it comes more than a real shock. <br /> <br /> "Clothes" has four of the most open comedy; Dr. John Pertwee, one of many actors playing a role in Dr, is an entertaining thing for many years, for whom an empty, bold horror movie star (in fact, is the manifestation of this story). In the most recent budget, the quality goes out and gets its coat. Sait pants have strange forces. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a Pertwees partner; Here is an amazing example of humor, a unique piece of information that is unique to Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> Detective Inspector Holloway is an entertaining blend of his story "Out of the Blood-House", which Michael Dressun finds unusual, surprising and scary; I say "Crypt Tales", I do not like it, it's still good fun. Under Piter Duffel's, he moves slowly, but he's definitely moving towards the results he has reached and, of course, his type of movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
