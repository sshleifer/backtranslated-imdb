<br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi went to a low-budget refrigerator for Monogram Studios in the 1940s, and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The elderly spouse may look younger, kidnapping young brides, and then pushing the extracts out of his body. Once a reporter and a doctor have been brought to responsibility for the death of the bride after the night, this morning the police report these murders and the mad scientist is shot and soon dies. <br /> <This film has almost everything: the assistant to the scientist, the old house in Bela's house, the trick and the dwarf, the thunderous and strange passages. Bela and her husband spend more in coffins than in beds. <br /> <br /> Corps Vanishes looks especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 to 3 stars.
