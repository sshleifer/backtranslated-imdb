I liked the EARTH way loved. His photography is incredible, it is a challenge to edit and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. Additionally, music and sounding follow an in-depth experience you do not want to miss the EARTH. You are really on a visit that you will never end yourself. <br /> <br /> In some cases, you see the animals in daily struggle to survive, first of all I was very surprised by the laughter of the audience, and sometimes I could not help laughing at myself. Nature makes a great impression on you to understand. <br /> <br /> But if I do not need to laugh, I have asked deeply: "It's a 200 year industrial revolution that can destroy natural systems, thousands, thousands of years?" <br /> <br /> Considering this question After seeing the EARTH you will understand how I feel a little bit painless and weak. I immediately needed to change the world, to fight all these animals, to overcome past changes in the last century, and suddenly stop global warming (not all of them became NGOs activists!) ... <br /> <br /> I immediately watched the web at the end of the movie (www.loveearth.com) to see what I can do to escape the destructive destiny of our planet (and the polar bear). <br /> <br /> It was a little disappointing to find answers to my questions right there. But it was very interesting to learn more about the film and learn about the crew's struggle. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, it will cut off my energy usage. <br /> <br /> An inspirational film, however, did not know that the refugees had to swim to reach the land ... <br /> <br /> I did not feel the movie feeling very happy.
