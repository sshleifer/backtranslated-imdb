Many of the points I read are indicating that most people love the better than the second one. I feel completely different. Part One played a bit around trying to find different ways to show Che Guevara's identity by breaking back and forth between different scenes, different places and an interview and the Cuban revolution. For the most part, it was nice but somewhat entertaining. Second, O enters Bolivia and changes its geographical position, rules and structure. There are releases, "documentary realism" and releases, between spacial jumps and stocks. Instead, we are now trapped in a depopular landscape with Che, thinking that only those who are just there are boasting for their lives but that they are thinking of choosing to live. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of life? </ Span> </ span> </ span> <br /> <br /> One and Che: Part Two is the second two moves of the three movement structures, actually starting with Motorcycle Diaries. The motorcycle diary is China's (or more fitting, ideal) living in Argentina Che: Part One is its military leadership in Cuba and its collapse in Che: Part Two Bolivia. These films do not fully reflect his life (we will not miss their experiences in Guatemala and, more importantly, in my opinion, will be executed after the Cuban revolution), but they are creating a very detailed study of its character and the controversial aspects of its nature. <br /> <br /> Both are hindering the revolutionary failures that occur in the post-Alliance third world countries and their CIA intervention. However, all this is predicted on the screen that Che is more sincere, not at long-term perspective of dialogue and speeches, but at the end of the case and until the end of his life. Again, the rules have changed, and it is difficult to explain that there is no chance of success in this situation. The camera shows the number of people who have been stranded between rock and a difficult place and the number of desaturated, jerky long-wearing people who have been captured on the scene of the enemy, and revolutionary beliefs eventually saved people from the second hunt. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie is not easy, but very effective. <br /> <br /> PololarisDiB
