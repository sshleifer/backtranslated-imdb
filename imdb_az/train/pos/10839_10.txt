A few years ago, I saw this movie in the video store and rented it. <br /> <br /> My husband and I enjoyed it, bought the VHS and enjoyed it since then. <br /> <br /> The solution was discussed. Well, this movie deserves recurring views. Americans, for the first time, will not enter all the jokes. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, tactile, sad - all at the same time. While Ray's daughter offers toast in the wedding, it's sad. When Karen calls Tony "Brian", she tries to kiss, that's a hearty one. When Beano was eventually moved by a black woman, it is very funny for words. And music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack you've heard in these years. I'm dancing in the hall "All in the World". <br /> <br /> Every speech is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was fairly imitated by Ray's description of a man with a lot of bad experiences. Stephen Rea is perfect for Karen as a favorite keyboard player Toni, who fires in these years. Women have an attractive look that wants to hug him. But all actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Do not see the box you read about this movie and see it. It's a stone.
