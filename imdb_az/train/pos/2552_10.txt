Fatal Error is a really nice movie! The film includes Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis. The shooting of the film really made a good move. Robert Wagner played a good role. The relationship between Saboto Jr and Turner was wonderful. There is a great age difference, but they are a unique couple. Two actors worked really well. The music in the movie is really good by Ron Ramin and is very suitable for a flick. There is something you do not know what happens in the movie and what's going to happen in the future, and this movie goes from start to finish. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and watch this beautiful movie by Janine Turner!
