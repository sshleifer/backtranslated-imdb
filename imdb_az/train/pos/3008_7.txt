Missing William Powell. It is a joy to watch the screen while on the go without worrying around the world. He always appears at the top of his game and takes care of everyone who is suspicious of him. Crimes are projects, but not human. That's what I said, it's all part of it. Sometimes, besides the crying widow, sacrifices the function of being the cause of the film. Nothing more. There are enough twists and turns to keep things on track, and Powell is a master of it. Especially because it belongs to Asian singers, there are many political mistakes. This is a bit difficult. Casting is great and Curtis's direction is also a consistent asset.
