All Kira Reed fans should see it. The premiere of the movie fights against the romance novelist Kira, and a new idea can not emerge. She is also divorced. But she meets this guy in a restaurant and pulls it out of the shell (and clothing). They go to a corner room and they do it. Thankfully, Kira gets a condom (Do not tell me that these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core flies, remember them, safe sex). Later, the publisher was amazed at how big he was, but he did not take his name. Nevertheless, the boy finds it and continues strangely. But in the end she will hide herself and want to know more. Then all hell loosens and I will abandon him. It's the best I've ever seen with this soft-core Playboys movie. Check it out and marvel at Kira's magnitude.
