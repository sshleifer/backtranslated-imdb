This movie is a classic in every sense of the word. Very entertaining and very uncomfortable. Those who act in this movie work well. The story itself is convincing, suspense and well thought out. Character development is also good, the audience can clearly see how each character is emotionally tested through this film. The oppressors in this film are very threatening, for the first time, the audience can say that they have something to see when they see them. This film can be slowly transformed into wild and paradise-like animals, when it comes to a life-style or death, when a person is taken from culture and in the woods. Everyone does not like this movie, there is some content that disturbs some audiences. Must definitely watch. This film is a work.
