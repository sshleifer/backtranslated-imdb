Ugly is a very good movie! Robert Culp was very good at the movie and it was perfect for the part! It's hard to believe that this is a true story, but what can you do? When I was watching it, I thought it was necessary to do all this. It's not right, but they have learned the lesson when they are choosing a wrong person! Anyway, if you see this movie on the TV, look, it's a good thing!
