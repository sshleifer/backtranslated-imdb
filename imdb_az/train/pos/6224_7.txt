Fred Astaire and Hollywood's premier dance gang, Ginger Rogers, usually did not slide in cash in 1930s and largely outdated Art Deco sets. However, this 1936 anniversary is a bit lower for the fifth part of ten music. Astaire postponed his top hat, white gear and tails to become a bubblegum-chewing sailor named Baker at this time "Bake" Baker; and Roger, Bain's dance-racer, Sherry Martin, plays dance and something else - before he counts. Therefore, in contrast to the most common mistakes and romantic hesitations in most of the previous matches, they are a few of the starters of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mark Sandrich, In fact, Randolph Scott plays both films, on the other hand, this time as Bake's fraternal band, "Bilge" Smith. He collaborates with Harriet Hilliard with Irene Dunne (clearly understood this explanation). Only in the real life with Özzie Nelson and Hillary, who had been married ten years ago by Özzie and Harriet, Sheryl's nude daughter John is playing a difficult game for Bilge. In a clever field, she is given a makeup by a young, blond blonde Lucille Ball, and has a classic three-track gear called Kewpie-doll's favorite Betty Grable in front of Hilliard, Ball and a mirror. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the story, one is given to Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor, and it creates something like this ... Bake and Bilge are on the seafront in San Francisco, where there are Passenger ships in a dance floor. Bilge works when Connie comes as a dowdy spinster and then looks like a charming girl. Romantic blooms for both. Connie and Sherry take over the curves from their father, but money is needed to save money. Many misconceptions are happening in both relationships, but all of them work when they make a drummer into a theater and have a fundraising style. <br /> <br /> For the first time two tones - a random dance competition - sounds in the dance floor, but this unforgettable Irving Berlin tunes and trio give a good excuse for a trio for Astaire-Rogers dances. a physical ship set on tapping "Go To Yourself" and show "My Eating Like a Cart", which they showed to win, showed the rhythm of the comedy. But their latest dance is a classic return to a beautiful melodramatic piece with a beautiful arrangement called "Let's Face the Music and Dance". It is noteworthy that this film is not just an Astaire dance solo, but only one dance for Roger's films - an energetic tap called "Go Yourself". The Kremlin satin is decorated with sailor material, and it is the same film, most importantly, at the beginning of the film. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Actress, Astaire and Rogers are usually in a zesty comic form. While playing a role of a rogue virility with Scottish fiancee, Hilliard is an extremely dull creature, and as an old band singer, she performs two Berlin love songs in a frustrating way. Regardless of this, Astaire and Rogers are going through this basic review of magic created by them. There are a few good additions from the start of the 13-minute launch of Astaire and Rogers on the 2005 DVDs: "Navy: Dances of Foot Legs". A live-action cartoon and original theater trailer called "Can It Be Me" has a live action "soundie" called "Melody Master: Jimmie Lunceford and his dance orchestra".
