This show was a character in the American comedy because it was the first sitcom to play all Afro-American castles. Unfortunately, it has never been widely broadcast on British TV. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in the tower block. Father James is trying to control his house, but his wife Florida is always better. There are three children's artistic JJ, moody Thelma and young intellectual baby Michael. Always coming home, friend Willona from Florida. <br /> <br /> I watched the two episodes shown to youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and Evans Family - only two on the site). Why did an English watcher watch a series of cruises that were never seen or heard in his own country? The answer is abrupt. In 1976, the entire black sitcom was named The Fosters in England. Only two series were created and now seem to be forgotten. But I watched an episode and really amazed. Then I learned that comedies are similar to "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters, but with different names - Sam Foster Dad, his wife Pearl Foster, and Sonny (young Lenni Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. The friend of the pearl was Vilma. (I've written a review on this to read about the Fosters). While watching "Good Times", only two things disturbed me. First of all, the opening theme was a melody (terrible) and the second was the audience laughter. I like the audience laugh, but this one means a little laughing line, and the audience begins with shock and starts screaming. Apart from that, it was a very funny show. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Sex and Evans family - Series 1 episode 6. Foster's episode. Black was not sex in society. The other episode I saw was an episode of Black Jesus called "Fosters".
