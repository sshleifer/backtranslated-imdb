Great Woody Allen? Good Woody Allen? Indeed. When I found myself, I was very laughing along with the audience, and I often saw one of the best Woody Allen lines they heard. Aging Allen has created a suitable role for Scarlett Johansson's "father" ... well, kind. Some say Yohansson plays "young Dianne Keaton". I differ. He plays Woody's dialogue, his comedy has always a very similar sense ... well, a Woody Allen comedy. This is good for us. Undoubtedly, Vudin's dialogue is better than his last comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may find Woody's humor tiring, but we look forward to those who love the right things.
