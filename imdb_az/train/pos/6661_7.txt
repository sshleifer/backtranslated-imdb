We've been watching Gandhi for a long time. Basically, light is a description of Gandhi as a person who is a freedom fighter or principle. However, when I hear that Gandhi is a film that emphasizes that it is a Father, I note that there is a dark side and fewer people but an untested area. He showed courage. Fortunately, Anil Kapur (Producer) and Feroz Abbad Khan (Director) did. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Gandhi, who works in South Africa, with the white men and her husband. The latter Akshay (Harilal) joined his father's barrister, but his father (Gandhi) pushed (or encouraged) him to become a freedom fighter. Gandhi shows more credibility than formal education. Harilal tried to follow his father's footsteps, but changed his way of thinking to his wife, children, and dream of a great success, and then began to push between his son and his father. He finally defeated his father to continue his dream and leave on his own terms. He starts writing stories that are written in India but are larger and larger over time. <br /> <br /> The first Akshay. He has served the best of his role so far and has been completely convincing in the description of Harilal Gandhi. The event that reached the place where the dead body of her husband was located is a place where Akshay is a secretive and progressive actor. Darshan jariwala is as good as MK Gandhi and is capable of experiencing a larger life. He spoke well and very easily. Shefali Chaya (Now Shah) is a brilliant actress like Kasturba and has already proven her metal in TV series. Bhumika Chavla also performed well, but the actress's role was frustrated. The other actor justifies his performances. <br /> <br /> Technique and Makeup are also good, and the Duo tonal color image is very good, especially cinematography. The suit looks and is compatible with the context. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, if you look at a film that is slowly going out slowly and patiently when you challenge, it just gives you an idea of ​​the area that has not been brought to the silver screen. . Also, story progress and scene linking are some people and especially critics, but it's still enough for me as a middle-class movie watcher to occupy my place.
