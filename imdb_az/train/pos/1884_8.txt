This is one of my favorite comedies. Hero does not want to condemn the thirsty lifestyle, but alcoholism is inappropriate as it is worthless, and the film is simply a very entertaining thing. Although he was married to Susan because he thinks he could do something, Arthur says that he is capable of 40 successful, drunken, irresponsible. Arthur offers, but then unforgettable, Linda falls for a waitress and a small thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Artur, the world's most beloved drunk, who has a laugh of his antiques. Of course, I agree with Moore IS Arthur and those who can imagine another actor in this role. Fabric ladies are well illustrated. Liza Minnelli is as impressed as Linda and his chemistry with Moore is superior. Jill Clayburgh Susan chooses a rich and more fitting female for Arthur. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the film is made by Sir John Gielgud, who describes Arsur's sarcastic, but morally characteristic of Hobson. These two had a great deal of interactions with Hobson's long-term employment. Hobson is the best friend and mediator of Arthur's reluctant comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's romance, but an unusual relationship with this rude and, of course, persistent dissatisfaction. These are the butlers that you will remember the best after visiting the loan.
