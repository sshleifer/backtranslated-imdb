What a beautiful movie. The understanding of the nations that have been sent by giant robots to fight against each other is solid. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is extremely important. Unfortunately, never seeing the relationship between Achilles and Athena, he has developed more than a few kisses and Athena's fear of Athens's safety. Their romance is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
