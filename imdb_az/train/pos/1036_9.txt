Reyn watch is one of the best anti-propaganda films produced during the Second World War. Paul Lukas was, of course, worthy of his Oscars. Bette Davis shines brilliantly as a great actress and beauty. I invite this movie to those who are interested in it and, of course, to the legendary films of the late, great Bette Davis.
