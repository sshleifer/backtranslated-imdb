This is the best mob film ever made. He deserves more than what he earned in Oscar. The best picture would be for the director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Supporting Actor (Newman and Law), easily selected and won, his account, art direction, supporting role (Newman)! Hanks gave one of his best performances, and Michel Jr's playing kid was very good, and I was surprised to see more of today's movies. Critics did not give enough credit to this movie. But besides incredible performances, another real star of this movie is incredible music. It was the best score of the year. I became a candidate, but I won. This is a great movie that can be seen by anyone. Az-A +
