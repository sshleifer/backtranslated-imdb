The storyline was quite interesting, but the characters were quite straight, and sometimes they were too much in their thoughts / actions. More than it is needed. And I also think that something in the cast is wrong. John Turtorro does not really provide me a semi-autistic chess player playing, not really speaking Italian player. <br /> <br /> The goals are not described too much. <br /> <br />
