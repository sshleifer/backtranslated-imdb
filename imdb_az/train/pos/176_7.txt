ALLEGED VIOLENCE Attention. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were two of the best. Okay, so a former outsider who was working on a biker for his clothes (SPOILER HERE) was funny. The head of this man was also good. But the movie was really Sarandon and Hawn. These two have to spend more time on the screen. They want chemistry. The scene in the bathroom-WOW! Romantic, cute, yummy. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a cocktail party that ends in a white house in the middle of an area due to the resurgence of a foreigner and longing for politicians. Talking about Sarandon will be too far away. CLAIMS This is a very unusual romantic / political comedy and provides a bit more - the political party is much more than romantic. <br /> <br /> Touching on political issues and just touching romantic areas. <br /> <br />
