It is not a good idea to watch the Hundstage movie if you are unsure of 100% mental stability, this movie will be tested regardless of how healthy you are. Hundstage is not a fun movie, it is an artistic film, so most viewers do not have the level of "maturity" to reach the unpleasant side. Like Tarkovski's films, it differs in some ways. I can not say I have had a lot of fun watching. But Hollywood's proposed clich√© has a very nice and exciting experience for those suffering only. Hundstage puts a finger on your right brain and squirms all of your mind. You just can not sit back and watch it, you'll use your respect or watch the movie open. A film similar to that in style was Nachtgestalten but a better and less intense film. For example, this is not for children, or for mentally handicapped or bad guys. Most viewers would probably give 10 or 1 movies. It was better than I was seeing a movie phenomenon in more than one story in another movie. But this is a great part of itself. You have to watch, but be prepared to see something disturbing.
