ALL animation if it's big. This movie is classic, because it's strong in two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this movie are beautifully illustrated. I felt all the characters and the human-animal relationships in the movie perfectly work. Beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation did not work better in another movie. This is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. From 8 to 10 a.
