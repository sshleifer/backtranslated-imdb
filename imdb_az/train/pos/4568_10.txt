Seriously, you can imagine the spread of a talent in a film without a big budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor, and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis are worthy of awards: But it was true that O'Conor (like Young Christie) and McAnally were right: this clich√© is right here: they do not fulfill their roles. Day-Lewis's performance is a tour force - it's such a transformation that's frightening, but that's a sign of academy's intelligence, and besides this performance, Brenda Fricker's beautiful, limited, realistic, and heartbreaking work is like Christie's mother. By the way, if you have not seen this magnificent actor in "Swann", this is another film that needs to be checked (and beautiful Miranda Richardson).
