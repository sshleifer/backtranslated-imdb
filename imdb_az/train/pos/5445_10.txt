I've seen this movie ten years ago and thought it was really funny. It was not as bad as some critics began to realize. The truth that generally is written by reliable John Hughes shows at least some comic dialogues. (By the way, I think the Strange Science, which was written by Hughes at the speed of light, is pretty good). <br /> <br /> All the main colors of the film are red, blue, and so on. provides a unique look. Casting is also good. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;
