I was very pleased with this movie and had very few expectations for all the negative reviews I read before leaving. I was interested in all this fuss because I went because some articles were very angry with this movie and the Koreans. Oh and some of my favorite movies, from Korea. I liked the Host but it's definitely my favorite. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify; ">> It was not mixed as everyone said, and the monsters looked good and fought in battles. The story has some gaps, but it does not matter. When I see things like this, and when I see the summer blockbusters, I stopped asking why I had been asking for a long time ago. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation item was different, and the protagonist was dressed suspiciously as Korean actors in other shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe the combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
