This show is good. I love the player, the funny bit and its sharpness. Actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... and others. The show was originally intended to bring back deadly people and, as people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a bit lower, but later they looked back, starting with a fun, ridiculous idea. Now I really hate it will be canceled. Why does not ABC allow you to finish all the episodes after they are finished? I would like to know how the truth is. I think it's a chance to give it a lot of fans because I love it.
