This film has gone through cracks in film history. It is better than the other New York films of the same period: "French Connection" or "Pelham 1-2-3 Purchase". There is a strange truth that allows the film to effectively use humor to maintain a cunning line. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman is becoming a bravura performance like "Batman" and his career is headed by Gordon Parks, and comes after the "Shaft", first of all, this is a strange choice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film has not been featured in DVD or VHS in the United States, and there are actually some stones in their hands, and something like this is a part of the previous effort and is close to your business. they are not a shame.
