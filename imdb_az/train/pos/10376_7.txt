I just watched Roll and it turned out to be a happiness. Toby Malone's performance was truly remarkable, and I myself thought about Matte in all parts of the film, and it's a very tall, very short time, with a good mixture of rounded heroes. There are also good good twists, which will last approximately. Other characters to look at are completely crazy Tiny and secretly charming Jesse. Hollywood can not have a big budget, but it does not let you put it, you can do something worse than checking it, and you will not regret it. Good fun. 7/10
