Each of us must see this movie because each of us has been broken one by one and this can help us: 1) My life is not as bad as I think, and 2) It is important to accept a child as possible. There are so many. Thinking about the fact that the film is actually thinking about a real human being has made us think deeply about life and the world. Corrupt, but corruption does not need to reach your home. We all have a choice! <br /> <br /> I would like to shoot films titled "Color Purple" and "Woman, You Art Lose" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all. Movies that give life to us and give us a sense of life.
