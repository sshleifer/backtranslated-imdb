ABC has done more for this show, allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to participate in the show. Initially, the show could be viewed and even predicted by John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and three kids really play a solid role. After the death of John, the lesson he taught me in real life was home to me. At age 17, I left my father and understood and understood his pain and suffering. The ABC should be proud of protecting this demonstration, which should protect John as the ultimate wish. This show has evolved and evolved over such uncertain situations. Emmys should be rewarded.
