Must see another Downey! If you are a discreet fan like me, you should see this movie! He was 22-year-old Yale Grad's footballer Alex Finch. It's only 26 years ago. Alex is a reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a foolish lawyer who is not married in a happy marriage with Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie died in a car crash in a year. She demands Alex Finch's body to return only this time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Robert Downey Jr., <br /> <br /> Although this movie is 15 years old, it still re-incarnation. If so, how will you answer the life of the same soul after life? I do not know the answer. But I know you need to see this movie. This rebellion and Downey look very good on a tuxedo. This movie believes in love, and true love never dies. It's just turned down.
