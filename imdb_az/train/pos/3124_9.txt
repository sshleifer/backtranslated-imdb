Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room with blood in his hands, just trying to figure out what he is doing. At the same time, a CIA head of NYC reflects the agency's response to what's happening only on the screen. An American flag stands proudly at the center of his desk at the front of the department, but when he speaks, he turns the plan into a somewhat rugged area of ​​advancement and, as long as it does not want to be related to the course, the government's decision is essential for national security. <br /> <br /> This stroke effectively captures the film's mood. In addition to learning how Bourne is Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also a study of human costs of measures taken to protect us for stability and security. <br /> <br /> Probably the best movie you can see in this year's cinema. <br /> <br /> It's so tight. Bourne Simon Ross (Considine) says, "This is not a newspaper story, it's the truth," and you almost believe in the audience. The camera is shaken, but it's pretty stable for you to see everything and feel like Bourne is trying to burn her back, and the speeches are so good that these guys are able to act as acting actors rather than just the characters you describe. Event scenes are rapidly moving forward and at least seem to be instinctive, not those planned for action. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> It's moving towards its outcome, but not so fast that it's a fight to break you up leads; scripts provide the information as quickly and accurately as possible before moving to the next intense campaign. Although they are often simple (Waterloo's sequence is mainly a person on a phone that is watched by a person on the phone), they are charged with dramatic intensity so you do not take them out of your eyes. <br /> <br /> The name of national security, the Bourne series, shows the uncertainties of our age exactly who holds it. Ultimatum is its peak.
