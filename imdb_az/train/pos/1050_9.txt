This beautiful documentary provides an overview of the life of brave women in Cameroon's court system - police, lawyers, and judges. In spite of many difficulties, the claimants and defendants - the brave, the mighty women, the lack of means, the hopeless poverty of the people, the numerous languages ​​and numerous legal precedents in the region and the religious and ethnic origin of the country - this is a rare thing - a little bit of humanity is a truly inspiring film that rebuilds your faith. Despite the tyranny that we have seen in the film, these passionate, diligent women have begun to work fairly. <br /> <br /> I only hope that this film will be released widely in the United States. More people see this movie better.
