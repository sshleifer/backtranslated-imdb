The good story is a bit difficult to watch for the first time, but it's because it's dancing to all the bare breasts' 70s painted vampire / witches bongo drums. Of course, it was cut off by several vampires. And there are many interesting candles and they are used for them. Girl in action, vampire or ... this movie is just rocks!
