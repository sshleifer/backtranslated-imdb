For all the reviewers of this page, I would like to see this movie. It was established in 1972. The fashion in the film was the same fashion of his time. People who have not studied decades of culture think that this film is a cheese ball. According to the modern series, "behind the back" (which is being prepared for our time) looks at the cheezy look. The only evolutionary part of the film is still fashionable in the past for more than 30 years. BUT. The message sent in this movie is very powerful and carefully maintained. Almost there is a lot, but I refuse to say that. (to be afraid of being protected) Go out and see this movie! If you do not like the message you are sending, there are issues that require some attention!
