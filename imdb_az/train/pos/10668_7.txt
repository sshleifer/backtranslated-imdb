Here, as we have seen in many reviewers, the movie version differs slightly from the scenario version of the story. I have never seen the scene version of the story and, therefore, better reviewed the film's review. Perhaps Richard Attenborough is not the best choice for the film director, but the movie is still an entertaining account of a few dancers trying to spend a great time at the show of choreographer Michael Douglas. The movie is correct, without choosing any popular actor or performer in the final experimental group. From this point of view, the dancer's actions and individual stories and the fight when marathon days are held. Douglas is probably the best choice for partial. As you can see, some songs have been cut off for a new benefit and a story of costume clich√©-rhythm has been added to create a romantic relationship between dancer and choreographer. In all fairness, I can say that this was the weakest part of the film. Cassie's relentless interventions are almost unheard of, when used with attempts at artistic professions, where there is almost no talent and / or chance of action. However, this feature of the film has caused death in the past, and it is interesting to see that this tired old shoe stands up again. The dancers themselves started up with enough confidence in the number "I Can Do It", but the dancers had little fun at different points while explaining their stories. Of course, their stories differ little in the real life, which did not have such a chance. *** 4 stars.
