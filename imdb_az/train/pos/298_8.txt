New York has never been so good! And there is no one in this movie. Although the script is a little lightweight, you can not help this movie or any character. Almost like people like that. The actors' appeal is really good (John Ritter, Colleen Camp, and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good). Come on, and we'll be happy to take this movie.
