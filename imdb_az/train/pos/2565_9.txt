In fact, this film was interested in the prejudices that arose in front of them, along with the post-war relationships between American military men and Japanese women in Japan. Brando hates Japan (who, of course, is a WW2 thinker) who wants to marry a Japanese woman and marry her. His performance is good (I'm not the biggest admirer of his player style) and the movie looks very nice. <br /> <br /> The Red Knights took the Oscars for another GO's touched performance in love with Japan (although Japanese women also played a beautiful job). <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil it <br /> <br /> This movie tells SOMETHING and enjoys it at the same time. Very reasoned stone.
