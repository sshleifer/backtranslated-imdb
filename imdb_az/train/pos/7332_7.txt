As a child, I watched these tracks, but when I bought the Blue Underground immediately because of the Limited Edition, it is now just for my watchlist - it's Bakshi's American POP (1981) late night on Italian TV (see the following movie review) !! Anyway, I consider the derivation if the movie is played with a rousing discovery, with a pretty good sword and wizard animation epic, imaginable-looking backgrounds (quite unusual rotoscoped characters were, admittedly, less).
