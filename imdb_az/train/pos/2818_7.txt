"Dragonlord" Chan returns to "Dragon" from "The Young Master". Although much of the first movie did not take place. His older brother, Kaplan, is nowhere to be seen; Marshall, his daughter or son, played in the original film by Yuen Biao perfectly. Dragon has the same hostess - probably all other students have moved to other things. (Dragon's laziness in training is heavily reflected in this film, maybe she is still learning!) Under the title of "Young Lover Love", this film is a village girl from Dragon (at least for the first sixty minutes) different idiots and slapstick ways. His love for his rival has long been a friend of Chan Stunt-team member Mars (unmatched name "Cowboy"). After returning to their foolish schemes we see different scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a scene where the movie is unhappy, resulting in a failure in the box office. That is, I'm sure the expectations are quite high, and I feel that this film does not make a fair decision based on its essence. But when I try to do it, I still think it's a problem with the movie. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> Because of past events, it's not as bright as the other case. <br /> <br /> What really survived the film is the final sequence. As with the "Young Master", there is a fantastic final shot full of incredibly exhausting activities - you really feel every blow. Again, Chan opposes the same opponent of the "Young Master" (here is the same character?), Here is the time and energy of the brilliant. The style of using the last bit of the surrounding environment to defeat the opponent of the bell - just not to rely on pure physical ability - is clearly seen here, as elsewhere. The barn they are fighting is packed with clever little sticks and improvisations. This is an absolute attribute of the film and one of Chan's incredible career. <br /> <br /> You do not need to prequel to look at the Dragonlord, but in fact even more questions can hope for more. Answer. However, the original film is said to be a super movie and is considered to be "DragonLord", it is evident that attention to the girl's pursuit and team sports is noticeable. Fortunately, some of his proposed scenes (plus a fantastic service cock-scene) push the line as a sci-fi film in this genre.
