Kurt Russell was the closest person to appear in the show business as Elvis, and much of this film was a liar. First of all, the producers claim that the 9-year-long "Elvis" 69-year-old popular live show was launched for films with white costumes in 1972. Also, the "burning love" first introduced in 1972 was the 'miracle' we first recorded in 1970. They also claim that all Elvis fans have received their first guitars for Christmas, when they know it's for her birthday. I know that all the movies based on the past are fraudulent, but this is so clear to people who love Elvis.
