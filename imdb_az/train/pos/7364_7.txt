It's not always easy to explain what a movie is, but this time I think I've found it. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded two films: Trainspotting (small time criminals did some stupid things in Schotland taking medicines) and Blair Witch Project (due to shooting style). <br /> <br /> Two friends, one escaped from prison, the other remained unmarked. She is in the Scottish village with a stolen vehicle, but runs out of gasoline. They do not find any farms because they are trying to find some fuel. Farmer thinks they want to rob him and shoot one of them. All of this goes wrong. One of the comrades accidentally hit the farmer's daughter and forced to flee. A man hunt with Scotch's fields and forests. <br /> <br /> This film was shot only in 12 days. Okay, this is not unbelievable, because its largest part is always in the same place: Scottish village, but still so striking. Especially this is not a really bad movie. This is perhaps not the biggest film, but it is still proud of what it has achieved. I had a wonderful time watching it and generally enjoyed the movie. I give it 7/10.
