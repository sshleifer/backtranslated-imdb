It's an incredible movie to watch or show the young people. In addition to a very short nuclear scene, the colonial rulers in Africa give an interesting idea, and in other films you will find it rarely. It has a superficial similarity outside of Africa, but without all the romantic hairs. The white French people in Cameroon are interested, because they do not accept the local population as human beings. The whites are all managers and wait for the Black Sea Service without question. However, unlike real men, only once you hear the whites say "thank you" and nothing else is given to these people. Nevertheless, like animals or slaves, people's feelings are never considered. <br /> <br /> The basic description of this illusion is the relationship between mother, Aimée and her servant, Protée. Even though they spend a lot of time together, they can begin to have sex with each other. White woman never adopts Protée or her feelings. A good example of this illogicality is that Protée's dress was abusive and he was so angry that he was so angry. In addition to these connections, almost all Whites have not fully paid attention to the fact that Africans are human, but many should resort to verbal abuse and act as garbage. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that Protée and the little girl (who is the start and end of the film). <br /> <br /> In some cases, she is more like a toy or a cat, and the girl never plays with native children. <br /> <br /> Separately, the bellies think better, unfortunately, its character is very controversial and mixed. For a moment, she's working hard with Blacks or eating with them (another whites will never do anything) and try to beat the next Protée! I could only guess that he was motivated - perhaps he was just mad or nude, or perhaps trying to mix darkness (who knows!) Against the Baptists. <br /> <br /> This movie really seems to have spent a lot of this character, in addition to many good scenes. <br /> With a child's perspective in a small period of his life. What can be done to get rid of absolute and colonial rule, and the film has left me wanting more. The film began in the early 1980s (for a Walkman style headset) and was filmed in the 1960s (more or less) when the film was withdrawn in time, but never in the 1960s in the 1950s gained violence or independence against colonialism. I thought some of this confusion would have to have been made by filmmakers in the early 1970s and early in the 1950s before the political change in the country. <br /> <br /> The use of the prologue and epilogue, like traveling adults, is a good idea than the missing content and the confusion over time. Also, I realized that it was an unpleasant surprise that you could find out more about the beautiful person who introduced her to your beloved. But in general, only one thing is felt as missing - there is no resolution or message except that colonialism is unconscious and cruel.
