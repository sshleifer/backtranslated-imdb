On July 27, 2005, I first saw a movie on the BBC. It was a good recipe for Conan Doyle for me, and I really think about what Sherlock fans think about it. I think it's a movie for these fans or I think they do not accept them. You can ask Doyle whether he is a strong person or not. But he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how many half-biography was it? Instead, this is a little less than this, a movie you need to watch - even though you are not interested in movies or books of Sherlock Holmes, watch it, enjoy yourself and have your own opinion.
