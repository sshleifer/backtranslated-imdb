Okay, so FX is not a high budget. But this story is based on actual events. A few rich actors, something that is thrown together to become richer! Like most books based on books, there's just something incompatible. Only a few people believed that most of this film was not based on real events! This movie is in no way affiliated with TWISTER! Both films are linked to tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those who are experiencing problems in the science of storms and storms in the film, there are a few things to remember ... "night night" was June 3, 1980. Thus, this film was released 16 years after actual events. Try to think about how storm research has developed in that period. It happened in a larger city; Grand Island, Nebraska, is the third largest city in the state. The film tells the city something else and says it is a small town.
