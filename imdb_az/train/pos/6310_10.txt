<br /> <br /> I did not wait to see the last copy of the Slavic Village-Broadway area to watch some of the shooting. <br /> <br /> I did not laugh at Cleveland Prime Minister on Thursday while watching this movie For a long time it sounds in comedy! It's a great slapstick. The Russo Brothers directed a wonderful job. The whole tower performs the best comedic activity ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors, and he's great as a cut off cut off in this snipe. I was the most characteristic of "Riley" by William H. Macy and Michael Jeter's "Toto," which kept you in "stitches". I believe the whole film is the most fun role.
