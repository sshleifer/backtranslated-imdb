It does not want to be tempted by many critics and Kurosawa fans, but it was fine. An episodic multi-character study of Tokyo's most populous people lives in a town that is literally a city of garbage. Even though it seems like A-Bomb, Technicolor's dignified use of the film has a calm beauty. The head comes from a crazy young man who takes a naked imaginary tram to the driver. All the heroes were beautiful and all the stories were considered, but perhaps the most tragic person is anxious about the man and the young man living in an abandoned car. When they are not looking for food, they use their dreams to set their sleeping home dream home. Emotionally moving and beautiful movie.
