Without a doubt, a very good idea, the scenario was OK. It could have been better. If you are a perfect adventure lover, this is not a bad idea if Atlantis is a new idea about the world that has lost. this idea had more potential than that. They had to end with a better adventure than that. It was not bad, but it would be better with more runtime. it was boring or not good ... It's a good thing for people who love adventure animations like Sindbad, as a way to Dorado. This movie is also very nice to be happy to look for people looking for a nice little adventure.
