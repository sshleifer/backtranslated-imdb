I am biased, I am the author of The Hungry Bachelors Club, published in 1994. The scenario is written by my good friend and ac linguist Fred Dresch, inspired by Marlon's character in the film. I can not be more satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the film as a whole, and will comment more. But my character Jorja Fox playing Delmar Youngblood is perfect. Carries most of the emotional means with beautiful shape. I could not do better myself! It looks like a real person, mastered by a difficult formula and grateful to the racist prejudices, is beautiful and heartfelt.
