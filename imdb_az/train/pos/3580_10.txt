I do not think such a movie will be released today. <br /> <br /> But what's in this movie is an interesting thing. Learn how family is involved in sadness. When the voice of language and the great loss of treatment are silent to us, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Reasonable and impatient sadness is anger, even hatred. And, unfortunately, the main character in the movie (a young boy who fights and kills his brother while hunting) is given more than his fair share. He finally set off and moved to his father (Wilford Brimley), telling him that he was an accident. <br /> <br /> He knew that this young man was in the heart, but I had to hear that from his parents and to get their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: lack of dialogue. A great deal of attention was paid to physical reactions and facial expressions. And the slow pace of the movie allows the actors to really watch the reactions. <br /> <br /> We do not do many things with today's films. <br /> <br />
