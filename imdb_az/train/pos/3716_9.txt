I saw a cure for a cure at Cracker Bag last night without watching the front view of Disney's Holes. I do not know who decided to show it, but I am very happy. Cracker Bag is an absolute boat for Australia in the early 80's as seen through a child's eye. Eddie and her brother were "cheerful" and were, as the rest of the film, true to life. Every shot has brought a great sense of nostalgia because it reminded me of my childhood (maybe the director can have the same age, probably a bit helping) and the sense of sound increased. Only one day I hope to see the Cracker Bag.
