<br /> <br /> It's unique since 1950, when the film's main role fell to the ruins of the crowds destroying the past and ruin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dana's eyes reveal pain in her eyes, Carl Malden is as superior as her master, does not give up any shamelessness, but gives compassion to those who follow her. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger just made this movie. If there are any mistakes, it will take Gen Tierney's beauty to a strange place with breath-taking cops. The scenes inside the cafe are beautiful and true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully is perfect as Gary Merrill, the title of his father's bit piece. Great lighting and mood. I love the building where the deadly deeds are in a high atmosphere, the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8.
