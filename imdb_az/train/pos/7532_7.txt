The new Batman adventures (also called Gotham Knights) occur 5 years after Batman's latest episodes: Animated Series (B: TAS) and broadcast for only 24 episodes. This is not a terrific show, but it's not as good as the original Batman Animation Series. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the animation itself is: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always shiny red and orange, B: TAS did it, but it was pulled over a dark palate, The show is very bright in the show. All this is just like any other kids' show and does not look like Batman: TAS made it a dark, cool art style in Gotham. The art style is good, but Batman is no longer reminiscent of it. Each character is made up of straight lines, squares and triangles, and symbols are less like human beings. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters resemble the compiled versions of real people. The animation can be more consistent here than B: TAS, but it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Next: Some episodes have dropped very low and seem like childhood, but some are more powerful than B: TAS. (Two people who attempted to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2) get some pretty villainous treatments). It leads me to the next point. <br /> <br /> Because in the future and in the last episodes of the Batman Animated Universe, many bad guys escape or die forever. Poison Ivy is drowned when a ship is exploded; Two Face nearly Penguin, Killer Croc and himself killed, he moved to Arkham forever; Joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (though he is back to the series of Justice League animations later); Catwoman, Batman and so on. Leaving France abandoned ... The end of the series does not mean just getting rid of some of the great characters! The motifs of the crooked are also very bad. Not yet! B: In the TAS, we learn that these cruel oppressors are suffering and their lives are destroyed, so they behave exactly as they do, and they only commit crimes to advance the story. It does not only save Batman, but only the health of those who are in the battles. This is a cold and joint version of the Batman character, but I can see why it's so tough because it's been doing this for many years. <br /> <br /> Then, the revised character models are horrible. Gordon down to about 100 pounds ... sick? Many bad guy STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc WORST). Although some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). <br /> <br /> Harley is the same thing and Ivy (even now hotter) has light green skin. <br /> <br /> The series has many errors, some episodes are great - Edge, Mad Love, Creeper, Girls Night, Old Wounds, Darkness Legends and Fear is My Best. <br /> <br /> The absolute WORST part of this show is that creators love this series's animation more than the original. About the features of the original Batman Animated Series DVD features they are proud of how they have the art style and how difficult they have some animated animation, but they are successfully (for example, the challenging animation needed for Clayface animation). In the DVD features of the new Batman adventures, the creators are basically "B with H: TAS, this fresh, new vamp, it looks better, and we love it directly with EXCELLENT VALUES!" They say! (OK, this is an exaggeration). When the developers put beautiful art style B: TAS, it really bothered me! <br /> <br /> This is not a bad show, but I like the original animation series. At least the show does not speak to the audience, so I still praise it. In this series, some episodes are fantastic and worth watching. <br /> <br /> Superman: The Animated Series and the Justice League: The Animated Series shows Batman's great track: Animated Series and New Batman Adventures, so give them an hour.
