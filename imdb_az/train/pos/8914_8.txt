I grew up in Royersford, Pa, where Jerry's market is. I remember all my family going to watch the shooting. I remember a man who showed me and my brothers a Blob in a bucket. I would also like to share my mom's movie. Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsaut and she was ill one evening and wanted to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for a few shots after seeing my mom. They paid $ 25.00 and gave him a story until he died in mid-August. My mother was not a teenager, and she spent several months since my younger brother's birth.
