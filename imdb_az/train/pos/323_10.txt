This is a perfect movie with a revolutionary message (in form and content), which should not be missed by any French fan or the underground movie. But there are loans for opening or closing - we've just fallen into the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This movie has little to do with documentaries and is more interesting when it comes to advertising and its relationship to reality. True and inaccurate lines are cut through ways that are familiar to documentary films, but this time we do not pursue it for consumer and marketing purposes.
