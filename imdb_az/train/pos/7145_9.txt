This movie was a great ensemble of adults, and if there were any justice, it would play the role of young actors in the movies for a long time. The director and editing was very nice. I have to look at it from the book and I must be very nice. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson, were an explosion to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis seemed to have seen enough, but when they were on the screen, they had fun. Children in the camp could not have been better. (as I said, I liked it!)
