For all the murder junkies out there, this movie was great! Every single character in the show has created an image in the film. It helped solve some (but not all) issues from the series. Unfortunately, unless you really watch the series, most of the taste will disappear as you put heavy references on every season of movie consciousness. It would probably fit a number of finals against a separate movie, but we must get things we can get. I hope they will shoot more movies and continue their Law and Order Criminality Symbols.
