Now only Sean William Scott is just like Stifler for Performance, but then the quality has dropped, while only American Pie 1 and 2 love it. The Band Camp has kept the normal level with the characters you really look at, but Naked Mile was the same joke and graphic lines (Erik Stifler's sex problem was like Jim). As a soccer player, Coozeman had some fun moments like 'penalty', but there was usually no originality, and 'Mile' was just stupid and moronic. You can not talk about an irritating girl who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to Naked Mil. I looked at the Beta House with anxiety and thought that the array would hit a new one, but I was pleasantly surprised. There is no real space to be honest, but full of hot girls (Ashley's incredible) and aplenty of sex jokes. Yes, it's a formulator and jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with very neat performance. The Greek Olympics brings the latest and last occasions to the fun, and Christopher McDonald's is not funny. There are weak points though. Coozeman is in a state of irritation as in the first place, and I am still as bad as part of it. <br /> <br /> If Coozeman is bad, Eric Stifler is worse. John White was a pain to watch Naked Mile, but his performance in the Beta House dropped to a new low. First of all, charisma is a condition of a Stifler. Indeed, he does not care less about him. The only reason I was worried about his relationship was Ashley's on the screen! He shines on him as the rest of the fortress. Seriously, John White is characterized by extremely bad behavior in a bad way. <br /> <br /> The film is fun, and Coozeman's daughter is laughing brightly, expressing that she is not a full girl. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is worth the rent, some of your spouses and laughs in vomit-fest events and Erik 'loser' will break your anger at Stifler.
