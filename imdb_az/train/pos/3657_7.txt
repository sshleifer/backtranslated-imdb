This movie resembles the Ettore Scola's Brutti golfing and cattivi version of the 1950s. Little reality and less realism, but a tale with great humanism and warmth. I say it's a neo-realistic picture. It should be classified as a comedy, though it is very sensitive and more tale-like and very serious (although it's a little like Chaplin or a comedy in 1930). Although it's typical Italian, it's hard to stay apart from a cold, cold-blooded person. Sezimentalism is a disappointment, although this picture is a real drama. This is not a work like Umberto D or Bicycle Thief. <br /> <br /> 7/10
