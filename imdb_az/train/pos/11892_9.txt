Pialat, people in extreme emotional state, usually with a few violent scenes. In La Gueule, he deals with the terrible effects of a woman who died of cancer on her husband and son. A nos amours leads to violent clashes with a teenage girl's sexual experience family. Here, we have a very bad young woman who left her husband to go out with a sexy old man. His motivation is a little cloudy because Loulou is not able to read or discuss anything more difficult than television shows; On the other hand, he has an incredible body (why did Depardieu do any sports movies to show this physics?). <br /> <br /> There is a lot of impression on the cast. Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to perform gentle and inadequate performance (he gave most of them); Depardieu plays with all the dynamism and charm of Loulu - he sees the scene, stabs in the intestines, runs away and looks for treatment, and then works with Nelly soon. Guy Marchand, with those dark eyes and regretted looks, Nelly's husband is playing well; Coup de foudre is a beautiful duplication of pairing.
