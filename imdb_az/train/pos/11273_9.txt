A year after the beautiful Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) likes to rival Tarzan, hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) turns to the wood, which has another bash to gain the heart of the brunette babein. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Carriers, Harry finally it's even worse to find that Jane is still full of muscle yods, Tarzan does not allow hunters <br /> <br /> Nasty Arlington has killed a monkey and fired She decides to solve the problems, and then says Jane and Holt, who was attacked and eaten by Tarzan's crocodile. Of course, Tarzan is dead, not just injured; <br /> <br /> After returning to health by Difficult (!), he stepped in to rescue Jane from a tribal tribal lord who attacked the Holt expedition. <br /> <br /> Tarzan And His Mate, the second star of the star as a jungle man of several words to Weismuller, are often referred to as the best of the series; Although I'm a little bit original, I can definitely understand the popularity of the movie: it's damn sexy and has some great action range! The unbelievable chemistry of Weismuller and O'Sullivan is incredible and causes a few beautiful evidences and many silver costumes for both stars, and there is something particularly impressive for the audience of both sexes (although O'Sullivan is very praiseworthy ) <br / The most exciting moments of the film are a beautiful submarine fight between Tarzan and a crocodile and in the form of Jane's lion and the local population, but his beau, monkey palsy, and load of elephants The whole lion's crushing regime (once raped by me in the first film, it's a shocking shock like a pigma there is nothing). <br /> <br /> Cetin, Tarzan and her husband have some bad influences and dissatisfied majority suffer a little? Dodgy back projection, a few ridiculous monkey suits, more masking of African Indians as African troops and sneaky trapeze swings? this fun movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
