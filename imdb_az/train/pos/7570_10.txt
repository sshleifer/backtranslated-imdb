I recently bought a very low-level Dreamcast and went to the city to find some games to use. I bought Soul Calibur (Classical) and then entered the Resident Evil Code Veronica area. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2 and I have played 3 times in Res Oyl 3 times and I have been amazed at them all, especially since no history is classic I need to fall into 1 date. <br /> <br /> But none of the three Brilliant Gory approached Gameplay's sleepless attempt. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <strong> This story goes through the 2nd part of Claire Redfield's search for his missing brother (Chris - 1st story) under the guise of a frightening umbrella. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Claire, with the super hairdresser Steve's assistant, must help her to discover the truth. his brother's place. The 2nd CD allows Chris to manage, so if you can move away from the room in fear, the management is very tough and the motion of the characters is a great fact. Characteristic warnings are dangerous, he looks at the direction from which he is. PURE GENIUS! <br /> Generally, this game is 10/10, because it's just the game of the year, the decade game and the world's best game! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
