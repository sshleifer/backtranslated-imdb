I really enjoyed this movie. Although the mother was a little bit harder, the adult actors had a great deal of action. But he was very good at being a new talent. This humor is very spectacular, not just on your face as Hollywood comedy junk. I. Naked professor If you have a little attention and if Hollywood is used for typical things, you probably will not want it because it's a bit slow pace. I took Blu-ray and I have to say that the image quality is top notch. Probably one of the better visible Blu-ray I've ever seen. Attachments were very cool. They erased it a bit, but that's probably a good thing, because most of the deleted scenes did not really add anything.
