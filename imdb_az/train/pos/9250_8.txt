Clark Gable is a man who busts on the life of a harsh boiled Mrs. Jean Harlow. She tries to put her in the brush when she is tough-wearing. Despite their cynicism and cons, they are in love. When Gable died as a result of an accident, she stopped going to the women's prison where Harlowu was pregnant. Anita Loos 'and Howard Emmett Rogers' writings are excellent with a very well-drawn and striking character (with a stereotype trail, including the Jewish Socialist Women's Prison and the Black Prison and his propagated father). Gable and Harlow actors have shown themselves by adding nuances and strangers to typical Gable and Harlow characters. And Sam Vud is a better direction than you expect. A beautiful shot caused Harlow to jail, and then went to a stunning snowy courtyard for his tracks after the camera. It is also one of the best genres of "love criminals" and "women's prison" genres, and has one of the best solid-state dialogue ever written.
