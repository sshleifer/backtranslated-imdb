Bless Bless 80's slasher films from God Bless. This is fun, funny movie. This is Slasher movies. Now I'm telling horror films, I just shoot movies. It happens: All these stupid lungs and cheerleaders choose high school nerd, and then one of their games goes extremely wrong. Marty begins to kill young people one by one after spending a revenge on a Joker / Jester mask (a pretty creepy looking, add-on) after managing to manage them to believe in a middle-aged middle school. Is this mainly a plot? What's this? The beauty of 80's slasher films would be the majority of them. Too many things can be ridiculous, but as they go, they 'get you more'. Especially this movie. <br /> <br /> Some offenses are offensive, and some are extremely creative. (a beer poisoning, acid bath, and I can not remember a jaw that was first used in any other slasher movie) This is a really entertaining, fun movie. That's all this. Let us never forget the heroic characters, their foolishness, and the angry, accidental things happening in this film. The memory can be controlled by the killer (even if you see it until no button is gone) and the toilets can cough up with blood, the baths are able to get out of it, just a part of your fun! <br /> <br /> These are 80s slashers. You never know why such films are never accessible? Not more than 80. So you have to devote them to good and good entertainment! <br /> <br /> This movie comes as June 13, when you are a fan of Slahsers. <br /> <br /> In a recent recording in a movie, Marty Rantzen had something against one. A hatred that killed all old enemies in a creepy Jester mask, nerd. A good villain is a good slasher. Simon Scuddamore, who played Marty, committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High's release. He adds something creepy to the movie and bends over it and even feels sorry for Marti's character. Totally, over 80 slashers are entertaining! It is a shame that will never be the same ...
