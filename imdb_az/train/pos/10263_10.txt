"Game House" is a perfectly designed movie, and one of the few films I've ever seen made me wonderfully and unexpectedly ending with a flair on the screen. I first saw Roger Ebertin's video in 1987, after reading a review of the best film in 1987. I had doubts, mostly since then it has not been recognized as other films. Boy, it's a surprise. <br /> <br /> The scenario is not just the area but the height, the returning, and the many things that have been rebuilt. will only come out of your mind when you think of it), as well as for the character development. At my second glance, Mamet's scenario began to understand that not just a clever tension movie, but every development has created symbols and their motivation. The height of the film is particularly effective because it is completely inevitable. This is due to what we know about the characters in nature and therefore is more than just an unfinished twist. Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna's speeches add a lot to the film. I can not describe other players who play Mike as well as Mantegna, and Crouse simply plays a decent amount in order to propagate a repressive criminal mindset. Their works and Mamet's unusual scenario combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s. This is really a must see.
