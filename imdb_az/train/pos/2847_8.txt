As it's commonly known, anthropic films do not penalize the American audience (I think they prefer a standard scheme). New York, I love you, the second stage of a series of aerial films related to cities and people who live and love them. The first was 'Paris, J'Time', and I really liked it. The film consisted of different segments, each one written and / or directed by a different director (most of them were French, but there is a very funny segment run by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like Paris, it is an anthology by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shaker Kapur, etc.), as well as New Yorkers and Parisdaals, Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki and his team are similar to experienced veterans like James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach, and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly, but others do not know (although it depends on individual tastes, although I discover that they are working for me and I do not give it to anyone). The next entry will be Shanghai, China (Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece issue). It is mainly spoken in English, but with English subtitles it has Jewish and Russian languages. Strong language and sexually explicit content were expressed by the MPAA
