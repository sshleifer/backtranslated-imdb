I have not read Mourning Night at Kurt Vonnegut (though I've read his other books, all satirical and game-changing novels). After seeing Keith Gordon's movie adaptation, you need to read it immediately in the near future. If it is not regarded as a movie in 1995/96, many of today's / Holocaust / WW2 films will be selected so far in the very popular time. . The reader says that it's more resonant, though, the nature of the actors and the real horror of the post-war life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> According to the Deputy Chairman of the Caucasian Muslims Office, ethical choices and complexity, even after the end of the war - Howard W. Cambpell (Nick Nolte). But this is also a really powerful feat of kinematic technique. Keith Gordon, I usually think of a really strong stuff (sometimes I think as an actor, surprisingly enough to return to Vonnegut with him), but that's a revelation. Campbell's story takes the story of a frustrating story: a German propagandist (a German propagandist who actually espoused the Americans but who was actually a figurehead who was a playwriter) was indeed "two nations", himself and his wife (Sheryl Lee) . He was followed by a prison cell waiting to be tried in Israel in 1961 and wrote his memoirs and expressed his concern for the "hate" Nazi, and then in 1960, a large part of the film was filmed in an apartment in New York. <br /> <br /> It can be very difficult, like the mom's night, to communicate with the pianist, but she goes to the emotional-brain level rather than the poetic poem of the film. Gordon, through Vonnegut, strives to look at a person who has nothing to do with us, a "brother" who does not want his long-lost lover's love for NYC, when he / she is dating an artist (Alan Arkin, very good), then and his apartment is found as a Nazi-hiding with a smart supremacist bulletin. On the surface this should be just a story of spying, but something is wrong. The 'life' of this human life is striking, but in the end it is something that he chooses. Campbell is one of the symbols to be analyzed at the end of the day, and the same results can be achieved (and in some way reflects the Goebbels line): a bigger lie, more people believe. <br /> <br /> But he was just a beautiful, tragic-funny fairy tale, or something else. there were some really fantastic performances (Nolte is here in the best place and Sheryl Lee, from whom we can recall Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer, especially on the stage, she is "Helga"). It's also a beautifully lit movie, bright lighting, and shots of the nature of the character, or just the starkness or the painful colors of time (watch the scene where old Campbell sees a young man feeling better). And music choices increase the level of tragedy. Some music is plentiful, but sometimes it raises the materials through its usual dramatic dimensions and makes human nature solemn. <br /> <br /> It is not always an easy movie to accept emotionally and as some of the folds have a spy story, it's the "Whose" lure. But from Vonnegut, something like appearance and performance is something to remind and remember the imitation life that imitates life's lives. Although the book is better than the movie (or other way), I still have no idea, but for me, it's hard for me to give it to anyone looking for a masterpiece of WW2 / Holocaust.
