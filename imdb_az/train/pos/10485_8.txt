Last night I saw on TV and was very glad. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is beautiful and warm around you, and I believe that it is still a good thing in the world (why all our neighbors?) I love to act (all this is ordinary , like common people, was at a small age.) The biggest thing in the film was the imagination and humor! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the end was a bit confused, but it really did not stop me, I'm really glad. all story!
