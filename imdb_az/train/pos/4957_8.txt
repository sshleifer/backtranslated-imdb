In a budget developed by writer / director Brad Silberling, 10 pieces in two weeks, a little film shot in the city of Carson, which felt like the whole story, was a good word. Silberling had a great opportunity to bring together Morgan Freeman, a great actor for the Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the two men from different opportunities that led to the further development of one's life. <br /> Morgan Freeman plays herself - part of the comedy is depicted as a four-year-old actor and returns to find a place for a little 'full movie'. His "role" is a market manager, and it is thrown in the marketplace where Carson meets a girl in the market with a disputable 10 Product or less pay line. Just as Scarlet's tired of his static job, he is also angry at his treacherous husband (Bobby Cannavale), while at the same time he was losing himself with the scarcity of Scarlet's lazy workman (Anne Dudek) and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> After a couple of shared problems, the two couples will go on a "road trip" that leads to each of the growing characters from each other's companionship and life story. <br /> <br /> It just said, but the closing connection between Freeman and Sun works very well. This change and sensitivity to exchange is one of the few films about human relationships. It's worth watching, and it's a pleasure to look at a DVD that has touching, informative and funny features.
