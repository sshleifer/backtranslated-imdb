I chose to watch this movie on Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and saw it as one of the best films in the festival. Both leading actors provide a well-rounded sensitive performance that appears to fit individual-level characters. The director did a great job of bringing characters and stories to life with the skill of first-time production. <br /> <br /> One interesting aspect of this film is wood processing and New York City (Brooklyn special). The film builds business around the family furniture and covers the sensitive cinematography of the tricki and ordinary Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> This is a great choice. <br /> <br /> This is a ship, and I strongly recommend it (I'm sure it will appear on the screen).
