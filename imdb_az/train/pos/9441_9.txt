The creators of this delicate film have done a great job of connecting with symbols because you have suffered this horrible test. The horrible scenery in the trees was so beautiful that you should not forget that these guys are just actors and play pieces. There is a film that's so bent in a movie. Brendan Reynolds and Jon Voight are not the best on the screen, although Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney perform well and appear in a short time, James Dickey is a little worried about the Aintry.It Sheriff, the owner of the book, and the kids, of course, but it's a big, dramatic film.
