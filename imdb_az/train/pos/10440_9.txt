This movie is clever. That is, more than any other movie, at least less than the total denominator - foolish people will not likely. The story also relies heavily on the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Sunrise is a brighter, slightly less abstract and just better. <br /> <br /> The scenario, characters and even some surreal atmosphere are completely realistic. Players are playing in a brilliant way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, although I find a little bit embarrassing and embarrassing moments, it is almost always on the right, according to DemirBank . Balancing on this delicate line requires talented actors. Sometimes it gives great results, and in general, this movie is simply magnificent! Only in very, very rarely reliable and realistically-described movies are "love." Every time the results are fantastic. I think that the striking and invisible beauty of the leading actress is less than that. <br /> <br /> This is just a ship that you can not escape. One of the best films I have ever seen since 1990!
