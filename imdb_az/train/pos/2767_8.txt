Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this film. Last 15 minutes (or there) are great and Peck is definitely a joy to watch. However, the rest of the film can not be the same. It's not terrible and I'm sure it was done well, but that's the only reason I have to see Peck (to be honest). It is good for the rest to read the Old Testament.
