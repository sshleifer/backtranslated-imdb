It is difficult to describe such a beautiful beauty movie. Perhaps this is the absence of many dialogues, or maybe this is a perfect noise, or maybe Meena Mumari's foot, but it is a joy to watch this movie again. I have not seen another Indian film approaching it and see its perfect opponent, which is less than any country.
