When I look at it, I will accept biased bias. For the first time, I saw this movie for the first time in 2005 at Nightfall, "Fear Friday" at AMC. Before I look up any of the here to make sure I'm promising, he put an end to all the Amicus anthology series. <br /> <br /> I still appreciate the House that beat the blood as I love it, closely following the cryptic Tales and then the shelter. <br /> <br /> I think all the elements that make this series attractive - vintage '60s /' 70s style kinematography, creepy kooky, versatile stories and totally britishism totally backed up by a total of others overall . <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> </ font> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He creates a murderous character called Dominic and soon faces great difficulties telling the artistic truth. There is a delicate physicist because of his rebelliousness I find here to be entertaining and creepy. Oh and those horrible teeth teeth (later British actors, maybe they were REAL). The second story was that as a single old man who moved here (Peter Cushing) escaped from his loneliness, even worse. He found it possible to get rid of the local (very creepy) honey wax, but he would be better alone ........ Third story, Christopher Lee (my fav English horror actor), many father and a totally creepy young like a father with a daughter. He is always cautious about accessing things that are not as witchcraft! That's why there's natural talent. Lee is like an ice-cold discipline that has a real talent to play characters that are totally heat-free! But in spite of his best efforts, the little problem-maker actually learns forbidden information and evil ...... <br /> <br /> This recent story is the story of an old veteran actor who feels a young filmmaker to shoot a suitable vampire movie not qualified for the suits, and in particular the quality of the clothes. So, as if in the middle of an evening to get an "original" thing going to an old shop of interest. A little one knows that he really got the king of the original vampire! Putting on the midnight kick is noticeably impressive. This was the fourth and last story I had after 3, and I was not too lenient in the first attempt. But I've had something to do hundreds of times, when I'm asleep and waking up, I have a stunning film or music experience and movie / music is part of my dream! Great fun !! This strange story was perfect for this, and for the first time it seemed very intimidating, because it was right when it was used by the power of the plaque and could not understand what had happened at first. After a while, the lovely Ingrid Pitt, who came to the movie, came to visit and warned him not to put on a late night dress - but he was not a real vampire because he was not concerned. The Chinese keyboard lamp, which went down the stairs, was just hysterical! And again in my state of half-asleep, it seemed strange! Side Note: Be sure to catch Lee and Pitt along with the classic Amicus star Britt Ekland of the classic The Wicker Man (1973) all the time. <br /> <br /> The weakest link here was an interpretation of interlacing between stories, but based on stories, this is classic! Objectively, I would say that the third story is the best, but I love my 4th love because she smiles very laughingly. It is highly recommended for horror fans and is an English fears fan! You can see the series in chronological order. The latest film of this series is Monster Club (1980), of course, the weakest. I think that the first 3-4 films are good, except for the medium-sized torture band (1967), but if you love any of them, you need to watch them at least once. You'll probably come back more times to watch your favorites.
