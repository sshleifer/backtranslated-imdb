This is a movie I've seen more than any other one (I believe I've seen it on average every year after my release). That's what I've seen every time, it's just as fantastic and always something new. It is most likely that he has a combination of the best Yuxi cinematography here. This movie should be absolutely for any dear movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, the Balkan and split it. This is a poker movie that everyone should have in their personal video collection.
