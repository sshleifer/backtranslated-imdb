Normally, I liked films like "Chances", but for some reason I did not agree so much. The first half was pretty good, with Alex Finch dying and reincarnated in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He welcomes his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and his wife (Ryan O'Neal) and his grown daughter. Re-discovering scenes and re-discovering someone who saw Downey once was good, and the Shepherd finally thinks that he really is reincarnated to his wife, but there's a movie down there. Downey and Shepherd, who want to come together again despite the present-day individuals, has a few sexually explicit scenes. After that, the film ends at the best possible, taking into account the terms of the plot. I did not expect it to be extremely immoral at the end of the film because I was disappointed. There was a great potential in this story and the scenes in paradise did a good job. There is a good theme voiced by Peter Cetera and Cher, but ultimately the film is not great. For a better movie, "hell can wait." <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
