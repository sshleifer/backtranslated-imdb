Without a question, this movie should be one of the biggest ........ in cinema history. <br /> <br /> Meena started from a place where Kumari is the center. <br /> <br /> The center of Meena Kumari is surely followed closely by Sahib Bibi aur Gulam and Phool aur Pathar, one of the best in his career. The nuance of each motion and performance gives importance to the diminution of other Bollywood heroes. <br /> <br /> <strong> Kakak's wise interpretation was combined with Urdhu's grace, tragic weakness and poetic delivery. <br /> <br /> Pakeeza is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; <br /> <br /> Noyshad's music is not a memorable thing, it is incredible that the musicians are essentially aware of music. <br /> <br /> The road that tells the story of a small atmosphere motivation and a story based on many romantic melodies is truly remarkable. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend the people who seriously look at the movie, this epic mediation is life and art.
