It's cheesy, creepy, expensive, but that's a lot of fun. There are just moments of the best melodrama that are just plain smile. This movie is great for entertaining. They go to a small town to cover the holiday, but can not afford a room to stay overnight. This is what Ernest Keller is talking to. It's creepy on a psychological path. And he suggests staying at home. But he did not tell the truth about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> The performance of Stephen Furst is truly wonderful as the "Unseen", which really carries this movie. The majority of the film is boring, but it is interesting to find the truth of Ernest's family. <br /> <br /> In this scene, it's worth seeing this cast. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make beautiful candy candies. <br /> <br /> I think the film is an old stone, it's hard to find and value it.
