I just went to the show in Expresion en Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and made a short speech. <br /> <br /> I drew a film and was amazed at the first shot: a glorious black-and-white futuristic long-term shot from Paris. <br /> <br /> I should not go with the details, because I think it's worth the movie. The story of science fiction can be average for many ... it was really good to me. The action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere, and I want to say everywhere. What you can do or see is impossible to do. <br /> <br /> Now that's what I found beautiful, it's animation. See 3D graphics 2D. A BW comic book brought life. The details in the background give you more tissue as you can manually (I'm sure you see the depth when the angles change). <br /> <br /> The producer in the document spoke about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director said that he was brilliant, but perhaps he was too inexperienced when he shot only one short film on his CV. Thus, many people have given them the true faith. <br /> <br /> He did not involve himself. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, I think Richard Linklater may not regret it for the final appearance of this movie.
