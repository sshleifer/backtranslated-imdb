The film is just an entertaining thing .... it's probably more fun for our young people and the "The Ramones" during the film's preparation. I watched the movie again and again with myself and my friends, still fresh and funny. The concept of becoming a great admirer of a certain group with the risk of being too serious is endless, and high school students are not always in the same degree of boredom of some classes. <br /> <br /> Some gem lines / scenes of the film .....

And everyone knows what happened to DJ Don Still? <br /> <br /> So watch out and enjoy ..... do not think .... just FUN!
