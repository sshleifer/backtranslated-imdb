SPOILER ALERT! <br /> <br /> This film is included in the life of Two Students, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> They are the "missions" that come together with themselves and lead them to a great mission, which is a "zero day". The zero-day content is not determined by the Medieval until the end of the film. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Back to top There's nothing like this below. <br /> <br /> In this attack, many movies and movies that I watch in this film are different from any other movie. Different and most respected. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <strong> My English class I never knew the reality of the events and the shooting until the story of a generation or story in our generation. Everyone was going to choose Twin towers, but I wanted to be different. Because the Twin towers were tragic and over-set, but I did not think of the right choice, because there was no way because I only stayed in grade 3 and had no idea. But the shots left and affected. <br /> <br /> This movie is a charming, earthly and terrible masterpiece, and I would like it. He praised everyone.
