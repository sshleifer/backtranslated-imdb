There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and it's too old. This short title requires more than what the viewer can give. It offers a simple story, it is better and better after talking with enough reasoning to explain it very diligently. Clooney's community is funny and very nice, but it can potentially make it easy, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman. Pleasant and funny, hilarious so toward the end, Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.
