Okay, this movie is stupid. I want to say that in a good way. It was a fool for this purpose and was one of the better "stupid" films I have ever seen. Sugars and gags are poor, but they are delivered with me because they hit all the correct notes. The supporting characters were quite shallow and mediocre. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is in the spotlight. Lovely and cute. Cassandra Petersen is a filmmaker who has only a glimmer of talent in this film. This is the most striking physical aspect of the actual talent. Several people would agree with that. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Recommended for fans of comedy and admirers of beautiful women. Please note that they created many Elvia movies.
