Very funny movie. The classic film of the 80s Eddie Murphy. I saw that I was a kid and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony is not good, the movie is funny, good. Murphy has made many action movies to joke about everything that is dangerous to him in the 1980s. The result is only a 1986 movie that has been changed since then. At that time the atmosphere is good for the film, and special effects are good for a movie of the time. An actress who has recently lost is a beautiful movie that favors and loves Muri's taste. The last part is anthology, and Tibet is a beloved actor playing a part of the monk. This is so.
