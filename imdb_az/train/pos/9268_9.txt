A film about women who want to see a soccer match in front of them will not boost a little interest in football, but this is not about football, but for the discrimination and love of women. <br /> <br /> Film between Iran and Bahrain will be opened on the day of the World Cup qualifying match. The girl is trying to enter Tehran's Azadi Stadium, dressed as a boy. a soldier tries to look for him. When a small cage is held on the edge of the stadium, where several women are caught after the capture, the leader is guarded by a small group of soldiers who want to return home more often. cattle We will never know the names of the characters, but we recognize them as those who want to allow their daughters to watch the nearby gaps in the wall and try to try to comment at least when they do not give up. <br /> <br /> In many parts of the world today, however, there is a lot of hot moments in the film about tough sexual segregation: one of the girls "disguise" wearing the toilet and the girl hid her as a soldier and was caught only because she , he chose to watch the game for the head coach. The enthusiasm for girls has come to an end, hoping to win the hope of winning Germany, hoping for the hope that Iran will win. Soldiers are not regarded as fundamentalists, they are only because there are women and women are not content with their arguments when explaining the girls because they can not watch the sport of men. <br /> This film is a shame that Iran does not seem to be in itself, but we can see the wider world, and you see that ordinary Iranians do not have a hopeless group to wage war in the west, as well as ordinary people with the same passion and concern as humans. The player has done a great job of displaying characters, not just cartoons, but as real people.
