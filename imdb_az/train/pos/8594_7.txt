Sentinel hoped he would be a good movie, and my son was right. First of all, it was a great story from a novel, and I thought it was an original story, but it was not, and it was a very clever story. Michael Douglas is very good in this movie and Keither Sutherland is too much, but it's hard to override his role as Jack Bauer 24 on 24, but in the end, he is different from The Sentinel 24, and another person tried to wipe out the role of television. , but it failed. Eve Longeria.She was not good at the movie, and it was all in the back seat. After watching the movie, I was constantly dreaming about Sentinel sleep.Overall Sentinel is a good movie and I recommend it.
