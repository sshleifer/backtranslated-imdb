I was looking at a fully-fledged home. For years, I started watching him, but about two weeks ago I started watching him again. Now my kids love to watch the show and watch them too. My kids do not believe DJ at the show and I'm at the same age. <br /> <br /> I love my show, because it's a show you can follow with your family. It has good teachings that you can learn from your children. There is no drug and violence in this regard. Also, children can always open their families for help when they are in the show. Nowadays, children should be taken from the TV once a day, but not for drugs, but they should apply to your family for help. <br /> <br /> I love my show because it makes you laugh and fall into the earth. It speaks about real-life problems and family issues. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson you can get from the show.
