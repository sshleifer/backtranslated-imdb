"Thieves and Lies" introduces us to a very natural description of the level of corruption that affects many Puerto Ricans and makes it difficult to make choices about their lives and their lives. Cast is very good because some are non-professional actors; It's a great choice to increase the level of realism in the movie. Photography, as it should be in this type of film, invites the story without interference. The scenario captures Boricuas's subtleties and attitudes very deeply. Sometimes it feels like you are watching a documentary! While watching this movie, you were secretly penetrated into the Puerto Rican society and followed it invisibly. I loved it!
