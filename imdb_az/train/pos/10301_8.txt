Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best pictures ... good ... for a long time. It's one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even boasts a few funny jokes. It's a bit boring but with a few funny scenes you have one or two romantic moments all over a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
