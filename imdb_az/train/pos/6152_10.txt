Fabulous, fantastic, probably the best music adventure in Disney. For over 35 years, I love this movie because it is creative, clever and entertaining. Despite the scenes of the "flying bed", other scenes and dialogue are magical and funny. Who could have been better off Angela Lansbury than Eglantine? I can not think of a more suitable person in this role. <br /> <br /> Although David Tomlinson has some quality movie roles, this adventure is completely brilliant. In those days he was often a forgotten comic genius. Blustering, premium and proper English - no one can really make a slapstick and weigh it as subtle. <br /> <br /> After Tomlinson's death a few years, nobody can step foot on his shoes and do not justify his fairness. <br /> <br /> Dance night night and armor have a magical aura about them. Other movies with witches do not just catch up. <br /> <br /> The Germans are very pleased with the occupied territories of Eglant, and he must defend it in any way. <br /> <br /> Have a good sea, riding in the bottom of the sea. Richard and Robert Sherman have dropped out of musical numbers. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <
