When I heard the voice of this story very serious, I liked Nausicaa more than the valleys of the winds. Laputa, his name, has influenced freedom in the US to avoid extremes in Spain's broader audience, the director's first production of Conan's animated film. In fact, Pazu has Conan's thick bones and immortal vibrancy, which she dropped her daughter in her arms and dropped from a thousand hectares falling to her feet. It gives you the most attractive and cheerful character to watch. The fan of Nausica's techie may be disappointed with flying bugs and retro technology through Laputa - the only exception can be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Winds Valley, the theme of Laputa is not directly related to the environment. If there is a theme, it is anti-war. The importance of nature is the essence of the nature of the flying tower, without being postponed, it is briefly debated and is not really pursued. In general, I see the part in the intersection between good feelings and ants.
