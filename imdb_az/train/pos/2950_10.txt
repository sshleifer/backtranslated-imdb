If you were always sad to get a movie on DVD, it was probably 'Delirious'. How often do you enjoy your comedy routines? When I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's "Delirous" and "Raw" (not funny), I did not know Eddie was a big part of his inspiration. Now I'm old and after Murphy saw both Pryor and a lot of comedians, I distinguish two things: Eddie's Eddie Everyone, EDITORS, RICHARD'S LOVERS. The big difference is: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. It was something that was before. He had everything needed. Eddie Murphy today is dull and old? but once he was the king and the largest castle built in "Delirious". Indeed, it is one of the most funniest routines of all time.
