Nora is a single mother of the 1970s who wants to continue her life as a young artist, a friend, a group of writers, singers and actors. The "free love" philosophy does not go completely out of the system? and Nora did not count on love, especially with a junkie. Hazlehurst has won two AFI awards for four years, according to Nora's beautiful picture, which ensures that her children do the right thing, but also favors Juno Javo (Friels). Garner ?? then will it be tougher in the movies like LOVE and OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET? Nora's prettier daughters and Caton appear to be as neat as an artist, perhaps as the 2000 lifestyle program is ready to act as the owner of "HOT PROPERTY". Director Cameron's early efforts have won; MY BROTHER JACK, among his next projects, went on to make mini-makers. But striking deliveries by Hazlehurst, an intelligent search engine based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
