I grew up in Doc Savage and was deceived by the green death as a child, but now I find it so fun. I have looked at this movie with numerous friends and colleagues and was amazed at the variety of reactions. , so basically, I think I'm strange, but you're there. "I did not know what the Doc was doing, but she always gets girls" should be the last line when you look at her sad group. This movie was a classic parody in the genre of all superheroes, and it set out ahead of time, it is not taken seriously, it moves on Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God. Failure to broadcast this movie on DVD in the UK. I told him I was classic, and I would not be able to do without Ron (like the Italian job without Mini and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
