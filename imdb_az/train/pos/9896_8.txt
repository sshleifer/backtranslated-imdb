It's important for me to see this flick in the last few months. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After a few years, the perfect youth group has come to their schools It was recalled and now it has been abandoned for them. party <br /> <br /> Then, through the film, young people begin to die on the most horrible path possible. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, you see a dream, and you see that none of them happened. But Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. <br /> <br /> Despite the incidents in the prison, the murders did not happen. <br /> <br /> It's good that the move is terrible. <br /> <br /> I love life. I'm really sincere with Marty. Like Tamara (2005). <br /> <br /> Caucasians differ from each other. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Good cheese slasher!
