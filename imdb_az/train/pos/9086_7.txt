If you are 13 years old or older and over 13, you will enjoy the D-War. If you are a serious admirer of any brain moving movie, you will enjoy the D-War. Otherwise, do not worry! Today I saw a movie with my brothers and three friends. They really loved him, and that made me feel good. After the movie was over, I did not stop thanking all the children (my nephews and their friends) for taking the theater. <br /> CG is good. Acting and leadership are awful. Storyline is very simple. Half of the audience was screaming, screaming, and dragons appearing on the screen every time they were children. <br /> <br /> D-War is the beginning of the war. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; I give this movie 10 to 7 because the kids loved it very much.
