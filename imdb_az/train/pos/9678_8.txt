I wish my happy birds could talk. Tisk tisk from the reviewer who canceled the movie. A sweet story that people of all ages love. Paulie is a lovely treasure. She really has some smart lines that make me laugh. In particular, I liked the dance sequences during her show. Forgive open clich√©s, as you strengthen him in his sequence to unite with Mary. A charming movie with two strong symbols that really loves the little parrot separated from the younger owner. You see, the blind woman must see more and leave her mutual visits. I liked his artistic and poetic inspiration, shouted that Paulie would not come in. Finally Marie joined the handsome young man who helped Blame Paulie in her new home, perhaps defeating antagonists to complete her journey.
