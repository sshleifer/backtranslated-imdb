hi .. I think I'm just one of my favorite Sean Connery movies, Castin is a tense psychological tension, especially with Connery's perfect performances. There is one of the best lines I've ever seen in the film, and this is a pretty good dialogue. Sean is one of the best scenes in the film when discussing the character of Ed Harris in prison ... I'm so glad I can not recommend it enough, do not miss it this one! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that indicate that you have been in the last 30 minutes, as the rest of the film, it's a really fun movie.
