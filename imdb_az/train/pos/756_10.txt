Although I humiliate such shows, despite being shocked, I am a daughter, I have to express my opinion. Before I saw Jackassie, I had seen Chirkassa and thought of getting out of Jackass in terms of programming. Story lines and interviews have been touched to create a more exciting show. I watched the Jackass movie in the night and did not believe how bad it was to put it in a joke after a joke that had nothing to do with anything. No shocking amateur should even have the fastest show. Dirty Sanchez Jackass came out of the league as Puke drink is not really my thing, as it goes on a major entertainment show.
