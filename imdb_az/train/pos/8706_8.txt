What happens when the average grain is aware of supernatural powers? Presentation can be acquainted. The watchmen? Unbreakable? <br /> <br /> Because of the fact that a person named Sasha fled from society, from the elderly and from the family, the story is due to the supernatural power he possesses. Whenever he wishes or gives anger, the sword stretches from his arm, and the skin itself. Very funny? Maybe ... but this is not an interesting part of the film. He has taken away all his life and led anger (and his temper) to return to our home town to turn our "hero" life or find a cause. The only thing he has here is that when he is faced with a new lover of the old flame, it is difficult for him to bloody. This is the act of revenge and anger. This is a man who does not want to pass, and from this point the mafia and the police are in his tail. <br /> <br /> The film's shooting continues for several days. <br /> <br /> With regard to filming, this is a house of art in a craft house, carefully taken on every scene on the terrifying philosophy of knowledge. This is a strange fever that is of great interest to me in this film. The approach of directors for this genre is refreshing, not just a straightforward film that draws attention to Sasha's emotional journey. Do not worry, there is movement and more. However, most of this sequence only shows the severity of the horrible results provided in the pictures. This does not mean that the action is not showing. These scenes are fantastic and fantastic (especially when Sasha's full powers are emerging in desperation). The film implies the severity of many scenes to direct the character to a remarkable struggle. This is a tragic story of love and manifestation of the genre.
