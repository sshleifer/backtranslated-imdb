First, when people say "GUY RITCHIE" they consider it SNATCH instantly. Yes, it was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone is connected to Snatch by Guy Ritchie. They do not expect to explore its new borders. This film is different from the REVOLVER lid; very dark and very complicated. The reason I gave the 10th degree was that I had to watch Revolver three times to understand everything. So, this movie is playing with your head. <br /> <br /> This film is different from Snatch. <br /> <br /> "What has earned me that we can understand how complex the hero is and how we stand?" more questions than answers.
