The 60-year-old middle-aged 60-year-old mother (Reid), who recently lived in her mother's womb, says her husband is married and has a relationship with a young carpenter. The film is quietly interwoven with a passive mother, her son and daughter growing up, and a quiet need for a conversion between her and her young lover, trying to sleep. An antiseptic drama with psychodramatic weaknesses, "Anne," is a perfect work to solve realistically unrelenting issues and escapes unreasonable sensationalism. A more competent audience, perhaps better to play with women, who can empathize better with the central character, needs and issues. (B +)
