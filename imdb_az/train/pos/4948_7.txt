It is an outstanding simplified film that explores a topic and gives something different to every audience. Stage is simple: a well-known celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) visits a store to look at people and decide to explore the future role. <br /> <br /> Both players play brilliantly and bring each other. solid characterization of the nature of a character research. Convention-specific research is not; Each of them represents all worlds. Cassiri's life is forced into a "real world", but the actor is enriched in his fantastical existence, but can not solve simple issues like remembering phone numbers. <br /> <br /> He immediately accepts that he is looking at people while talking to people, and shows that he is not one of them in every aspect of exploring real people. <br /> <br /> But in fact, we also see the reverse process. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Cassiz's "Al Pasar la Barca" likes the song instead of a girl to pass through the ship (ie honest work), and could not be better selected. It is parallel to the character of Vega, the only shop assistant, with any brain or passion who wants to work hard to succeed. (There is a lot of desire for someone who looks like Paz Vega). If you do not mind slow pacing and "talky" approach, this movie will have fun. Heroes are a perfect contradiction, and those who work effectively make them happy. It's a beautiful clock.
