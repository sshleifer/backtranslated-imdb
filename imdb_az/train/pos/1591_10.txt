My mom and I have been in this show recently, but laugh at our stars! I'm just disappointed that I've seen 10 episodes and did not pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! The storyline is very funny, the characters have really great personalities (or not so great, but still funny!). I love you about any episode about TiVO. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all the players, do not leave me alone! There are some inappropriate language and some sexual content for kids, but there is not much trouble with a parent guide nearby. This show has a kind of 'Friends' relationship that draws me. I love it very much.
