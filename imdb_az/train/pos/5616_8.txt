What can be said, really ... The "tenant" is a first-class tension consisting of equal amounts of paranoid, durable and full. This is a complex imaginative film - each detail includes one reason - even characteristic of space, and not even more objectively. That's why we are increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski) - a former Polish citizen who remains a Polishman with a flat who gets an apartment due to suicide - through a world of increasing fear and uncertainty. After a group of warm-up parties thrown by a group of negative partners, Trelkovsky remains under an invisible, inexpensive investigation by his colleagues in his building; the rest of the film creates a mental breakdown and gives a comprehensive insight into David Lynch's further efforts. The "renter" is more labile and poor, with unexpected funny relief, beautiful performances, and realistic scenery. The film is more skillful than the one described, so hop.
