I captured the double feature of "Sunrise Before" (1995) and "Sunset Before" (2004), and both films looked at each other and really did not have the capacity to hold or think. I have to say after sleep that I have a great deal of superiority over the latter, and why I will explain it. <br /> <br /> Before introducing us to the young actors before the sun, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), only 25 at the time of release; and Julie Delpy (three-color trilogy), then 26 (though very young). She is an American writer who travels Europe after her split in with her girlfriend; He is a young French student on the way to Paris. They met at Budapest-Vienna train and decided to leave the train together. Everything was written in the 1990s: From then on, on the beautiful captive streets of Vienna, exchanging ideals and ideas, the technology swiftly jumped, all the new millennium waited for the hope and dreams in the corner, as young people but the love of life and the passion for the future. With all its mistakes and discrepancies, Cessini (Celine's accents, semi-American half-French in error or purpose, and reliability of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) characters, turning to two from one spectrum) were the mirror of time. This movie is a work for me, for the faithful couples to swallow their lives with such a sense and enthusiasm, who run all the klichel and romantic, and direct the audience for themselves. <br /> <br /> Some films, films, films, films, movies, movies, Vienna, have told a good classic romantic appointment and will definitely return to a future movie for future thoughts.
