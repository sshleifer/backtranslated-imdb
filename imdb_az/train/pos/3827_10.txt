I did not know that I was talking about another review - it was a great movie and it was a time of feeling like time travel. These characters are really young, a strong match for Mary Byron, Claire is young, and a striking, Polidori persuasive beaten down sycophantine ... all are beautiful, curious and irrational ... they are not terrible accidents Gothic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gothic Romantic, yes, but every time I think about the movie, she completely updates my interest in Shelley and Byron's life. One of my favorites at all times.
