I say, "Back to the dinosaur's story," just a kiddie version of Jurassic Park. I found it more interesting. As in the past, the question of bringing the existence of a period into question puts its safety in question. John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King are really looking at me. To describe these words: a well-known actor, "Poetry" woman, Tonight Show hostess, the most trusted title in News, the famous chef, Young Frankenstein police chief Lisa Simpson, Three Amigos and <br / > According to some reports, I thought that there was something for both kids (fun only) and adult (natural history) in this movie. True, it's running, it's understandable. I'm really saying John Goodman Rex's voice here is a warning to Monsters Inc.'s voice work. It's worth seeing.
