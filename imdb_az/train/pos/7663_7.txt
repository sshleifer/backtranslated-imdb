As a rule, the Full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid film. <br /> <br /> <strong> Because of Jeffrey Combs's other films, I shot him. <br /> <br /> This is not bad. Not great, but there is something else. The film fights with a mystical "brother" and hood that wants to dominate the worlds. <br /> <br /> Mordrid also has to deal with the people and the power of a successful secular world. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" and find a fortress guard; But the watchman blinded. His eyes dump the garbage. The magician holds his hand in front of the other one, and hey, presto! His eyes were restored! <br /> <br /> Then, Mordred and his brother are fighting a few animal skeletons in the museum. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Adventures are good and play Combs. <br /> <br /> I've seen so bad.
