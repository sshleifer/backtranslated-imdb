'Midnight Cowboy' was awarded X in 1969 with the original version. There are some scenes you can understand, just a little. Joe Buck (Jon Voight), who came to New York from Texas, is sometimes anxious to become a hustler. A cowboy tries to live like a hustler, who is decorated with love and trying to earn money. He does not work as planned. A boy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first made a trick on him and earned money, they were friends. They live in an empty, very bad apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe should try to make some money. <br /> <br /> The film has won X because of the main subject, but when you see some strange things. This movie is great in correction. It is nice and sometimes funny to see that Joe and Ratso have a real frustration. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and supporting actors give great speeches. Especially Hoffman presents some beautiful lines. The score is played by John Barry and sounds great. All this is a great movie for the best picture Oscars win for a good reason.
