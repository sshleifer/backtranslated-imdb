When I was a kid, I really liked Bill & Ted Movies. The other night, I was on the Bogus Journey and since I've seen it since the last 5 years I've decided to adjust, and I loved all of them! This movie is still funny after all the years. The 'perfect adventure' is better, but that's the only one. Of course, some are a little lovable, but hey, this whole movie is beautifully beautiful. Now in a movie with the highest quality personality of Death! Conclusion: As a totally non-fake movie buddy! Perfect way! STATION!
