This movie (for some reason, with the alternative title "Martial Law 3") introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was a great introduction. Even though I had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent warrior. In this movie, moving scenes are great! By the way, there are many. The front-line fight at the Peace Emergency Center is particularly good. There is one thing about a man who has a man who is really entertaining. And for the rest of the castle: Brigitte Nielsen is a good choice for this villain. Such roles are compatible with him (others are not). Matthias Hues has done a good job as always. He was a character like a great warrior and ma√ßo and a good opponent for Wincott in this film.
