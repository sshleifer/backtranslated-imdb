"Jedi's return" is often remembered more often because of mistakes and it is shameful because the last chronological episode in the Star Wars Saga is a striking example of an epic story. <br /> <br /> As you know, all of the previous films have a direct end to all story lines and are so convincing. <br /> Yes, Ewoks - the undoubted Star Wars demographics that have cute and cuddly bears - and in the middle the film tries to slow down. <br /> <br /> Probably, the last hour is undoubtedly the best part of the whole saga. Here, Luka finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most famous murderer in film history. The tendency of people to ignore: an incredible conclusion to the story of Darth Vader (a place that is somewhat unbelievable in Empire Strikes Back), an interesting opening at the Jabba Palace, by Ian McDiarmid's skill performance. The Emperor, Luca eventually comes to himself, solo and Leia romance solution, and Endor's last moments are extremely powerful. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are few shocks. But they resemble a generation of cinemas where each scene is spent in nitpicka. A magical and moving movie piece that still serves as a great last chapter. This is not a "good" movie - it's great!
