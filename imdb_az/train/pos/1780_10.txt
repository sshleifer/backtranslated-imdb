When my mother and I decided to attend a film festival in Boston, we went home from a trip to the North East (mainly Massachusetts). Now I do not know much about the film, so it could have been a bit of a study. This was our first movie, ROMEO DIVISION. Now I know you, but it was beautiful! I'm from Texas, and when we came here, it was a very unpleasant surprise that we did not see too much moving pictures. My mother insisted that she was very severe, but she said that I did not know much about what I said, but it was a great picture. I was shocked by the sequence of war. Also, when I get good guys, I'm a big fan, but I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all the bad guys. It was a real glow. I'm not sure when the video is shot, but if you have a chance you should check it out. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Though it is a word to the wise, it is very severe and there are many cuss words so you do not want to watch your children. This is great for adults.
