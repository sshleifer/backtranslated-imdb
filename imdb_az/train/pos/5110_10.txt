When I was about 11 years old, I learned that I lived 0.48 miles from the uncle's home. uncle's home Westway Dr, deer park, TX. Since the film was filmed, he added his home. I do not know the number of the house, but you are looking for it. I am 21 years old and enjoy watching this movie. The bar on Spencer is no longer the case. Pasadena ISD wants to build their school. The house that last week lasted still looks great. My father and my uncle went out into the street where the actors looked at the place where they came from and the house they were trying to shoot. 225 of the magazine on railroad failure has reached a higher level. When I close my son, I start thinking of the city cowboy at 26 or 25 at that time.
