I was 10 when this show was on television. It was so cute. Actors were very reliable. Alexandra Bastedo was just beautiful .... DVD (15 episodes) simply ordered. They had no superior power. They were just superior human skills (power, hearing, sight). 3 actors were very good, very good. Every episode had a good event. At that time there were no special effects and explosions everywhere, so the script was good and the characters were fulfilled. As with other shows, there were no imaginary things. They did not try to make a joke to make a light show every two minutes. I recommend this TV show to everyone as a good thing.
