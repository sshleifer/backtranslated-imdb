In someone else's opinion, this is a good movie. This glorious scenery and Luciano's stunning sound! I've seen this movie many times and have seen it again. How much I forgot to read Pavarotti's Nessun Dorman and I should not remove the CD! In the second half of the day, it's a great and entertaining movie. Eddie Albert's agent and above is a bit older, but not all agents alone. The Italian village is magnificent, but nothing is perfect for a perfect look from the balloon. If you need the action of the Olivier ratio, this movie is not for you. Follow this movie if you just want a fancy and some nice music flight. Just enjoy!
