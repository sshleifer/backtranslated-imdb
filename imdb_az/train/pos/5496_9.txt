Someone already wrote the word "do not be in the right place at the right time". For this documentary, I thought I was skeptical of the mistakes and maybe some actors, but that's not it. All this is true. The story is not something new to developing and / or poorer countries. It sheds light on manipulation by means of artificial polarization of the people, the corporate press, the wrong information, the tension in the streets, and sometimes the army, the intelligence, or even the government (believing that many believe), to "push" the masses into violence, a film official in the film reminds us of the fact that they wanted to confront the people in the streets, all of which were exposed to blows of three times in Turkey (the US dog dog in the Middle East) and the recent plans of the Turkish army <br /> <br /> This film is rare, it is a shooting from inside, and maybe shooting from inside them. it is clear that it is open, and I did not know if the filmmakers were able to filter and manipulate events and data. <br /> And will Chavez defend Venezuela's people against the dictatorship of the US and world economy? <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is hopeful, and I believe it is worth the luck.
