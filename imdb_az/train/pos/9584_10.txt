Yes, these are the top films. You can not recommend it more. Great doco for anyone who loves gay or movie. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never miss it. Great introduction. A film showing passion and interest to the subject. Some speeches and just beautiful. If you only find this movie in the VHS, it's still worth it. Great. From 10 to 10. I've seen about a decade ago from this doco province and did not understand the audience. Interviews are very clear about the egos of performers, such as heavyweight boxers aiming to get out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was a timer for the first time, what was the achievement. It's cool. Watch it.
