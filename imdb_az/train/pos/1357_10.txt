Wow, what an episode! Last week, Mellissa was almost pucced after seeing her relationship with Annie and Brandi. But it was not until Mellisah saw the fireworks after shooting. One of the most astonishing things on television was the fact that no one was surprised to get out of the boat and get his bag. She continued shouting at crowds to pick up her "all" as she could wear one of her ugly outfits. Mellisa you are 40 years old and are still glamorous? Then Joan calls each book's name for Annie and Brandie, and gets up and goes out of the show! Both Rivers are exaggerated knives that stand in the long run. Mellisa cries and refuses to give up her exit, but as everyone else thinks of America, you are a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can not get my way! Annie likes to explain how cameras that Mellis can manipulate their way of thinking, and then did exactly that. Mellisa is a very clever contestant and deserves to win the whole game.
