The speeches in this film were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric has exhibited a fantastic performance like "Kid" Collins in this beautiful adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. A good film is far superior to "The Grifters", this film is really true for pulp fiction / movie noir roots coming from the story. I recommend this film to all fans of the film.
