A very powerful mobile suit that can destroy all the troops - check! Toughly target everything and still destroy weapons - check! An angel-based mobile suit - check! <br /> <br /> OK - its Gundam series. Gundam Wing has a good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas, and some eye-catching gadgets. Firstly, Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then Dorlan) with characters is stronger and more independent (although the heterosexual series is still fully fed by Heero Yuy). Heero, in the first place, is a cold, heavy butcher, more and more people, yet characteristic. According to the White Fang newspaper, US White Fang team's team saw Millardo's face floating between freestyle and freestyle teams (Whats nomm de guerre Zechs Marquise). . <br /> <br /> The political and military situation is also very good - how the real world works. However, in 49 episodes of half an hour, it is a little responsibility because it is not used for the full potential of this complexity. <br /> <br /> Ideas based on the series - war, peace of mind and so on. - are also resonating today. Retrospective, the series "Anti-Terror" and when was it all? However, the investigation of these ideas is an incredibly dramatic piece of monologues, which is part of Treize Kushrenada's, the best of the series. <br /> <br /> But sometimes good writing is sometimes extremely bad. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, the design and the big bangs of oranges explode (better because the animation would have had better explosions). But who cares? In short, the sophisticated complexity of the series means you've missed a lot of places, delivering some episodes. Poor posts can break you, and sometimes the animation lets you "WTF?!?!" But this will be more than classic animation style, size, spark of incredible dialogue and more seductive animations of these corpses.
