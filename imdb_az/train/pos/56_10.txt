This is one of the coolest stories I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie was run by Larry Clark, this story about the filming in the school was likely to be seen by the killer and this person was primarily insane. <br /> <br /> Instead, it focuses more on how the impact of the school shooting and its surviving survivors are overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Before I had seen Busy Phillipsi in other films, but his performance in this movie is the best. <br /> <br /> The only other film I have ever seen with Erika Christensen was the "Live Fan", which caused her not to watch my movie. <br /> <br /> This is a very good performance. Some of the movies I've been really cried. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it is very important for me.
