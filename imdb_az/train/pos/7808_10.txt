A movie that everyone should watch. In my opinion, Washington is one of the most important points in South Africa's restoration, although there are still many similar situations in South Africa. Kline also performs well, perhaps not as stunning as Washington. <br /> <br /> There are many areas where a film can be filmed, but all of them have been set off. It would have been easy to describe white men as bad guys and black people as good guys, but Attenborough did not do it. Certainly, there were some white characters similar to the evil in nature as Captain, in the Soweto Uprising, but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would not have been a movie for a long time. Some people are complaining about the length of the movie, but it takes really half an hour to tell the whole story because it's really amazing. <br /> <br /> Steve Biko's funeral is the best scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> If the whole crowd starts playing the national anthem of South Africa, it's probably one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you have not already seen this movie, you can watch it. It may seem comfortable, but of course it is worth it.
