Choice is a Chinese movie or triad in this case. In each of these two years, there is a choice to make a decision on a new leader, and first of all Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai or I'm known by The Other Tony Leung) and Lok (Simon Yam, Full Contact Judge!). At the time locus gained, Big D refused to accept the choice and did its best to ensure its recognition as a new leader. Unlike any other Asian movie, I look at my bandits, this is not a motion picture. Goodfellas has bloody moments when it is needed, but mostly just dramatic drama. There are many characters that are really hard to watch, but I think it's a bit embarrassing. A 100-year-old baton, a symbol of the power I have mentioned before, changes hands several times before solving things. Although the movie seems to end with a 65-minute or 70-minute sign, there are still some great surprises. <br /> <br /> The election was the best actor at the Hong Kong Film Awards last year (Tony Leung), the best picture, best director (Johnny To, Hero Trio!) and the best scenario. He also had a cinematography, editing, movie scout (liking me) and three more acting (including Yam).
