Firefighting is a striking funny film, especially when it is released for the first time, taking into account its bad propaganda. Ben Affleck is funny as a beneficial millionaire who pays the family that has occupied his orphanage to become a family for Christmas. She is nurturing with kindness to her family for the Christmas holiday. I have never been a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (though I was like Daredevil and Paycheck), but here plays a good role in this role. I love Cristina Applegat as a daughter of Affleck who can not stand the first. Of course, you can see where this movie is going, but you do not care. Not to ignore what the critics say, and to rent this movie because it is more strange than most Christmas movies.
