Thomas Thin was always skillful to bring stories of simple homes for life with fullness and flair. "Italian" is such a film. Particularly silent child actor George Beban, Jr. and by his father, George Beban, and beautiful sets give a realistic feeling to the early immigrants in New York. This 1915 movie is an unusual fact in these vintage features. <br /> <br /> A person from a modern day (from the modern dress to George Beban) begins a film from a modern day and reads a story about an Italian immigrant, then we go through the story with the immigrant with George. He raises enough money to bring his fianc√© from Italy to America, marry her and take her with her. But times are hard, and they struggle to get married. <br /> <br /> I wondered why the mother did not breastfeed my mother in 1915, and that I was afraid of the dirty formulas she faced, even the Early Dream Factory stopped the political behavior of women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is that Beban has a chance to take revenge on a murder boss who gave a wrong condolence and at the last moment he has decided against his planned action. Very clean. I liked the effect of the curtain, it was very nice. <br /> <br /> Good use of lighting in this movie. <br /> <br /> I will give 10 to 8 in Italy.
