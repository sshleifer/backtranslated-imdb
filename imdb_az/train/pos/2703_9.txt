I'm a big fan of the camp kitsch and views of this "very good buff" type. But I love this movie because of its entertaining factor, and I believe it or it is innovation. <br /> <br /> All things have a ring of John Waters and are incredibly enthusiastic, but some great actors think. focuses on most collisions and stylized movements. Billy Zane moves in an incredible expression (see a tutorial on how to use the bus) and some unexpected stars are framed. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this movie, do not love it, but if you have a chance to watch it, then be careful that you will end up with a mixed smile on your face, and some great stars have a new perspective on humor. High level.
