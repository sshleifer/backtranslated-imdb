**** SPOILERS **** Powerhouse film, showing how devastating the men have bestowed on their best friends and family members and how they do not realize what monsters are. <br /> <br /> In 1922, the Black & Tan Irish rebellion tacitred with the mighty British empire because it was too late like a bull like Gipo Noland, Victor McGullen. British occupation troops, Irish Republican Frankie McPhillip, wanted Wallace Ford investigation to kill the Briish soldier. Gipo, the best, best friend of fugitive McPhillip, succeeds in not working with Margot Grahame, his girlfriend Katie, who was forced to turn tricks in Dublin's red light district to pay for her rent. /> <br /> <br /> After working on a potential John who wants to spend a few hours with an angry Gypo Katie, a shilling or two, an angry Katie says so brilliant Gyro, that he is his body, his body. Katie also tells Gypso that he knows what the truth is and what he is in. That Gypso would cost only 10 pounds to go to America, and that he would get rid of Irish poverty. Gypo suddenly recalled the poster of his best friend Frankie McPhillip, who just announced the award of Â£ 20 a pound. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is enough money for Kaite to travel to America. <br /> <br /> Gypo goes to a local Dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal to escape to friend Frankie McPhillip. Frankie said her mother was in Dublin to see her mother, Mrs. McPhillip and her sister Mary, Una O'Connor & Heather Angel, and that everything was safe for her to go home, and then to Ireland <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Gipo secretly went to the police and killed his wife, information. <br /> <br /> <strong> This is what the police officer was carrying on a 20-pound bone, thirty pieces of silver, and a man can take it for a reputable Gypo who takes it and is hiding from the rear gate of the police. You see that Gipo's friend Frankie McPhillip's betrayal is nothing more than disrespect. The crime was asked against an enemy of the British empire. <br /> <br /> Gypo is the worst enemy to himself after being betrayed by Frankie's betrayal. Gypo looks at and listens to everyone, including Katie, his firstborn boy, pointing to a finger and associating it with Frankie's betrayal and death in the hands of British authorities. Gypo's guilty thought, for his reward, makes himself drunk with royally and glorious, when he is forced to commit offense at almost the deadly drunken and creepy Gypo colleagues of the Irish Army <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mulligan, an innocent man accused of informing him, tells wrongly about Donald Meek. Soon, Gypo, who was released from sin, was described as a general fiction. Then, sticks are drawn for the heart of this ghost, who can be the bullethead of the Gypso for the final gut disintegration of the complacent and unforgivable crime and punishment class.
