When I went to this movie, I heard good things about it. When I left it, I was not really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg has many childhood characters as well as other films. There was a few laughs here and there - something very funny. Probably my favorite parts are dancing on the club's stage. Once I find myself in a club, I have to try again. Here are a few stars: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, Chuck Choo from the X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite entertaining to see a crowd of Thandie Newton on a scene. Of course, in the previous movie with Simon Pegg, Fatboy Run Run. I see it as shake, or you will enjoy some degree or you'll be a bit bored. I can add that Kirsten Dunst is very nice in this movie. : 3
