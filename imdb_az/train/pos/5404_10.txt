Everyone says pokemon can die of fools. This movie is great. Even Celebei died when he died. I'm not sorry! This movie is a tactile animation tension. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of Pokem, Ash and his friends should avoid making Celebei the last bad weapon with a dark ball. Over time, Sam and Celebei are constantly hunted by the game hunters. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to be the owner of the miramah. <br /> <br /> I'm also glad to have a miramax owner. Warner Brothers instead. Finally putting mini-movies was a great idea. Pokemon in this film comes more than life.
