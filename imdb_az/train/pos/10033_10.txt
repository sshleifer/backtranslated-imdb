The Titanic is then a "remembering the night". He always writes a tragic historical event that will always be discussed and never forgotten. Why is it criticized? I have no idea. Will they be able to shoot a movie like the Titanic? Each time it moves and touches until you watch it. They can replace any epic masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The director had a great impact on the film. A simple disaster movie (dull to watch) turned into incredible romance. Yes, I'm not a romantic, but it should not bother you, because you will not see such a romance. Guaranteed! Everything has incredible effects, music, and movement. <br /> <br /> The film creates incredible visual and beautiful feeling. Everything looks realistic and lively. The legend "TITANIC" is featured in all classrooms, and plenty of view too. Acting had a real impact. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best in playing the role there. No one has done better. Partly because of the greatness of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not think much about it. The field is simple, a toy based on a true work, probably half of consumers who watch the film will share their tears with an imaginary finish that will not be forgotten. If you had not seen a good movie, Hester was missing out on something and idolized for Hollywood. Can it be better? No. The most moving film of all time, do not listen to people, you can see and understand. A landmark. (do not be surprised if you do not cry too much)
