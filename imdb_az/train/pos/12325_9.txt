For the first time, I made this movie in 1988 when I worked in England 2000AD. My pal Steve Parkhouse pointed him to the VHS and sent me. To this point, I really only saw Shaw Bros kung fu films, with their sharp lighting (the audience could clearly see their actions) so it was burned for me. Ridley Scott comes out from Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I was first exposed to Tsui Hark's films (apparently called "Choi Huk"). <br /> <br /> But for all the smoky, refined, exterior and special ambitious effects (Stop-motion? Chinese Dream Theater has a simple and moving love story, Leslie Cheung (tragic, tragic wasting life! Joey Wong's gorgeous beauty and elegance. <br /> <br /> Some viewers say that the movie is merely something that's glamorous, but it's glamorous, just over 20 years old (gawd, who we are?) It is a permanent image of that actress, there is no surprise, but it's actually missing from a famous Chinese story written by about 1700 Pu Songlinq! Romeo and Julienne have expected an end This is just a little bit of complaint about WEST SIDE STORY publications. <br /> <br /> For me, China 's REFWORLD STORY is an exciting romantic tale There is a great tragedy because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together, because we are mature, because none of us will survive until the great loss. It is sacrificial because the sacrifice is an important part of True Love. And Wu Ma comedy stylings also do a little damage. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the Chinese Ghost Story trying to hold through a filter of western culture and it will only be good with it.
