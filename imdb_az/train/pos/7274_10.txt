No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best performances ever. Mencia is known for entertaining and entertainment related to racism. But he does more on this stand in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's outfit just makes you laugh, and today she thinks it's really wrong with the community. <br /> <br /> Long-term performance at this time, Mencia speaks about things like immigration, what equality with women in the workplace, terrorism, Mel Gibson's thought of Christ's passion and the fact that she is united with a woman an argument and a physical or mental barrier when it shows how the society should behave. Mencia discusses whether he has the right to talk or talk. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid of insulting critics on many occasions. For example, he goes a little farther (and accepts it) Pope II. A joke about Paul II and what he really does in heaven now. <br /> <br /> We have the main message in all of Mencia's speeches, and we use it to avoid talking and insulting the voice. He reminds us that we have freedom of speech and reminds us that we should use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you love this performance, I strongly recommend watching Mencia Mindini's show at the Comedy Center.
