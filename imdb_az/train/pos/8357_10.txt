Even though there are really shocking events along the way, it's a smiling, beautiful, fluffy, often lyrical movie. When women are treated and after a while, they come in a very good way, and because of this, very potentially disastrous scenes work very well. This is probably the best performance of Depardieu, of course, of course. Jeanne Moreau has played a very difficult role to play with a couple of at least half-aged and bold sex scenes. It's beautiful throughout Miou-Miou and there are very difficult scenes to play again. At first it appears low and dirty misogynist rant / romp, but the opening of fairy tales and characters emerges a much more tender and honest picture. Ultimately, this undeniable and charming movie requires respect.
