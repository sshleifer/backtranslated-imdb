William Powell is Philo Vance who plays the role of Maryam Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralf Morgan in the 1933 film The Kennel Murder Case. Philo, a dog demonstration into the Scottish terrier, serves as the backdrop of a secret room lock with many suspects. The mystery is very clever, but also complicated and interesting. Since the discussions are still very young, camera work is a bit static, but Michael Curtis does a good job of moving. <br /> <br /> Supporting the handle is very good; all cast film brings a notch. Many actors featured Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played the most (five times) and best fit for the role - at the same time very comfortable but serious. The Thin Man had captured him from a large stardom in 1912 and went on stage in 1912 and spent 12 years in the movie. A remarkable person, remarkable screen presence and remarkable. about 92 years old actor. We are very lucky to have your films on DVD and TCM today.
