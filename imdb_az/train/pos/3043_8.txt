This film tells why Amitabh Bacchas is a single human industry. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the peak of Bolivia's rule, and his only parent, Prakash Mehra, decided to use his image again. Prakash has the habit of adding Bollywood sensitivity and cliche liberal dosages to collect and talk about them. Zanzeer saw the creation of Angry Young Man. Lawaris said he was brave and that Namak was about Halal's main grace. <br /> <br /> Then, however, he limited himself to the three-hour-long songwriting, dance, and drama of the theme script. The film's composition is a Haryanavi caricature, which has become a Mumbai and a regulating hero. Amitabh's vocal abilities and diction have shown that this film has made great money thanks to the perfect Haryanji accent. For me, this is the biggest controversy in the film. Amitabh now had to have a typical comedy scene in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose. <br /> <br /> The shoe cover on the party, monologue on Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazar's arguments, the mosque in the control room and the usual drunken scene are now standard Amitabh tariffs. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapur Amitabh was a loyal servant, but he was added to an honorable, sad film about a mile ("remember Shaaadaaaap after Ranjeet's poisoned cake event) ... and that's why Shashi is the rest of the film It was a more sophisticated character to make a serious film, so people came to see Amitabh wearing a new hat and returning to a happy home, the last one could always be predicted, good guys would go into the hearts of the bad guys, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
