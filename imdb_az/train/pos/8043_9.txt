I've heard people telling me that this movie is boring, boring. I do not think I'm watching the right movie. This is not a prototype action movie, but thank God. <br /> <br /> It is only the psychological drama of the shepherd and his mentor to kill these people. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < So, as in the other roles of the film, it seems to be in fact its activity. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the action towards the end - it would not be enough to take into account the rest of the film. However, while watching Zainey's face as a panic, Berenger does the ugly thing.
