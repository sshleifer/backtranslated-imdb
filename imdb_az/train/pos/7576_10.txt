The third and last installments of Hanzo the Razor are the most concrete. "Training" ends in the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film is carried out by the order of eminent monks investigating Hanzone's credit-related slavery. It also makes a historic statement about the proud renunciation of ancient Japan's western technology. The first Hanzo film is directed only to combine everything "Hansa 3: Who's Gold" and eventually brings her home. Definitely perfect for the finals. Oh yeah, Hanzo still has many sexes and there are many unnecessary blood and violence (after * Hanzo Razor).
