It's a decent and ingenuous area for a comedy, and the funny episode of Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments for this fantastic movie. I particularly like the color shots and conflicts in the arenas scene. Robert Stacks is also very entertaining in unsolved Mysteries spoof.
