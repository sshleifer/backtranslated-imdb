The first time I saw this animation (May 15th) I was really impressed! Compared to Japanese animation, she has a completely different style and I love her more. The whole impression of the film is even worse and darker ... Colors are not colored. The Characters do not talk too long, and do not have long and boring conversations (like Ghost in the Rock) .Beats, with pictures of strange animals and the sense of the city, these ancient scandinavian violent stories, terrible creators, charming forests and deep caves, dragons, throlls, orks ... and a mysterious hero to stop the evil ...
