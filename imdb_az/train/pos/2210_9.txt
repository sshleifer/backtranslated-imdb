Hal Sparks do not believe in the hate of many people! She was my favorite host at the show, her hands down. I hate celebrity gossip and generally do not love talk shows, but when I was home to Hal Sparks Talk Soup, I had to watch TV. I rarely missed an episode during a run and I was sorry when the guest went home (though most of the guests had done a good job). <br /> <br /> In any case, we have not seen weekly special offers for all those who do not like Hal Sparks. The Talk Skate series, which consisted of the best clips of the whole week, was a long episode and was sketched by sketch comedy bits. Hal Sparks' original bits were fun. In one of them, a bad comedy had a demon and went on the stage like the air intoxication. <br /> <br /> An episode was dedicated to the fun of plenty because Clone Sparks, who was cloned, dropped out of the studio for a long time. OK, maybe they sound funny I describe them, but what I know was the other two shows I had with Conan O'Brian along with the Spice Soup during the same year. <br /> <br /> Hanson and Tyler were both very great guests, so if you like these shows comedy stylings, then you want Sparks Talk Soup throughout the year. All three guests brought something different to the table, but in my opinion all good comedies. Of course, Tyler and his guest star began to wake up in this show, but now I catch the show's spiritual herd, and I am sure that a new guest can bring some unexpected smiles from time to time. <br /> <br /> OK, and have spent enough time talking about a TV show that is not in a channel that you generally look down on. Look no further!
