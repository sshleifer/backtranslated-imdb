As well as the previous posters, Rockstar's real stars are: INXS - and, indeed, Rockstar: Supernova - Paul Mirkovic, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Do not know who they are? They are an awesome, narrow, rockin 'musical ingenuity and talent an American sad Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Remember the House Band 's "strings" tonight? Music was accurate and up to perfection if I ever saw it. Suzie McNeil's epic interpretation of the Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody', Ty Taylor's Stones's unforgettable cover, 'Always Get ...', JD Fortune says, "Suspicious Minds." INXS is their common denominator where their head, JD live performance has a shadow of their past souls despite their breath of fresh life on their music. <br /> <br /> As well as the awesome House Band. This show is for all producers HB <br /> <br /> Memo: House Band (if you're blessed enough to do so) Season Three Must be Rockstar. Get those boys best lead singer and they are going to places.
