<br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie, but if you do not, I love this movie. I work with everyone - this is it. Without the actor, I spent most of my life in the cinema business. Such people are heroes of this film: gaffers, pullers, air-directors, lighters and writers, suits, and so on. And the whole thing is at least a great deal from their point of view. Most actors are absurd in terms of hazelnuts and absurd, this movie is so good, but you have to work with actors to recognize that this movie is a real-life drama! The possible spoiler alert: on a beautiful scene, both players, _discuss_ discuss how to deal with something personal, from the 'scenario' with another player, and they prepare lines, prepare and criticize exercises <br /> <br /> What happened when the film appeared, '91, especially on television, was fashionable. But it's hardly everyone has done it well.
