This film is unique as it is in sight ...... A different story tells you just how to survive or protect, and if you have an open heart, you can find love love open mind. I saw it in cables at the end of the 70s and really described the limitations of the gay community at that time. I believe that this movie was a little bit dark before it was a dark life style. This is a classic in the sense that it is indeed a precursor to something that is described as a large family. This movie should be available in DVD / VHS, as it may only be supplemented by ordinary speeches by Meg Foster & Perry King, but we have come to our relationships and still have to go.
