<br /> <br /> What makes this movie better than average tension is style. There are some bright scenes and scenes that will really bring my nerve spark to the edge of the seat. The best scene from the movie; Murder of the museum scene and leader. There are some soft erotic scenes and the movie tempo can not be as fast enough for a casual viewer to appreciate this movie exactly. So this film may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also very good, but it really is a style that organizes the work of the movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Michael Caine is an exciting casting choice and Dickinson acts as if he were well-visible (not bad for 49-year-olds). <br /> <br /> Music account from Pino Donaggio is usually De Palma <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
