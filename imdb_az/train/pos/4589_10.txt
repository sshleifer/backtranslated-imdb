Well, I think the Police Story is one of Jackie Chan's best films. Areas, battlefields and stunt work are very good. In this film, Jackie acted as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (in some versions, Kevin Chan) who successfully succeeded in arresting a criminal lord. After she was released because she did not have evidence she had prepared Chan to kill a police officer. So the police searched for it. Later, the secretary secretary, Salina (Brigitte Lin), went to a shopping mall and tried to prove her lord's crimes and she was preparing to start a crime on her computer and was ready to give them to Chan. But the criminal lord knew that Salina uploaded her information on her case and hired her to catch her. Later, Chan appeared on the scene and defeated each other and began to fight with all the followers. On the final stage, Chan saw the lord of the murderer. Finally, this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should watch it. Be advised.
