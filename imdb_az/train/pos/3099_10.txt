Along with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my best new drama in the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> It played a big part around, but it's really Campbell Scott's job (bride photog) and Hope Davis (the last widow of journalists killed in Iraq). <br /> <br /> Besides the player, the writing was fresh and moving. The show was also shot in NYC, in the real town, at the back of Warner Bros or another studio, adding a second layer or realism. <br /> <br /> People are interested in the latest "Survivor" and other reality trash. Not too bad.
