After you've been out of Mail and feeling frustrated, I decided to see the original film that inspired you. I was amazed at this movie. It's a real boat and this is one of the most favorite films of all time. Acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you do not see it, I urge you to see it today. I am not ready to re-create it, and sometimes I love the new version more than the original, but this time we should acknowledge that Mail is a weakness of this classic. Do not miss it, go to your video store and rent a store near Corner today!
