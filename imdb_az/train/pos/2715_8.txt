Q.E.D. was a brilliant television series and was really one of the very few cost planning for it! I doubt that during this period, I will mark the TIVO and the devices that work better since 1982. I look forward to his presence on DVDs! <br /> <br /> Along with this, Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and Brisco County, Jr. With other TV shows like The Adventures, QED, which I'm a big fan of, has more intellectual quality. That was why he was not suffering - the dialogue was ready and the move was high. <br /> <br /> As Britain's Mastermind escaped the show and had a part of the BBC, but it was at that time with better production values ​​than the BBC. <br /> <br /> I was a girl at the age of nine, and this series fled at the start and I had a lot in my life to spend on TV. I remember my mother's memory, but I urge you to remind me that Q.E.D. we will sit on the phone and watch together. <br /> <br /> Really Q.E.D. it is a sad loss, and if it can be done with the same quality and value today, I would like to see a return.
