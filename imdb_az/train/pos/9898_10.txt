My 10/10 rating is for a fun factor and you accept that you have decided before you like it before looking at "Slaughter High". Yes, this is typical revenge - after a few years - a dirty story, but how do some of the things that they are doing here? <br /> <br /> Yes, maybe we can be crazy and say that this movie does not offer anything new. Yes, this does not pretend. As Scream's characters are likely to watch, this is a kind of flicker for how they follow their own rules of how to live a fear movie. After all, who is the one who does not like to suffer to fulfill these things? No doubt, because people are punished for the failure of the 60s, this is a reactionary way. But you still have to love these things! So, apologizing to Don McLean, this treachery did not read for the king and the queen!
