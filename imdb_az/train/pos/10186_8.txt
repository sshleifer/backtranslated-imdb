Ok, I know this job well in India. But the overall theme of the film is India, not Shakti. The power of a war and the power of the mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and her son swept you in their heat. Then things are very wrong. Nandini's relationship with his father's law - the power of their inadequate relationships and the change that has altered this life are the strengths of this film. Shah Ruk Khan's performance is just like a community in comparison with the convincing desperation of Karisma Kapoor. In this movie, you can take in love, violence, and life-saving, and breathe in comfort and sorrow. Music ties are strong, convincing, and good.
