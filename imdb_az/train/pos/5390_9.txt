Life begins, is a beautiful pre-coding movie showing the best of the times. Especially for women waiting for anxiety is established in the room of a hospital's maternity home. An elderly woman, a flawless mother (Glenda Farrell), a weak young woman, Italian woman and the main character who has been jailed for 20 years (Loretta Young). Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital for every second illness to know that everything is OK. Aline MacMahone plays a great nurse in her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and entertaining. In any way it is not scared, but it is interesting to see such an indifferent topic on the silver screen. The actor shines all around. Loretta Young's condolences here. Eric Linden does not leave anywhere and is sincere. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is always as great as the pre-codex and good reason.
