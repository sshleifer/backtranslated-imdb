Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly exciting, well-prepared movie. I liked the way the substance of the main character subconsciously coddling the audience ... The player was top notch - honestly, I read the Dominic Monaghan's phone book! But everyone, especially a young girl, was great. I was very disappointed with the appearance of the movie. In general, "independent films" have a cereal, direct shot-on-my-camcorder look for them, but this director knows what he is doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I'm waiting for a feature length from Tess Nanavati!
