It was a great movie! There were only 15 people, including myself, though it was great! Dude and I laughed too much. My mother enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women there, and there was a middle aged 20 and they enjoyed it. I feel that Corky and Nedine love both Nancy and her favorite lol. And he takes the path and Ned is there. Yes, it was a great movie and even thought that people were not lol. Go, see that I'll see it! I'm really glad and my friend did it. <br /> <br /> People were very tough in this movie and they did not even see it. I think they will give a chance to film and actresses next time. All this was a great deal in my opinion. However, if you have young children, it is still appropriate. Perhaps I will take my 7 year old brother to watch.
