I was delighted to see the release of the first season of Amazing Stories on DVDs. In this series, we forgot about the role of actors and directors. The only way to see this beautiful series for the longest time was when re-managing the VHS 2 or 3 episode collection or Sci-Fi episodes. However, when Sci-Fi re-runs, they are usually involved in the same episodes. There were several outstanding episodes, such as the Mission they did not repeat in one season. Does anyone know how long this series has lasted? From 1985 to 1987, I say above IMDb, but I think I've been running for more than two years. If you love Twilight Zone, Nightclub and External Limits, you will love this series and will not be disappointed with your purchase.
