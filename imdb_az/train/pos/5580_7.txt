The beautiful young Eva (Hedy Lamarr) is married to an old man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, it does not satisfy sexual desires and does not see it. His wife is planning to go home and get a divorce. One day, he is in the middle of the tree in the lake. Gallops with horse dresses ... and then it runs! He meets with a young and very beautiful man (Aribert Mog). <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p> Of course, this has to be punished for the crime since 1933, as it causes a catastrophic catastrophe. <br /> <br /> In 1933, people who are horrified are very sophisticated in today's standards. Lamarr's naked swim does not show anything, and when the horse is completely missed, it is either shown in extreme long shoots or with branches and so on. Her breasts have only a few small weight. When you have sex with Mog, nothing is displayed on his face, but you see his orgasm. During this stage, he was highly respected and completely abolished in American freedom. <br /> <br /> <strong> After the past, it is beautifully drawn and not next to the dialogue. This may be a silent picture, except for a music account. Fortunately, all actors are good - especially Lamarr and Mog, and they are so attractive that they just take your breath away without watching them. Also, a favorite sequence is one of the most beautiful shooting and moving tracks I've ever seen in a movie. The scenes with a sexual symbolism (some of which are) are, unfortunately, very clear today. <br /> <br /> So, great direction, beautiful images, attractive actors, well-functioning environment - but not exactly twisted. I found that the film was moving slowly (a beautiful image did not take a picture for me), a bit boring, open, static, and ending. In the end I live, but I do not want to apologize to other problems with me. And the last sequence is really strange - and it's gone. So, I love this movie more than anything else. Good work has been done and I would recommend it, but with caution. Many people like this movie, but I live in a minority. Use your decision.
