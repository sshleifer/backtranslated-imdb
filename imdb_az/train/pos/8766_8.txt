I've seen this movie for the first time in a million years (exactly 5 years). I decided to watch this movie again in the light of recent developments in Australia for smuggling Australian woman Schapelle Corby. I am a sucker for the hot girls who need it (I just read my review of "Laurie Show Stalking") because I excluded my heart. Some of my eyes escaped from my moisture, but my tears were full. Why? Because the two heroes were absolutely beloved and desperate because the film was virtually inaccessible in the face of these two children, even though it was almost unhealthy. Why? Why did not we cry? He wanted to cry! When I rent a movie like this, I do not want to be calm, as it is the morning, I feel unhappy and like it. This movie was too short to do so. It was like putting the script into basic elements, and it was thrown out of psychological point of view. Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale have done a great job of reflecting the feelings of two friends, but this film has made more and more images in the more regretful (and pressured) circles of these girls. The mind travel is unfounded. Perhaps because of bad regulation, you see its key moments (very touching, accept). Sometimes I felt that these girls were walking in a postcard. Relationships with family members could have been a little more intense. What are the relationships between girls and parents (especially between Alice and her dad)? <br /> <br /> This was a great movie, and eventually I had to crush my lips a bit. . But for this reason actresses (and music) have more acting skills (and appearance) with the director's decency later. To be honest, I did not know who Kate Beckinsale was before watching this movie (again). Now I am not a fan! Great movie as long as you do not expect to be a classic movie.
