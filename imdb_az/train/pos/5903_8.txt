This movie reminded me of my marriage. Very clean, you can see it with your family. Very nice work done. Songs too. I think the writer is great. The film shows that marriages are progressing. At different stages of life, there are couples in life and life, the story is beautifully described in several stages in parallel with the same story. Some dialog boxes are pretty good. The film is not a dramatic phenomenon but a very beautiful complex of human emotions. It is also perfect, but then perfect. It shows the dynamics of the newly-married marriage very well. The film is very well written and directed.
