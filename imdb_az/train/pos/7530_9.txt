This animated film is a continuation of the sink and is as good as it is, and because of the same reason it has a lot of activity, so the voice over the actors is good, like Conroy as Kevin Batman, Mark Hamil as Joker and so on. These villains are really good at Joker, Two Sided, Catwoman, Clayface, and so on. So I'm sure the batman will not be disappointed with the new adventures, because it's very good. <br /> <br /> When my wife comes to me, make sure she is watching on television or leasing or publishing collectors. <br /> <br /> General score: ********* **** ***** **** ****
