It creates good yarns that are well appreciated by all actors. The best Michael Curtiz. Very nice twists and turns and the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell is beautifully comfortable and looks good on his debonair. Pioneer for Thin Man series. Give advice to everyone. Did you understand all this?
