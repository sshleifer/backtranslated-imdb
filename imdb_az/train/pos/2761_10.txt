I first saw this movie in August 1996 on the road from Paris to Paris, New York. I believe the film is a unique work. People are a type of movie you need to do. I still think that Daniel Auteuil is one of the most sexy actors around. In this French movie, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his life in front of a Down syndrome, living with other Down's syndrome patients. In fact, actors with the Down Syndrome actors create convincing friendships and relationships between these two tough guys. Daniel's life and us forever with Down Syndrome man. He realizes that life simply does not work and is not a game, but for life and love, and that it should be about all life. Although the latter is unhappy, I still consider it one of my favorite films. It is enough to open your eyes.
