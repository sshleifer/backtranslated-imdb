The astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades found a place flying in Saturn's rings. His comrades are instantly killed, but in fact they seem to be lucky. Steve returns a continuous leakage mass of a permanent mass into the Earth; <br /> <br /> It is often ridiculously funny - it's hard for me to believe that all the laughs are inaccurate - with enough absurd lines and situations around them. It seems like me to engage in low-budget genres from 50 to 60, and this is a nice fun movie. She is consistent with the nurse. <br /> <br /> Writer / director, William Saks, is worthy of credit for this intricate idea; thus, we treat the split screen sequence that does not add anything directly. its ultra-sophisticated character is truly memorable. I think her pacing a bit off; Some scenes (such as older couples) take a little longer, but ultimately it gives a degree of rough, shocking, B-film products. <br /> <br /> Arlon Obers 'music is gratifying, yet a few moments of fun, and Willy Curtis' cinematography creates really great shooting times. <br /> <br /> Rick Bakers brings with it a fantastic and credible makeup effect that creates a highly respected center for the film. <br /> <br /> The warehouse has almost everything to do with heavy make-up (Sachs gets my praise for the film's crushing) and it's a good thing to do. DeBen's is a very flawed and strange hero, and Ann Sweeney or his wife is not too hot, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson also support. Jane Blythe (Tobe Hoopers's "Eaten Alive" and Wes Cravens's "The Hills Have Eyes") and even directed by Jonathan Demme, are a sincere thing to see as many people like the Sherlock "Rainbeaux" (without the best shot) /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" 8/10
