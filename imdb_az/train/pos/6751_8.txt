A very good movie from Prettyger; There are also labyrinths in the nature of the modern city, as well as how they live in different views and perspectives, as well as groups and locals. Dana Andrews: "In this sense, it is a very hot water that has killed a man accidentally and spatially gladly kills a man with a good cop-shaped plate with a bad character as his hero." Hamlet plays a silver role and has never been better. The story may be a pure melodrama, but Andrews is giving weight and it almost raises the level of tragedy. As a daughter, Gen Tierney is attractive, but not outstanding. Gary Merrill is a very interesting hacker, providing a nice contrast to Andrews' coolness with natural warmth; her horrified, embarrassed person, as well as his smiling, despicable man, the dreadful wound he is following, and the moral police. <br /> <br /> There is no great surprise in this movie that looks like a link to everyone. The director met with the director Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, for Preminger. They had their career peaks since the film was being prepared. Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand, is a pretty optimistic player because all of them have set off. As a pretentious observer, as always, the pre-emperor allows events to emerge without expressing a strong sense, because the morality of an indefinite end is somewhat disappointing, because the cat and mouse between the two antagonists are bigger and larger than any movie it looks very archetypal <br /> <br />
