I was more excited; When I was only eight years old in 1983, I was going to see Star Wars in the theater! The best day of my life would have been. At that time, Star Wars' experience was just a few HBO indicator in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it provided me with less critical eyes that day. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceship. Emporer. A green bladed lightsaber !! Amazing! Wow! I should look at this movie hundreds of times this magical day. At this point, it is not possible to accurately estimate it. With those numerous scenes, I've certainly noticed that this movie - REAL Episode III - has its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Of course, these "flaws" in the context of the Star Wars movie have become more and more magical days of millions of people in 1977 and 1980s. In May 1983, I was also there. And it was my Star Wars movie.
