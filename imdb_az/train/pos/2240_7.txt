The love affair to Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, which helped me to start from my puberty in the Thunderball in 1965, led me to a number of unusual places. From this point of view, since 1959, this interest in the British, Luciannaya in one of the previous roles, "Carlton-Browne of the F.O.". The picture is really a showcase for talents for Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, though this star also began to rise at this point. In this pretty, often funny movie, we learn the island nation of Gaillardia Madeira, which was the British colony until 1916, and then forgotten later. But after forty-three years, when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered, it becomes world-class focus and international espionage center and sends Carlton-Browne bumps to the British Foreign Ministry. Terry-Thomas, as the role of the smaller country's prime minister, Amfibulos, is a good option. (This was the second film of Sellers' reflections in a small country in 1959, and the second was the "The Roared The Mouse"). Ian Bannen says that he is a show-maker of Gaillardia's suave here, and my daughter Lucianna is as attractive as she can be in her small role. Although some of the abdominal laughter (for example, at the Gaillardian airport and especially the parade in the May-Day style of Gaillardian's power), the film is shown as a very dry humor. The prime minister of the desperate British who sells strawberries with seemingly persistent stains, has a more memorable character in the pantheon of this great actor. Despite the consistent or fuzzy, rigid, high-angle English opposition, I found this photo as a hobby as a hobby and presented it on the crazy-looking Anchor Bay DVD.
