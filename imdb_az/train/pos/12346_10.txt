This is a very beautiful and poetic story. Beautiful landscape. Great music score. I've been to Japan twice last year and the film gave me this typical Japanese feeling. Camera movements and actors are superior. Without melodramatic, your senses deeply. The Japanese people are very sensitive and kind, and here the screen is very good. The lead plays a brilliant color, and the audience can use a film with delicate and subtle details. After seeing this movie you may want to see more of the same director. This is a really good movie and I can recommend it to anyone.
