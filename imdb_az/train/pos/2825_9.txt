This movie was pretty surprising. I did not expect much from being honest. Greta Garbo is the first Hollywood movie? So what? <br /> <br /> It is probably a rude thing and often shows low-level silent films with the usual exaggerated hand wave and facial contortions. <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo shocked the studio people just as you did with me because this movie made him a star and worthy. He understood the power of the still standing power, or simply captured a meaningful expression for a long moment and felt the effect alone. I thought of myself, how did this modern actress go into a flawless silent film? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a poor peasant who returns to return to a city that is improving only in the big city and then the survivor's life Like Leonora, Garbo is a performance. Co-star Ricardo Cortez may serve, but his character is not actually developed and violates the scenario throughout the story. At one point, Garbo's dresses are made to leave as a rule, then return to ignorance and give back. We still do not talk about Garbo and later his horrible final scenes with his wife. The road was very ordinary and I did not have a career afterwards and I could understand why. <br /> <br /> This film has many fantastic lines that all say. "Leonora, you're striking." Yes, it is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know the whole movie, just watch the last 30 seconds - Garbo says everything because his brother is sitting on his luxurious car. "He must be very happy and has everything he wants" - yes, Garboun's face is talking about it. This should be seen again, Garbo is just beautiful.
