The mysterious murders in a European village are the result of the VAMPIRE BAT assault that instigated the terrible public. <br /> <br /> This amazingly effective little work has been created by Majestic Pictures, one of Hollywood's poverty Row studios. Cruising production values ​​and rough correction actually add to its hearty atmosphere and have almost expressive qualities. In general, it leaves the viewer a feeling of a bad sleep that is appropriate for such an exciting imagination. <br /> <br /> Recent statements about ugly murders are ridiculous, and at least, the movie can boast of a good cast with respect to the development of the required fields. Grigorian Lionel Atwill, this time as a doctor who has been an old castle scientific researcher, typically delivers beautiful performances once again. Fay Wray plays the role of her assistant and makes her work less and less exciting. Dour Melvyn Douglas, a discreet police inspector, is Miss Wray's lover, in a relaxed way. <br /> <br /> Mood Eburne can look at the right situation that can be very exciting, Miss Wray hypochondriac aunt. Old Lionel Belmore plays the terrible burgermeister of the village. The smallest Dwight Frye, which is always remembered for its strange roles in FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is most effective here as a bat-loving lunatic.
