This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given to any movie. How well did this movie make for me? Fixed motion - no slow part, great motion, no intelligent writing. I liked the shooting style when it trembled as you are part of the scene and only feels different angles. Finally, I begin to see an action movie that does not try to appeal to all sectors of society (ie, there is nothing forcibly romantic). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
