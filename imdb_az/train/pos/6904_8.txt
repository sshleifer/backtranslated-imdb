This is a series of movies I can watch over and over again. If you had not seen him, give him a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are beautiful, and the film is very surprising, though it reminds me of Julia's premature death. It is a good opportunity to return to the international intrigue and to laugh so much at the time of fear and fear.
