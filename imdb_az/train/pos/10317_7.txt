Do you know how Star Trek fans flock to all Star Trek movies, even those who really are bad? Why? See the heroes again on the move. I thought about Doc Savage. I'm a great fanatic for character, and Doc and his crew are more likely to see an adventure. The first 20 minutes of the movie only increased the sense of expectation. Then, some Doc decided to make the shirts with adventures and throw it into a film, which eventually did not produce a decomposable film. There are many unanswered choices (music, camping elements, etc.) that are watched here. But Doc has a soul, and those who are familiar with Doc and his crew meet these. . So with my speed, I do not want to say that this is not a bad movie: it's not as good as it is. Everyone with Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters should only be familiar with the hero who inspired all of them to check this movie.
