When I went to the video cassette, I rented this movie and was really glad. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to get it on the DVD and I looked at it several times. When I said that the Indian writing was a nostalgic movie, I would have to agree with others. I can be 10-14 again while watching it. I think that's why we love the movie a bit. We sometimes wish that we would be able to restore our lives as children of wisdom and knowledge. Do all your friends / parents like to be younger again? Do not worry about your business, mother, and so on. Being ... ??? I know that I would like to go to De Lore and return in time. I love the movie, though it is my favorite favorite camp movie, but with Bill Murray. I want them to make an Indian summer version.
