Ask a giraffe ... Ask Johndan Nadia and she is sure to give her a good answer, yes: Yes. Get started with questions and doubts about the relationship between a man and a woman who do not know each other in this way, as well as a "Birthday Girl". <br /> <br /> The birthday movie is a passionate film capable of counting me. At the same time, Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses I've ever seen (She's pretty and smart). "Birthday Girl" is the story of a single and ordinary person looking for a wife on the internet. The woman she finds comes from Russia. She can be sensitive woman, not normal, more. One day, on the day of birth, suddenly, his uncle's son and his friend come. The man begins to discover certain things. <br /> <br /> Many of us believe that the movement and excitement are sure and new not just "Birthday." It is full of good surprises, good performances, and an imaginative plot that you have never seen and imagined.This romantic tension with some funny touches is a great natural film with many suggestions for this movie. <br /> <br /> "Birthday" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes severe but at the end of the day, it's completely up to you. satisfactory. <br /> <br /> I have to apologize for the mistakes, if so, it would be good.
