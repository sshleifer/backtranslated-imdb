It was a beautiful historical drama. John Turturro brilliantly describes the manic impressions of the character, such as the genius genius Luzin, as an excellent and strange dance. Emily Watson is a nice role as a sensual lover, like Natalia. The relationship between chess and the proximity of madness, Gorris and acquaintance Nabokov's "eternal innocence" (ie, "Lolita"), appears in this film. I will continue to read novels now. It was a touch and a catastrophic end, and it was difficult to keep an eye dry. Brilliant movie!
