"The Sentinel" (1977) is a creepy film that is still in the center of the unrecognizable actress Cristina Raines. In this one, a fashion model, Alison Parker, does not think that Brooklyn Heights moves to the brown stone and will give too much in this late date, which is very close to the gate. And as a renter in this building, acne plumbing and occasionally are subject to worse conditions than the water bug, to put it mildly! Indeed, the scene facing Alison's neighbor neighbor is really terrible and, of course, most of the viewers should send low ice water down the bones. Despite the complaints of many critics about Raines's mobility, I thought it was better than hunting with areas like Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon, and Eli Wallach. The description is based on an effective benevolent conclusion, and despite the fact that some traps are not disclosed, I feel more convinced. According to the DVD Deliryum, "Any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles can not be as bad as the top cannibal lesbians in leopards!" One side note, I went to Montague Terrace on Brooklyn Heights yesterday and looked at the Sentinel House. Yes, it still exists, and it looks very much like this in spite of the heavy slippery clothes in the top-floor window and the blind priest's lack. If this house really sits at the entrance of Hell, I'm Hell ... Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we know the New Yorkers for a while!
