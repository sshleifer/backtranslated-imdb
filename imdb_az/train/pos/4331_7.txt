Killing in Mesopotamia, I have always accepted one of the better Poirot books because I have a very heartwarming ending. There is no doubt that TV compatibility is remarkable with a few beautiful photography and very exciting music scores. As usual, David Suchet is perfect as Hercule Poirot, episode's a comedy moment with Poirot's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is as sensitive as Captain Hastings. The remainder of the rubble turns into decent speeches, but some cristi adaptations have to focus on avoiding two potential hazards. Some of the episodes were terribly scary, a little bit of a tragic episode like Five Small Pig, and one episode really liked me. Especially creepy, when Louise Leidner saw his face on the face of the whisperer, she put aside the music. The adaptation book was so loyal, but I did not want to say that there were three things. The main problem was pacing, it was very slow and there were occasional scenes. And I did not like being killed by Joseph Mercado. In the book, I see it as a very frustrating character, but the fact that it is a murderer's intrusion and not developing it makes it a less attractive character, although I am happy that they will abstain from drug addiction. (I noticed that writers were becoming hysteria when they believed that the book Mercado in the book was the next victim of the book). Amy seemed less sensitive in the adaptation if it was effective, even if adaptation, as in the theory of Amy Leatheran, was so impressive. In general, I liked murder in Mesopotamia, despite some wrong ideas on behalf of the writers. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
