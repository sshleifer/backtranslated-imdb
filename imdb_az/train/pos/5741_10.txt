One of my favorite movies I've ever seen in Seattle. Tom Hulce was beautiful, words could convey his feelings. I really donated some money to Mike Ferrell to help spread the film. This is a good. The system said they needed more mistakes, but did not want to give the plot things. I was Hulce and director, Seattled in the audience, writer and Mike Ferrell. They talked an hour later. The house is not really a dry eye. I still do not know why Hollywood is stupid. (I really know our fault, see what we look at) What do you pay for good kids? Get it and see it with someone special. It's a stone.
