The 1st season was beautiful, the whole idea of ​​the island's correction was only extraordinary while (and seen) the secrets were explored; full of tension, cliff tones and a beautiful plot. I want to say that I love all the ideas I'm going to use on the island. And when I first saw the first smoke beast in the first episode, I was truly impressed. Since then, I've been involved in it. Along with the first season of the second season, it was a little better. I liked the idea of ​​DHARMA Initiative and boards. All sequences and sequences of the season were mysterious, creepy and exciting. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but still great. I like to see others' backgrounds, see their camps, and explore the secrets further. ("Tricia Tanak Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season was not good, yet breathtaking and entertaining but most exciting! Now, 4 seasons. There were hopes this season, and we've had a few episodes, but really started drilling and monotonous. That is, I want to say that I like the new "saviors" like Miles and Daniel. The site was old after the first few episodes ... and most ... Season 4 LOST was excluded from a perfect series: mystery, tension, comedy, confusion (Charlie went) and total excitement. Additionally, some of my favorite characters were separated.
