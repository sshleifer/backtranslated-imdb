Only since I have watched this movie again since 1998, showing VH-1, I only have to comment. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time on television, it was 1981, my mother's bet. I remember the film, starting with the song "My Bonnie": "My Bonnie" camera panned on a scene of Fenerbah√ße. I also remember the opening scene where Paul would not bend to some girls, and I say, "Look, talent!" So I recalled, in my 1998 compilation, that it was opened with "My Loved One" instead of "My Bonnie". When you see that the camera looks slower than the speed of music, it says, "He loves you, it's just not right." Also, in this "later" version, Paul sees the girls, "Look, girls!" He remembers and remembers previous versions in a way that does not match this word. I thought that they had to amerikantize the film for the American audience. Personally, if I'm going to watch a movie about the English band, I want all the English desires and their words, behaviors and so on. I want to be part of it. <br /> <br /> How was it that more irritation? "angry" editing was for television. After Stu was beaten, for example, the film violates direct trade - 'em. Yes, I know it depends on the network, but it really destroys the impact of a movie on its slicing, we all know. <br /> <br /> Some people are insignificant in terms of dialogue (and hence to make adjustments), they can really go for the following action or scene explanation. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the version of this movie was probably the previous version I have been asking since 1981, which included the Shake, Rattle & Roll version of our 1998 version. I began to think that there should be two different versions for television, and confirmed that I looked at the "alternative versions" link on this movie. The fact that the American version is somewhat shortened / cut / different scenes and / or dialogue is a great disappointment and something to focus on these issues. Imo, the best ones, is to try and get a continual version of the European version of this movie, impossible and (even less likely). Unfortunately, I have to cancel my old Betamax version because I did not know how to translate it. <br /> <br /> I saw that this movie was gone, perhaps one of the best films ever. The story behind the Beatles birth. When describing historical events, I know that the artistic and creative license is often used in movies and television, and I have not allowed any inconsistency in the film. Of course, you see the poetry that made me wonder at the Beatles Cavern, "Did they even write that?" I do not think, but despite this, I thought it was a great movie and performance <br /> <br /> Actually, for me, John was the actor playing Stephen MacKenna. I just fell in love with her. His appearance, his behavior, his personality, and the voice of speech seemed stain. When I saw the first Beatles for Ed Sullivan, it seemed to me as a young John to duplicate the end of the film. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deadly history of Beatles's life and its start, I really asked whether the Beatle movie was real. You will not get anything better than The Beatles Anthology, because it's written by boys, but if you're looking for a fun look at the Beatlemania days before coming to America, and if you put analytical critical reviews on the doorstep, the "Beatles's Birth" you can not go wrong - It is necessary for any "real" or casual Beatle fan.
