Not only is this film a major film for major cinematography (scenarios, toys, setting, etc.), but also for its realism. This film could have happened in any farm or village. There is no difference if the film will be held in Louisiana or in Kansas. Stories and incoming messages will remain the same. This film shows family values ​​and relationships for a larger audience, but also shows the younger behaviors of young audiences. I knew that everyone who watched this would go face-to-face with something that touched them. Every time my watch is coming to the last home to avoid drowning in tears. Bitmap emphasizes the importance of farm security and anyone who does not work on a farm should see this movie. Insecurity and carelessness make you a dangerous one. <br /> <br />
