I offered to sell this movie to my friend, and he forced the film since it was no good. Our version of the store was named "Fear: Halloween Night", which was a bit shocking. This film is expected to erase off a Halloween off a killer wooden boy. But it was opened with a good scene and the killer immediately killed two victims and went on for twenty years. Her son, who was witnessed to her, killed two men (including her mother), and even fallen in the woods with friends and lover who are trying to face the fear as they come to their fathers in the spirit of their father as a wooden statue in a lonely cabin of suicide. After a while I was very good and did not even see it first.
