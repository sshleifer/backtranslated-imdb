Ida Lupino was one of the few women to break down the Hollywood director's glass ceiling under the studio system. Not surprisingly, she also touched upon protocol-feminist issues, so it was rarely clear what she was talking about. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Author: Mala Pauer: she lives with her parents, but she is dealing with a swollen boy (Robert Clarke), who is now winning $ 90 a week and finds it is stalked out of the plant after a night's work.In the next stage, is the best movie? When he returns home, when he is in shock and shock, the police can not take him for a long time, he has never seen the aggressor (a snack machine outside the plant), trying to act as if nothing happened, he thinks everyone is looking at him, and he falls into a state of the fugitive fleeing to Los Angeles on a bus but fleeing to a vacation spot <br /> <br /> As he wakes up in a strange village house, he learns that he was rescued by a young minister, Tod Andrews, in the California city of agriculture. He lied about his identity and packed the oranges. Two love falls uncertainly, but Powers keeps secret secrets for Andrews. <br /> <br /> This was a brave film about the history of a company, when he caught a key and kicked the kiss of Jerry Paris trying to kiss .... <br /> <br /> It was a brave film 1950 and will be able to disclose and give some excuses. Lupino never returns to the fear of early attack, and film becomes conscious and sentimental, talking and didactic ends. Yes, Lupino had important information for informing, but he did not rely on the story to speak for himself. Its casting is pleasant, but not too helpful to provide soft and general, either melodramatic postures or homespun. But what was really wrong with the harassment of aggression and what really meant it for the survivors was an exciting adventure for the next conversation.
