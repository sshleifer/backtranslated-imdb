<br /> <br /> A group of low and endangered groups are merged with an "experienced" crook to avoid themselves from poverty. <br /> <br /> As we know, Mr Clooney is actually a funny thing for a change. Casting is perfect and the moving standards are very high. Although it is possible to say that the theme of the blue group is not new, I think this film works in an interesting and unique way. <br /> <br /> <strong>
