Jim McKay has made one of the best movies ever seen. The quiet simplicity of this film draws you from the opening shot and does not allow you to go. Not a bug in the entire movie. Not one. Everything works. Handheld camera never attracts attention and should always be. Three young ladies who follow her life are always real. It's not the only game we look at actresses playing the role of spectators. real girls who are just trying to find themselves. There is no secret or any other political agenda. This is the most cautious film, and it is likely to be seen by several filmmakers, although this is more extensive. Special films can not wait to see what Mr McKay next is off.I have the money needed to get this important movie for filmmakers Hugh Hefner.
