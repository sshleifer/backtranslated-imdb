<br /> <br /> This movie was a little foolish story, but it was a fantasy, and cast-and-play was spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as actor / impostor, with all the smallest neuroses and actors imagined gaps. <br /> <br /> This was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just as his character had the best role that embodied the dead dictator! And the fragmentation scene: something like Casablanca! <br /> Raul Julia Paradoria was as beautiful as the Secret Police Chief. He takes some really funny lines, some of them respect other films: "Roll the suspects!" <br /> <br /> Sonia Braga was perfect as a girl friend - besides being a really hot team: "You need to get an Oscar this evening!" <br /> <br /> Recall Johnny Winters as CIA agent and several guest stars: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - Completed. <br /> <br /> Generally, a memorable reptile beneath Paradoria. <br /> <br /> -R.
