As an BSG fan, I have to say that I'm not sure exactly what I think about this show. I saw this night on the big screen at the Arclight Cinema (as part of the demonstration at the Paley Center) and then cast and filmmakers talked. Ron Moore said, "I want Battlestar to want a pure rally and want something different, and yes, some fans have lost but I hope they will win others." <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> "The actor I played was more interested in his strong faith than the actor who played with Zoe, a little violet, but he was a young man" Zoe " (and I'm sure Zoe will not be the only one to think of a cylon, the danger of becoming a BSG geek.) They want this new Bamber / Helfer / Park, they want to re-think <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz, a person who has been overwhelmed by a tragedy, such as Daniel Greystone, who is confident that he will not be disappointed and disappointed, especially on a scene where his daughter's teenage teenager is on a web-site, confidential information about her characteristic computers and people's inner world. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (saas), the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), says that he is clever and good as part of Stoltz. written and beautifully played, and living together forever and forever, and they have rarely had a strong relationship with these days. I hope to see what this family is and I hope to get something like Roslin in the BSG - she is strong and intelligent, and it's really good when she clings to her child. Not to remember the eyes that can hold magic powers is so intense. <br /> <br /> The other part of the show that does not work for me is a 100% turnaround for a government agent - a very short scene, but it has played well - really gives you an idea of ​​his power. Scenes with Esai Morales and her mafia genius tribe. He generally did a good job, but I did not believe in the power of these gangs, and I was scared by their threats. I found myself to understand that this story line was somewhat mysterious and difficult; In the way presented, it is almost a matter of honor to God's father, they make you a little bit. But over time, I find that with the help of poor minorities (Morales, etc.), it becomes an Interesting "Top / Bottom", compared with the wealthiest people in the planet (Stolz, etc.). <br /> <br /> Looking at the boy playing the "Willy Adama" from BSG's lovers, he liked being honest when talking to his son about the origin of his name. she does not really look like diamond, but she's just a kid. Will it sound more like it is in this movie and who knows it? I can not say I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays "Brother Clarice" and is hesitant and strange on every stage. I'm not sure what to run or who will do, but I'm very sorry for his work. In this film, he was on the one hand, but then obviously set up to play a very important part. <br /> <br /> <strong> Roma is not something of his own character, but I always find something impressive in the actors. <br /> <br /> Unlike the BSG, the music is really good and less open. , Bear McCreary. <br /> <br /> When talking about "panel discussions" after the conversation, Seth Green organized it. . Ron Moore was very clever and expressive, David Eick clever (like blanket videos), Esai Morales told a long story about how he played and Eric Stoltz was very funny and really did not answer any questions he had always had for him). Paula Malcomson was difficult (Seth Green was mistakenly told that she was 24 years old), and Zooey and Lacey were both lovers. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer also responded to questions about how they performed their movements on the BSG. Generally, a very interesting and beautiful evening. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give 9 out of 10 demonstrations and I'm looking forward to expecting too much. <br /> <br /> Note: I just watched this second time and hope to actually explore why HOLOBAND was originally made. I do not know what may be, but I have a great charm.
