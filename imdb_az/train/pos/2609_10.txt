<br /> <br /> After the last episode has been shown, I've been writing this for 9 years, and still I'm going to break out of the impact on Wildside. <br /> <br /> This was a great deal of success in the success of many other police drums. <br /> <br /> It's just that we've been stupid, just because we've lost this series. But it also accelerated and, despite the realism of the streets, Wildside remained loyal to Sydney's uniqueness, and because I really owe it to this beautiful series, Underbelly dramatized and acted. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < BR> <strong> That's why I ask ABC to leave the full series of DVDs, not the top three. Give this series a deserved end.
