This is not the comicist Robin Williams, nor is the quirky / crazy Robin Williams of his last fame. Combined with Robin's new romantic love, this is a hybrid of classic drama, from dramatization. But this is not a tension. <br /> <br /> The stars try to find the place for the sick boy and goalkeepers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This Suspense drama, <br /> <br /> I feel more like a guy (Williams) watching, because he really carries out actions, from the perspective of the third person. <br /> <br /> In a word, it felt real, and I could subscribe to the story's start. <br /> <br /> Generally, Friday / Saturday will not be, though it takes an hour. / <br /> <br /> This is a level of 7.7 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:.
