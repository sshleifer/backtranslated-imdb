Waiting for the Red Eye. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well-directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in this role. Yes, the same story with a different verse, but Wes Craven gave a good pace. At least the usual college killer is another Scream. If you do not seem to be the main character of your self, it is a good thing to see a clean, tense tension. A filmmaker like Craven who lent himself to bring home a good television movie if he had brought many innovative ideas into the genre of tension and horror in the past and is now just released in nature. Good job!
