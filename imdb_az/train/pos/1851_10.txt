We saw this film at the National Association of the 27th Annual Congress of Black Journalists held in August in Milwaukee, WI. MOVIE IS GREAT! Derek Luke is as beautiful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. Real Antwone Fisher has done a great job of filming, and Denzel's direction has been the right way. See the weekend's opening. You will not be disappointed.
