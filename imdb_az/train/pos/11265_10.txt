I did not know who Robert Wuhl was before seeing this. But after seeing it, I realized what a funny man was. It is teaching HBO's special "New York University" movie students "American history" and the man was only extraordinary. Only in the United States, almost every major historical event that took place in many parts of the world was fun. This documentary / comedy was a great satire and asked me if I was a naive, true story. <br /> I like mixing Mr. Wuhl's useful information with great comedy and it's more exciting to learn. I would recommend this to anyone interested in history, and we are ready to ask what his beliefs are.
