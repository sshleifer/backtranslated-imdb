If you can skip the movie, Pecker is a great movie, perhaps the best of John Waters. A beautiful castle that begins with strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci makes the story so funny and realistic. There are some shock scenes that are of course inappropriate for younger children, but there is one goal. Unfortunately, this movie has not been produced publicly and most of the community will be able to see it. Take this movie, if you can.
