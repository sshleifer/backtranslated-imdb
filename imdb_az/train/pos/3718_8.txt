It was a good movie. Your typical war is not a bit of a hit, but a bit different. This film showed us soldiers at the pre-war training and is not actually a war. This movie is one of the more realistic ideas from war and other similar films in the army. Colin Farrel has done a great job of describing an army job, and Clifton Collins Jr and Matthew Davis also contributed very well. When you see Colin Farrel's transition from grade b to class a few years, you never thought that would happen. And I will add that in the filmmaking in 2000 and as seen in 1970, tiger manufacturers have done a great job. It is good to use your talent wisely and hope to see the same capability in the near future.
