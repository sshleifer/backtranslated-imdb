Paramount understands that he wants to shoot this movie with Rodgers and Hart, but he has not been able to solve copyright issues, so Van Heusen, who wrote most of the songs for Bing Crosby between Burke and Van Heusen, was very nice. <BRr> <br /> I've read Leonard Maltin, that this movie is "Crosby's fitting as a glove" and I did not put it in a better way. No, this is not Mark Twain's, but Bing Crosby, and in 1949 was Crosby Hollywood's most widely used star. Paramount's technician and Rhonda Fleming have never been lovelier on the screen. <br /> <br /> William Bendix's Brooklyn roots are somewhat different, but they have a good comic effect. Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a good time with Busy Doing Nothing. <br /> <br /> The third song, along with Rhonda Fleming, once and once. Bing has one of his patented revolution philosophical numbers. This song was nominated for the best song, but lost in Baby It's Cold Out. <br /> <br /> Bing was able to write accounts with Rhonda Fleming for Decca and Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is Crosby's comic talent, Bob Hope. <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm talking about the filming of Bing.
