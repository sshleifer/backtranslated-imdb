When I was a kid one day in Disney's beautiful world, I remembered to see this movie. This movie is more than 30 years old in my memory, and I'm looking for it. After almost all the children's films, I've seen more than anything else, and just really want to see it again after seeing it once. The story and pictures of this movie burned in my memory. So far, I have not seen anything since the 1970s; in fact, I never remembered the title until today, as I was previously informed by internet searches. I liked it and wanted to see my kids. Does anyone know where I can find it?
