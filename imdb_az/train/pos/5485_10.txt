You can never watch one of the most timely and documented documents. While the story takes place in the capital of Venezuela, Caracas gives a sincere look at the political dynamics of the western hemisphere. In fact, in another chapter in the story of "US-backed, Latin American coup," this movie is in real time, and what happens when the poorest people have unity, political insight and courage! <br /> <br /> The political concepts presented by this film are very valuable. The private media has clear examples as a mighty force for massive deception and propaganda. We see the poorest people in Caracas, who are struggling with the brutal realities of "American politics." When people are suddenly and illegally opposed to the aggressor oppressing the conspirators, it explicitly implies the expected resurrection. We also see the CIA-backed, private media, plotters and generals' arrogance and fascism, who agreed to repatriate Venezuela under Washington's sovereignty. Though under the leadership of President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas have to act with him after the abduction of Chavez by the denied generals. Their reaction is the highest point of the film. This is a movie that the US government, looking for a great portrait of Hugo Chavez and the Revolutionary Venezuela!
