The Seven Pounds, this was just the movie I was convinced, Will Smith really goes to the movies "I'll make you cry". Something that I can give him a ton of credit can make him cry. Only when moving as a story, Will Smith re-proves time and time that he can act, so why is it so regrettable? But still a good movie. I forced it to cry, but I felt that Rosario Dawson was different from performance, I absolutely love this daughter, and I knew that Ed Norton would get off this girl since I was seeing him at 25. She is beautiful, charming, funny and talented, and can not wait to see how long her career will last. <br /> <br /> Two years ago, Tim was in a car crash, and she was also injured. caused by using his mobile phone; Seven people were killed: six men and a fianc√©e.

But I liked the last thing, it was beautiful and really thanked for life and did not accept it. There are good people in this world and Benin's character reminds us to give life to those who need help and helpless ones. <br /> <br /> <strong>
