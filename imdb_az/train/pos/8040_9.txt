This will be a little short. First, do not listen to critics, as the majority say, is not as bad! Sniper utilizes a classic film formula, many of which release the film immediately. The Sniper does not have a 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, but it does bring Snape's view to those who do not know anything about the Professional Sniper. And yes, there are many flaws in the film, but what's not a movie? There are very good scenes and good moves by Tom Berenger. I have to say that Zane watched Billy Zane at the helm at the helm of the film and at the Marine's bar scene. The best scene in the sniper is Beranju sweeps in the middle of a field with the forthcoming force! There are plenty of classic shots used by the camera as you look through the jungle and a good shotgun. And yes, the sniper's steam "a shot, kill one". Judge Sniper for yourself! <br /> <br />
