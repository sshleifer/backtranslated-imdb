Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best players and favorites of our time. <br /> <br /> I remember that many years ago we had a party in our house - friends came, we sat around the table, dining, drinking, talking, laughing - a good time. Television started working - we did not pay much attention to the film. Then we talked and we laughed. The glasses were not round, the forks did not move, the plates were cold. We did not see our eyes that the young man who was opposed to his whole body, and who had only control his left foot, tore a peg through his feet and tried to write eternally only a word. When we finished writing in a word, we all knew that we were triumphant - the triumph of the will and spirit of man, the moment in which the film was captured, <br /> <br /> Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot" work from cerebral palsy to the world a whirlwind, a strange bio-drama associated with Christy Brown. a Dublin sink; <br /> <br /> I love Lewis' performances every day (I have mixed feelings on GONY), but I think her biggest role is Christy Brown's "In My Feet"
