This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Several players like Jet Li can play stoic. The action is fast shot and special effects are increased for intensity goals. As a result, Americans can be a little watchful. A bit of stopping the kufr takes a long way in the Jet Li film. I feel that this is a great introduction to Jet's work and brings more masterpieces (especially Legend Fistini) to the US market. A wonderful blend of weapons and physical conflict will provide the most flick enthusiasts of action.
