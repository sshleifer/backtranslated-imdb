Tension D.W. Griffith's Intolerance The full length of Buster Keaton in the three centuries was the first attempt of comedy. The only one for intolerance is the opening of the "book" scene and the similar stories that have been around for centuries into a complete movie. The justification for Keaton's adaptation to this style could have been reduced to three rewards if he did not succeed as a feature film. Fortunately, it's a brilliant success as a three-year comedy and contains some funniest routines I've seen in Keaton. There is nothing unique and brave about story lines. They are a simple guy-answer-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-pick-girl plot, but the period satires is strange and defines the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all films of this genre. But I do not believe anyone can overcome this comedy. No one can play the unusual door like Keaton, and the scenes in this movie are the best. Additionally, Wallace Beery's view of Keaton's rival adds this movie's appeal. Everyone who thinks that the 1920 comedy can not be praised by modern masses should see this movie.
