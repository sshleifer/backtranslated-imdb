What a stunning episode for this beautiful series. This is the best television advantage. The story takes place in 1968 and is made in almost cunning style with beautiful black-and-white, deep shades and stunning pictures. This is a story about two lovers, but I do not want to spoil it. It is a rare presentation of homosexuals that they encountered in America in the 1960s. Written by the great Tom Pettit and operated by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move our lives, their love for each other and their tragedy. Taking such a sensitive issue further impresses the episode. Our emotions are torn and strangled as characters. Bob Dylan's novel "The New Testament, but I was even older, and now I am older," as Byrds read, the sounds ended. It's a bit gone and the way up to the stars. Beautiful.
