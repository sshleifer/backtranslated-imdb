The figurative trolley, which is one of the symbols, is the sound that the characters use to disperse the garbage dump. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and explains the story of a group of people living in defective homes on the edge of an effective bottom. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> It's amazing that sometimes some there are three or four hours of original version in a shortened version due to incorrect reasoning during promotional materials. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <i> I have mixed feelings about the movie to see the movie yesterday. First, it is closely related to each one of the first films that follow. You can see each of the six films that are reflected in this film and the Kurasowals that fall below the rest of the sunset. You can understand the color of the film and see how it extends to a movie fund; he would be happy (of course, there are unsuccessful projects). Film is a visual art of the art (though you may be aware of it on your TV, this will also be shown at the normal TV rate of 1.33). The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that these people do not come together directly. As with individual tales, they all work well, but they do not depend on each other as part of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not blame Kuresna, because I can not always shoot in the box, especially those who specialize in many character films, such as Robert Altman, have bombed themselves. <br /> <br /> I have no reason to see the film. Like all Kurasowa films, they do not want me to see and work on movies. The first arrival of the Trolley is one of Kurasowa's best things and is worth the rental price. One of the most magical moments like a tram is considered and removed from the movie history. The car's father and son are touched (ultimately very upset) and have other bits and glow pieces (like bulk on silver) and at least test the film different from one person <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
