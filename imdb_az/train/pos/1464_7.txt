More like psychological analysis of films, but Psycho sounds better as a title. The responsible men in the film (if they tell you) describe their films here in their own way. Most of them are classics, but all of them are mentioned here on the IMDb and I strongly recommend seeing them (especially Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, Conversation and Lynch) because Slavoj Zizek will refer them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, it can spoil them for you. I do not remember that it suffered more from the list (I think there are also Chaplin films), but as I wrote, it would be best to watch them in advance! There is a missing movie on the IMDb list, and I've been reporting that I can get out of there soon. It's not a Meg Ryan movie, but it's not a big deal of a rich deal. <br /> <br /> Zizek is naked and entertaining to listen to the views and thoughts. another perspective (even if your favorite movie breaks a bit for you ... it does not mean it will do, but)!
