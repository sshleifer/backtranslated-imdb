The Korean War dubbed America's forgotten battle. Many unanswered questions were buried with 50,000 people who died there. Sometimes we get treatment for a game or movie that is fraught with a frozen cemetery remotely. Perhaps it is perhaps the best. This is called "Sergeant Ryker". The story is an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin), who was secretly appointed by his commander. His task is to offer the North Koreans a defect and services against the United Nations. It is so fortunate that he is very valuable to the enemy and is given the rank of the Grand. However, it was later captured by Americans, being tested as a traitor and a spy. He said that he had commanded that he was defective and, unfortunately, learned that his commander had been murdered and that his innocence had no proof or evidence. He was convicted and sentenced to hang. However, his conviction is suspected by his prosecutor Capt Young (Bradford Dillman). Since Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) is convinced of the suspicion, he was given a new trial and found guilty. The drama in the courtroom includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton, and Norman Fell. Max Winkler. Korea was a very remote place, but in the 1950s, accusing a Communist and assaulting him was very close to home. Thanks to the super script and powerful message, this drama became classic in the courtroom. Perfect view and recommended for all. ****
