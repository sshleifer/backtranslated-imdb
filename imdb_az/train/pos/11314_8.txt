Amazing! Wow! It is a film that can watch the movie ten times and still enjoy its nuances. Completely incredible! If it were Visconti's first movie, I'd be shaky without thinking of what would happen if the movie was better than the movie. Ossessione (Obsession) was even more vivid: it was completely incredible - it's just another Venetian Death I've seen in her (during writing). One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, but his story did not take Ossessione. If you hit the "different" button on the links on this page, there are fears in the movies on those sites. They are not really fair in movie experience: Twice of the first movie adapted to James M. Cain's "Postman Always Rings", such a delicate camera movement, so amazing composition, so wonderful face, so awesome characters, such a great story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < they can actually feel everything (i do not know anything about it), that is, this actor can use the phone technics - but so far, some of the best, most original and realistic performances in the movie. Also, eight years ago, the name of Tram has brought a new sensitivity to the screen, Ossessione is an exciting emotion! The most sensitive thing since the beginning of the movie! Yes, I'm having preference, but Ossessione was just terrible. Ossessione Tram This fascist Italy has been forbidden by Mussolini and has not been affected by the fact that it was cut off in America. . American trams for up to 59 years, after eight years of tram <br /> <br /> I did not see her full reputation, so I do not say it again - just one of her best, most beautiful and interesting writing, and I tell you to go out and see! As another reviewer, I will buy it for the time he can find it!
