"The Prince of Shanghai" is known as one of the most difficult production in Hollywood. Welles was originally purchased by cutting manufacturers and cut the ribbon. This made it even harder for him to watch the mystery. They dubbed a good portion of her Irish conversation because of the accent of Irish accent, and the dubbing was very clear and weak. <br /> <br /> As we all know, the most disastrous of these is the differences between Welles and his screen and real-life leader, Rita Hayworth, and their thunderous chemistry comes on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this is the direction of Fantastic Orson Welles. Makes the movie an incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene seems to breathe just behind the screen. Also, the characters and scenes are very strange that they are boundaries of imagination and surrealism. The feeling of stranginess raises frequent scenes in these films, such as sequences in the courtroom. I usually find a drama in the courtroom, but the direction and quirky touches of Welles make them all the more interesting. Reminds one of David Linch's last words in Carnival. <br /> <br /> It's also very good here. Despite their unsuccessful attitudes, Welles and Hayworth also give decent speeches - only a little bit of their interaction. Everyone, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders, is outstanding and pleasant to watch. "The Prince of Shanghai" has obvious problems, but he expects one of the cinema masters to see the best.
