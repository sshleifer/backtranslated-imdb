I have great respect for Disney's animated films, and when it's late, I'll really say "I have not seen it." <br /> <br /> Atlantis looked interesting from the first movie poster and trailer and did not expect my happiness. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is focused on "more mature" Disney movie (an unusual feature of Disney movie) and more in the sense that there are no songs, and more than just Disney's offer. The world of Atlantis is hidden under the nucleus of the earth, represented by caverns that are ruined by its ruins, and then gradually transform into natural ecosystems, although it is usually something reminiscent of some of the toughness of the tropical paradise itself. The presentation of the landscape and structure of the simple Atlantis, with some good cheerful songs, gave the kingdom a more beautiful and interesting look. <br /> <br /> Adds attempts to incorporate the Atlantic language and its attempts to integrate into the mythology of ancient civilizations and work fairly well. <br /> <br /> Except for some scenes with the presence of Mole, practical jokes, I often did not seem much more than a "child" element combined with Disney films. Instead, the key elements were struggling to go to Atlantis, and a steady discovery in Atlantis, as well as Milo, was able to learn all the information needed to help the Atlantic to find its part in its history. they did not know about them. Part of the place means the Atlantic "weapon" used at a very moving summit, which is extremely exciting to avoid a better word. Of course, the whole story is inaccurate, and there is no new computer-generated visual effects in the film, but beyond Toy Story movies, this is the most fun Disney movie I have ever seen.
