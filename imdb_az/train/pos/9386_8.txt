Here, though, the item is missing, it still provides great entertainment while working and generally does everything that a film of nature can do. I actually saw this movie because it was run by John Dahl - it was a high-level filmmaker with great excitement like The Last Seduction, Rounders, and Roadkill. If I believe the film is as standard as I see it, the Red Rock is certainly a movie that the West can certainly be proud of. Area is extreme moral about Michael; a man who is traveling in America looking for a job. When he hit a rod in Red Rock he finds it one day - just to catch a job is to kill a man's wife. It was a mistake for a murderer named Lyle, but to do the job; both sides play against each other and eventually plans to make a run. However, attempts to escape are unsuccessful and when the true Lyle returns, she finds herself in a bad state ... <br /> <br /> John Dahl enjoys excitement on the way; It's been about ten years since Kill Me Again three years ago, and then with Roadkill. It's not hard to see why Dahl chooses this place because it provides a loved atmosphere for a story. Dahl is filmed as "an atmospheric" film, since the film is mainly focused on the central character and is full of dark and mysterious characters. Nicholas Cage, acting in the lead role, is largely good at playing with Lara Flynn Boyle, A-class support from J.T. Walsh and, of course, Dennis Hopper; which once again ordered with his screen over the top screen. The second half of the film is not like the first, but Red Rock West is certainly not boring, and the way to put Dahlin at the big finals is part of all the central characters. In general, Red Rock West is a movie that has caused you to regret the audience. All this is exciting, and you do not want even more!
