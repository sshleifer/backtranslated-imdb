Ok, here is the personal list of my best Nicktoons shows here today: <br /> <br /> All grown up / SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> 2. My Life is like Teenage Robot 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Pay attention only to one word in capital letters? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Simple, but a great animated comedy about "Three Catscratch" - mostly about three rich cats - Mr. The man is surprised and surprised by the fact that Kimberely is trying to move to the root beer. This is simply a Nick show that is often curled up in your comic bone! The theme song is charming and memorable. Sound actors, including Wayne Knight, from the Seinfield franchise, bring symbols to life with very strange personalities. The stories are pleasant (fans of the episodes will be "The King of All Roots" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And humor is all done on the dry Jim Style. <br /> <br /> So, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which is very popular all over the world only 3 seasons or less.
