I do not know what people are doing against this movie, but this is definitely one of my favorites. It is not propaganda, it is not related to morality, it should not be controversial. This is God alone. Any possible God, despite the religion. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Jim Carry, a television reporter Bruce Nolan, usually plays on the open side of the news, to prove himself helpless (for little or no herself) do a good job in anchor work. This driver slowly removes his beautiful daughter Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the last sticks are executed, he is not laughable, but it sounds before God, in turn gives Bruce powers. After that, Bruce improves his life, prepares to help others, and then relinquishes his authority. <br /> <br /> It is more selfish to have a constant excitement of his life, leaving his relationship dangerous. <br /> OK, it was too long. But it works well as a plot. <br /> <br /> Because the step-by-step fashion, which combines the problems of being God, is better than bringing together problems and is able to conceal itself fairly. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, in the first part of the film, Carrey's pitch-motion character (which is, fortunately enough), controls and controls the scene and gives the atmosphere a scene. Whether they admit or not, the role is just written or rewritten by Carrey. Together with humor, humor is a half performance. And humor is first of all very good. <br/> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <BR> <strong> At least you do not think when you see her. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red;"> nice feeling, better than expected and better than expected and it should not be said that he or she has just caught up with Carrey's career (not going anywhere).
