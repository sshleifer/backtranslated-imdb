From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. It was one of the best faces. Why did they get rid of it? The show is not the same as before. His way is bad. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen. You can not change anyone else! Without South Park without Kyle or Child's Chucky! This is not true! The only one who replaces him, uh! Terrible. It does not match the story line. He was one of the main characters, and his brother could not replace him. He was a beautiful actress. A better way than your nest. Take it back, or you will not miss a single tone of the audience.
