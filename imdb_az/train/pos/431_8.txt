Two housewives decided to hire a castle in Italy for the month of April, slowly starting, but refusing it. Nothing happens, but the time is exhausted and there are a lot of jokes (my favorite storm is a picnic, I find cheerful). <br /> <br /> The film is literally romantic in many aspects, the scenery is beautiful (like Polly Walker), and the resolutions in the film are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film is the largest book with a few freelance Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester work, but the version of the movie (which may be more emotional, but I felt more compatible with the voice of this story) > <br /> A perfect movie, especially as a history movie in bad weather conditions.
