Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original scenarios written by Hitchcock itself, this film shows an incredible story structure. Carnival Champion "One Round" Jack begins with a rousing boxing game losing an opponent from the professional prizefighter. The film then slowed down to develop characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, the girl and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic structure between two people, this time for rematching heavily crowned. Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for a meaningful cinematography and climbing. An armband for the boxer's girl, continues throughout the film as a symbol of loyalty. The only big detector for this film is that in 1927, a boxing game was not yet perfected. The final result, eventually, is somewhat anticlimactic. Still, this is the film.
