Life Pod is just one of the movies you're watching and trying to make it harder to analyze. Acting, in the best way, is amateur. Special effects are an open budget, but not too bad. The storyline is fund enough, but with an interesting twist. The computer is amok, but a computer and a working amok are very clear when the truth arises. There are still moments of the movie and it's pretty cool. For me, at least part of this movie is a prominent role of Kristine DeBell. He may not be the world's biggest actress, but has been a former player of the month, he is pretty sweet. All Life Pods are similar to Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and can be predicted somewhat. <br /> <br /> White Star Lines bit is completely inaccurate. The last part of White Star Lines was purchased by Cunard Lines in 1947 and the last boat to sail under White Star colors was Britannic (not Titanic sister), sold to scrap in 1960.
