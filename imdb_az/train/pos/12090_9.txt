When I was 10 or 11 years old, on Saturday night we lived alone in my parent's basement. It was shown at Chiller Theater, and I did not listen as a young person. Now, thanks to the Chiller Theater, I've seen many old horror movies, but none of them are with me, "Danse Macabre", a.ka. He could not remain as the 'Tower of the Snow'. I am 51 years old, and only last year I'm lucky enough to find a relatively new, high-quality DVD edition of the supernatural classic, which has caused such a great noise. <br /> <br /> Despite the events in the Caucasus, Haunted catacombs and cis-enshrouded cemeteries, black and white back, do not work as color, even in the day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, gladly shadows, cobweb-wrap'ed haunted castle kits, restless souls die again ... and a dreadful irony ends <br /> /> IMO is with Robert Wise's "The Haunting", "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr) and more recently "The Others".
