I have not Learned Higher, one of the three best films I've ever seen. There is a bright cast and an even shining director. Singleton shows how life will be at the University. There are 3 main story lines, skinheads, African-Americans, and homosexuals. She was interested in all the stories, but the one who came to me was the story of Kristen's other feelings against another girl. The end was great. Once I see the movie 25 times, I still cry. I would give this movie 11, but I have to bring it to 10/10.
