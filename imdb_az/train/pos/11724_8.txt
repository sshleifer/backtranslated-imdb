Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is home to a cheap horror show. After realizing that dead lady was leaving something, she went to England to find out that she could have some money. But in her fear, Elvira detects that she has all her house, dog, and cookbook. Elvira decides to stay home, but she will not live in peace with dark darkness and surprising features. All neighbors are now turning against the whole city, and with Elvira's ugly attitudes and looks, everyone is expecting better because Elvira is in fire! I really enjoyed this movie, watching Elvira entering all the adventures is really fun, he is very good. The whole movie makes you an attractive mood, and I'm sure it's foolish and jokes are cheap, but it's nice to watch it. I would give Elvira, Dark The Mystress of 8/10
