I saw it yesterday. I was totally blown up because of how good this movie was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> I'm not going to worry about attracting this movie because I think it makes it even better. But we can say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and realistic. She was funny and funny, most of her comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as fun as Borat or Billy Madison, but it's a good tempo about it. For me, almost 90% of the audience laughed at the film. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> network friendly they just did not see it and directed their relationships to themselves.
