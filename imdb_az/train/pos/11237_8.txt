Star Trek: The Hidden Frontier, a long-running internet fan fan, is for the entire series of love and should look at the fans of Trek. The quality of production is quite high for a fan movie, and sometimes we can say it has turned it into a green screen. However, it does not go away from common practice. CGI ships are fantastic as well as scenic space scenes ... On the downside, we can say that some actors / actresses in their previous episodes (and even sometimes new ones) are not quite comfortable in themselves. but once again it does not go beyond the general experience of Star Trek's new interpretations. The cast and the crew really have something to do with it, and in general, I would recommend this series to the fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
