I really did not laugh this for a long time. The Hollywood latter left me a wall! This was unambiguously fresh and intelligent. When you look at demographic figures by ratings, only a few women voted! I do not want to destroy the film for you, but I am sure that everybody who saw it ran to their computers to evaluate it and considered it bad, why? Because the film puts its place on men, so. If more women vote for this movie, it's not worth the cost of humor, it can not hurt men ... it could easily have been a "7" movie!
