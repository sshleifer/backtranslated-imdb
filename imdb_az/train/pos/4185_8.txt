This film has everything to stop watching - neat editing, less durable, crazy dialogue, bad (even non-existent), meaningless story lines, long-haul shots in FAR ... and for riffing in the MST3K-style it's not about talking about "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": just scribble the pictures ... click - sign your name ... click here - edit bad Foley ... take some, <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < strong> I talk about the events in the Caucasus. at least 20-30 minutes longer!
