Amazing! Wow. Uhm ... good ... wow! I think I'll start with a plot. A traitor (Lucy) family came to the house of the Bishop or the Cardinal or the Catholic Church to wait for someone to marry (for a will). They will be France's Mathurin. Waiting, young Lucy gets information about a legend that has led to the centuries. She fantasies with Beast and her aggression with the old lady on the night bed. It's interesting here. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great movie, look elsewhere, this movie is a very important movie for you (this is a sympathy topic). if you have a stomach, do not be afraid.) At the beginning of an action at the horse, 'actions' are quite cartoon, IMO)
