Pandro S. Berman was "Production Cost", but he was called "Line Producer". But this is not the Arizona movie given to the epic, but the remains of the "golden temple" in the Mohave Desert in California, the Thuggee Booths, British troops in Muri, Tantrapur villages, and so on. small technical deficiencies and should be forgiven. Despite the fact that the academy did not offer it at that time, there is no Oscars for the good music that is cruel. One theme was played at different tempo, including waltz, walk and sweet, mood. Brilliant! One of the interesting aspects of the production was the widow Kipling's demands. A player playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In his first release, his scenes were cut off according to Mrs. Kipling's requirements. Later, they put "contact" with the Ben Hecht script of Kipling's immortal poem. Interestingly, this very typical and English-language story was a great scriptwriter who hated himself English.
