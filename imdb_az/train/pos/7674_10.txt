Last week, Edinburgh had preferred to watch the Hollywood movie festival "Holly". What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl living in prostitution by her own family and living in a prostitute in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) comes to Holly's life and decides to help him. When Holly is re-sold, Patrick is hopelessly looking for him. <br /> <br /> Xolli is one of the millions of children sold and sold everyday. The film does not pass this line, it is a difficult matter. Wanting more information about child trafficking and asking how I can help? This movie can be seen by everyone, because it is a beautiful story and we have an issue that we must not trust.
