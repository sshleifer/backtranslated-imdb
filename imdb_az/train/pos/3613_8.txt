When Girlfight came out, the reviews praised him, but I did not see it. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Soon I met the student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). There is a bad expression on his face, and any ideas we can draw from this idea with Diana are soon confirmed when fighting. When Diana is concerned about her, we face her father, an aggressive type; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> <strong> His brother has already entered the shit, but his father will probably not approve it. Only Diana can decide what to do with her. <br /> <br /> Only in the first few minutes he described me as the most perfect, non-Hollywood movie, but confirmed a supporting role in John Sayles's short appearance. Before you go to any boxing scene, you notice that you have been beaten up on your face when it comes to the ugly life of Diana. When it comes to the main story of the movie, there is no return. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is definitely coming. We have to use boxing as a tool to show that it is trying to do something for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but still I have a great deal of work here. In fact, this could have brought the genre upward. Very Good. Monsieur Rodriguez made it worse in Hollywood films after this film.
