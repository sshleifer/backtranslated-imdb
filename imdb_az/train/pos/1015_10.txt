Waiting for each new episode, reboot with the expectation of each one! A new look at the Stargate SG-1 intelligence is hopeful that it will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that is interesting to me. Season 9 should be in an excitement. I would like Richard Dean Anderson more frequent in the new season, because I love his dry mind as well as his character as Jack O'Neill. Other symbols include the season's winner, the uniqueness of the show, which forms the blue season. This program is canceled for the next three years and you are making a serious mistake. Also, you have a bigger role for Asgard - they are so cool.
