It's always a nice surprise when a movie made for television is just as entertaining as Little Richard. This is a very watched movie about the Rock and Roller story, played by Little Richard, an actor named Leon, but has never seen it before, but it does a very good job. Like most television movies, it's a sad tamer for a minor murder because it's a little shame, but I'm sure we've seen something controversial about Richard. Instead, it is the only thing that spoils the film and ultimately breaks a promising career. All of them are good in the movie and the actress is on average more than a television movie. 10 to 7-i.
