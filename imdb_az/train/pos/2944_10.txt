These hands show up to the greatest leg. I saw many showtimes, lots of shows, and I watched Bet's Comic View, but I did not see anyone who could fit into Murphy's skills at this show. Presentations are perfect, skates are great, time is perfect. You can even say that the meeting really is in the congregation. He has made Raw really good after a few years, but this is # 1 in my book. It also shows that at one time, especially from eighty to eight, Murphy was funny. My favorite parts of the show are retelling that family barbecue and "Ice cream !!! Mooommmm! Ice cream comes from the man !!!!" Another big part of her mother is Clint Eastwood.
