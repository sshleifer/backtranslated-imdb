I liked Sky Sky. The most loved thing should be music. It worked in two ways: at the first hour of the film, the audience is given a time frame. It consists of songs from the late generations. An instrumental score takes place in the second hour. Music now perfectly adapts to the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> I only used music and I liked it very much. Jake Gyllenhaal like Homer Hickam was a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Like Kris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam), she gave her first class performance. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen this movie about escaping twice for a couple of times now, and twice I've been very pleased with myself.
