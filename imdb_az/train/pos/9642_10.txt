The film is very realistic. Of course, it does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema where every line is perfectly announced and where every action is clear. Actors playing the role of Valentine are doing a great job representing the emotions and thoughts of characters - their everyday life shows. In general, the audience is in a state of collapse. The whole story is where realism is understood. Everything we think does not happen. Even though the movie is not a bad note, I can say. We watch, learn and live ourselves. Perhaps this is the moral aspect of the story.
