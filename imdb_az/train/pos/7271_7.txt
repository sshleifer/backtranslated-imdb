Writer / Director John Hughes covered all the basics (as usual) with this bitterly "Sunday Evening" family movie. "Curly Sue" is a sweet, orphaned orphan born by Bill. <br /> <br /> While traveling to the United States's largest US embassy, ​​couples face the "very nice" yuppie lawyer, while the rest are predicted. <br /> <br /> Children love this film because of the heroine of the 9-year-old Alison Potter (an album called "Going into the Girlage" for Pepsi's ads). It is assumed that the character is about 6 or 7, as it calls for thinking about going to school. <br /> <strong> Like Home Alone, many sticks and small fists have a big fat jaw. Again, this is a "formula" for a young audience. Fun and cheerful. Do not expect any surprises, but do not be prepared for a predator or two.
