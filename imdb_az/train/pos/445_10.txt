I first saw Enchanted in April five years ago. I really liked that my husband surprised me with the next Christmas. Because of the two women who decided to hire a castle in Italy for the month of April, stay behind them. There are very sad women at the start of the film, and you can not help them if they plan to set up this plan together with the other two women they have been invited to share. This is perhaps the best I've ever seen. It's clean and straightforward, without any car, no boredom or death. Careful and well prepared taste. Except for the happy tears, you can not help smiling with all this!
