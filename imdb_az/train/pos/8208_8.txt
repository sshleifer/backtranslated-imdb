I liked all the movies in the Dirty Harry series, except for a thought I called "Enforcer". Deadpool was a bit weak in the regions, but it was still. This is one of my favorite if this is nothing else for a great line, "Future, my day". It is also interesting, though, to get acquainted with someone who killed the wrongdoers. Imagine "Magnum Force" with little secret about who is behind the murder and you have your plot. It's a bit more, because it's a great show in an entertainment park. It's also a Dirty Harry getting a bulldog as a gift and opening up a pretty humorous scene up to Sandra Locke. What is the reason why Client Iustov has a pretty mediocre actress on Sandra Locke in most of the movies? The movie likes me for everyone, even every single time. That is why it was not bad, its character could have been better by someone else. While it is a problem with the film and other Dirty Harry movies, it sometimes seems like an ad for the gun. I like guns as the next person, but do we really need scenes that tell us about the different forces of his new weapon and how many bullets he holds? Still, a great introduction to Dirty Harry's movie.
