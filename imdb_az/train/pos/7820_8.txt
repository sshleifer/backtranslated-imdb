"The True Story of Friendship in South Africa and a Wondering World". <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough, who runs a "far-off bridge" and "Gandhi," wanted to bring Steve Bio's life to life and told his story of traveling and worrying journalist Donald Woods. The films use Wood's two books for information and basics "Biko" and "Trouble Inquisition". <br /> <br /> The film takes place in South Africa in the late 1970s. South Africa is opposed to the terrible apartheid, which separates the snow from the white, and classifies them as superior races. Black towns are forced to live in blackmailing towns and cities and are exposed to frequent harassment by police and army. Bulldozers and armed police raided the camp and even showed a dawn raid by blackmailing them because they were forced to flee after killing the residents. Then we get acquainted with the editor of the popular newspaper Donald Vuds (Kevin Klin). After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Bik (Denzel Washington), Woods is going to meet her. Both of them are cautious before each other, but soon become a good friend, and Biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system for Woods in terms of black people. It encourages Woods to speak out against what is happening, and Steve Bikon's story is hopeless about the white man's South Africa and the world. Soon Steve Bico was arrested and killed in prison. Now Woods and his family are courageous to flee from South Africa to England. Woods, Steve Biko, and his book about apartheid. <br /> <br /> For the first time, when I hear Cry Freedom, she explains that she is a film dedicated to Steve Bikon's life. The events I have seen in this movie have not really been heard by Steve Biko before watching this movie, as it really was before my time. There is more information about traveling along the border with Donald Woods and Lesotho while trying to abandon the South African authorities. After being assassinated by Steve Bico, Woods was sentenced to five years in house arrest. Steve Bikoya had to flee to publish his manuscript. Handwriting would be considered a betrayal in South Africa and could have been similar to Woods Bico's fate. The original Donald Woods and his wife have acted as consultants for this film. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is only in the first hours of the film and I'm sad that I expected her to be in love. movie But Steve was as beautiful as Biko, and he captured my personality really well and his accents were perfectly sounded. His performance earned the Oscars nomination for the actor who best supported him. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline delivers a perfect and thoughtful performance like Donald Woods and Penelope Wilton is excellent as his wife Wendy. <br /> <br /> Zimbabwe's filmmaking appeared in South Africa when it tried to shoot. South Africa watched the South African gestapo shootings everywhere, so they took bad habits and went to neighboring Zimbabwe instead. In spite of everything and the fact that apartheid did not end in seven years, the fact of "Cry Freedom" in South Africa was not banned. But the movie-makers were bomb threats. <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough brings apartheid's horrors to the screen with excessive strength and determination. When a student shows a peaceful protest in Shanghai, it is becoming a massacre when the film does not go back and shoot at police. The film ends with the names and deaths of all the apartheid carriers who died in prison. Many have "no explanation". Many were "epilepsy", which is hard to believe and most of them either fell off the stairs or were "suicidal from addiction". No one knows what is happening to them, but it is fair to say that none of these people are in their hands but in the hands of others; or rather, in the hands of the police. <br /> <br /> Freedom of Liberation is a feature film for Steve Bikon's description and story. It is a beautiful land split and describes a devastating and destructive description of racial discrimination and violence of hell.
