So far, one of my favorite films has started as an adventure in Atlanta with the united side of a group of four. The idea of ​​living before the Chulawasse River is turned into a lake comes from Burt Reynold's Lewis, who unconsciously raises his enemies to the worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film looks like a motion picture, the second half is a completely different story, because our men (they know) will change their lives forever. Very bad ways. At the end of the film, everyone has been able to endure only weekends in the river, but will have to deal with scars that have been called for survival. The nature of the film (with some exceptionally clear goofs) is very well directed and beautiful breath-taking nature is paradise. Photography is also good. Voight, Reynolds, Cox, and Beatty show how the only event can destroy four different lives, in the same way, in different ways.
