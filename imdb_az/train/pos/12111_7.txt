When I started watching anime for the first time, I never thought that something about bread would be really exciting, but I'm happy that I did. <br /> <br /> The great advantage of this anime is that it is very smart and very funny, humorous, with some, into a world that produces bread. recurring gags. But animation, noise, and character development are at a moderate level, although these shortcomings do not seem very clear in the first episodes because the big work on this anime is actually showing in the last 20 episodes. <br /> <br /> As for me, if this animation ends with 52 episodes, I would give it 9, but the end <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
