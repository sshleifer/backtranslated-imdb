Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump, Private Ryan and Green Mile. For her part, her role has been good guys we are glad. <br /> <br /> Sam Mendez's "The Destroyed Road" is a story of a man and a son based on a graphic novel by Max Allan Collins. At the time of Great Depression in Chicago. What's different from this little trip is that Sullivan's staunch man is hunted by his former partner. Her boss, or former director, John Newton (Paul Newman) loves her more than her own son, Sullivan's partner, Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After a job has been misinterpreted by Connor, Sullivan, who has witnessed his mistake, has a son who wants to be there. Connor is trying to take Sullivan and his family, but his wife and his other son are Peter. Sullivan kicks his knee and jumps home to find Michael Jr sitting at the table. Sallivan, who is dead with his wife and children, set out to find the answer. <br /> <br /> Michael is trying to give something to Sullivan's wife and child, and Michael, who feels his story, is guilty of all that. He feels his interest in killing his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a great job like Michael Jr. It brings adolescence and still a sense of youth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mendes' This film did not sound just about the Oscars winning the best cinematography award, but the music, sound, and the fifth nomination of the best actor in supporting role for Paul Newman. This picture is a great story, which set out through Midwest and brought to the legend of Mike Sullivan: husband, man wearing a headscarf and his father. This movie is a bed film that will be tracked for years to come.
