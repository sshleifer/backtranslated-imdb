Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey need to check the heads of everyone who does not think it's one of the greatest films of all time. At the same time, he can also be absolutely convinced and inadequate, at the same time he is terrifying knowledge and clever. The Bogus Journey can be reused and reused when one of these rare films really gets better than its predecessor. Outstanding moments include duel with Death, and ending with "extremely emotional". Keanu wants Matrix to forget the trash and perform its best. Ted Teodor Logan, Bill and Ted: The Return.
