I have featured a screenplay, direction and a 7/10 movie with 6/10 films for production values ​​and acting for 1944. The player's rating was calculated by the hero, Ella Raines, by Carol Richman, who is perfectly featured at 8/10, for all screen characters, except for those that were played in turn. Thomas Gomez's identity is just a loyalty to Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) <br /> <br /> The original soundtrack on DVDs like La Dama Desconocida on Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro in Saudi Arabia and "Ingles". Although I was searching, I could not find a completely English version. Although I did not see another performance of Ella Reynes, only one woman acted as a heroine in the "Impact", a garage. we believe in the role of another hero, rejecting some of his suggestion that he return to his home in Kansas (pet's pet's name) before the innocence of the engineer's manager and his disappearances. It is a little difficult to know that he is secretly in love with his boss. <br /> <br /> Children thought that the "family man" was burned at the beginning of the 1940s at the beginning of Carol, and had prepared children's playgrounds and playgrounds. Manufacturers of "movie code" can only show sex through metaphors, and Elisha Cooke jnr.Carol is made up of angry drumming, played by babies. Providing information about the "The Phantom Lady" alibi. Another main character, Jack Marlow (Scott Henderson's assistant) performance, I found the theater very much and wondered, for example, that Carol was amazed at her standing and stranging hand. Here, the scene should be improved, and the theater performances were very far from the audience.
