As a true product of hip-hop and electronic dance music, this is one of the most favorite films of all time. Beat Street is a film that can be used to capture the hearts of everyone who is proud of urban sampling / DJ-based music and electro-club culture, although in some cases it is not "original". <br /> <br /> In some cases, though we acknowledge that the dialogue is slightly cheaper, you will not be able to help symbolize the hip hop culture in New York, and as a result, you were there at the top of the eighties. The b-rich battle scene at the Roxy Night Club (real-real competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is as important as the archive of a hip-hop fan like any classic album. See the movements of some fighter movements, whenever possible, to really appreciate the recommended B-boy / B-girl's athletic and stylistic experience. All the praises for Zulu people!
