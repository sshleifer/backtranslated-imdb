"Maléfique" is an example of a horrific plot and a pattern that can be very heartwarming. Its cast names are not recognized and do not have a large budget and, of course, do not have visual effects; but with a clever and well written scripts, an effective player and director's vision is to talk more about stories than the cheapest excitement. Eric Valette can not yet be a well-known name, but with Maléfique, his length debut proves that he is at the level of contemporaries such as Jeunet, Gans or Aja. <br /> <br /> The story of four prisoners in a single cell, four different men of different backgrounds, but with one purpose. Carrère (Gérald Laroche) was arrested and charged with many millionaires fraud; his colleagues, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), intellectual Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), and Pieterette (Dimitri Rataud), who were sentenced to death, and Carrère was given a cold welcome. Carrère will surprise his personality when he finds an ancient book explaining how an old prisoner escapes black magic. <br /> <br /> "Maléfique," written by Alexander Sharlo and Franck Magnier, is a very reminiscent of the stories of dark fantasy and fear of Clive Barker. The strongest point in the film, as they have set up their characters, is that they have very complex and distinctive personalities, and many tensions and stresses come from men's ongoing confrontations. The supernatural feature of the story is very well developed, and in general the film gives a feeling of reading a Gothic novel. Although a movie about four people locked in a room, the film will never be delicate or tiresome and in fact the isolation of the group increases confidence, claustrophobia and, in particular, paranoia. <br /> <br /> Eric Valette uses a great deal of atmosphere, mood, and structure to give life to the field. Despite the inexperienced budget deficit, he has created a brilliant film that feels original, fresh and very attractive. Its exquisite and effective camera work, despite the unified position, ensures the film's dynamism and the rapid release of the film is ideal for creating a heavy atmosphere of isolation and stopping the plot. <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-family:" <span style Gerald Laroche Carrère is an innocent person but hides a dark past, and Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud play a very important role, especially Rataud, but Clovis Cornillac, who stole the performance as a Marcus, <br /> <br /> This film is a terrible person, but it is not a mistake, of course, the most unhappy ones are its low budget. Some of the CGI effects are used in other scenes it's a bit weak compared to the effective makeup and prosthesis, but it's not bad for that, probably a bad thing about Maléfique, if it seems to lose some steam while focusing on supernatural black cities rather than symbols not so bad, the latter may seem weaker at this point. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Maléfique deserves to be one of the greatest scary movies from France and much more. Valette is an absolute talent to prove that the ability of this modest (talented) tales of nature is sufficient. Personally, this movie is a new favorite. 8/10
