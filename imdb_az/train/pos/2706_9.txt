I saw this movie at the Brussels International Film Festival. I met the director of the film. I heard Ed Wood writing the story in 10 years! <br /> <br /> If you take the movie seriously (like MR Wood), this is one of the worst films you really can see. . And that's cool. <br /> <br /> I make this movie very good. The scenario is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely excellent. As you can see, this is a high art ... or low garbage. <br /> <br /> *****
