As the director of Mitchell Leisen's fifth character and his previous films are heavy drums, he manages his music and shows its versatility. <br /> <br /> You can say that this is a pre-codex movie, and after a while (like 30+ years) there was nothing like this in the United States. Leisen hit musical numbers, so it seemed to the audience what to do - no big screen shots or the above Busby Berkeley. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it is a very interesting and interesting thing for me to never see the audience. <br /> <br /> As we have noted, the potential is of sufficient character, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play normal movies. Gertrude Michael provides a little spark. The musical numbers are interesting and good (especially Rapsoda's Rape is entertaining), but the drama is unconvincing and lying - more than three kills and minimal emotional impacts on characters. This is the place where film will be much better.
