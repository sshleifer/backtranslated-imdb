this movie is not quite fun. Basically, the plot is transformed into a snowman through a series of B-movie chemical accidents around a number of killer. then he leads the city and begins to insult the local population. try and stop it up to the local police chief and some other characters. it is built on a budget budget and of course, but one big thing about this movie is that it is trash. Styrofoam and polystyrene improvisations that are imitating the giant killer snowman are classic, and this is one of the few films that have budget as a major selling point. besides funny bumps, there are other great comedy moments - the most exciting rape scenes from the beginning to the right and the movie loyal to the voice of a father who insults his children. fantastic tacky fun
