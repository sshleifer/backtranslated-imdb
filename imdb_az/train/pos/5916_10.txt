One night I watched the movie Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin) at www.afrovideo.org and I did not see anything racist (I'm not stupid), have adopted character designs a bit of plant origin and unaccessible today, but I think That's a satire and old brother Remus stories, very low, the main characters and "The Tar Baby" and "Briar Patch." These are the cultural icons created by the hero Americans and they read and love these stories that are my white women. <br /> <br /> This movie was an interesting time capsule in black culture in the Harlem city of the 70s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> wind. When Randy waited for them, Randy began to listen to the story of a new Brother Rabbit, who soon emerged from the confusion of his Lord, and Pappy (Scatman Crothers) began listening to himself; You know, Rabbit, Bear and Fox are the animal versions of Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. Stylized animation and lack of live action, the film is a graphic and condemnation of stereotypes spreading in the 1970s? racist, ethnic or otherwise. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a good Bakshi movie; And under the carpet you have to sweep films like this? Are They Never Sayed? hmmm ... I think it would be a shame; I think we have not been surprised by these films, and we need to learn what to do next.
