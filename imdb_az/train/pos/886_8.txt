Recently, I'm one of the DVDs. I recently purchased six sets of "French Movies" to refresh our French fans before this year's planned holiday in Provence. <br /> <br /> Along with developing French language as we evaluate French cinema, we also have greatly increased our gratitude to French cinema. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's old, anticipated, treacherous,. It is a good example for screenwriters' writers, actors, directors and cinematographers. These brilliant magazines have also stimulated to see two identifying characters in leading roles without having coverage figures. <br /> <br /> Another thing that liked me about this movie was slow character and structure. In spite of everything in an unhappy sibling, is there any good thing, despite the fact that a person who is loyal to his loyalty respects the old conventional convention? Can a poorly-lit little hero who is sexually disturbed prove his desires and destiny to him? <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie, regardless of whether you are like me, the viewer is interested in these questions and the actors are slowly and convincingly responsive. to see again. I still did not think the director was a psychologist in the role of an oral officer, and that some delicate nuances of camera work seemed worthy of a second look. When our hero is given a chance to help the outdated and highly-functioning heroine in the office, the area requires a bit of imagination. It should be broad-minded to believe in reading a lip and doing some exercises. But with this example of the French cinema, you will be very happy if you are the best for a exciting ride. Five to four stars for me.
