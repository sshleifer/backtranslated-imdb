I liked this show very much, and I was so sadly saddened that it was canceled, but it was only two stupid weeks. This is horror. I have never learned how to end it. it sucks. Get her back! There are stupid shows like ABC Supernanny and Unnot, but do not give those who are good at the Six Degrees. If they were complaining about the ratings, it was probably a good show because of me and it was awaited because they were a bad slot. JJ Abrams surrendered, she is surprising, ABC can rely on her enough to complete her story. I liked all the boats. I will not wait to see how anyone will answer each other at once. Everyone's story is now incomplete, and now I'm not sure if Steven and Whitney are together or together with Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what to do with Laura or Damien and everyone. This is actually such a reduction.
