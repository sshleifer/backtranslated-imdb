One of the most important examples of an exciting, dramatic episode (in this case, the Terrorist Balance) called Shore Leave, which is a more ugly case, is a more exciting piece of science intelligence than the name of Star Trek writers and the formula is still in this introduction (True Triumph Tribbles With Troubles, Season 2), while the audience is laughing pretty fast when it is ready to allow the whole silliness. <br /> <br /> Enterprise, which transmits from the show's tradition, does not refer to any missions in this episode. Instead, Kirk found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time: a good break after three months of work. A planet-like place (a budget-related fact) is very attractive, but just a few minutes ago, Dr. McCoy begins to take a look at a white rabbit that looks straight from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon other people start to experience similar things: a woman faces a character like Don Juan, works with a watery samurai, and Kirk is facing a double past, almost in love, and going to the Academy. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see how easy it is to see how Kirk and Spoken are trying to figure out what's happening before anyone hurt. <br /> <br /> Thought is classic: the idyllic place comes out of the sky. The humorous theme of the theme was quite successful, though the darkness of the events that did not fit well with the rest (of course, everything is still working well) ended and they were reluctant to express themselves in a funnier side (the most embarrassing and ironic, hilarious William Shatner) . <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also, Shore Leave is a good example of the new and old invisible writers about: Star Trek's success description. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
