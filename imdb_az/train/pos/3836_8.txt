Very interesting and entertaining movie. David Linch (even in the film with the red curtains) and Franz Kafka's novels (in this film, like Mrs. Grubach, also known as Der Prozess in the house goalkeeper), are clear, but in this case, the clear understanding of the colonial past of Belgium references are accompanied by. I can not clearly describe the exact content of the film: this is a crucial part of the colonialism's failure to cope with this past, but personal memories of the main character are also the main issue and its social connection and love. <br /> <br /> In some cases, these are some of the symbolic themes that talk about these films, but in fact there are not many impressions. <br /> <br /> But if you try to follow a line of stories that do not have these symbolic backgrounds, a very interesting movie full of spectacular scenes (beautiful dreams of Beatles, larvae and other bad insects are replaced by great sleep sequences and the dark atmosphere gives the extra style of the film) . Maybe I can say "I did not get the movie", but I was deeply saddened by the quality and excitement of the mystery I had seen for 1.5 hours as hypnotized.
