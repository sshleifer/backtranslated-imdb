I am a great John Denver fan. There is a huge collection of music on vinyl. For the first time on TV I saw this Christmas special and I liked it. There is an original vinyl album and CD. Have the original CD and then release it. Even though there are several songs that have been postponed. I see that this year was released with all the original songs. I was surprised to find the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - think of a Christmas cd that will be worth it. It does not cost me to sell this treasure. This is my favorite CDs. I have never been able to find VHS or DVD. I would like to have the version. Let me know if anyone has it. Thank you
