The film, the religion, the effect, or the music that I'm currently not aware of, was taken away from the public library. (!) Most of the comments here are targeted, moving, funny, sad and yes, despite the best intentions of the film, a bit of exploiter. Extended Chriterion editions are a prerequisite for everyone who loves it when it comes out. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, if there is a class missing in Edie and you see such a loss, you can also announce it in Jackie O's old films; People do not speak like this anymore. Documentary, I think it would be interesting to learn more about the fault of the house, Old Edie knows at least what is happening to a certain degree; Do not you see once the magnificent house breaks down? <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is the life of two women now set up for themselves, a real-life act by Tennessee Williams. It's worth your time.
