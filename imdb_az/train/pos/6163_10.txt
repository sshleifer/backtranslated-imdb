This is one of the few films that the film's presentation is about the development of the original book. The story is clear, accessible, entertaining and interesting, and the musical numbers are absolutely unmatched. Despite the cyclic presentation of the "Old Home Watchman" and the charming 'Portobello Road', a great combination of early animation and original player techniques, they were not afraid of the charm of the piece despite history. <br /> <br /> The WWII background worked well and did not happen as happened in the evacu stories of the film. <br /> <br /> Very often a very underrated film, used for people of all ages. Actors' performances are extremely good and all the text looks the same and well-prepared. Guarantee to put a smile on your face!
