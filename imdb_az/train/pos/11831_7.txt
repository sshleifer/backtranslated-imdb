Despite the magnificent and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of the worst Disney films I've ever seen, and I do not often hit Disney movies. The spirit is also a wild shame that has been repeatedly caught by cavalry or Hindus, both trying to "break" it. The soul ends with a Hindu with a constellation and is a short story. This movie, which is me or my five year old, except for beautiful horses, was not inspired or excited. This movie is called "Spirit" because it is a spirit that can be used by the film for a little while. An additional point was given to the song sung by songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. Although this film is examined by G, you still have to understand what it means to break a five year old horse. <br /> <br />
