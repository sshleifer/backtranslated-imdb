When I discover the perfect (semi) unknown movie, there is always a certain charm that I find. These discoveries have always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown fantasy, motion and horror, for many very good reasons. I found the video "High Tide" in a compact store with a mix of different quality low-quality tapes. Of course, as it is not on DVDs, I'm the only place I can find. <br /> <br /> While watching Judy Davis (like Lillie) throughout this film, he watched great publicity performance. Yes, I saw Davis in several smaller parts and played a role in "going to India." But, despite the superiority of the film, "High Tide" is a totally different animal. Since I watched the next movie, Gillian Armstrong's "Charlotte Gray," I knew it was an actress shocking her. Davis talks more about Cate Blanchett than in the past - in both ways and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Judy Davis's performance is surprising, I can not say enough good things about it. The other great actress of the film, Claudia Caravan (like Ally), shares a touch on a beautiful screen. Together, there are plenty of drama and quiet humanity, and I will not intend to explain their details here (see for yourself!). At a glance, "High Tide" has something very good. Indeed, it would be very difficult - the film speaks well enough for itself. As a result, the screenwriter Laura Jones's praise for her actor's interpretation, director Gillian Armstrong's definition of the actors and the great Russell Boyd (see Tender Mercies) for his most brilliant, simple cinematography.
