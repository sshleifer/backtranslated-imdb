I liked this movie very much. The animation was good and romantic. I liked most of Bryan Adams's songs, and Hans Zimmer's score was very good. Many people realize that their failure to comprehend is related to the Dark Heart / Apocalypse. Now the themes (what happens when the "culture" raises one's home, what it means to be a "cultural"). The opening scene and the music were very mixed. The film was once beautiful, a cry for America.
