He imitates the best Hollywood Daytiem Soap Operation! It's the entertainment that we see. Great characters and large lines. Whoopi hilarious ..... Sally Field is such a top .... Gary Marshalls is a disorder of the lines .... what this love is good comedy. Do not hesitate to entertain yourself !!!!!! The beacons were great .... the wardrobe was at the point and the backyard "Montana Morehead" was a delicacy taste. Terry Hatcher did not have enough lines like "Dr. Monica Demonico," but it was pretty funny and entertaining on the screen. I would like to know how this film came from. I did not see the role of many people in the comedy! Soap must be a must and I'm waiting for the DVD !!!
