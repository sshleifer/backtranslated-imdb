When I read Diamond's book, I was a little disappointed in my series, but it was completely informative. <br /> <br /> To read other comments, it is easy to know that "cultural warriors" are hard to deal with "Western civilization" under every kilo. <br /> <br /> Is the Diamond a little promoter? Of course. Like many scholars, he sees his theory as the most important thing. It uses the term "guns, microbes and steel" every time it appears in the array. <br /> <br /> Diamond is a little simpler (in the series)? Of course. Part of the Spaniards in South America is particularly entertaining, intensifying a very long, complicated history, up to about 15 minutes, ending the whole conquest of South America, such as 'flowers, swords and horses'. <br /> <br /> It is, of course, the reasons for the success of Spaniards against the established cultures (but not entirely defined). <br /> Does it propagate any way against Western civilization? Nope. Not a word. Not to the ears. <br /> <br /> Successes play a major role in determining which cultures are moving faster. <br /> <br /> As a result, if you are looking for something that proves you to be a self-concept, this is not the case for you. But if you are more interested in the effects of societies on success or failure in all factors, this series presents a useful explanation of historical evidence.
