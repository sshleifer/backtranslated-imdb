Although the "Eighth Day" plot elements seem to have been seen many times, the film still has a lot of sparks, mysteries and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal was the first film. Even though my favorite is always as good as the "Toto Hero" that will remain on my list, the movie still leaves us with many emotions. Since Daniel Auteil did not like it since 2001, "The Closet" reduces its role and has long been afraid (rightly, the actor's role has been dramatically exposed). <br /> <br /> This film was not just a character's growth, but I felt a little more realistic in order to draw more attention to the character. <br /> <br /> Do not go to this movie waiting for dark humor and unexpected folds You've gotten from Toto Hero because you'll be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a worthy or defective film
