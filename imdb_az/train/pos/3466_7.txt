It was a real guilty pleasure ... I saw the trailer and all the ads, so 'Why did not this vh1 check the movie?' and they say, "I do not believe I'm watching all the stuff!" Quinn and Harris, a believer boy, and I find that the dialogue is convincing, though emphasis is often overwhelming and sometimes difficult to decipher. The film touched on the cautious relationships of len / mc and were deeply down, two children shared each other and shared a passion for music. you wished you had to drive yourself in a cab for a fortunate combination that could shake the world's socks, but you also appreciate why they are not.
