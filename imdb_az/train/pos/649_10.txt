We do not need to lose this movie, it's one of the biggest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is one of the most memorable of fashionable fashion (most of usual). Jean Eustache is no longer on earth, but only to remember one of the biggest and most selfless French filmmakers in these black and white images. You just have to love this witness. <br /> <br /> P.S: We apologize for the English language ...
