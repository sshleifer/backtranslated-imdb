*** APPLICATIONS *** *** APPLICATIONS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, "Divers," is really interesting. I knew about it, it would cover history of the Nazis, underwater scenes, and everyone was talking to Denmark. But for some reason I decided to check it out that the story is about the development of a second WWII German submarine. There is an abortion for the German subs, especially for possible accidents. I'm a bit skeptical about the part of Denmark, but we can take the weight of this part. <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm not sure if Scandinavian films are always good and I'm not sure of the size of the budget, at least I doubt it. <br /> <br /> I had some ideas about the inadequacy of actors, and I saw some young people, especially the two main actors. This is not an issue, but both are very good. Like other actors with 50 other people and others. It has some interesting interactions, both young and old, often seen on the screen. It is not rare but rare. And all is good. <br /> <br /> As for the Danish language, it is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < strong> I thought the budget was delicate, and I thought it would go into the most dangerous situation in the worst and worst case scenario. Again, I was surprised that the outer appearance of the boat is beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for the German subs, I knew what I should look specifically to Sub and did not let down. The team made a serious investigation. <br /> <br /> I'm suspicious of more people to see a few sub-mare scenes from this film. So I have to make a "warning". Underwater film is not an existing model during the war. A special purpose subtitle. But it's a link between this type VII, IX type, and a Japanese carrier similar to I-52 to give you a clue about what you expect. <br /> </ strong> <br /> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> It's a sea-off island or peninsula. The summer season and the two brothers travel to their fathers to celebrate each year in the summer. Their father is a kind of sailor. The cinematography is pretty beautiful, there are many beautiful summer spots on the island, a few new youth love, beautiful diving air and a "perfect" feeling. <strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ span> One of the visitors, a 50-year-old man, has a German eagle and sword An elderly citizen of the island remembers after the end of the Second World War of a German alien bumper and has been in the depths since then. <br /> <br /> In 1945, when German authorities began to return to land, After a while the father was looking for a boat, no submarines were found. <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I was not expecting some elements of supernatural elements in this movie, and it kept me, although it is not a great admirer of supernatural events, but it is well adapted to the story and it creates no problems, and everyone's vampire turns to the end "Dusk the tongue is in the morning "<br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < STRONG> Then I learned that there was a fair budget, and that some actors were practicing Danish veterans. But even if it was Hollywood, I'd give it 7 or 8. Yes, the child's story is somehow, but still a great talent. There is a great aura of tension and adventure that I found very attractive. Again, cinematography is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> Medusa 2001. <br />
