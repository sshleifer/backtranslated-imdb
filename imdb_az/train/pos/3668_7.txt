Recently, I saw this movie and loved it very much. you understand how much work you really are when you make a movie and make a little budget. People need a name player / actress for everyone to see and be filmed. Bobby played with Myeres Modine, and his partner, Saul-Paul Linder, made a perfect combination in finding the eccentric Miachel Bates, the "NAME" actor Alan Bates, who made a perfect casting decision in the film and film. My favorite actor Sandy Ryan was again starred in the movie by his spectacular and underrated performance by Debra Kara Unger. If you think about watching the comedy, this is for you. Low budget, low budget content with high content of laughter.
