In the West of Hollywood, these trail hands surged heavily to the city. One day before the railways crossed all parts of the United States, driving all the way was a single job. <br /> <br /> As Eric Fleming did, the reindeer, who worked for Gil Trees, was no different. But Fleming was one of the businessmen, and he had a job to do so and hired his top crew to do so. <br /> <br /> Rawhide is a long term and needs to know all the drovers at a point where most of the regulars stay. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood's western appearance was molded by Rawhide, but it covered a whole range of story lines. Fleming and Clint Eastwood's characterist Rowdy Yates, this is a shame that they are not often featured. Probably they were black and white. If it were a NBC show, it would be painted like Bonanza and it would not work as often as those shows. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming left the show to open the film. She made several people and hoped the show would give her a movie. Unfortunately, a movie shot dead, filmed a moving film, drowned in a tea. <br /> <br /> Clint has been the head coach of last season, and then the show has completed its work. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a difficult western, and there were a few tough guys. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it was not a fraud, they were cowboys who did just one job, and each year they fought with the elements and all kinds of situations. <br /> <br /> They really do not create more TV series. What a pity.
