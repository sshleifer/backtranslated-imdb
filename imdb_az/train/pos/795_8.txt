Several very bad comments before me do not know the truth about this situation. It is based on actual cases, from 1996 to 2000, on a high degree of public loss and criminal offense in Wilmington, DE / Philadelphia PA. I was very skeptical about how Hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events. indeed, they were very upset about how close the time was to news reports from local news agencies and Philadelphia Inquirer. Of course, I immediately said that the actress playing Fahey (I love her in Cold Death) did not look like something like that (Anne Marie was really nice). I must admit, even though Mark Harmon really did have the kind of personality that Capano and Capano had shown in this period of behavior. The details of the event ... do not even have dramatic effects on carpets, weapons, furniture and refrigerators. As a result, I wanted to add that I met with Tom Carper in various positions (although he was a good person, a politician), and I'm very glad that he drew the ropes in the federal domain to solve these grave crimes. Children like Capano were real and it was great to see them finally put behind bars.
