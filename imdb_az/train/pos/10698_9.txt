It's a little funny movie. Completely incredible, incredible, impossible. But it is funny how a fussy masochist can be absolutely dependent and surprised, and even a girl he does not know is hypnotized, but laughs at his dreams. Of course, a denunciation of the foolishness that you can get on the internet. You do not believe in a hundred percent of what you say, and you never will never accept your hands to each other or to one another or to something that you do not know personally. Most of their "business" will deceive you and afflict you. But he deserves to be the victim of such gangsters here because he's not just naive, he's crazy. But then the movie becomes funny, because the end of the entertaining work on the top ends with the victim and begins to play the same game with his victims. I'm sure of someone else. Safety at British airports is not something that should be, but I think it is not the best place anywhere in the world, and even now they are compressing all the rules and regulations, passing their procedures and making them systematically folklore. Then, lose your luggage, take revenge on modern airports, and do not expect a fair compensation. To put a bottle opener or drop-opener in order to be even more dangerous. I see myself by breaking my way through a plane passing by. Funny, is not it?
