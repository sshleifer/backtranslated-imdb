It turned out to be a classic production with what should be a small budget. The alphabets are different, from bald chicks to 7ft ghouls! It's not romantic enough to be interested in me, but rather the connection of potential. I also liked the humor mixture (which might not be very accurate, very / easily accessible), which meant too much of darkness or too much frustration. From Eaves's other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium were a great step in storyline and production. They have a great web site where they need to check. It is impossible to wait for Bane if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
