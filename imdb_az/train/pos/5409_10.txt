I love this movie! Animation (for pokemon movie) is great, cgi looks so awesome. I love music in the movie. Probably they kept Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for the story, there's a sense of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pokemon. Ash is really great in this movie and I love friendship with Sam. Something I did not like was Suicune's appearance, he suddenly opens, Ash & Co helps a bit and leaves. <br /> <br /> But, in general, a great movie! Wait for the US version of the DVD!
