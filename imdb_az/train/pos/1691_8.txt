This movie is funny and suitable for every age. This is definitely a family-friendly entertainment. Casting works in Big Bean, a popular nation in the middle western state of Illinois. Ten years of excitement (pre-occupation) Since the interstate is a new (and only) ramp, I have to assume that nothing will happen. It is quite boring and completely impossible for the spaces to be occupied by the Martians. However, these marsians are absolutely inconsistent, even though they have been trapped behind terrifying and deadly weapons, including a bunch of marsians! The martyrs have killed their lines, throwing just the right accents, they want to help our viewers and the indigenous peoples ... get out of the ground. J. J. Anderson has only great lines playing a very young Halloween carnivorous duck. Watch this movie for Lauber and fun; not thought-provoking. But it is delicate and pleasant.
