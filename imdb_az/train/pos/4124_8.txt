Lloyd Bridges and his ship, like Mike Nelson, were all stars of this series. How nice he was to me when he watched that the submarine was a real part of entering the water. The show shows young energy energy for exploration under leaking water. <br /> <br /> The show was a demonstration showing something about the divers from a man appearing to the audience as a sophisticated producer, Mike Nelson. There were excellent shows and the program was always good. Certainly, drama scripts have sometimes been recorded in more than one episode, but each show is similar to the American television's infantry, with any show in American times.
