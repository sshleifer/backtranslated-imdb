Henry Thomas was "great". His character was my focus. I'm not real, and I forgot that I had been in the story. I wanted to keep her up and see what a special person is. The other people in the story were important in his character. The way they came together to help each other was really awe-inspiring. I love movies that show the true side of your human emotions without compelling you to hit you, so you are not smart enough to work for yourself.
