A great story with a message. Joan Plowright is perfect as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is hilarious as "Coacher" and Richard de Klerk plays "Carmine". Mischa Barton performs well as "Frankie", and Ingrid plays the very first way as "Hazel". This film is surprising by Jo-Beth Williams. Correction is the first degree.
