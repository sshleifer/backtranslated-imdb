"Dick Tracy" is one of the favorites of your family - the actors are great - the direction of art is exceptional - music is magic. <br /> <br /> Stefen Sondhemim evolves songs: "Back to work", "Early or Next is just right." <br /> <br /> Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn's High-Level but also Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome. <br /> <br /> For a minute, <br /> <br /> However, one of the things that most describes this film is that every one of them is attracted by a smile (how many times we looked at each other and said, "Wait a minute - I have a thought - it's gone!") it's a good time to spend a lot of time and, first of all, increase your audience's joy, so if you did not, do not give Dick Tracy a chance - why accept it - brought a fun comic strip of life - and in a wonderful way!
