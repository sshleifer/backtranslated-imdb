I liked this movie. The decoration was breathable, consistently beautiful curls and turns, and the symbols were well rounded. On two fronts, Rob Roy dominated on average. First, I have seen a "famous" film that rarely has a high quality of dialogue. There were many verbal twisting and twisting to accompany the brilliant choreography sword. I could give many examples, but why am I? Just watch the movie. Second, this film understood a more sophisticated principle. A drama is not just a hero to succeed, but a truly incredible villain. You do not have the joy of throwing roots for one or the good kids. And "Rob Roy" is one, not three - Montrose Earl, his assistant Kilairn and Archie. Not one-dimensional villains, but also full fleshed and very bad. The more patience is more brighter than "Braveheart" - there is more dialogue and emphasis is a bit difficult, but it is a much smarter and delicate piece. (Like I said, I liked this movie!)
