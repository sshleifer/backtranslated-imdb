If the creators of this film tried to apply the reality into the field, it would only be time, money, and creative effort. Fortunately, all the fruits of truth were thrown into the wind, and they made the comedy admiration. Who could give a film that completed the entire movie, such as a memory pilot, Jack Nicholson, with Lakers T-shirts? Do not leave this movie as trash.
