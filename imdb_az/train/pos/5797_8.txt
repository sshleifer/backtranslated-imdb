<br /> <br /> I was watching this movie in the movie 6 or 7 years old. Me and our brothers at the same time were magical, beautiful and scary. . <br /> <br /> For several years, I've seen this movie a few times, but it's always the channel I'm changing. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend. Even if you see a few seconds, I will bring back this magic feeling and it will warm my heart. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie once and I believe it is a good decision to watch it again. If I see today, I know the MJ player, a plan (if any), and I will not be able to do it. For me this is a childhood memory, so my feelings are about 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> My adults are interfering with my rating and 8 music for her memories and beauty. For this little kid who has been watching for fear 20 years ago, this is definitely worth ten.
