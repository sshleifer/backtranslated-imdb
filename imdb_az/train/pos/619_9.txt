I was expecting this movie to be decent and perhaps clich√©, but I was totally wrong! Charlie Cox (who has never heard so far) played an incredibly good lead man; <br /> <br /> My friend and my friend who saw the movie with me were very happy and romantic. <br /> <br /> My favorite Claire Danes (who loves Romeo and Juliet) loves me more and more. His player was fantastic and could not even say he was an American. Chemistry was very good at the invitation of former US Secretary of State Robert DeNiro and Michel Pfeiffer. DeNiro is like a gay bullet ... priceless, priceless. I was so laughing at a scene on Septemus's ship ... oh god, wow. Pfeiffer played a good kid, I liked him as a snippy mother in Hairspray. But there were good melodrama and sniper comments in the film. <br /> <br /> In general, it was funny (but not a rifle!), romantic, special effects were not very common, but pretty big; Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who loves fantasy films like Princess Bride and even Lord of the Rings. My interest is kept all the time and when I get the DVD you will receive!
