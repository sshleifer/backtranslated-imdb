IQ, in my opinion, is a sweet, charming and exciting romantic comedy for finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was a really boring man. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited to James Catherine (Meg Ryan). Anyway, everyone involved in this film did a great job. Now, as a result, I recommend this sweet, seductive, and cheerful romantic comedy to any admirer of Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan to find the right person for you. If you're going to have too much laugh, go to the video store, rent or buy, repeat it with a friend and see.
