However, we have high expectations. . . Because Zombi 3 was officially studied by Zombi 2 and managed by Lucio Fulci. . . however. . . It's shot by Phillimines like Zombie Night and Claudius Fagrasso (Night of Zombies), directed by Bruno Mattei (The Night of Zombies) and Dardino Sachetti is much more than the Night of Zombies (Living Dead in Hell). eventually comes as a comrade of the paradise of more than 2 victims of the Zombie. Fabrazio DeAngelis, the creator of Zombie 2 and its editor, Tomassi (?) And efx gianetto De Rossi, gave the magic of Zombie 2. . . Zombie 3 is not magic. . . like peanut butter and jelly sandwich. But over the years I have accepted Zombie. 3. I remember that a soldier's arm was over and I saw a version that went to the hotel room. . . Fulci has an uninterrupted section and is on Mattei / Fulci-cut DVD.
