At first, it's English, so there's certainly a 98% chance of being a smart and very nice movie. I have never heard of this movie before. I saw Helena Bonham-Carter in a minute, I told myself: Oh! Here comes the female version of my left foot. I'm right, but I made a mistake. It's wrong, because two films are very different. My Left Foot was a John Ford movie and this is a Chaplin movie (which is not funny, because Chaplin is not in the big sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes). I made a great feeling in the truth and made a little ugly by playing a crippled person in the beautiful Daniel Day-Lewis in 1990. Here's the very nice Bonham-Carter did the same thing, but with many women's emotions. The story is well-written and very clever. Miss Bonham-Carter gives me one of The Waves Breaking's Emily Lloyd, one of the largest female parts of the 1990s. Gee! Look your eyes! Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner had the most beautiful eyes! Like many other films, he is truly talented. Look, you will not regret it! The branch is also a very nice job!
