I saw it in theaters and I absolutely loved it. Geoffery Rush, like Lex Luther, has acted as a superhuman guy I've ever seen since Gen Hackman. Kel Kelly and Paul Rubens were the only players in paradise. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, one of my favorite actors. Hank Blue was great as Raja and I liked that the character is not really really English. The scene with her and her mother tells her that a super hero has brought tears to my eyes. I like Bowler talking to the ball. Some of the enterprising stories included Stiles and his character, the furious rage of Mr. Furious, and that his threats and linen were astounding and did not give any meaning. I stood up with applause when I called myself "Alcohol, Freinken-Puss". But one of his favorite things, Captain Amazing, really died in the movie. I strongly recommend this movie for any event, and I also give my own personal tweets.
