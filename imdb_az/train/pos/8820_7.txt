After watching the big operation, I watched the movie. I know it was just a "B" movie, a venue west, I liked it. Maybe it was the lack of high dollar production flashs that did not keep my imagination and provided a great run. Unfortunately, our society is not so exhaustive, it is easy to discount small attempts. If I can benefit from the Shakespeare class school performance, I appreciate many achievements for art. I found myself in close proximity with police and retired LAPD. As a husband, I can not escape the crisis, but can answer another life (or myself). When I had a romantic end to Farnsworth's bad boy, I needed a little romanticism that could do good good (predictable). My world is really kin.
