Russ and Valeri are discussing the start of a family. The couple lives in a luxury apartment and carries out auction dealing with valuable collectibles. At the same time, the owner of a childcare agency takes a mini vacation and raises an orphanage to his father's responsibility (Leslie Nielsen). Father Harry is in hiring and he has a brilliant idea to bring "couples" like Russell and Valerie to some of their children's homes. Being aware of the couple's dilemma, Harry offers a family-friendly brother for a ten-day rental period! Brandon, Kyle and Molly are moving along with their temporary parents, but children are inexperienced. But what is the likelihood of a happy ending? This is my darling family movie. The actors, such as the gatekeeper and the gateway to the attractive home of Christopher Lloyd, are all beautiful. The scenario is quick and fun, and overall production prices are quite high. Yes, only life can be this way! Orphaned children everywhere have a chance to prove that their lover is and that their parents are happy to have parents. If you want to show your family a good, but very fun movie, find this movie. Everyone's heart is laughable, even if his heart is like melting.
