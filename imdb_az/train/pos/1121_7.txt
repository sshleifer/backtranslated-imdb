Here's a strange weird thing for you. PSYCHO on the camp starts with another shooting in the shower scene, then becomes serious when some coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for Spring Break. The horror comes when it comes to the smuggled land run by the murdered Sheriff Dean. One of the collective babies enters the woods, witnesses the murder of the sheriff, and his head is open. Then Dean pins, traps and defects allow MACON COUNTY LINE-time as one-to-one witnesses. Tony Mart is targeted as a bad, shotgun-happy Dean. The overall sound of the movie is really uncomfortable. Until the time you tell, the director fled the movie. This is a matter of despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthrops, misogynists and nihilists in the world.
