If you are looking for a definitive biography of boxer James Corbett's life, maybe this is not a movie for you. Famous boxer gets Hollywood's 1940s life - making the story more entertaining and attractive than real life. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays Gey's ninety-year-old boxer James "Gentleman Jim" Corbett. But it was very good (especially by Errol Flynn) and scripts, and the film's decorations can be forgiven - a man with world boxing champion in 1892. The film goes from his modest beginnings and follows through his career by winning the title match against John L. Sullivan. However, most of the time he focused on the matches, most of them are short in the film (except for the last title game) and is based on Corbett's sad personality, as well as on his relationship with the lady who played Alexis Smith. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent supportive workmanship made by well-respected actors (such as Alan Hale, a long-term actor in Flynn films), and actually helped to educate these people. <br /> <br /> Being a boxer in Flynn's Athletics, the movie is particularly beautiful. Although a couple of shots were double, almost all boxing scenes were Flynn and he made a credible job as a pugilist. It was a nice walk to Flynn, generally playing "pretty rich" or smugglers, and this shows how difficult it is. To learn more about this, try to read his biography - before he came to Hollywood, he was pretty rough and trivial. <br /> <br /> Now, like REAL James Corbett, I'm afraid to find out if the movie is not accurate. First, Corbett was not a poor man from a poor family, but educated and brilliant in college. Second, she divorced several years later when she went to Alexis Smith at the end of the movie. Thirdly, the most delicate scene of the film between Sullivan and Corbett was perhaps the best part of the film, as Sullivan was, and could never have happened - in fact Sullivan was more egomaniac and Corbett's main role-playing boy - beautiful for a movie though.
