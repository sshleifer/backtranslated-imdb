I grew up in South West Virginia; <br /> <br /> I am connected to the age of Homer Hikam (or maybe older than one), the author of the "Rocket Boys", which is the true story of this heartbreaking film. And I closely coordinate with the coal-cultural theme in West Virginia and with its striking effect, Sputnik was on ours (October 4, 1957) on all of us. Rocket Boys went to build a great life for themselves. I went to become PhD in Physics and Computer Science. Sputnik has become the United States of America during the Cold War because it has become a "Science Flood" for many young people ... <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie for everyone of all ages. <br /> <br /> If you grow up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, she will touch the core of your existence. <br /> Everyone: Get; see it; advise your friends ... thank you very much for whom.
