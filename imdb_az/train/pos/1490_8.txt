Everyone has their first love and it is difficult to determine when you are young, but you have aching. Malaysia's filmmaker Yasmin Ahmed, in his fourth feature, aims to prove the most complex complex of these emotions in a film that has been deceived by a simple, straightforward fashion. <br /> <br /> This approach is particularly convenient in this case The love story of the movie covers two twelve-year-olds and therefore does not make any attempt at "deep" analysis and seems ambitious. They also do not believe in the healing speeches by leading actors Sharifah Aryan and Mohd Syafie Naswip. Former Orked (formerly seen in the previous Ahmed, Gubra, a genius character) plays a violent, violent sport with boys, a vibrant, rebellious girl who is influenced by her "Englishman" (her mother's English). One day, he gets acquainted with Muhsin (Nasipip), where he came to spend a holiday in his aunt's home, and suddenly changes his habits: screw tops, bike-riding and tree-climbing. But what does this mean? <br /> <br /> In their opinion, is it just something that they are talking about with friends or something else? <br /> <br /> Given the age of the cemeteries, these questions are impossible, and as with a few "small" movies (Lost In Translation), no true closing is a bittersweet choice, but ultimately a satisfying sequence : a natural, unprintable toy (especially Aryan), and a powerful supporting player (most of the Orked family) helps keep the minimalist story entertaining and entertaining. Downhill approach is not always effective (the hilarious subplot on the poor neighborhood is too early) and it is difficult to justify the strange Pulp Fiction reference at the beginning of the feature, but an emotional power is an interesting part of this independent Asian cinema, which talk about young romanticism.
