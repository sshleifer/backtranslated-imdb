I've read good things about this movie, and finally had the chance to watch yesterday's evening, and it was all about what was expected and more. This should be a proper fear movie. it was scary because it was very real. The strange beep was perfect for determining a dark mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and knew how the rest of the movie was being performed. It is very easy to watch and understand, unlike some of the most complicated films. very good. I would like to see a horror movie like this one again. This is one of my favorites. A realistic lightning and lightning storm would have created a nice atmosphere for this movie. After that all the elements do not need a good horror movie. This movie comes to anyone who can appreciate a good intimidating film that draws no punches.I have some interesting exciting features that add to my collection.The DVD.
