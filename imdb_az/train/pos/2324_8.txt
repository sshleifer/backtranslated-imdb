When I watched this movie, I felt nostalgia. As a child growing up in rural areas, I felt like I was still a kid! The swimming pool passes through the village (this is called the "tank" in Central Texas), the free spirit of the desert! The story was very convincing, and I completely lost it and cried until finally. Thanks to the pain we are experiencing in life ... life is going on and can be forgiveness.
