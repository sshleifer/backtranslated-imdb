Edmund Burke said, "It's better for me to do anything for all your bad needs." Hollywood often gives us trash because many families start seeing quality movies. This film was an astonishing story about the disappearance and restoration of faith. There was no violence, no envy, and was not worthy of a PG rating. The western shores were well laid, some vistas were just breathtaking. Actors were younger than their own, but in other cases they were convincing and talented. The music score was very high and in some places the dialogue was completely drowned. I was rarely surprised by the end of the film, but something so unpleasant was surprising. Sometimes good guys win and earn honest efforts. We love the movie and the message, and we recommend it to the whole family.
