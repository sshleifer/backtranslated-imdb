John Cassavetes's "Opening Night" is fantastic and interesting; Fantastic fantasy deals with the deepest fears we are in, because it's not surprising. <br /> <br /> Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), a two-hour-long, twenty-minute-long actress, will not be able to grab the screen. ) tries to put himself together for a single game, fights with his demons; The "opening night" is not only a woman on the edge of a crisis, but also because of the difficult life of theater actors and theatrical world. All Cassavetes' characters are experienced people who know about the world of theater; Half of the film is taken to a stage where the performers, or producers, writers, and directors work on the stage. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes is so tough with its characters that it is aimed at the audience, but the movie class. In the film theater, there is another audience who really does not know what's happening and laughs because they think that everything is performance. And what is this actually; Only in the theater our viewers will not see 'laugh'. He does not dare Gena Rowlands before leaving this stage, but most importantly; <br /> <br /> I thought that it would be hard for me to be friends with an actor repeatedly. Myrtle (Rowland) says she is an actress and this is the only thing she knows how to do it; I imagine if I was a friend who was a professional singer, it would be difficult to say the truth, because he knows he is an actor and can at any time get a fake thing. Myrtle's film creates many things during terrifying experiments? We doubt that it is real; <br /> <br /> Writer Sarah (Joan Blondell), who does not understand the nature of Mary's character. There is Manny (Ben Gazzara), who can not accept his best actress lost; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He will not be able to deal with one another, witness of his death; all these come together and affect Myrtle, but his scheme is real. They do not say anything, because they do not want to criticize him, but the film only becomes a subconscious mind that Myrtle has accepted. Sometimes, we can say that everyone is saying this. At this point, the brilliant script of Cassavetes reflects the terribly violent honesty of the words spoken on the stage of the debate; The correspondent can be contacted at trend@trend.az Do you have any feedback?

And from this point of view, performances are more important than "Shadows", because characters take a bigger picture; <br /> <br /> But in a different way, the true way to build a movie is different from the movie "Shadows". Al Ruba has a nice thing in the camera. When talking to someone, the camera does not pay attention to it, it hits the listener; so we see how he reacts to what others say. <br /> <br /> In some cases, they do not care, sometimes they are happy and sometimes damaged. <br /> <br /> All improvisations may still be improvised. Near the end, there is an unexpected scene where Cassavetes and Rowlands have not started talking. It's not something we need to wonder if it's improvised. We just watched it; but also more than just showing it while watching the sharing of life experiences and the fact that words are truly alive in a conversation.
