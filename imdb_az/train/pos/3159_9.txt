... and the series gives you the opportunity to forget about all this. Because I'm over three years old of the children described in the series. Born in 1958, I was driving during the first gas shortage, and in 1979 I received the first post-college degree in the second gas shortage. It was a really terrible time to be 70 years old - inflation, the minimum after school <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> for our elderly enough to know better. Looking directly at the 70's - the original of the time has come to an end, and yet it is the youths' hopelessness and the secondary and college years to fill the show with the best time and the worst days. Then there are parents. Two young lover in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - are really the most feared parents of goodwill. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not June and Ward, although they are conventional for ten years. They represent what happened when they reached the suburbs in the late 1970s. Donna's parents are two of them waiting for their lives to legitimize their ambitions in the 1960s. Ericin's friends Fez, Kelso and Jackie, respectively, around the group representing nerdiness, good sense of insufficiency and snobbishness. Hyde is an unusual young man for a suburban show, but he represents a person who is forced to play cards that are mostly driven by flawless and negligent parents. Although eight of the season is a bit behind Eric's absence, I love all eight seasons.
