<br /> If you're interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / American history or Yul Brynner in the early 19th century, you see this movie for yourself and create your own mind. Avoid various invasive analyzes. My reaction was an entertaining, well-behaved (most), very intelligent dialogue, and an excellent work that reflected Jean Lafitte's appeal, appeal, and legendary charm. All the events in the film are not historically accurate (can you show me a successful movie)? I feel that the film is accurate in the treatment of Lafitte, played in New Orleans history, hate the relationship between New Orleans' "respected" citizen and this illegitimate son of the city. Do not worry about what to do with the movie, but see what's happening, namely to explore one of New Orleans and America's most exciting historical personalities.
