A Japanese inspector of QI should be sent back 400 years in the midst of feudal wars that led to the formation of Tokugawa Shogunat? Is the big pitch right? The film clarifies the tone on the tile. <br /> <br /> It is gratifying that writers, in scientific fiction, usually did not have the difficulty of explaining the scientific findings in time transport. No, what for and why. They just did. However, the passage itself, as in hell, is quite large and beautiful, though it is a bit dated. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is based on T. But medieval Japan is chosen by a destructive battle sequence, losing some vapor with various subplots following the arrival of GIs. Certainly, this is the main command of today. With all the concept and the film itself, it probably came from this simple pitch: If modern warfare was equipped with the most up-to-date equipment, would it be possible to fight samurai? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only fast and long and not tiring, just GI. The only building that is the only building in the world is a gigantic rumor. Samurai can surrender. Would you like to have the chance to complete other tanks, tires, helicopters and samuras in the same shade? G.I. <br /> <br /> According to the Lieutenant Iba-led team, hundreds of tens of thousands of machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks were smashed. <br /> <br /> These mish-mash styles are one of the most widespread geniuses - Kurosawa Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Banners epic and the other western action and battle movies. There are style touches (such as beautiful slow motion pictures and bloody violence) to bring Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari to Keoma. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by western and other Hollywood works and vice versa. Samurai turns into an interesting film to win the gas that it joins in the east. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers take everything seriously and get a lot of benefits from the movie. Despite the disappearance of mentality, it does not try to envy bad movies because they laugh at the movies. The budget was probably too heavy because it was seen from hundreds of additions, ready-made clothes (very decent for a non-traditional production) and special effects. <br /> <br /> Despite the Caucasus events, there are many "song" scenes that play over 70 rockets, discos, and country songs' montage (a similar scene, love - scene of scene, "hell of war" scene, etc.). The songs themselves are quite bare and mixed and are afraid of everything. Although it lasts for about an hour in 140 minutes, it flies like bullets for most of the time. <br /> <br /> In the first part some scenes, flashbacks and subplots could have been cut off for a more intense impact. <br /> <br /> The player was Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf), Tsunehiko Watase and Hiroyuki Sanada, all of them accurately records.
