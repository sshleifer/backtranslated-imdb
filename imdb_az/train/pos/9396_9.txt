In any film, Nicholas Cage is a powerful, silent hero, Dennis Hopper, homosidal manic, like a vamp / tramp like Lara Flynn Boyle, and a late, lamented J.T. you can find. Heavy like Walsh. These are the types of roles that can play in the fourth, and they are often enough to see that they perform the boundaries by stereotyping. Therefore, John Dahl, a master at gaining more souls than a motion, led the nuanced nagus thugs. Hopper manages to cross the top, Cage typically has less depth than superficial heroes, Boyle, whistling, innocent and schematic, and the first one feels the spirit of the spirit. Her character, Wayne. Dahlin's direction, the gap of the Greater Sema country, gives a sense of space to the story's place and is dense enough to show how the missed bird will show a radical change in the store. The plot curls are top-of-the-line, and some of the characters that support one of the other great floors in this movie act as if they were in your brain. There are more brain than the main heroes of smaller heroes, such as sheriff sheriffs. But with a smart director like Dahl, the intelligence of something related to this movie should not be surprising. Beautiful movie.
