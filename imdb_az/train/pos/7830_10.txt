Siegfried betrayed at "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried". Now Kriemhild wants revenge. <br /> <br /> <strong> Hagen is married and after a series of events, he is dealing with an extremely tough (but appropriate) activity. <br /> <br /> One of the ways to watch this movie today is illustrations. Attila Hun (called Etzel in the film) can be portrayed as a strange person from the east, perhaps an idea to the Soviet Union. Obviously, Hitler's use of Nibelungenlied for the national honor of Germany in the Third Reich is not the fault of Fritz Lang but sees FÃ¼hrer's love for the story. Nevertheless, this is a great movie.
