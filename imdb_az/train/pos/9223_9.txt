Ashanti is the seventh type of film (1979, must be accurate). It reminded Wild Geese (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore's mission in Africa). <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a African-born doctor and married a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson). She is a doctor in medicine in America. They are doctors, one day was captured by slavery for the slave slave slave named Sulayman (Peter Ustinov played perfectly with all people). The rest of the film tries to get David back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is, of course, a brilliant actor, He initially helped an English campaign by a non-confessional (Rex Harrison!), Then a helicopter pilot (William Holden), and then Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has an account to agree with Solomon (he has a very strong, very attractive character) and went with David to go back to Anans - it did not happen unluckily until Davut's camel fell. <br /> <br /> Then, There is an adventure. There is plenty of ethical questioning. The story's development is somewhat predetermined and there are few freedoms, all of which can be completely forbidden, to make things faster. Question: After selling Peter Ustinov to Omar Sharif (yes, of course, Omar Sharif too!) Will he go to Anas?
