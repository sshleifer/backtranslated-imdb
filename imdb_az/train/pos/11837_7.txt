This is a very nice movie. Everyone in my family loved it. There are many manufacturers of visionary films like Disney Studio. Animated shows perfectly and easily. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And there are no moments when the characters will enter the song. I am sure that at the beginning of the film the scene will not appear in the form of a Disney: Birth of the Spirit. But it is tastefully done and no offense. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not take me wrong. I like Disney very much and I will continue it. <br /> <br /> The "Spirit" is an example of a great animated price. I understood that he wanted to see my children again. There was the same feeling. I see it as a whole.
