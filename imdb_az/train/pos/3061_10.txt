This film shows the performance of any ensemble in each film. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (husband and wife) are positively hesitant and discuss the "family business" as if they were a grocery or dry cleaning. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also terrific. As a member of a top-notch theater troupe, they play each other, because the quality product requires the support of each actor's benevolence. And finally, there's Sammy (David Dorfman). A beautiful performance of a child ... and how unforgettable it is for Ullman, your son's play! <br /> <br /> We are treating a unique story in "Panic" and it is rare The tired formic twist these days. Dialogue is sharp and intelligent, and this relatively short film, though, has the power to reveal a portion of the full sense of the audience. There are places to smile, shock, horrify, grief, wake up, angry and love. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that jumps for joy, but when it's over, we're more than happy to know that you're doing a good job of the last ninety minute. <br /> <br /> Let us go to theaters if we are treated according to this quality. When will the forces in Hollywood wake up? This is a good thing, when there is no success to succeed enough for cables on the edge of the festival and households.
