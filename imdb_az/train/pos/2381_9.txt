Timothy Hines's "The Classic War of the Worlds" is a very entertaining movie that goes to great efforts and lengths to re-create H. G. Wells's classic book. Mr. Hines was able to do that. Those who watched the movie with me and myself, evaluated that they do not have the standard, predictable Hollywood tariffs every year, for example, the version of Tom Cruise and the Spielberg version was just the smallest of the book. Obviously, everyone is looking for something different in a movie. Those who think themselves as "critics" as amateur are just looking at everything they can to criticize. Others take a movie on more important grounds, and as they are entertaining, the majority never agree with "critics." We have striven to remain loyal to Mr. Hines Wells's classic novel, and we have found it to be fun. It was easy to prevent the "critics" from perceiving their own shortcomings.
