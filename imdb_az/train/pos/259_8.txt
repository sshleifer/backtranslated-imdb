For a Danish movie, I must say that this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It is in its class, but it has international potential. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great budget and plays the role of several famous Dansk players and a few new players who play very well. Anyone who loves adventures can be watched by a ghost movie. <br /> <br /> Do not worry, you're excited!
