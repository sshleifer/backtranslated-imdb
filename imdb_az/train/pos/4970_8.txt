Some critics have found this movie in the dark, but it was good enough humor and optimistic for me to overcome this impression. For example, the girl's silent positive and stoic character is still the center of the film and often reflects aspects and sequences that are not disturbed by the setting. <br /> <br /> It is full of original ideas and symbols of the film and I also note that I've pointed to the effective use of black and white, but the article I've seen here shows on the SBS TV network was full of color. <br /> <br />
