<br /> <br /> Arctic White Men's coming in Canada is not afraid ESKIMO calls for freedom of hunter. W. S. Van Dyke, the peripatetic director of the MGM, was responsible for this interesting appearance of life in the Arctic in Inuit. His production took place from April 1932 to November 1933 (some of which were back-painted by the projection effects show that some of the shots were back in Studio). <br /> <br /> Although it is thought of as a documentary in the film, it probably means "docudrama" because it is written in an interesting plot and storyline. <br /> <br /> The daily life of Eskimo begins in the winter at the hottest time of the year, with the winter and summer and, in fact, the eyes of the abdomen or the ice. Continuous feeding is described and watched exciting hunting for margarine, polar bears, whales and caribou. The mother tongue is used in conjunction with heading cards; spoken only by fishermen and mountains facing English Eskimo. In fact, white men are both good and evil, and the change that Eskimo creates is the key element of this story. <br /> <br /> This Pre-Code film was a crucial and completely innocent part of their culture, with the Eskimo moral norm, especially with the practice of sharing with his wife. In fact, the whole movie can be viewed in a valuable way in the early 1930s as a rapidly disappearing lifestyle. <br /> <br /> None of the rubble can get a loan as a screen, and there are some outstanding speeches. The most important of these is Ray Wise, who plays Mala Eskimo's lead role. Aqil (1906-1952) was the Alaskan family of the Inuit family, and believed in a very demanding part of a magnificent and perfect manner. <br /> <br /> Although it is as beautiful as any Hollywood star, Ray Malan's name will continue to act in a frequently-used movie career. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long Malan's second wife, the other wife of the other two beautiful actress names are now dark. Director Vudy Van Dyke is stepping up as a harsh north-east steel police inspector in front of the cameras. The two worthy Messiah, who had to deliver Malan to Canadian justice, is performed by Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing, a long-time film actor. The Danish author Peter Freuchen has a short live role of a badly-lit marine captain, drawn on his books, unusually creating Mala's frozen anger.
