An unprecedented appearance in a city of Vienna in the 21st century is a piece of provocative, minimalist and tense observing movie, mixing stories of six characters by the old documentary artist U. Seidl. <br /> <br /> The world-wide Big Brother shows that Hundstage is an unsettling, deeper level of contemporary voyeurism. <br /> <br /> It is hard to avoid the love of European painting, it may seem tyranny and elegant, yet it is still trying to convey the nihilist sense of the modern society. <br /> <br /> Must be for fans of the world cinema.
