<br /> <br /> This film is a joyful blessing. <br /> <br /> There are many people who are stranded in an abandoned school. They begin to be killed, they know they are attracted, so what do they do? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> A girl decided to buy a bath, the other decided to deceive her husband (with her ex-spouse), along with an old friend, abandoned school?). <br /> <br /> And this is also interesting in terms of history and sociology. The usual 80's slasher has a unique perspective on how we look at ourselves or how young adults look and where Hollywood views the rest of the country. This is a British movie made to become an American slasher. <br /> <br /> If you love your favorite 80's (like Pieces), then you want something like this,.
