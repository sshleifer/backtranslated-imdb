This movie is great. Many times I have heard that it is really realistic and sometimes cruel, but unlike some people, I'm totally unaware of the ideas that Austria is as grim, negative or crushing as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary, although HUNDSTAGE has really heavy scenes, some of the characters can be called bad guys, but you're watching the love, beauty, and humor in Ulrich Seidls. And this is something that distinguishes HUNDSTAGE for me from other films that have tried to make the life of the "Simple People" dense, realistic; Their hustle, desires, dark sides: Seidl never tried to prove that the working class was trashing the lives of people! In my view, as far as I can imagine, the audience was afraid that we would have to believe other people, just as nobody else was "clean" and "normal". And every living thing is dark and often hearty. The most beautiful scenery: The old Viennese man watches the 'eastern way' dance when calling her. Everyone who finds this scene should be deprived of the sense of ugly beauty and ask himself what it is, proto-fascism: the characters in HUNDSTAGE and the extermination of a 70-year-old woman's body, all her charm for her lover.
