This well-thought-out and thoroughly investigated documentary shows that the torture of the Cagos Islands between 1969 and 1971 was forcedly deported from the homeland by the consent of the British and American governments. Anglo-American policy makers admitted that the island would be strategically important to managing the Indian Ocean through air and sea power projection. During the Cold War, the most independent post-colonial states were moving away from the Western orbit, British and American officials believed that the islands could solve the island's fate. Instead, they chose to hand over the wholesale production of the local population. The film shows that there are no provisions at the Israeli release point and that the Chagosian community, which has been moved from Mauritius, has been exposed to three decades of freedom and that it is due to the demolition of houses in these new conditions. However, over the past three decades (and years) after the release of a large number of documents from the British public office, one was wrong and that these documents were not publicly disclosed), the legal complaints resulting from the exile Chagossian society were found in English courts intermittently and consistently against the British government. Thus, the admirable and alarming results in the film can be substantiated as evidence. Nevertheless, the UK and US governments have not taken any commitment to return the Islands to those who have resolved so far. This is a very valuable film for everyone to see, but it is important for the British and Americans to watch. To be silent in the face of these facts is to take part in a completely ugly crime.
