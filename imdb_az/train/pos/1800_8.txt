All dogs go to Hell, parallel to Watership Down for scary guys. Both were dark and were pretty bad, but at the same time, the most unpleasant experience for the child. It was one of my favorite films as a kid. I fell in love with Charlie and when I was about five or six, I would accept it ... I was drowned in a cartoon dog. All Dogs explain the dark story of the crazy cad Charlie and the healing partner. The story begins with Charlie, who escapes death, and closes the closest club to make some gambling games. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this movie. I loved my songs and animations, but as a teenager, I'm starting to wonder why this film is not bothering me. These are pretty mature topics --- gambling, murder, hell, and prisons, but in a world of good Disney movies, every child needs to watch one at a time. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some kind of opium crocodile scene, and the scenes of hell have frightened me so much that when I'm little, it's just a terrible message that should not be ignored by your parents!
