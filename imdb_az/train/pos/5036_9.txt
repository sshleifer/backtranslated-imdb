Bill Paxton began his career as a Frailty director for the Far East, near the Darkness and Terminator's glory. It hits all the cylinders, but there is a modesty that is closely related to the FBI agent (Powers Booth), which is another point of thought and thought-provoking. Besides, this movie was good. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays Dad. It can not give a name, but it is not the weakness of this film. In fact, the film enhances the viewer's ability to see it as a kind of symbol. There is one day that the world has come to an end and two sons, Fethon Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) say that the demons should be subtle and kill them. . Demons appear to be normal people they kill, and does this taste just lost their mind or really does God's work? <br /> <br /> The story is spoken and spoken by one of the growing sons (Matthew McConaughey). FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) is very skeptical and justified. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of shooting and Bill Paxton guessed us to lose interest. Acting is incredible. Paxton is doing a great job with two of his younger friends and looks like a normal family, although all of them are murdered. I said that there is an imbalance of Powers Booth's character, but it's not really a big deal. This is a very good movie that is incredible and covers the family.
