As we all know, sub-genres of sexual comedies are quite full. It's not enough just to be too dull. <br /> <br /> I've seen and heard a lot of disgusting jokes and movements that sex comedy needs in other days to appeal to me. <br /> <br /> Why wait when you come to 40-year-old Virgin? I saw ads. "Is not it right if you do not use it?" I do not think I'm finding it, it is heart and honest attempts to develop character. There are still strange "strange" characters we can see in Adam Sandler's films, and there is still a language that is not adequate for the release of Noah's Ark, but in some ways the film has a valuable love story and yes there is a message. <br /> <br /> The main character Andy (unfortunately for me) may be related to a person. At first, I see that he distributes my love throughout the movie to see the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which has a poster for his movie on the wall) and a really neat collection of his true antique age. Andy also has a lot of video games and a job related to film and technology. Andy does not want to buy a car, because he prefers his bike. Most importantly all; Andy is a beautiful person, she says, she does not respect her, and goes away from them. Combine all these factors and begin to think that everyone is a serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is like my life story. <br /> <br /> Each of the other characters has funny little stories to go with a bit of exaggerated personalities, and they all work on a certain level, but not like Andy. <br /> <br /> A few days after some days, some days before, another thing is bright. The story is clever, but very predictable and romantic; very simple. It deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we know what will happen at the end of all of us. Of course, the last route is a bit different than we expected, but you know what will happen next and I'm sure of that. <br /> <br /> This movie has little spots, but here's a good thing that I will not see a few mistakes easily. <br /> <br /> When I say "good", of course, it means "bad." This is a sexual comedy and wants to be bad. For most of all, I think you have succeeded. After abandoning sex with Trish, there are many hilarious scenes like Andy to get rid of a squad. Or if Andy goes to sex education with her daughter Trish, she ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Oh, and we should not forget to soon be a classic chest engraving sequence "Ooh! Como se llama!" She is an interesting little note about the scene; actor Steve Carell actually shoved his abdomen, and the pain felt was real. <br /> <br /> Actually, when we talk about Steve Carell, I'm telling you he's already upgraded to my dear comedies, and I did not know who was before seeing this movie. With his writing, the player and the time, I was very surprised to see him wait for his future roles. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "I'm very glad that it's too much I have seen so much since being one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It's just a series of sexual gags that come together and has a number of sexual gags that involve a very valuable character and really romantic touch. /> <br /> My view from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
