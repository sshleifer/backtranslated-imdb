Buying the Amazon's first season (Canadian version) gave me the chance to "Hardcastle and McCormick". When I got it, I started with a pilot and immediately closed it. I appreciated these 5 stars in Amazon and I appreciate 10 stars here. Only good. The topics that I liked were the opening and closing topics and, of course, at the end of each episode, Stephen Cannell's logo worked together, but most importantly, to convey each case between Hakim and Mark. I liked this as the second season I bought as a friend, and I liked it. If you do not have this great series on your drive, I believe you'll be able to buy it and pack it.
