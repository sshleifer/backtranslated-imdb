Nina Foch insists that in 1945, Dame May Witty and George Macready starred in the movie Noir called "My Name Julia Ross." Short, because the film draws. <br /> <br /> When I grew up, Foch was a wife of a fraudulent, hated woman playing television, a nervous breakdown with a cheating husband. She was one of the great teachers in Los Angeles. Here is a young worker who plays the lead. Julia answers an advertisement for a secretary and is immediately hired by Mrs. Hughes and her son, Ralph. <br /> <br /> According to this study, only one woman, one non-married woman, or one without a lover is to be found. <br /> The situation; <br /> <br /> When Julia entered the house, she went to the drug and woke up, but she was not Mrs. Hughes, and she did not. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good. Low budget, but still fun - some, especially at the end, happen very quickly, so I said the movie was too short. Nevertheless, I propose that.
