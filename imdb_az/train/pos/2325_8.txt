The Court is doing its utmost to realize that the difference in the Dani's centuries is an incredible love affair. Soon Dani's nubile attraction begins to win the will of the Court. <br /> <br /> He later joins Dani's elder sister who is played by Emily Warfield and is at the forefront of a short-lived love / jealousy problem. <br /> <br /> Tess Harper and Sam Waterston cast work around.
