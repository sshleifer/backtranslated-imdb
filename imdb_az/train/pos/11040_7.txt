Last night he watched this French fright movie and he liked it very much. The whole movie takes place in prison along with three prisoners who have been in jail for 20 years to escape from the prison and find a written magazine in the hands of a wall serial killer, without leaving prison. When they look at the day, they see black art and commands and liberties that can emerge from the path of the cell. They know, that is something completely different and at least a terrible thing to say. I love the little budget horror movies that convey the goods in a good quality and tell a good story. This is what the film continues to do for a while. The result and the terrible horror they are doing is very interesting to me and I enjoyed the trip. Not too scary, but the story does not fit, though it is very good.
