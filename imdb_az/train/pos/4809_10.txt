Do you really have another time with all the latest English monarchy films? Answer: BET! Young Victoria is a contributing factor to the British movie wave, which deals with the royal family. In this case, he deals with Princess Victoria's early life and the events of up to Coronation because of being the Queen of England, as well as romance and eventually for Prince Albert's wedding. The film will meet the exciting life and career of the Queen and Prince of England as well as many other events (political turmoil, etc.). Emily Blunt is a brilliant Victorian girl in her youth, Rupert's friend loves and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest is mirrored by Miranda Richardson, the city's Dutchess and the screen is always there, Jim Broadbent, King William, has another cast that glows on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A. Z.Y., Loser Love), a guided scriptwriter by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). Jill Bilcock and Matt Garner have always been a part of the film, with the help of the designer Patrice Vermetta, who has an artistic look (by the film teacher Hagen Bogdansker). What I value in the Fellowes script is a chess play that is metaphor for some political motivation of the film (the characters in the movie act as pieces on the chess board). This beautiful, well written, directed, filmed, edited and entertaining entertainment (and enlightenment) is a good night in cinematography. Several scene scenes by MPAA, some short violence (although a bit bloody, although not very bizarre), a rough explosion of the tongue and some smoke on the screen
