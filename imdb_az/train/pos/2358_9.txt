Pushing Daisies is just a "Amelie" is a lovely fairy tale with aesthetic and romantic shades. <br /> <br /> Look blue in the sky, have a beautiful palette, its shots are well thought out and detailed, names and dialogues are strange and attractive, real, dreams are great and romantic. <br /> <br /> Watch a strange, natural and totally satisfying song from a scene. <br /> <br /> His account is beautiful, the stranger is very loud, there is great music, and two leading romantic stars can not touch one another or die. Do you need more sexual tension? <br /> <br /> This is a show that is a pleasure to spend an hour and I recommend it. (In fact, they found a way around this, but c'est la vie) is high. I did not have a television like him and would like to see more. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus
