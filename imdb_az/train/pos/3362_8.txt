'Una Giornata Particolare' is a film that he thinks he has once seen once I'm very familiar with. Now, finally, I see that I'm very happy. Marcello Mastroianni, one of the great masterpieces of La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2, is one of the better Italian films I have ever met with one of the most beautiful performances by Federico Fellini. <br /> <br /> Ettore Scola's director, Adolf Hitler, is a filmmaker who has taken the time to present a special day on a special day on his trip to Rome and is slowly making a story. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastroianni, Antonietta (Sophia Loren). Member of the Mussolini party is very fanatical in his thoughts and is no longer a member. I will explain why. Since daytime, each of them, including her husband and children, has access to seeing Hitler, they are still in the building. Antonietta escapes and goes to Gabriel's apartment, and the second is this. Before Antonietta went to Gabriele, he was thinking of killing himself, for the reasons I did not explain. <br /> <br /> Mastroianni says that Hitler is not in Rome, and I will not even figure out how to develop this outcome. beautiful performance. As you can see, he is a man who wants to be around him, but first we do not know why. Perhaps Antonietta may be like, maybe, she is in love with her, there may be other reasons. Antonietta feels like us. What does this guy want for him? He likes his attention anyway. How we see how attractive his hair looks to man. Loren's scenes play very well. Although we can not be sure what his intentions are, we understand his questions. The moments we find in both of them are a great moment if you can call it. How the story is more interesting than development, but I do not want to spoil it for you. This is a sophisticated film. Great speeches and beautiful cinematography, and the message he has given us today.
