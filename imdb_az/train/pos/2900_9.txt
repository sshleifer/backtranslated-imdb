If it were an American movie, I would have evaluated it 7: we've seen it before. I am an Argentine film and I would like to give myself a 10-year-old Argentine because it's the quality I hope for the better. Taking into account all the limitations of the 3rd world, this surprising quality is amazing ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene when I confess Diaz Silverstei's fianc√©e. The main moment of the film is perhaps not surprising, not original. <br /> <br /> I'm always trying to collect the previous information before watching a movie. Just like I'm a basically, satirical, commercial, press "Play" and ensure that reality and logic stop, I'll tell you the best thing to enjoy movies like that. It is not possible to discuss the expediency of all ammunition, but it is convincing in some way. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < As for me, I can not stop laughing in every joke and comment - "sauce malo" "I'm so tired of seeing the movies for Peretti, and I know she's a great actor , but sometimes his role is unfair, Luis Luque plays a role in this, I did not like Argentinean television, I did not have much to do with Luque, but a very good performer, his physical role, his views, his attitude to me in this film <br /> <br /> I do not know if Szifron plans to start later. <br /> <br /> I know that if the "second part is not good" rule, and will do so, and I will definitely see it, and I hope that in the future Peretti will take on the same opportunities to develop their roles for their profits. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great speeches and lots of laughs!
