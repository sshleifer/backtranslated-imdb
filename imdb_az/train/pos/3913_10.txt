Carlos Sauran's Carmen is one of the world's best accomplishments, not only Spanish, but also cinema. Causes flamenco interest in beautiful staged adaptation, which is a powerful physical force of Bizel. At the same time, we see the impact of Carmen's new interpretation and training on choreographer / director and principal dancers. The fine line between life and art is brilliant.
