I will never forget the film or the events that led to Jonestown in Guyana. It just looks tragic, but there is a need. Powers Boothe gives a flawless team performance as the leader of Rev J. Jones's general madness. If he was released in movie theaters, he would have won the Oscars easily. This is the type of mini-series that will not be forgotten. You will not describe the cult of cruelty, control and obsession with its leader. Its ups and downs and the threat from outside the world is to destroy what it considers paradise. Nobody's imagination is unrealistic because of mass suicide, because many people (900+) volunteered or resisted Joe's orders. They do not make a mini row anymore where you are hungry to remain open with their mouths and know what happened to the others.
