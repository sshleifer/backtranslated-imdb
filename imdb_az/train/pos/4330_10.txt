<br /> <br /> Bleak House's hands are never the best fit of Charles Dickens's embroidery on the screen. Alway, one of my favorite novels, I was happy with this TV Mini Series. The late, great Denholm Elliot giant John Jardyce and Diana Rigg beat perfectly as Ladty Dedlock was perfect. The film reflects the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely loyal to its book, making it a small plot cut that does not affect the story. on all bright, moving and atmospheric films.
