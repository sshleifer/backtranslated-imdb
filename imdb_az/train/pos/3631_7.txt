The film really has a good story, but it looks like a few basic places. The movie resembles the director taking the film without taking the time to make some important feelings in the film. The Sea Quaid is doing a decent job with its role ... but one thing is obviously missing from a few major scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5-hour film could have been postponed for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
