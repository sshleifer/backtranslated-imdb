Ahh, Talespin! How about this great show was not mentioned anymore? There is nothing! Without a doubt, one of the best-featured shows I've encountered is live animation or animation. The new things have fallen for my taste and I have to shut up the children in the room for some "mature" things. But it is not Talespin. <br /> <br /> Stories are attracted and very acceptable. Someone took one or two hours to shoot the movie. Episodes such as Stormy Air, and the chances of falling asleep, are also pleasant to children and adults. Then Baloo Bloods have the most bluest-like pure comedy episodes, and the emphasis is on you being struck by the beauty. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "</ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; In Episode, Stormy Air, for example, Kit Cloudkicker decides to join an airline, but Baloo believes it will be very dangerous. In the biggest struggle of the episode, Baloo goes away from Daring Dan, Kit shouts: "No, you can not tell me what to do!" * YOUR YOUTH * * * MY * * DAD *! and shouts his pillow. The next day the air is leaving the circus. <br /> <br /> This kind of drama is a rare event in an animated film and is most enjoyable in recent days. <br /> <br /> Characters have many depths on them. Baloo is quite a lot in the Jungle Book or a few degrees negatively. Rebecca, the idea of ​​making money, is theoretically good, but in practice it is rarely a good business woman. Molly is a cute little girl, but let's not cheat you. It can sometimes be a real hell. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker one than the rest. She does not rely heavily on adults and is forced to disconnect her before applying to her. <br /> <br /> As a result, it looks like it was prepared to put it right through a pirate. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is one of my most dramatic real-life chemistry drama symbols # 1 in this show. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. Baloo pointed out Baling Whale's points for all the animals in the aquarium to replace Kitty with Seymour's other adults. Baloo and Becky's relationships are also realistic, due to Baloo's motivation for work, 'comes from coming back to the Sea Duck, not the desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if Duck was to get back, he would still work for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> The Sea Duck has been designed in a really realistic way to avoid all the other planes in the series. Unlike the airplane functions series, it does not change once (which is difficult to maintain), and unlike most super-planets of most cartoons, there is no single weapon on the boat!) And instead of the sophisticated pilot's great ability to get out of trouble. It is difficult to think of a hero with a gun, a gun, a laser ball, or even a pistol. It is difficult to find a cartoon in their use of their heads to get out of trouble. Already such a darn cool design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Ever. Period. Surely worth the whole ten stars!
