Paul Reiser is one of my favorite in show business. I've read his books, and I think he's thinking. Peter Faulk can offer a fist line with the best. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family that really knows each other. On a road trip, a father and son coordinate their lives for the first time in the middle of a family crisis. They do all that they have in their father's life and in the life of their children ... They are only doing in life later. Situations are very funny, but they really feel that people in real life can do it (from above or from cartoonists). This is the first time I've been watching Paul Reiser, and I'm sure of all the feelings described. <br /> <br /> In some cases, her eyes look very sad. There is a comedy and feeling, but there is an upgrade message ... Olympia Dukakas will do a great job :)
