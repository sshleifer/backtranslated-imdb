This is a big movie. fantastic actor skills and simple but human wisdom. there are real characters that can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very lively. The bus driver and his son gather the country (Jugoslavia) while traveling to the capital Belgrade. The funny and cruel situation on the road combines people and traveling pigs. <br /> <br /> <strong>
