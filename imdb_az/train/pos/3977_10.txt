I watched it personally to see the 60s and 70s. It was interesting to learn how the narcotics movement actually started and became a decisive force in pop culture and life. Interviews of classic rock stars are seductive and humorous. You feel as if you were a mystery, and at the same time, you can feel like you are very good and familiar. I like it, all segments from 60 to present. It comes in all aspects, including rock music, hipper movement, politics and good history. I mentioned the box, saying it was a spoiler, because I think or think spoiler in one part because I'm just talking about all four segments, just wanting to be safe.
