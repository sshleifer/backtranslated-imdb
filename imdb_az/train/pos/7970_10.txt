This movie is definitely my first 10 favorite list. Animal sounds are very nice. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are brilliant as cunning cats and young novice goats, but the real recommendation is Don Ameche, an old, loyal gold retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by both children and adults. Every animal is delightful and suspenseful and guaranteed to scream lover! (happy tears!)
