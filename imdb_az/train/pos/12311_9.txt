"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most beautiful Hong Kong films I've ever seen. It is a brilliant blend of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. There are some nice visual and beautiful battles in the film. The scene between Wu Ma and tree iblis. An original and refreshing movie and another beautiful Embalmer's offer.
