This film is another horror anthology. Very good, but could use a bit more. This is comparable to the "Terror House of Horrors", although a headline is appropriate. There are four stories related to a part of a house. The first tale works with a writer and his wife. He creates a killer for the latter novel, and then begins to see a killer who goes around his house. It can predict some sort of thing, but then throws a few layers. The next story is a little more unexpected and you know what the truth is. It was a Peter Cushing's features and was probably my favorite of the bunch. This man is buying a home, but not the home that leads to the center stage, rather strange wax. The third story begins quite well and features Christopher Lee. It's like a strange father who seems to be so terrifying to her. The point is that the story does not end there when it comes to knowing what is happening. It drags a little bit of anticipation. The last tale relates to an actor who bought a dress from a strange little shop. The actor really gets what he's paid for. There is then a small incident about an officer trying to explain what happened to this actor and then explaining why. Despite the fact that I was not very satisfied with my explanation, I do not think that Cushing really did not explain the story. I think there is a need for a little more back to them. Although all the stories are an interesting story set.
