This film was a disaster at Box Office, and behind it was the guilt of the movie, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of this story is very good, the director did his best. Abhay plays an excellent and impressive role and once again shines his role, has done his best in comedy or emotional stage. Soha looks very sweet in the movie. The star in the rest was simply good. Music and all songs are good, Himesh is here as a Singer. Do not miss this movie, its a beautiful film and a good part of us. Abhay is the best business ever. Ahista Ahista will give 9/10.
