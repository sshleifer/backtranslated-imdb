Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. <br /> <br /> Before I knew what this movie was, these names were enough for me. Gorgeous, talented and popular, they are the performers to browse. <br /> We know what the movie is. Five beautiful girls are targeted by a "romantic" slasher, a boy dance at school 13 years ago. Her trademarks include glamorous ghosts that appear as valentine cards, secretive floral chocolates, and bleeding noses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I love horror movies, but not all of them. This is one, I love it. I have some other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The mask of the murderer is a terrifying creepy victim and a victim of a bow and the chess you read is truly miserable. Players are top-notch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are very entertaining. I really wanted to see more from Katherine Heigl. I am one of his greatest admirers and I love to do some of the leading work in the near future. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress and Jessica Cauffiel City Legend 2 gets the perfect ditzy blond role. The smaller parts were also good; <br /> <br /> Dear Hedy Buress, called bleedmedry.com, and a small version of Denise Richards looked like him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Top: The opening scene of the dead morgue. Hottub's scene was fun, and funny. Audiovisual maze was also bad. <br /> <br /> I think that I felt as though I had not been murdered, but we only saw the mask, and despite all this, at the summit. <br /> <br /> In some movies, it's very important for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> After longing for people living in the Caucasus <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
