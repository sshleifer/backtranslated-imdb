Hanson's brothers - Andy (of course, along with his movement) and Hank (obviously his action does not have to) need money. <br /> <br /> Andy is coming up with a scheme to get some dough that will give results for Hanson's family. <br /> <br /> This movie presents. This is a layered, full-bodied roller coaster who knows exactly what he does. As a crime drama / tension, I would compare it to "no country for the elderly". Both films have dramatic drama and excitement, though 'Devil' is rapidly on the steep slope. The film "No country" is a cold and sad movie that can be very admirable, and "Satan" is a bit more pleasant. There is severe violence, not 'Satan', 'no'. It moves in the same way. In the past, sometimes wooden Ethan Hawke, heaps, sweaters and deer-led headlights - looks at the encircled Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, owns the most challenging scenes of the movie and is rapidly becoming a player and believes that you can do anything. <br /> This movie really does not have much trouble. It splashes back and forth from confusion. Events do not spiral, but the movie never - writing (timer Kelly Masterson), focusing (veteran Sydney Lumet) and stay tuned as a drum. In many categories, this is a rewarding team, although films like "Refugees" and "No Country" have denied this. If you love them, you will look like that.
