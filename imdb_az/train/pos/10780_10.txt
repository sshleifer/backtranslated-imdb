My favorite animated film did it after Animaniacs by Spilberg. Even though the prices are low, I still love it and it's funny, it was funny and I was victorious, Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and it was just fantastic, the whole castle was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this animated movie again, it was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant. And remember the moment when Brain came in, you heard her voices and played PATB themed instruments, it was just fantastic, and I love these cartoons when I come in. When it comes back to animation film and animaniacs, I liked them
