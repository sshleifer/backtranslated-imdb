If you grow up in a game play diet, you will gradually understand that you need a bigger and better correction. Well, in the Running Man world, your needs are sold. In this game, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate reward is their long life. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was such a parody of a ridiculous trip that we watched everyday. Not one of the best performances of Schwarzenegg, but all this is a very good film. The main idea that Television Organizations one day will be the "real" ruler of the planet is very convincing and very well described in this film. Of course, Arnie has one-liners, when my favorite games are about to be catapulted into the gamezone, the host hosts "any recent words?" Arnie says, "Yes, I'll be back home", but the host says, "It's just running again," and then eject button. I give 10 films for this film. I was watching it 30 or more times. <br /> <br /> In short, I think you have a one-minute T.V - it's yours .....
