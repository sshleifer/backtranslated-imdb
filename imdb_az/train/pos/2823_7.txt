When MGM first came to Hollywood, he was sure how to sell Garbo. Mayer believed in him and deserved it in his "Torrent" appearance. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez has never been so easy for him. </ Font> </ font> <br /> A small village without sleep in Spain. One day, Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes that her voice will bring her great blessing and happiness to her blessed parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but are under the thumb of her mother and can not succeed in her marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) brings Leonora's parents out of the house and hopes to give Leonor a chance to sing a song in Paris. Leonora sent a note to Rafael, calling to remember his word and come to him. Her mother is angry and forbids going to her - of course, she caves on her will. <br /> <br /> Years pass. Leonora has a new identity - he was La Brunna, the Paris Opera cats. Rafael's mother emerged as she wanted - she was abducted, and Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead), a "hog" lover, helped a "safe" young girl. Mack Swain plays his father. Leonora decides to visit her old home, and I agree - why did she not help her mother? His mother still lives in a family home, works as a reptile, and bathes. Leonora and Rafael meet, but Leonora is full of madness. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Garabagh" is a great thing, it is difficult to believe that it can be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> Dam bursting and floods the torrent city. Leonora's house is on the path of the pitiful river, but Rafael sees that she is so safe when trying to save her. Then they burn their romance again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br This movie tells "Flesh and Devil" and go to Leonora. Rafael meets Leonora before traveling to America. He intends to go with him again, but still allows him to lower it. He spends lots of time to destroy other people's images - "what will he do for you, but he drags you off." If the Consumer comes with him, he has just provided a top government job for him. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Littlefield, Cupido, barber and Leonora's old and loyal friend are doing well. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
