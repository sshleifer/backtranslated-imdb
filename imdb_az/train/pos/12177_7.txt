Recap: In the morning his bachelor party detected that Paul had woken up after his mother-in-law and had a woman beside him. Unfortunately, a waitress from the bar is not a fianc√©e. And suddenly everywhere ... a cabin on a highway and a relative's in-law dinner. His jealous old lover is hard to conceal of her pursuing and photographing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < something slightly outsourced. This movie was not afraid to make a little more joke. Jason Lee, as he does here, is trying to convey comedy when his character is semi-panicked and deeply troubled. And the beautiful ladies received a wonderful support from Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. <br /> <br /> So, more romance than comedy, and the last result was good. <br /> <br /> 7/10
