This is a comprehensive religious character that bad things can be wrong. It's a simple robbery. Make some serious changes. Let's collect absolutely our money and everything will be ovky-dory. But is there a mall and pop's jewelry store? No problem. Insurance pays for it all. No weapons. Nobody hurt. Great money. <br /> <br /> An older, more successful brother, Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) has a few minor problems. Heroin addiction, cocaine habitvi. A spouse (Marisa Tomei), that is good, can not seem to fulfill her. His flat stomachs were long gone. Small, sweet, light little brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke) with a few dinero problems. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, with 82-year-old performance (!), lends money to friends and relatives for friends' support for her daughter's daughter, giving 99.99 percent right, and it's hard to do in a tension. I remember the more thrill I have seen, and most of the director lives in a feature movie, with field holes, weaknesses, cheese scenes and a rush. Here, Lumet is a tension as an artwork. Every detail is perfect. Acting is superior. There is no space in the area. The story is real and clear, and it presents a fairy tale about the man's space, which is the greatest directors and even Bardu's self-esteem. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is certainly excellent. Marquee, when the lead man is not in the presence, needs to get talent, craftsmanship and clean concentration. Ethan Hawke, who does not bother with the role of a cute, little man, adds a layer of hopelessness and some of the human defect that, unfortunately, we do not want to regret it or throw it away. Albert Finney plays the father of the deceased children of a kind that violates age. And Marisa Tomei Andy, who has sex with magic qualities to go through her unique creativity, manages to be both sensitive and challenging as nails as two-time wives. (But who blamed it?) This is a film repertory dedication for almost five years to a commercial trader, but if you are researching this movie, as all talented filmmakers will give good advice (according to most Hollywood producers) paying close attention to detail is something that can only be done by great artists and can not really help. (By the way, in my opinion, there were twenty producers in this movie? Well, maybe many, check loan). All I can say in Sumet: Sidney Lumet, author of great films, to show such loyalty to your art and art at such a pioneer age. <br /> <br /> <strong> It would not be possible for the father (Albert Finney) to follow the booths he had taken to New York without losing Andy's tail. It is not small and I wish all the thrillers have such a small blip. It is also a miracle that Lumetin decided not to let us know about Hank's fate. We can guess and guess. Perhaps he falls into the cutting room floor. Perhaps Lumet said he was not satisfied with the film, and that his time was over and he said, "Leave him alone, and I do not think, what happens to Hank is not good, he is not a man who is able to escape to Mexico and build a new life. <br /> <br /> He is a person who has been given a "light" judgment from 10 to 20 and serves him, and he should have been a shady man who knew that he was not really a human. <br /> < See the Hollywood's best director, The Pawnbroker (1964), The Group (1966), Serpico (1973), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Network (1976), and more for Sydney Lumet.
