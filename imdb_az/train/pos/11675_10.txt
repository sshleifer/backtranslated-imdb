I'm always watching Dakar, so I did not expect to watch her when I bought my DVD Charli's "Race for Dakar" my wife! <br /> <br /> The winners of the Eurovision song contest were rewarded <br /> <br /> I think Charlie's hair was the only thing that was dissatisfied with DVDs , but he had drawn it before Dakar, so my femininity was in need of it; "I could live without flame", as with LWR, the preparation was as interesting as the race itself. I Charlie broke his hand and relied on all the hardships you continue in the lesson and, of course, Andy Caldicott's death ... was a tragic tragedy, but every year there is something ... <br /> <br /> The bribe is in the RWR a thousand times better than the controversial cynicism, although the Russians manage the hazelnuts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There were months to prepare "Garabagh" - X5 and the day before the departure of the team from Lisbon, Scorpion had just taken half of what he needed, and the car was a pain all over the race; 2. The Dakar organizer should put more on his horse / driver search plan - Matt (and possibly nothing else but a guilty negligence to rid itself of many other riders / drivers); 3. Charlie is a gratifying enthusiasm for the "rude and challenging" adventure, but he must toughen many things to do as he wants and finally 4. Charlie and Evan plan to one of these epic in 2007 called Long Way Down and, of course, wait for me to draw! D: If you love bikes and / or really nice "blocks", you have to watch it, I love it. <br /> In the end, Simon Pavey - You are a mystery hero, I was very impressed with your "quiet achiever" style and actually ended ..... But it is incredible that Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - . they are really admirable. All of you are beautiful.
