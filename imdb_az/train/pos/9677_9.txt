This movie seems to be a run on the children's film in the movie that parents on the earth can regret it with their mostly entertaining little kids. The film is visible and often directed to children, but does not stop at this level. I watched this movie primarily as a small child and found it funny, entertaining and cheerful and did not see it again after a few years. I was watching him at the age of 18 and found it to be almost funny but hearty and fun. This movie is very low and contains many messages from real life. This film is an epicly inspired story of inspiration for children. I recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.
