The biographical essence of this film is one of the best heartwriting books I have ever read. Both are loyal and respected, explaining the beautiful stories of two sisters who work as teachers and dentist until the age of 70 and then live for another 30 years. Ruby Dee steals the movie with the perfect nudity performance because the director is a blatant "gypsy" Bessie. He expresses his anger, wrath, and wisdom alone; knows exactly where they use the words of the economy. Diahn Carroll is an elderly brother who is struck by the teacher's surprise, but I'm afraid he does not believe he is more than 100. Stories also deserve it. Amy Madigan, as a reporter for the Caucasus NY Times, is acting extremely intensely and interfering in the first half of the film in an effective and dangerous way. This is only a small drawback. Stories are all true, and the majority of them do it in a good way, though they are both slightly damaged or in the translation. <br /> <br /> Any book that I recommend to read mainly for all the people who recommend the book. Very rarely I can not have this TV movie in the air, but of course, it is enough to make the flavor very worth it.
