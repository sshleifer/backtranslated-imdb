I'm very pleased with this movie. <br /> <br /> Some people did not like the film, but that event had to be seen in the context of what had happened. this is it. The film uses a flashback to show the younger humility and the eventual woman's appearance. Before the White. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> This tempo is slow and there is not enough tension for my taste today. However, this is only acceptable for a version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, even if you want it inactivity, do not forget to forget it. <br /> <br /> There is a sense of being the first franchise, but I doubt you will not continue as you did not see anywhere. Unfortunately.
