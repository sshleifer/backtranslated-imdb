and it is likely that Dickens is closest to the story line. Although young Ebenezer was hard to follow (who had thought that the hair, of course, had done a lot better than that!), Scott Scrooge is incredible. He brought some lines to me from Dickens and finally brought me to life. Edward Woodward is everything we have been expecting and presents more of the Christmas holidays. I'm G.C. More from the current version of Patrick Stewart, Scott's Scrooge is a more convincing contradiction. When Scrooge realizes that he is not 'lost', the scene is enough to convince one of those who know that Christmas is the Day of Action. He's awesome here. Almost all the cast is incredible. In this version of Christmas Carol, Tiny Tim looks a bit stiff, it's almost too sweet. Still, music and scenery need to be followed by this holiday. Enjoy!
