I love the devil's pit !!! David Tennant is such a great player and even Billie Piper! Who else loves Will Thorp tracks? So sweet, is not it? I hated the devil's possessions, and he was not going to hell, for Rose laid it open. Think about you, he said, "Rose, give us a favor, okay!". Mr. Jefferson was very brave or not? He dies to save others. I was very upset because Toby was so afraid of the second time that Will Thorp was out of his property. I said, "Lord, my God, I am very afraid of him." And when I wrapped it in, I thought, "grrrrrr, it's me, but I thought it was really sweet." And the doctor was good .... I thought I'd say "I love Rose" but he did not.
