I found this really a very entertaining little kid's movie for adults that would only understand with lots of jokes and humor. A few things are not suitable for children, but only a few. Athewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey), surprises many jokes, from sex to culture to alcohol can not change from Hollywood to races. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl, Cindy Lou Who is really sweet, and the suits and hairstyles of little people here are beautiful. Anthony Hopkins's voice is also gratifying, so the story is further enhanced. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> I've seen it three times and it's getting better every time.
