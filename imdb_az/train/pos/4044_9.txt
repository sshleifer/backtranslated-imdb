I found this movie very well paced. The stage is fairly creative and as an audience I have been drawn to the characters I have developed. For those who love to think, pacing is done very well - it is kept secret from the earliest follower, and then the questions that arise are emerging, perhaps leading to a well-thought-out and enjoyable movie <br /> <br /> Some people , it looks like a non-stop roller-coaster ride with a movie - one of those coming out of the door. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This would have been similar to one of the coasting ponds that you first knew was that the hill was slowly running, and in the end, in my opinion, is more fulfilled for the foundation laid. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie.
