In 1979, when I was a 12-year-old boy, our parents took a new home safe for the neighborhood. Like a 12-year-old boy, I saw television on television. I will never forget the joy of those times. I enjoyed racing cars, purple minibus, water beds, cigarettes, warm 70 chicks, a love car in my Chevy van songs, all this was new to me. A complete movie with all your horizons. I own it and once in a year. When watching this movie, I do not want to skate with a 4-wheel drive, go to the park, and hunt some babies with hairy hair. really great memories of young adolescents!
