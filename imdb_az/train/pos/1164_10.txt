When I went out for the first time, I saw this movie. It was an official election for Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for the best picture for it. <br /> Justine Priestley is hot, but complex Amanda as psychotic. This is not a usual psycho movie. Very interesting and original slants on the tissue. Amanda is married to an incoming and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband, as her career is based on some of her older "bloody charm" with some great blues music as part of her love. <br /> <br />
