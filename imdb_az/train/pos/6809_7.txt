It was a pretty good movie. I think this is a spoiler, but I'm not sure, but I did not want to get a chance. In the end, at the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a book of verse and then gives another word of remembrance. I can not remember the first passage that I read, and the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says in Genesis 9:12, but he really reads verse 6. It is a common link used to defend a large number of death penalties. Prosecutors do not have the courage to say the Bible today. Has no one ever heard of John Jay the justice of the first Supreme Court in this country's history? The Bible is the best book in all. Very bad in America, we have lost that look.
