At the Maryland Film Festival, I'm lucky to have this movie voluntarily. I've always been an admirer of classic horror films, and especially William Castle's gimmicks, so it's definitely worth seeing for me. <br /> It's about William Castle's life and work. In my opinion, it was a baseless director. True, he made some cheap budget schlocky scary movies, but he added something to these movies: no real live theater gimmicks that I do not see anymore. <br /> <br /> This is really a good documentary, and it brings more shaded director. burned and marked the horrors of his horror. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus has a bigger portion than the symbol of life. <br /> <br /> Most film historians interview SPINE TINGLER, most of whom are family members and administrators affected by their activities, such as John Waters, John Landis, and Joe Dante. A must see for classic horror and knowledgeable fans.
