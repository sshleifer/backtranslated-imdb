Pierce Brosnan is a new, but now James Bond, an assassin. He is very good, but he's old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as a straight and narrow businessman. Now, when the story is opened, the film shows these two people in a separate life. They had a drink at one bar and started talking. Then you suddenly find that these two people are involved in a number of events. The story is excellent, the actress is the top bumper, and humor is not funny, Pierce Brosna did not think it would be funny, but you really need to see this movie.
