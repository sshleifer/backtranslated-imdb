When John Singleton is, he * * *. And this is one of her better films. Boyz-n-the-Hood is not as tight, but close (and same with the same big stone). This film was written very well, it came together very well and hit very well. Too little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superfluous (eg Fudge has earned money for college for 6 years and many expensive things?) I have not mentioned a rich background ... And why Professor Fibbs has an office? ... And we did not, hick or not, for an engineering student, Remy is a pretty dumb character - I did it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But on the one hand, the film was very sharp.Here are a few good symbols and ideas sources; and Singleton's story it's not a side - many characters are unempattable and it is doing a good job of interspersing the Panthers and Supremacist scenes to show heartiness on both sides. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was perfect; In particular, Kirsty Swanson shared each scene with Taryn and Wayne <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes it was a matter of communication, sometimes it had to really advertise it, and it was incredible that it was unfortunate that we were trying to draw the points (we did not really need the US flag) by typing "UNLEARN" and giving some credit, we're not morons. .) Although singleton melodrama has been used very well, sometimes * very * very * very * cheezy (like Deja's death, it's all finally destroyed, 'impact!' Effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But the player was generally on the line. Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (Buffy can act), Michael Rapaport (though I'm really romantic and beautiful after cracking) <strong> Jennifer Connelly was flat; Although it was not entirely his fault, the role was stereotypical and of one size. Generic high degree. And Tyra Banks, who is a role, was not a strange thing. He was confused, confused and confused. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a noisy movie! Amazing! Wow! An incredible soundtrack that suits your movie as a glove (it's definitely worth it!). Each scene has a double song (although Tori Amos started the song * although it really ends me ... it's not the best thing to do). Liz Phair, Rage Against Machine, Ice Cube ... How can one go wrong? <br /> <br /> All: A really good watch, really strong cast, great script, great movie. 8/10.
