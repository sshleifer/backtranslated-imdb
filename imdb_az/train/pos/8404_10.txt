A simple but thought-out driving film is a simple but thought-provoking school-leaved "ballroom" with the desire to have the world's best quality valve. <br /> <br /> Bobby, the hero, has all the savings to gain the means of his dreams. Sharing and sharing the love with girls quickly, Bobby stayed in the local pizza shop, but so much responsibility, danger and heartache find such a mechanical miracle. <br /> <br /> Van is a sinful pleasure. It holds the mood of the rest of the rest of the mid-70's and has a fairly unusual humor to put it in the category of "good evil."
