Since I was 4 years old, I've been a Indian movie belt, but in my life I never watched such a moving and effective movie, especially an Indian film. Over the last few years, I stopped watching modern Indian films and came back to watch classics (Teesi Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Ana India, Sholay and others). But this movie has changed everything. It's one of the best films I've ever seen. I noticed that not only to act, but also to be a very educated person in America who grew up in the first generation of Indian women. It helped me to understand my family history, and it was always a very wise thing to me. But I realized that it was "seeing", helping to feel and to sincerely share the generations before me and the struggle of the Indian people. The film has helped me put a lot of things in perspective, especially given the current world events. I did not think that a movie could change in the way I thought it was ... it did. The area is fantastic, moving perfectly and the direction is flawless. Two heads to finger!
