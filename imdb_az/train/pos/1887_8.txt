Arthur is a middle-aged child, drinking like a fish. Arthur feels herself and wants to go into his mind. She wants to boast of her richness and she knows that she is a damned brat. He spends money on people he does not know and considers everything funny. <br /> <br /> Arthur should marry a high-level girl to inherit a great fate, but she is in love with a poor waitress, Liza Minnelli (which is really strange). <br /> <br /> This damn funny movie. I watched this movie because the very popular Indian film "Sharabee" is based on Arthur's character. Although Sharabee is inspired by the absolute Artur, they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. Sometimes a lot of time. The movie has a very fantastic liner. It's not a heroic protest, but some fantastic moments. My favorite scene talks about the mourning of Arthur's fianc√© and the "moose". Daddley Moore has a funny time. It is very good with words and body language. I liked a few children sitting in a hotel about a small country and talking to the couple in two different directions. John Gielgud took Oscar for this movie. I do not know that actor. I do not think it's a big deal, but I may have been watching more of what I have agreed in the future. The film has flat slopes, but it's not too long. look forward to watching.
