Gundam Wing is a good anime to me. A little slow motion (especially in the middle of the series), but everyone likes it. Now, after jumping into my job and calling me a "coup", I will admit that I watched the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> There were several problems explaining the story, and a few characters might appear to be rip-offs (ie Gundam's Cache Zechs Marquise), but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series, <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series, first make sure you watch the original Gundam and then watch the AU series watch.
