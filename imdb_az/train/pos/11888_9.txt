It was very heart-warming. As a refugee French, I particularly enjoyed this "TV" movie and I think it deserves to be widespread. The player was good and the relationship between each member of the peasant French family seemed so strong and very natural. No doubt, a great film about family concept and homosexuality and AIDS participation. One of the strongest sides of the film is the privileged relationship between the youngest son (Leo) who has contracted with HIV and his younger son, Marcel, who is trying to hide the rest of the family. Both characters gradually study each other because Leo is not ready to spend the rest of his life on medication.
