I think this movie has a bit of a rating because it's the worst case ever. There is a diarrhea of ​​jokes and embarrassing walnut scorpions, but in spite of this, it really lasts for a few minutes. Jason Lee performs some delicate comedy in this movie, and Julia Stiles manages self-censorship. At the same time, this movie acts as the most romantic comedies, and you know how it ends after about 40 minutes. (More than +/- 5 minutes better than what you know). Anyway, watching movies better is not necessarily the worst option ... It's strange
