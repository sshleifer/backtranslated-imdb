Super Speedway is a great demo of the new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAX camera races you in the race at the Grand Prix, reminiscent of the driving sequence (just on the DVD!). <br /> <br /> Only negative and why I did not give it to him 10, part of the driving sequence is to look suspiciously as the film is accelerating. Soundtrack also requires a bit of blasphemy - a real car is not the engine to hear. When entering the bridges, you will not hear the reptiles.
