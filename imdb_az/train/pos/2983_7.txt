BASEketball is really a very funny movie. David Zucker drives us to laugh others again, really clever but often clever, comedy. <br /> <br /> Two of South Park's creators, one of the main actors of this film, are playing very well. it's really amazing, but for the first time I see them as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a good and funny movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Sound: 7.5 for 10 years.
