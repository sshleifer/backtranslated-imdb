I'm a great admirer of the Faerie Tale Theater, and I've seen them all, and that's the best! It's funny, romantic and classic. I recommend this for all ages. Good for Cats, because it is good for Cinderella, because it is great for adults and teens, because it's funny and not over. When I was little I was watching and watching. My family and I have great lines that always quote. Acting is great and will never be old. If you love tales and romances, you will love it. I have watched a lot of Cinderella films in my time, and all of them are the best. (Sorry Disney) I present this movie and the entire Faerie Tale Theater. All this applies to all ages, and all of these are unique and entertaining.
