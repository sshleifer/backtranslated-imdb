The world of Dragon Hunters challenges a 3D gravity world. Planetoids, building blocks and strange flat plants travel around the atmosphere, most of the characters remain in space and do not appear anywhere. <br /> <br /> A world that remembers Neverending Story when nothing is to eat the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This time it is a great skeleton drum with hot eyes. Heroes are a huge, but taciturn fighter, with a double-entrepreneurial side and an annoying and greedy sidekick, who manages an bizarre animal. <br /> <br /> The most talked little girl in the world joins them, and I do not die early in my life with a terrible pain and hopefully. <br /> <br /> Animation is great. Sounds and sounds are top bumps. An extremely bad one is as simple as you can possibly imagine. The world went to stop the Gobbler, they reached him immediately and they were defeated. Last. There are no real character development or story corners <br /> <br /> They do not want to shoot a movie together with their spouse. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: something cute to watch, children can suppose it, but about it. There is no depth in this world.
