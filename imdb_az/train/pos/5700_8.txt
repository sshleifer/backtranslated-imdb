I read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got the opportunity to see it on DVD. To be honest I did not really know what this problem was. <br /> <br /> A decent crime pointed out in different ways, including trilini, often with potential killers / suspects, including the late porn king John Holmes. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers went to this movie to give the lowest rating for violence, but it was one of the best in the film. I really do not see it. Many modern films have become even worse - Ryan Ryan thinks that this film was more violent than ever before, and it is often more than a pitiful death, based on real bloody stains (the murders described in this film end with lead pipes). <br /> <br /> I was delighted with the half of the movie - showing that John Holmes was a desperate cash drug addict, and that there was a small conspiracy on the second half of the barren blood lake. <br /> <br /> Although Dylan McDorant looks a little bit more in biker-esque personality and bad boy in the past, the film has excellent performance. The soundtrack was also beautiful - 70's B-rock and rock pop were spread throughout Boogie Nights for a few hours all the time.
