Recently, I found a $ 5 picture in a video store and was eagerly waiting for it. If the music and (obviously) graphics do not fit the standards of my favorite series, I still welcome one of the segments except Mind's Eye: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella "Breaking the Ice". Music is brilliant and feels real. Unfortunately, there is no story or music in the Odyssey video clip.
