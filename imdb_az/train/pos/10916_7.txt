The funny feast between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murderous murder, one of the most strange and challenging areas. Powell is probably the most urgent detective in the 30's and Arthur has a unique voice that sounds like a sequence of smaller calls frequently. They are extremely entertaining to watch, so take the horror of the plot with a salt grains and enjoy it just to see it. <br /> <br /> Powell's contract with the MGM was a point that allowed him to refuse to grant a loan to another studio, but he wanted to re-work with Arthur, and he wrote the scenario, and he impatiently accepted the assignment. They worked together in Paramount, Canary Murder Case, Greene Murder Case, and Philo Vance series in 1929.
