This film was well remembered after Tom and Jerry signed a peace agreement. Things are idyllic for a while, but maybe it's boiling. Perhaps the most memorable moment was an infinite struggle that started with a pipe, a frying pan, and a baseball bat, with two plusch dogs running at the start and end of the dog. I loved a band and tried to keep it in the Cartoon Network.
