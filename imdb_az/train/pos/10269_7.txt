In the spirit of classic "The Sting," this movie really hits it in a hurry ... in its heart! A premium, hungry for adventure, the appropriate female psychiatrist, scoundrals meet with the most dirty and rotten. A sensitive doctor falls into the evil man of his career and is involved in his work. Although the film moves "slowly", the tip and the end is confounded! How do you like, in particular, the doctor's "self-esteem"!
