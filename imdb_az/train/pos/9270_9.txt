I should note that before I read this review, I would not make such a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something, I hope that I'm generally against politicians <br /> <br /> This film is not in Iran see IMDb trivia for the movie). Which is a shame because the movie is great. For Grbavica, this film will be won in the framework of the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> Of course, if it falls to the second place. Why? Because a film about pressure. Even this is not a complete woman problem. The government is trying to keep people down. The government's image is a similarity to what it thinks it should be forbidden. But prohibiting anything can not be resolved and / or destroy this movie! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a great summary: "Comedy about tragedy", this is a good result!
