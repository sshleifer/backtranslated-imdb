Dr. Feinstone was a dentist. There is a great home with a beautiful spouse and a pool. Strongly revealing that his wife is meeting with pool workers - he sees that everything is clean and rotten. ... Corbin Bernstein is as bright as a dentist - totally convincing. Surprisingly, torture scenes are incredibly bad and strange. It is recommended that you consider the Dentist 2!
