Who knew? Dowdy Queen Victoria, a full-fledged Monarchy, 40 years after her husband, Prince Albert's death, had a dramatic, dramatic, and intriguing life. "Young Victoria" writes the novel of the young Queen with her kin-to-be, but also reflects the political motive behind her rise to the throne. After the death of Victorian Duke in 1820, a year after Victoria's birth, the Duchess of Kent finally succeeded, as the old Army Officer John Conroy, the widow and her doll's queen, Conroy argued that Victoria was called a "Kensington system" to prevent contact with other children when growing up. <br /> <br /> < <BR> <BR> <BR> Besides, Victoria had to sleep on her mother's bedroom on a daily basis, stayed until the queen. <br /> <br /> In the film, in 1830, Victoria's mother the Regency Act, which had settled down on the throne of the Victorian Empire, was still in a minor situation, during which time Duchess and Conroy sought to frighten the innocent prince, and demanded that his secretary and treasurer Conroeux sign documents. Victoria would not have any of these, and she refused to go along with Conroy and her mother's bad plans. The camp accepted the Queen as a betrayer who disregarded Monarchy without loving Williams; The king's camp felt disrespectful of his wife. As a result, Duchess tried to limit her relationship with Victoria. At a scene that really happened in history, the King gave Duchess a birthday party and said that after reaching 18, Victoria's goal was to live until her mother was lazy. Victoria Victoria kept her promise and died shortly after winning the right to join the throne of Victoria. Victoria Conroy's revenge on her mother for her support, also blamed her child for being so sad. Both were sent to a lonely apartment in Buckingham Palace and had little contact with Victoria's mother for several years. <br /> <br /> 'Young Victoria' expresses the excitement and nobility surrounding the Victorian ceremony, as Victorian Hero. . A good part of the film is merely a relationship with Lord Melbourne, Prime Minister of the Vigar Party, which, unfortunately, is less than the film. First of all Melbourne earns the trust of the young Queen and becomes a good friend. In the early years of his rule, Melbourne has seen progressively, but later he loses respect and, when it appears to be a typical politician, conceals his respect for the masses who intend to hold the championship. In fact, Melbourne was more than a father for Victoria, but the film points to a sexual tension between prime minister and prince Albert, as is the romantic rivals. <br /> <br /> The region is getting tougher when Melbourne is hit, as the new prime minister, Sir Robert Peel, should be awarded a more conservative Tory party. The film notes the events of Bedchamber Crisis, which Peelin resigned after declining Victoria's Bedchamber women to replace Tory's politicians with their spouses. The film leaves another scandal in Lady Hastings, one of Duchess's women, who is accused of interacting with John Conroy and being pregnant with her. Because he hates Conroy, Victoria has helped spread rumors about Hastings's alleged pregnancy. As it turned out, Hastings was only pregnant, and it was actually a stomach ulcer. <br /> <br /> Viktoria's inexperience shows at Bedchamber Crisis, but the film's screenwriters do not see the more inadequate aspects of her character, as proven by Hastings Affair. <br /> <br /> The rest of the "Young Victoria" - of course - romance between Queen and Prince Albert. As Victoria wanted to adapt his role as a new ruler, Albert was waiting for the movie. <br /> <br /> Albert and Prince Philip find a great deal of parallels, because Albert returned to England and gave Victoria support. , the moth of the current queen. Although Philip was originally from Denmark, he went to school in Germany and had German rooted resources. Both Albert and Philip have done their job to make the mark on the Court (Albert has a great scene that has uncovered a table for King George III, even though his servants are still killed!). The struggle of Albert was the same as for the Philistines of the Monarchs, and they had to find something. Both Albert and Philip joined to various civil projects and proved that they could not live in the shadow of their ever-standing friends. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is a beautiful scene toward the end of the film. Albert Victoria was angry about his work as "interference." Albert, secondly, does not want 'Bedchamber Crisis', because he is the husband of his wife and covers Victoria's hostel ladies. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> When talking to Albert, Victorian, when an assassin shoots them down almost (Albert's gun shot in the film, but it never happened!). <br /> <br /> Principles, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friendly. Young Victoria suddenly ends up, and closure loans are largely dependent on hagiography (not talking about Victoria's depression after Albert's death). But 'Victoria' is still an interesting drama and an interesting history lesson.
