This high-definition movie movie (in me) is about what's good stories in a movie. Kasdan searches for meaning in our lives and puts everyone to see and do miracles. The film distributes the people created to isolate people from violence, hatred, and philosophy of daytime life. <br /> <br /> We ask the question after the question of life. Davis (a big beard with Steve Martin) asks himself: 'Does he use a violent film (and our expanding) that causes violence in society?' Claire "Why does the world throw a precious thing like a human life?" She asks. Mack does not have immunity as he asks, "Is it possible to move beyond the limits of second and get funding (even more difficult)? Of course, not the film, but not the others, asks questions and be honest <br / > The nature of life is that we endeavor to find answers to all the questions that we will never endure, and in some cases we need to answer our own needs and desires, and people can answer the questions that we can not answer: some answers are true Claire and Mack Although they take the easy way, the state takes care of their babies, although Davis "sees the light" and decides not to do violent films, but the next day he turns around and rejects his epiphany with his art. <br / <br /> All this has been answered This film does not respond to them, it just reminds you that they are looking for you
