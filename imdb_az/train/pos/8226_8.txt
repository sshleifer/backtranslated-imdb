We talk about a down-budget movie and have some weaknesses (obviously: no spoiler: sudden explosives expert and senseless alcohol); but generally the story is of interest to you, most of the characters are likable and have some original circumstances. <br /> <br /> I love some of the people who do not want you to believe in me and then do not want to tilt and make an effort ... I welcome this. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see the movie "Nueve Reinas" from Argentina.
