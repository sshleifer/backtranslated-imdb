After seeing a terrible, terrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAD END I knew I would not see the moment I heard it. <br /> <br /> Clicking on the game to see the dreams, I thought it was a bad bangard film that tried to bring a new depth to a distant character. <br /> <br /> <strong> WORLD'S BEST WAY TO USE BATMAN: DEAD END, and then some. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next shortest!
