Surprisingly good movie! There are very good jokes from the whole movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes come out to show how stupid the two main characters are. We have deceived him, be with the foolish blond! <br /> <br /> The territory is just called "dark". And boobies always offer two black-haired women acting as part of two line blondes and a bad counter, even though some strange reason for the movie is not too much to play with this card. <br /> <br /> That's all, watching a good movie. I gave almost 8/10, but not the bride.
