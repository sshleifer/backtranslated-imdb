The description of this movie can not be unusual, but the film is really special, its symbols (and, of course, the actors who played them!). I will not go into details of the movie, but do you want to say that? This movie is not just for everyone! The film is really virtuoso and it should be equally gentle to get it all. If you do not warn for a second, you probably will not lose one of the finest points. As for John Cusack actors, his multilateral role (along with the writer and the producer) ) played very effectively and played his character? Hauser, heartfelt killer? exquisite Cusack played a similar role before Grosse Pointe Blank, but his comic position in the film was simply superior. <br /> <br /> But the actress, who stole the whole show, is Hilary Duff! I've always been a great fan of Mrs. Duff. But I have to be honest when I hear about the role I play in the movie I was a little disappointed. But after watching the film, she was respected as an actress who was frustrated. Let's see this! The child grows up, but yes, his talent! All critics who have not lost Hilary's ability to act will be silenced for a while. Hilary was forced to play a really sophisticated character? Outside the tough, yet cute baby inside? and he just did justice. He makes you laugh and he cries for you? To shorten the long story ('I can go through it with pain'), BRILLIANT! Marisa Tomei and Joan Cusack also did a good job. Especially Joan's hysterics are amazed! But Ben Kingsley was very disappointed with the small role he played, and his performance seemed unbearable. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, War, Inc., with its clever humor, keeps you in your fingertips and is just in the right amount of space. I'll recommend all to this movie (and more to Hilary Duff fans)! P.S. - The film will be released shortly before being released in other places.
