Mahatma is described as a man who neglected his son in this movie. Do not make me wrong, condemn the film; This is a beautiful movie and I walked in my throat for a while. We must understand Mahatma's spiritual position, a true spiritual leader. Only the person who is fully understood can probably leave his loved ones. Such a caliber person takes the example of his family and followers. According to the film, he talked to his son and tried to figure out where he came from, but Harvallah, who was so poor, could not understand his father. Wrong things happened with Harilall, Mahatma remained calm and agreed that her son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If there were no other parent, she would have paid the price to help her get up. Mahatma did not do this, she is a true leader.
