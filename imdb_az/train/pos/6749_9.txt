Otto Preminger's spectacular, noisy film is Noir's charm that has intricate intentions, betraying the flawless nature of the embarrassing central character still living in the shadow of his aggressive father. Dana Andrews' accusation, the vindictive police are shown as an outsider, irrational and destructive, perhaps maybe able to change it, so she may have found a good woman. A terrible person restores himself with a modest impression. The story of anxiety, permanently in the last half of the story by Ben Ben Hecht, reverberates in Andrews' s tense performance, as the Preminger saturates in a proper style. We do not see the city at night and we do not hear; we feel it, because Preminger allows us to see and hear even the most peripheral and remote factors. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is a complex character that begins with her ghost darkness and hate it all the time. <br /> <br /> As politically developed, she has been secretly involved in situational traps, but she is updated with foreign affairs that may appear in vintage noir's protagonist's visceral facial expressions before executing them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> rational resistance, professionalism and ethical constraints are still a good cop. The Prettygger is satisfied with explaining the public-conscience drama about a disrupted community in a widespread urban area, but on the other hand, by continuing the sliding on Andrews's shoulders, he travels with the existence of individual ideas about a person with an Oedipal fix, which is always associated with <br /> <br / Companies that produced in the early 1950s faced a social-problem problem, and seemed to be more "low-budget, low-risk enthusiasts," an attempt to escape critical conservative critics and social workplaces. However, there is an expressive issue in Premer's refuting approach. Each floor is a ground-based one for a plot with a sense of drama. Each supportive character must do its part in doing something interesting, but none of these are animated films or exciting comic reliefs. According to him, every character is considered as a star of Karl Malden's direct speech police inspector and self-confirmation as a veteran waiter over a lunch. The advanced Andrews and Gene Tierney, as well as the unsuccessful attempts to destroy their unwanted intensity, are suggesting.
