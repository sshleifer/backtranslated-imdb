In the historical drama and the new civil war, a story about age came from New Orleans, colorful men. Starts slowly after the start, but when it comes to the main characters and when the real activity begins, it gets steam. This is not a story about the exploitation of black women, because these people were free. They did not have all the rights of the whites, but, of course, they had more power over their ancestors than their ancestors. Young men and women in this story need to make their choices about how to live their lives to give the system immorality or to live a good life and contribute to society. I enjoyed all the characters, but my darling was Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
