Istanbul, which has no masterpieces and is the best of Errol Flynn, still has a lot to do. Places and fine-tech graphic cinematography return us to the rest of the time. Errol Flynn shows the moments of past glory and comes back to follow him as a former pilot, Jim Brennan. The picture is actually the reconstruction of Singapore in 1947, and this story looks stunning and sticky in line with today's standards. Most supporters also seem to be "just passing through." Many people have compared it to CASABLANCA, one of the greatest adults of all time. While watching the film, I could see many similarities, but hey, Casablanca inspired countless imitators, so value it. Or, if you are an admirer of Flynn or old fashioned love stories, you may want to give a look to this movie. Otherwise, I would represent Casablanca or Malta Shahin as a good introduction to some Hollywood classics ....
