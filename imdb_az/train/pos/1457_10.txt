I watched this documentary twice - and despite having a big movie scene, most documentary films are not my focus. But this movie was astonishing. <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is wonderful, and I do not allow myself to praise it. Mardi Gras beads - who thought? <br /> <br /> Filmmaking of a Chinese factory feels like it's actually. <br /> <br /> I am aware of politics. Since I read a few books on globalization, I was not surprised at this movie. But that made me think. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I wish everyone could see it.
