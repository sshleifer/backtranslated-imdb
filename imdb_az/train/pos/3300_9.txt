Pakeeza has a very interesting history (written in the "Trivia" section). <br /> <br /> It looks like Kemal Amrohi (director) made a conspiracy to test after launching a metaphor, metaphor, poetry and visual character. As a result, the intensity of emotions can not be very realistic but very effective and reachable to the audience. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari, Nargis and Sahib Jaan live in his tragedy. Other stars of the film are Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). <br /> <br /> Peykeza is classic in world cinema. Each time you re-look, the new layers show you. Kemal Amrohi is one of the rare tales cinema poets, and he gave us a gift.
