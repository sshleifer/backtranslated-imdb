Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryandan could have been humble and modest in the hands of smaller actors. However, with two experienced heroes on the road, I found the most interesting and happy little mystery "Silent Anger." You may feel that Colbert has some kind of assault against him when he claims that he is already married and that he has been abused by a stranger who says he is the best person in the marriage. Colbert, Ryan and her lawyer are welcomed with more evidence that appears to reinforce the claim that they have already been there each time, as they have set out to give up allegations of aliens prematurely. It is not difficult to understand who the main baddie is, though the intensity and tempo of the story continues to grow. In general, a good, solid mystery movie with beautiful performances by two leading actors and a wonderful support that often involves unsound Paul Kelly.
