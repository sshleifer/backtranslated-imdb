The La Maman et la Putain movie should also be viewed as a movie (post-68) and in many ways endlessly. True, actors do not "act" ... True, they speak so much ... But conversations are the cause of life ... or to die. A very long monologue by Françoise Lebrune is perhaps the most accurate and moving text ever written about feminine, man, and love. Proper translation is not easy. This film is a commentary on the difficulty of being a man or a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud, is one of the greatest French actors.
