When this movie was released, I liked it and still keep going, because the story is generally hoped, and people are also ... One of the things I like about Lawrence Kasdan's films. Apart from the positive vibe of the movie, there are other reasons, such as Grand Canyon. There's a great cast for something ... For example Kevin Kline and Danny Glover. In my opinion, Crash, the Oscar-winning high-definition movie for the best picture, was very similar to this movie. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. The crash contradicts me; it was very dark. I'll choose Grand Canyon every day with Crash.
