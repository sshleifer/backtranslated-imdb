This is one of the few films that are very pornographic, though not only a very rudimentary structure. There is no live sound or dialogue; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br / I can fully understand that no one is trying to do so. There is such a thing now. That's it. :-) <br /> <br /> NOTE: The manufacturer has no right to distribute the DVD version. I never saw that I was never sold anywhere; send a letter to Mr. Borner and order a copy of the VHS.
