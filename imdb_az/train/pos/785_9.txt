One of the Irish roots, who loved this movie, was a warm and honest person, warm and funny. I loved my daughter too, she was beautiful. They were such a cute couple. The end was very sad. I love this movie! Although it's a bit dirty, it resembles an English or Irish General version. If you love this film, you should look at the prime minister. The same story line falls for the young boy adult, the old woman falls on the young man. If there are many ways, the best decision or task will be over. You do not have to say anything without destroying the whole movie, I thought the French man was ugly, but less attractive to me. Umm ... If you love Irish movies, I also recommend "Friends Circle", this movie is very good. A quick quote can be obtained if you do not watch it "well, my food is gone." LOL
