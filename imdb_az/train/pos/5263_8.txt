Netflix should note this brief feature in silk socks. Generally, it is superior to long-term consumption. It was better Cole Porter songs and more energy. Silk socks were a great disappointment. Fred would be too old for such things, though dances and Cyd are beautiful. I will follow the Ninotchka's Garbo - Melvyn Douglas version. Peter Lorre was ill during the production of Silk Stockings - is he more passive with more active numbers and less lines? I am so glad to have run between Paree-Paree and Pase. She likes the whole experience more. Bob Hope is pure joy, like a simple "song and dance man".
