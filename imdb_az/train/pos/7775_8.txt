In another category, this category is different. This story of a family with a few real skeletons in the cupboard is still clean, sometimes a fun-going thing. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the problematic Hadley brothers, and they really took part and fled with them. Malone has won an Oscars and has been nominated for Stack-supported categories, but also respected ones are well worth the effort. They balance a little mild potential. Bacall and Hudson could not be called the worst actors, but both had good parts and played more convincingly than they did. It's hard for me to accept that Rock Hudson plays red-haired heterosexuals as it is here, but it's more than anything else. But it does not go away from the overall entertainment value of the movie, which is also important, and this movie is very beautiful. If you're a little late and I'm going to explain this movie. It's worth it.
