WWE has released some of its worst payouts in the past few months. Cyber ​​Sunday, Survivor Series, and December were not the most terrible words, and similar B brand trusts Smackdown! try to finish the year with high scores. Armageddon had two main gimmick matches for the Last Ride and Inferno matches, sold to three championships, and became an interesting event in the form of a stacked team fight with King Booker and Finlay against Batista and John Cena. However, this was not a match of the night, but now one of Teddy Long's championship matches, which brought one year's match to the fans when they presented early Monday. <br /> <br /> T-Lo changed the WWE Tag Team Championship match to four teams including the Champions, London and Kendrik to Regal and Taylor, including MNM and The Hardy Boyz. <br /> <br /> I do not want to talk about it I can just say that I can not say a lot in the competition. It should be seen as a faith. There were many high dots and more pitiful bumps and giant landings. I have to talk about it, but Joey took Mercury directly to the ambulance room through the competition. Jeff Hardy jumped onto a ladder on the ground, holding Matt Hardy and the MNM members in the opposite side to take full force. Unfortunately, Mercury had no hands to protect her face, and the stairs led her full strength and left eye to the nose. That was bad. Her face was immediately a mixture of everyone, and it is not surprising that it ended the Mercury early. Then we saw that the broken nose cut off from the child and under the left eye. Be warned. This is not for the weakness of your heart. The end of a game for this royal coaster Paul was able to hold the championship belts for the London victory. Wrestling has been watching for nearly 15 years and I can not get a better result than this match. It's incredible. <br /> <br /> The night was opened only with the fourth Inferno game. Kane took MVP in a good match, but not entirely about vision and action. For both opponents, there were several close calls to the flames, but in the end they were Kane after they had left MVP after flames and both had gone beyond the ring. When the MVP fired around the cage, he ran around the ring and laughed after watching, he had a patient part. Can I offer Michael Hayes to come out next week at Smackdown? <br /> <br /> Last Ride game between Mr. Kennedy and The Undertaker was played in the second game of the night and the second match of the three main events. It was a tough match from beginning to end and it was the best of the arcade, and Undertaker and Kennedy were not there yet. Used pillars, chairs and a scene, the 15-meter concrete pad thrown from Armageddon put it on a concrete floor. Unfortunately, it was not an accident, and the meeting did not open it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero by introducing another tough match. This was a very good bout with Benoit, who once shot 8 German suplexes at Chawo. Benoit also thought Vikki Guerrero to put a heavy machine gun. Fortunately she came to her senses and left her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and Jimmy Wang Yang. Many high-flying and dangerous spots outside of the ring, this was a game worthy of the crowd. Richmond, JBL, Virginia, was angered by the fans, and at one point they even began to rush into a rush. Helms took Duke after a jawbreaker type maneuver with his knees Smackdowns! <br /> <br /> Boogeyman has put Miz in a worthless match. I hate Boogeyman with a passion. JBL needs to listen only to Miz talk. JBL comedy is golden. <br /> <br /> The main event of the night's last game was 3. World heavyweight champion, Batista and WWE champion, John Cena Finlay and the Champions Champion King Booker met to attend. . At the beginning of the match, Tag Team did not get anywhere in the championship match, but did not give weight to anyone. If added five to ten minutes, the match would be more memorable, but this time I said several times with WWE this year's matches. <br /> <br /> So, in 2006, WWE's payment terms expired. A terrific note that began with the New Year's Revolution of the year began, but with Armageddon ended up in a high way. This Ladder match will be remembered for a long time as one of the biggest ladder matches. Shapkam is far from all eight opponents, but his body must give hell to fans over a line.
