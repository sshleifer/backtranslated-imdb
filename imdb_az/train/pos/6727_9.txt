A few days ago, I realized that I was putting words into words under the title of creators of this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is not about the "fast giants" movement but on the contrary, it is to change people's attention to the giants of sport, the Riddington giants. <br /> <br /> One block in my teens Kama, one of the world's most challenging and best bodysurf spots. I was in the 15 to 18 foot surfing, and in most cases I was scratched by 10 and 12 foot waves and shot. Why is this experience full of fear of surfers in this movie? Jeff Clark may have caused Maverick to shift more than ten thousand by HIMSELF, even though all images are a normal fatality. The first safety precaution of any water sport is "never surfing / diving / swimming yourself". The wise men went where they were, and lived to talk about it. When the water is 75 degrees and sharks, I will not go there. <br /> <br /> In the world of light water: The first weights of the waves in Jaws always give me a skin tone over my entire body. These are not just awe-inspiring waves, they are uncontrolled, gut-emptying waves. Laird Hamilton did not live just like a 40-60 foot wave (which can not complicate these numbers), but blasted Rinconda as a fun day. There is a great deal of devotion and attention to the great wave shooters that all around the world compare. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. Because I did not want to note that they were big big wave shooters outside the Hamilton / Kalama crew, I gave only 9 out of 10 and they celebrated it. Log cabins at the edge of Ken Bradshaw and this Splice at 10!
