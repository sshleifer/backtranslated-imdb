"Vanilla Sky" was a well thought-out movie. On the contrary, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched a movie late in the night and saw an excitement for the future. I'm not disappointed. As for the end of the movie, I love you. I could not think of it. The whole idea of ​​this was far from me. The latter was more surprising than Shyamala could do. The field line also kept me interested and exciting. Casting is superior. It was a beautiful movie around. The type of movie is still watching again and you can always find something new. I've seen four or five times and always find something new. This is a movie that will appeal to eternity.
