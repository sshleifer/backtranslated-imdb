Somehow, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg in shredding machine? Whoopi zanked tranquilizers? Whoopi like Blind Lemon, who imitates the miracle Jagger? There are big moments about film capturing, but the movie still sucks some sort, right? I feel like "Rich in Love". One person first hear his wife. Future youths talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice-cream from the bucket and is in perfect harmony with his wife who is not in another area. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his functioning wardrobe. But here's a whisper of a field and wait for it to be transported. Only when the former Go-Go's sounds a great pop song by Charlotte Caffey's The Graces ... and then it's over! <br /> This picture is a lazy summer day's agenda!
