Fred Astaire is a duet with a smoky day and a few other dances, with unhappy Joan Fontaine. Astaire sees the "scene" dance better in comparison with Ginger Rogers before learning about the full potential of the film's potential. The best thing is that Burns and Allen are the first to watch a comedy career in the radio / television comedy, they see the kind of dance that they have in their area and have not been able to give Paramount College films in the 30s. . (George was once a tap dance instructor). Together with Fred, it is worth the high points of the two films and is worth the wait. The first soft shoe trio is a warm up for a charming carnival number for the "Chin up". Here are three rides and other dance places and dances. It looks almost spontaneous. Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen have to push under the "area". I've seen this 4 or 5 times and find the fast forward button useful.
