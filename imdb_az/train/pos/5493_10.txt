It's rare that you've got an inner look in a media misleading, widespread as the official "truth," and downtaking many news agencies with pants. This film, in my opinion, is worth every price in journalism - objective (yes!), Brave and real "trash". Everyone, including the call, begins to fool themselves with their words. Filmmakers needed to keep watching "only" events and shooting their cameras. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite tells us how to throw a president and sell it as a victory for democracy. They were finally lost - so far. As we know, the largest television station has canceled the license only, yet it is still broadcast via cable and satellite. I doubt that George W. or Barack Obama would be tolerant after a coup attempt. <br /> <br /> As Chavez 's supporters have repeatedly denied the scams that they have shot at innocent civilians, the media has actually been more or have been more than just "free". <br /> <br /> If the famous "objectivity" square always gives rise to unwanted facts or blames it, "us" - spreading the secret history of the United States to the world or the war in Iraq, Johns Hopkins to mention the 60,000 Afghans (2003) who had been killed by 1.3 million Iraqis. Saddam Hussein was less harmful to his people than the US in order to be objective. <br /> <br /> According to the US embassy in Iran, the United States has joined us in supporting and teaching Paul Pot's guerrillas in the '80s. Probably not. <br /> <br /> Cause more independent media to avoid scams for balancing.
