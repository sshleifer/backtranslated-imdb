An incredibly little English movie for many reasons. First, Laurence Olivier in a light comedy is a rare appearance. If his performance was not standard, he would have been regarded as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, as a hoodwinked barrister, completely convincing. Historically, this film has a great interest in both time and place. Being British did not have a large budget of the Hollywood movies of the same time, but it is more interesting that this film shows only a UK that was shot before the war and soon to go. Today, when we look at modern morals and thinking, we think that this film and its most recent American part - "One night" - was described as "Fatal Instinct" on the agenda. But watching this movie and looking at it today for the first time after tasting, I can not help but feel sorrow. Before 1950, half of the filming was a difficult choice to save the rest of the film, and, unfortunately, such films are often transferred to keep the films we care about. Color change, lack of contrast and poor quality of the typical diarrhea are heart failure. This movie is not a dual feature, perfect for a good evening or a cool underneath blankets, as well as a movie that features a "Night Out" movie.
