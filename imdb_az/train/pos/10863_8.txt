First, it is wrong to say that watching the election films is a mistake. Unfortunately, after seeing election 2, the election looks a little frustration. Both gangster epics in the movie. While the choice is part of an unpleasant movie, it is not as good as it was later. <br /> <br /> During the first election period, we have two opponents to the president; Big D and Lok. After discussing a few scenes of who will be the head of "Dai", they (in almost unanimity) will manage the Lok (Simon Yam) Triads. It is not enough to say that this opponent will not go too far with Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and will not affect capture, Big D misses two of his uncle to take the ballot to the side. It has catastrophic results and leads the entire triangle to war. Lok decided to chair, but will not be officially formulated until he ends with Dragon Head Baton, the material representation of the president's government. <br /> <br /> The prime minister, Chung Wang, hid the batons in the mainland of China and saw who could regain the race first. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is Baton. Both the leaders wanted to do so, as well as the police and the opponents, to be one of the scenes chosen in this selection, which is called Jet (Nick Cheung), a machete and many bad guys. The presence of Nick Cheung focuses on minimalism ... I think that director Johhnie To be the second choice, I think he would be affected in any way, because he later introduced the character of Jet. <br /> <br /> Although Nick Cheung gives the performance scene scene, I should not give it to the rest of the actors in the movie. The selection has a great ensemble with both delicate and impressive performances. Simon Yam is usually his glorious self-esteem, and the film benefits from heavyweight HK actors, such as Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai, and unworthy Suet Lam. <br /> <br /> There was no weak relationship in the movement, and they believed they could easily follow the real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performance is great, one of the most effective things about the election is the Johnnie To eye camera. There are some really striking shots in the film, and the viewer is definitely aware of a number of innovative and very striking cameras, as it is treated with shots and angles. <br /> <br /> <strong> The election declaration is, first and foremost, a great film. <br /> <br /> My film-related issues are mainly due to the fact that the characters who are present in the election are not cut off. It's a bit difficult to watch the movie because the movie is full of symbols that are not part of the plot. Finally, although it decides to focus more on the two candidates, the first election electoral process is sold entirely to Uncle, the basement and the police. Perhaps the film would work better if the film was longer with Triad's internal work, or if director Johnnie To drop and explain more details. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line - All this is a terrific movie with a huge cast, a great hit and a pace that speeds up. This should be a bit more complicated.
