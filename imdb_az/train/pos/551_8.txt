From the west to the fourth Anthony Mann, with James Stewart, it covers a tough plant-bust, Jeff Webster, from Wyoming, Alaska to Seattle. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> But first, he must face Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), who manipulates the footpaths, the railroad captains and the coyote's enthusiasm, who do not believe in the future that Jeff believed he could be a valuable ally. That is why the captain hides him in the boat if he is looking for a dead end of a trail. <br /> <br /> Jeff also runs the creeping Judge Gannon (John McIntire), Skagway, Alaska. Gannon lost his city because he had fled the city to the city and disobeyed the public. He penalizes Jeff's possessions and Jeff just eats strange things. <br /> <br /> Besides, Jeff is heading to Dawson for Ronda in order to supply him. But this is just an excuse, because Jeff, Ben and Rube will return to Skagway and take back their livestock. <br /> <br /> Judge Gannon talks about this and is right behind, but Jeff is delayed by a rifle when Jeff Gannon competes with the Canadian cattle on the border. <br /> <br /> Skagway's men from another avalanche and another shot finally reach Dawson because Jeff sells his animals to the highest bid, only in Ronda, and then builds a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes the money and starts claiming himself and beginning to panning for gold. <br /> <br /> Judge Gannon goes to Dawson to take the golden action there, and says Jeff has earned a little bit with Skagway and wants to try his luck at Klondike. It also involves bringing some employers and forcibly stealing claims from other miners. Now, Jeff and Ben, feel that Rouben is taking time to make it difficult for Gannon to force himself to wait for himself as the most vulnerable sheriff. <br /> <br /> They just go back, because Gannon's men have found the bad things, so I made a mistake to open her mouth. I'm killed and Jeff is severely injured, but Judge Gannon does not rescue his son. The attack on Dawson Street in the Dolby Street is very happy. The first Jeff killed two of Gannon's best victims, Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie. Then, as Ronda went to warn Jeff that she was trying to slip behind Gannon, Gannon hit him behind, and she survived Jeff's weapons. Jeff Gannon kills him for sitting on a wooden sidewalk. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> Universal DVD uses a pan and scanning diameter instead of a large-screen TCM, beyond me.
