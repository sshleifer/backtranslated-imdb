Many of the user comments I've seen on this IMDB for this movie really do not justify it. Above all, I just say that this movie is not taken seriously. But you need to have a fun, but stupid movie that does not need to think. That's why you're disappointed if you're watching this movie in a movie or a humorous masterpiece. But if you want to watch a short film with some talented actors / actresses and some good passionate expressions, then you love it.
