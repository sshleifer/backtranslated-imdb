I liked this movie for my whole life. It's such an intelligent story, with plenty of classic alusions. for example. Ten years ago, the missing ship was called Bellerophon. Yes, in classical mythology it was the man who killed two or more living beings, Chimera, a legendary animal. At FP, Walter Pidgeon is obviously a chemistry and its id monster. <br /> <br /> Unlike the most up-to-date blockbusters that writers spend around $ 150 million on special effects, I love the movies they've been exposed by their audience, but about $ 1.50 in the scenario. <br /> <br> /> Dreams
