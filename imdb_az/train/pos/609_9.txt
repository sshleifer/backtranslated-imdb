Stardust is a very happy, very creative and filmed fairytale rolled into one, Stardust explains the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world inside to get a star that is just a star to find alive, young and beautiful. A king whose king was about to die said he had a competition to see that he could take a ruby ​​on a few sons of the king, and he wanted a triad of witches to use the awakening of the star and the young. These three areas touch are mixed together throughout the picture, with good action, striking special effects and some firm emotion and humor. Stardust is an entertaining movie, and starring Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer (who can look at me for longer than full magical powers) Robert Deniro is playing for a nancy-rich air pirate improvement. Tristan's Charlie Cox is unpleasant and convincing, and we get a good job from a group of boys playing with us to become kings who are killing each other forever. Mark Strong, Jason Fleming and Ruppert Everett play a good role in their life and death (they all love these issues too). Peter O'Toole is killing a killer who watches me for a funny man, Ricky Gervais, who has made me laugh more than anything in the whole movie for a short five minutes (beautiful legs). But the real power of the film is the work of Neil Gaiman's novel and a creative and productive mindset. Stardust creates and operates his own mythology and his own world.
