How good is it for a movie. I also love Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give strong speeches. Love is full of interest, but it is a film of many people from a good history film. I love the Harleys and hate to see the paint on the "hand-rubbed lacquer 14 dress" with the good old-fashioned Army Olive Drab. Here's a little history lesson that Harley-Davidson's motorcycle plays in the Second World War. I do not know if the training is similar to those bags. The film was interested in me as I went slowly everywhere with good sequence. I love the demographic look of the voice history - an 18-year-old man gave the movie 10 (a true bicycle lover). I would not give it to 10, but I gave it to 8. I will not shoot every single movie on the same scale. There are big budget movies, bigger actors, big failures when you expect to be good. (Star Wars - Episode is my best example) I liked the first three SW movies, but I thought the episode was weaker. So, it gets a lower rating than this movie. I'm expecting a lot from George Lucas.
