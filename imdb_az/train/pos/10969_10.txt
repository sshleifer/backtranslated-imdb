As we know, I did not see Gray gardens, but first saw the same Broadway music. Friends warned me that if I had not seen the movie, it would not be music. He did it, but he also wanted to rent the movie. From the very beginning, I thought it was a train crash, full of strange, embarrassing heroes and it was very difficult to watch. But he realized what Gri Gardens is a memorable documentary, stopping him, punishing him, and coming back. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are both unforgettable, and witnessed the lack of self consciousness. Both are well-off despite their age. They have a relationship that will cool down any woman (and, of course, some men), and you will have to re-examine your relationship with yourself and your mate. In a time when reality television and cinema are spreading, it is interesting to see Mayleses' work decades ago and realize how much the film affects. <br /> <br /> What other posters do I mean: How did it go to such a family? How can two people in the 1970's be completely relieved of reality? Or were they just too mad to help? I will watch it with an explanation that adds an extra idea to the movie.
