The ring was only made of Hitchcock's work, and one of his first paintings was a triangle of love. At first glance, it looks like Cecil B. De Mille's more cynically updating the genuine thematic comic comics, but it's actually a really sensitive Hitchcock image. <br /> <strong> <strong> </ em> </ strong> <br /> <strong> Along with being a German student of style, , influenced Hitchcock in the style of rhythmic Sergei Eisenstein. But here it keeps pace with the content of the majority, not with correction. It is clear from these opening shots that the spinning places are pushed brightly. And, like Eisenstein, offers modified style sound? <br /> <br /> When you hit a rich blow, for example, when you hear the sound, it almost sounds unconscious. <br /> <br /> In the United States, especially in silent films, The Ring is not scattered by too many title cards. As much as possible with images, Hitch believes enough to read the lip to the audience or to master most of the word of the characters. And this is not accompanied by simplified symbolism or intolerance - all these are accomplished through the right angles and the right time with points of view, as well as some solid and subtle indicators. Unfortunately, most of them are unnecessary, unfortunately, there are numerous open-label organizations (especially double-editions), but this is less than in Logar. <br /> <br /> Let's make a few glorious words for the actors mentioned above. Firstly, Carl Brisson is a leading and talented actor. Despite her talent, she was a little confused, first of all, to play a role, like a little dancer than a little dancer to be honest! But I know he knows how much he knows, because it turns out that Brisson was actually a former professional boxer and inexperienced in action. Authorized Ian Hunter, who wants to win a long career supporting the role of the opponent in the 60s. The Ring's most demanding role was given to Lillian Hall-Davis, divided between two lovers. He feels very good, but with emotion and tactical performance, and this is a shame that he never lived in the sound age. <br /> <br /> The traditional battle scene of figure is one of Hitchcock's most impressive moments in silent terms. Gordon Harker, in the best way, plays the best. Martin Scorcese could have dropped his eyes on the Ring when he directed the battle scenes at Raging Bull because his words for the scene were "Stay in the Ring". The Ring has started with some pretty long boots, but when Hitchcock moves intensely, it falls in the midst of us, despite the nearest portions and points of view. Hitchcock's goal has always been to attract audiences, and the secret of success is often crucial for the next career in which the audience is frightened of the character or paranoia. <br /> <br /> Deserves more recognition but better known by The Lodger. This is more polished and professional than the previous one and is probably the best of all the silent features.
