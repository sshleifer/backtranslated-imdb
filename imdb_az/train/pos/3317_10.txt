Bette Midler is still divine! It's really humorous. I love Burlesque. Older jokes with new dresses or the ability to tear you with old songs with more power and punch. All of them read new ballads that sound good old / perennial songs like The Rose; "Stay with me" and yes, even "The Wings of My Wind". The best way to evaluate Divine Miss M is always grace - that's why the next best thing is that I strongly recommend it to all adults for a glamor and appreciation and a childish desire to hurt all the borders!
