Ok The film does not intend to win any prize, and it is a modern bubblegum and a modern update on the theme "This is a Beautiful Life." But the DVD appears as a cheap release and there are many bad ways to cost $ 13. You are making a surprisingly strong casting movie, but many have been using the B list for a year or two. But an hour or a half is a good way to go, just do not think too much.
