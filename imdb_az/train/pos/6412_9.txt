I am glad that a movie about Carl Brashear's beautiful life story has been prepared. <br /> <br /> Brashear was inspired by all the minority groups who did not want to provide an expected status, as it was in the Civil Rights era. <br /> <br /> Like Brashear Cuba Gooding, Jr. behavior of the chosen life. Jackie Robinson, who integrated baseball, was very similar to her character and behavior. However, like Brashear, Gooding knows that his father, Carl Lumbly's wife, does not want his life, and Lumbly will benefit more than he has earned. <br /> <br /> But Harry Truman Armed II. After the World War I, the Navy is still in limbo. The black man can be the valet of the chef or the officer, the real battlefields deny it. The sea is not good enough for Gooding, which belongs to the deep sea divers. <br /> <br /> At one of the diving schools at Bayonne, Bayonne, Gooding, all of them, mainly Robert DeNiro, Chief Officer Petty Officer. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that there are several victories in DeNiro, but if it is a hero, it can inspire racism. <br /> <br /> The best thing about honors is chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that Charles Theron acts as the president of DeNiro's wife, Hal Halbock. <br /> <br /> Four men will retire because of the Navy's desire. <br /> <br /> Honorary Person is an inspirational story about people who are careful and able to change.
