I know, I know: it is childhood. But I love this kind of movie. A bird that suffers from many "mishaps" and still does not believe in humanity and its sense of humor. Something special about this film is Paulie, the main character, and he is not used as a support for some obvious human actors. Moreover, I love the story line: Paulie describes her lifestyle in a cleaner way than at the bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice is almost like Joe Pesci!). Of course Cheech Marin, the guy gives me humor. Since I've seen "Smoke from the top," I've come to appreciate the virtuous way I've done a very simple thing. I can not help myself.
