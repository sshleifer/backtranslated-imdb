Despite the feelings of most Star Wars fans, in my opinion, "The Return Of The Jedi" is the largest filmmaking film ever created. I saw it for the first time, the depth, intensity, special effects and moving story drowned me. The film has been able to halt the trial over the past 20 years, bringing together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> George Lucas has filled us with a strong movement as the castle of the true trilogy at Jedi's "Jedi" in the Star Wars epic. <br /> <br /> As you can see from the movie's essay) After the return of the Empire, we were abandoned for more than three years, and finally we found the end of the "Jedi Return" story. Darth Vader is a surprise visit to the Death Star, which is emotionally inaccessible, to control the construction site. The Emperor was first seen in this film because he had the last plan to destroy the Rebel Union and bring the young Luke Skywalker to the Dark. Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie, and droids travel to Tatouine to freeze the frozen Khan Solo from the Lord; Jabba The Hutt. After the rescission of the Khan and the defeat of Jabba, Luka returned to Dagobai to learn the destructive truth to find Yoda; Darth Vader is actually his father. Rebel's heroes are reunited with Rebel Fleet. Now, other species and races, including Mon Calamari, have to be joined, and they must do all or no offensive plans to destroy the Death Star without the rebels completing. When Lando headed the cosmic attack in the Hawk of the Millennium, the heroes of Rebel must dismantle the Shield star of the Death Star in the Forest of Endor. The rebels here are on the hairy, but powerful Ewoks. During a two-part intensive battle, Luka must conduct a third battle, as he entrusted Vader with an attempt to convince him to leave Dark Side. Emotionally, Luke should be opposed to his father as he enjoyed the emotional darkness of the emperor. As the young Skywalker faces death in the hands of Palpat√≠n, Vader turns to a bad runner to save his son's life. <br /> <br /> "Jedi's Return", which is packed with a deep, timeless story of good and evil, is a spectacular, emotional accusation that will all of us enjoy.
