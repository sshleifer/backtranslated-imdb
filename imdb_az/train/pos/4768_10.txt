SELECTED YEARS, and more than a season was broken too! I would like it! this was the best show !!!!!! you probably have a chance to decide not to cancel the show! ha ha I wish it though! I would be very excited! I really! I miss! and especially Jason was broken to see what was happening! I think not to do anything else .... I also think he's silly that he has ten lines to write that .. it's your dragging your comment .. and no one will be reading! I really want to know what will happen between jason and nicole ... maybe they can take off a spin!
