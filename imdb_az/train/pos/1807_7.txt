This is one of the first movies I can remember and the first. It's a very nice film, it's very unpleasant to bring a student to the world, and violence and addictions we had to live. A little of Babe, Casinos and Constantine, all of them are mixed into a carton and we get it. I do not really think it's really appreciated for children, but I think it's cool, very funny and interesting. I hate to have a movie (especially cardboard) a good end, and I will hurt it, because it is an unpleasant thing (not painful), although each character has an unpleasant end .But it was good, just go to paradise <br /> < This is just a critic, a good movie is something new. very touching and should go
