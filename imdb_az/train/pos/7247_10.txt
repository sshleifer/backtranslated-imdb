Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (Two stars are lively deaths) (What is Luca doing today? Probably a lawyer such as Bela Lugosi Jr or David Hennessey or something, a child from dark shadows) shadow shadows) In any way, there is no music on opening credits in the Thorn EMI video ... but good after the music ... Films with Italian films are not good music ... My favorite scene is with my robot arm after Alien, with the guy .. Alien, why do you follow me, Tommy answers because I feel it ... Tommy after the foreign reply Alien tells the West that I'm going to the east, after a while looking at the background in the background while Tommy looks at a pet a hamster sees sitting on a sheep ... Tommy looks up and Alien says this movie is very popular ... I love the movie ... It touches my heart. A child with a robotic arm needs a father and Alien is prepared to become Tommy's father in the desert. . . Yes, there is a need for water. . . Robot arm and a boy with Alien and Rubbish, and a good way to see a few good guys and a CRAZY BULL with a moderate chick with an iron claw, but with any way ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2), but a reasonable western / post nuke movie like Wez, a warrior. . On the 57th day of the church (Philadelphia, PA) Sunday morning, I come home and find it. . . frequently . . too often. I love it. 10/10
