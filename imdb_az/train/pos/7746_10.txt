Those who know the DUUS band recognize the lead singer Tom Barman. It is a mix of everything, making it a little bit like creating music. <br /> <br /> Although this is a major absurd and brutal drama, not a comedy, none of the main characters have a happy life to say at least, and there is really no purpose. <br /> <br /> Some people have nothing to do with the scenes of several people on Thursday in Antwerp, Belgium, but they are in contact at night and in the daytime. There are a few key characters: a teacher who does not read books, a young researcher with a terrible illness and a sister, a gallery owner, two young men in contact with the law, a man working in a movie theater and two young women. He is a person who has a relationship with the wind throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The film is shot in Antwerp and has several beautiful pictures of the city and the harbor. The events of the day are not easily disclosed, and I just recommend watching the movie. But I like it, Barman has a great use of the camera and uses numerous music (mainly dance music, really rock) to create a mood, especially with the party full of perfect music. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In short, look, it's definitely worth it!
