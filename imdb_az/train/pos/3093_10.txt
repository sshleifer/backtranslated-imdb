Why did not the manufacturers show all the garbage chances on television, why the producers did not give a six-degree chance? Will you shoot a serial video? I would like to see how it ended up. Place your season video and buy it. I was a fan of Six Degrees and waited for his return. I put the recorder all the tapes to the tape. Thank God for that. I only learned that the show was canceled and my heart was broken. If only I knew that he would do it, why did they tell us? I thought the show was just going to improve the depth of the characters. The writing was very good. Steven (Campbell Scott) loves me all the time. I'm so sorry to see her!
