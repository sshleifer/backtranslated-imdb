After a brief prologue by a masked man who stalked an old gentleman's stomach, we meet with Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) when one of the Australian streets of the century interleavers, urban transformation, and hunting. They are committed to getting a credit card for a fixer-up on a Sidney Street, but it turns out that a physical accident is not just their problem with their new home. <br /> <br /> <strong Although partly due to the budget, it can not be completely pardoned for the barrier. An important problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening "tension scene" is some flawless editing. It is used to hide the fact that there are no frozen frames and styles. Thirst is not to be imagined, not to imagine, but to be "settled in confusion." At the scene scene, lighting, smoke and so on. There is a nice atmosphere, but the camera slowly follows the killer and victim, and must follow each other while watching the street. increasing proximity. Tracking and cuts should be slow. The attack needs to be longer, more clear and better. We note that the scene has a strong sense of "prepared for television" and thus has a low budget. <br /> <br /> After this scene we went to this day and the movie stream was very good. Although the budget is more subtler approach, the story has many similarities with The Amityville Horror (1979). Miles and Scenario writer Tony Morphett effectively creates a series of scenario scenarios in nature that are naturally natural in the nature, such as the mysterious man who comes to remove the old tiles of the corridor. <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, Part of the realist drama can be a little bit heavy.

There are some interesting springs with very interesting character. The home is present as a metaphor for stress in a romantic relationship and a catalyst, which can boil it and possibly destroy it. It is in the open neighborhood and the relationships between two successful yuppies indicate that these problems do not only hurt people with a number of external woes, such as money or health problems. Peter's character is becoming more desperate than a "normal" worker-friendly corporate employee, and plans to get something even more free and meaningful. At the same time, we learn how neatly these professional friendships are. <br /> <br /> Although Gantry Row is not regarded as a television movie, it is 13 years old, but it's really a nervous breakdown. , it's pretty good with a striking ambitions. Anyone who likes haunting home movies, psycho-movies or horror / excitement with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. Of course, it costs 30 dollars for a DVD (after my local PBS station has shown a desire for a copy of the movie (sending and processing factoring), but this is a rental, and it's definitely worth watching.
