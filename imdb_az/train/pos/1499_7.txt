For fans of Hammer-type fright film in the 1970s, this movie should be a cure. One thing that does not love the film is the disappearance of Peter Cushing in the worst episode. In general, however, this is a complicated, heartwarming film. This is not one of Amicus's best films, of course one of them. The best episode awarded in the latter case, introduces John Pertwee as a scary actor - really great. Like Pertwee, it's hard to believe that such films are not doing more. In general, this is an entertaining movie that teaches me to scare my heck as a child and creeps up to so far.
