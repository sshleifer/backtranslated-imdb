SÃ£o Paulo, the world's largest and ugly third-world nightmare in Brazil, is an extremely tense storm in chaos. In order to make it easier for anyone interested in this curious and really good movie, this is also a film about a psychopath in no way, the Mexican feature "Amores Perros" with a character far from Max Cady from Cape Fears. Anisio (Miklos), a partner in a construction company (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca), pays the third partner (and most of the shareholder) in the construction dress. The murder is charged in the city, but everything is a smart and charismatic nightmare, not just Anisio's murder, but more importantly, serious social codes are a Brazilian society. Anisio puts poverty into an attitude and looks at where he wants. The appearance is almost completely lost, especially for the first time (and Paulo Miklos, a member of the classical Brazilian pop group 'Titang'), dazzles and baffles. In November 2001, I saw a Brasilia film in the Fest film . He has done very well in Sundance and Berlin today. Kleber Mendonca Filho
