I do not know what's happening with this movie. Movies about history or religion are always criticized with precision. Of course, this is 100% accurate. However, when "experts" do not agree with each other, it is difficult to make 100% accurate films. Therefore, I would like to criticize a film that wants to speak more than choosing more than all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> I'm starting to say I love this mini-series. But I agree with criticism that his childhood years are going very fast. The series consisted of three parts, the first part of childhood. <br /> <br /> With this movie, I have a real problem and this is the truth spoken in history. book way Especially part of what is happening is the second part. More precisely, I would like to see Hitler more humane (scenarios of self-doubt, etc.). Noah Taylor thought more about the better-acting Max. Nevertheless, I was glad and got a DVD. Seeing just what's happening live and seeing Carlyle best. 7.5 / 10
