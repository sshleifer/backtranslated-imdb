Initial release date is not 2009, but this feature is not for the nature documentary. Better to be called Earth 2009. Second, let's look at complaints from some viewers who saw the 2006 Planet Earth series. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this TV series, but I've learned that this movie is exactly what it is. this is the length version of the 2006 TV series. I appreciate any movie not from its source, but from its source. I appreciate the results themselves and the results of "Earth 2009" are really good. I reject some unusual complaints from some reviewers: it is simply an expanded version of the 2006 Planet Earth series. So what? <br /> <br /> I was surprised and surprised by the film "Earth 2009", as a filmmaker and a person who has watched live documentaries with them for a lifetime. Started with Disney's new "DisneyNature" section, and traces of Walt Disney's premier and Academy Award-winning natural documentary films in the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Kinematography, movie editing, music score, sound and story are very good. There are also a few other nature documents that are superior in these categories. Indeed, the "Earth 2009" separates one another, its coverage. <br /> <br /> After my first look, this documentary was required to make a great effort and time and talent. <br /> <br /> Three producers were required to produce this beautiful documentary. <br /> <br /> Earth 2009 believes in stories as the four-year species has been spread over one year on major migrations. Seasons beginning in January and December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two new high-tech cameras have been used for this movie: a camera is rotating 360 degrees with a computer controlled motor and another 1,000-square-foot HD camera per second. This shooting technique really adds drama and beauty to the Earth 2009 scenes, especially the big white shark that splashes over the water to catch chita chase and sea lions, and an airy view of the world's highest waterfall. This documentary has many beautiful pictures. <br /> <br /> With this movie, drama, sadness, humor and beauty, with cinematography, music honey and story. With the world-renowned Berliner Philharmonic, perfect creative and technical cinematography and a great music account of James Earl Jones, I regard the Earth 2009 as the largest nature-length documentary. <br /> <br /> For five years, hardworking, patience, talent and dedication really are paid here in a very good way. This film should be reviewed in all schools around the world. Among other prizes, I guess the award for Best Documentary Academy Award. Indeed, an incredible, astonishing, exciting and magnificent documentary. <br />
