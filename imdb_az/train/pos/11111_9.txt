Sopranos is probably the most cleverly designed series to watch. This clever, strange, funny and mafia genre is so good that most people are unable to watch. The best feature of this show is the great realism of the symbols set up in the underworld of New York crime families. Often, really, smart guys do not know if they're going to hit anyone or take a lunch. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realistic approach of heroes in this show, the depth of their identity is as follows: These are dangerous men, most murderers, but by God. I laughed at their minds, I was tired of being wrongfully convicted, and I was afraid of a miserable criminal. <br /> <br /> New York City's suburban setting is completely perfect for the show's subtext - people are not always what they seem to be, and even the striking contrast between the abilities and the steps taken by these smaller criminals. <br /> <br /> If it were not for that, it must definitely be.
