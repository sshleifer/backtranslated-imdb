The best was the horror of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Janos Rook (Karloff) is an expedition trying to find an ancient meteorite in Africa. The soul was poisoned by radiation after finding it. All the dead whom he touched, and the darkness of Ruh, make him an egoist killer. His friend, Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited solution to the problem and can also be used for the good of humanity by treating radiation diseases. It will fight on two divine radiation capabilities. Pretty good special effects. The others are Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi, and Frank Reicher.
