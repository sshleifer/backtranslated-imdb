<br /> <br /> This is a long-term film shot. <br /> <br /> For the first time I watched Dragon Lord when I bought a DVD many years ago. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and read more positive reviews to get a general idea. I've always found the story a little bit of mixer. The film is, in fact, a love story. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not the case in the long run. The old "original" version begins with a sequence of large barrel scrambling / rugby, with a broad sequence of finishing sequences. The opening sequence was hanged around Dragon (Jackie Chan)'s home and always acted as his father read and read. <br /> <br /> Other layouts have also been cut off or lengthened for a long time, and the story is much more intense when you watch it. Pacing is also better, and generally only works better. <br /> <br /> For some years, this has been a few years (or at least I think how I think) Why I would fix some other things and fix some scenes) for me the best is something. As I watched it, I felt like watching a totally new Jackie Chan movie, although most of the series were the same.
