Rod Serling, of course, was a genius, and his beautiful, entertaining, creative thought left something of his time and TV examples in the development. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> There is no such show now, on the contrary, "Housewife" Eva Longoria or Terry Hatcher, or ghostly slots of our high-tech screens that are stingy stabs on humps and witty knives. <br /> <br /> Jack Elam is not an episode with the kind of sensitivity and unbridledness that Rod Serling has made for a long weekly demonstration around Elam, even if it helps the story flow. This episode ends with a twist as usual, but shock and humor, especially Serlinque, are agile. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
