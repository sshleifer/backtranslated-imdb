Contrary to rhetorical beliefs, this subject is at least as bad as me. In fact, actually. I think it's a favorite movie of all time. When you consider the difference between the series, the source of the stories is not very well set up, yet you can feel very happy about it. <br /> <br /> The scenes for a feature film of the day are well-proportioned and symbols are always convincing. <br /> <br /> Sound / audio track is my personal favorite. Almost everything has a smooth sound effect, and many sounds are sounds suitable for the characters that are better than they are. Sinx is perfect for every shot. I've had a few issues with casting for 'foreign' voices (please, please, it's been some time since I saw it). Otherwise, the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this movie. Dubs often rarely agree with a topic. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> It's a historic value for me, but after seeing my Megazone 23, it remained stronger and more watched in my collection. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this headline was sent only to Texas in the United States. Personally I think of his great embarrassment. If I were to follow the right audience, I would think that Robotech would be filmed and will not overcome for years. <br /> <br /> Every day of my life attracts anime, and everyone I have shown this movie has shown that she has put her in a beautiful fashion. <br /> <br /> Watching the film after its separate components, the audience is clearly visible between the shows. But, without seeing the works, an audience did not really matter. Since it's the same as an animated style, there's no reason to question her since. England's anime is very limited. Laser discs were the most productive media. Personally, I love the way Carl had the ball to push at least the genre. That is, Harmony does not intend to put cash money to the public. <br /> <br /> Despite a few voter mistakes, there are people in this movie, eighty feelings love me. Megazone 23 now, the original Japanese audio or the new dub, I believe will be very disappointed with the OSD. Return your work to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and imagine EE's new eighties. <br /> <br /> Say all this. The popularity of this film is still rare in the open market today. Personally gave me a collection. I cleaned the goods for three components of the world, and if I met Carl Macek, the patient would shake his hand and buy a pint or box to buy me anime.
