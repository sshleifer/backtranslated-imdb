Altman's "H.E.L.T.H." in the classic sense of the fourth humor (not related to a comic or even fun concept), with all humor and really funny, entertaining ways. Esther Brill, a very slow, protective and protective character of Lauren Bacall, has a dissatisfaction that protects the mystery of his age and beauty, more than his well-being, appearing in a lifetime task. Paul Dooley's Choler Dr. Gil Giliney calls for a bottle of water outside the water (perhaps more like a seal) and to subscribe to its irrigation evidence. Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell Melancholyn, a challenging and self-righteous Hamlet of Shakespeare - a soliloquy or two. And remember the character of Henry Gibson, Bobby Hammer ("Breastfeeding Breast"). H.E.L.T.H. H.E.L.T. H.E.L.T. there are symbols of Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett), who are relatively intelligent characters trying to find a balance between all the comrades whom they call for and the humorous humor. A kind of world trade organization that specializes in H.E.L.T.H. means nothing but health. This Altman is the classic best.
