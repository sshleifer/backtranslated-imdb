This is another fantasy from Ralf Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube. A pre-historic sword-wizard research in the distant, good and bad after the Ice Age. Nekron, a glacial artist and mother, Queen Juliana, looks at the glorification of the world. When the glaciers were destroyed by a village named Larn (Larn), he promised to take vengeance on his people and kill the Lord of the Rings. Meanwhile, Nekron and Juliana's subordinates capture Princess Teegra, the daughter of King Jarol of Firekeep; but he succeeds, and as a result he meets Larn, who promises to return to Firekeep; <br /> <br /> This film was very little box office, like most of Ralph Bakshi's films, but became a cult classic. Collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Also, I heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, two men who wrote the novel of the Conan novel, and backgrounds, James Gurney, an illustrator of the Dinotopy novels; I must admit that I have not read Conan and Dinotopy. The artist, Thomas Kinkade, also noted works of art for figurines, and Bradford Exchange's music boxes as well as paintings. Like Bashshar's films, Rings and American Pop films, this movie is a rotoscope, but the movie works better than ever before. <br /> So, in general, it's awesome collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta, amongst the best animated fantasy films and two great minds. With many fantasies, sex traps and thrilling adventure.
