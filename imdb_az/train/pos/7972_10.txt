I'm watching this movie all the time. I was watching it between 3 and 87 years of age and everyone; All this was loved. It really shows the true scenes a dog and is the love and devotion that you get from a pet. Just fine. <br /> <br /> Ideal for comedy films, tear-films or even nasty lads. <br /> <br /> Music is beautiful, the animals are spectacular, scenes really thought and the characters are perfect. Those who love me on the cartoon are real and beautiful mixes: Shadow (Oldest, Golden Retriever) He is a wise man with the wisdom and thought of any dog, Chance (American Bulldog puppy) is actually a puppy intelligent party, funny character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She has a real cat who will do a real girly thing, for a real cat owner.
