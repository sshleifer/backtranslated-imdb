The fact that the DVD's still being formatted on the TV and the flawed images actually made the movie piercers really frustrating ... and in the right way. <br /> <br /> This story meets with a street boy and a little girl who is in need of his son to pass to his work (rules of the day) (not understandable). way) .... and then problems coming. <br /> <br /> The old man bought the boy at an auction and soon found that he did not have a child. He was a child who was obviously thinking. <br /> <br /> Old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) The little girl is Doggie (Chou Renying), and the rest of the story is how it is handled later." I usually love a nice syndicate, <br /> <br /> In the past 15 minutes, there's a story that's full of drama, cries, humor, and sadness, and just rent money after you leave the DVDs on the big screen.
