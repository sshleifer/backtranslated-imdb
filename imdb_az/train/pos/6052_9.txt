<br /> <br /> A well-written, funny movie that will appeal to everyone with a sense of humor. It's best to go to a lot of your own, catch up against larger builded studios in a Great Independent English movie! It's worth it to join any movie collection. I'm convinced that this film has many scenes that can connect with many people. You will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy a great soundtrack. In particular, Orb's Jimmy Cliff's Vietnamese version and the Tower of London were invited to Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go, go and go ............ You will not be disappointed.
