I've watched this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, which is pleasant. And it's pretty scary, but all good, ghoulish fun. A woman kills her second baby, but a manicure that runs out of a witch's Santa Claus clothes enters a problem she and her little girl decide to visit right now. Mary Traynor, a SNL or other television comedian skit show, is a bad wife, and Larry Drake plays lunatic in the worst Santa dresses. I forgot that Santa played by Drake over the years. His Santa is an unbearable force and sometimes terribly scared. Perhaps Santa can finally guess how it will go home. This episode is played laughably, but it can sometimes be quite intense.
