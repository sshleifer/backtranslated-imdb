I also looked at this movie for some time and it would be great to find it on the DVD ... <br /> <br /> When I was 6, I saw this movie in the Netherlands. And I was very impressed. Walt Disney's first JUNGLE BOOK book! <br /> <br /> What I remember this movie was fragmented. I was reminded that a boy was friends with an old friend. This made me very impressed. For some reason he was expelled from the village (he did not understand the reason). When other boys throw stones at him, a rock climbed and jumped. At that time an eagle turned and flew with an eagle friend. He still wore a turquoise necklace as an eagle. <br /> <br /> CB
