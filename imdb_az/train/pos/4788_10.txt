This is one of the biggest films I've ever seen: I shine in the whole movie. Music and cinematography spelled magic when it took little on the screen. The slow pace was designated by travel mode (sliding mower with a large trailer) and slowly maintained the backgrounds, sounds, and other symbols. <br /> <br /> The story really happened; Alvin Straight died at the age of 76 in 1996. Everything was absolutely real, as though the actors were actually transformed into symbols. Sissy Spacek complained little, but with a fraudulent, certainly strange performance, of course, as a slightly disabled girl who wanted to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was perfectly beaten and beautifully transformed into a revolutionary but loving old man, Steven Stewell (Stevenson). Alvin has learned much wisdom in her life and has revealed the best of the people that they encounter. <br /> <br /> Film, this is the importance of the family and I hope all of us. I do not expect to see it again. These movies, directed by David Lynch, prove their directorial skills. Farnsworth was nominated for the Oscars for Best Actor; At the age of 79, he was the oldest candidate for the award.
