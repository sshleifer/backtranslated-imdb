MacDonald-Eddy rabbit songs do not always understand how much of the rape is - not just by the detectors, but actually everyone. To me, "I have an angel married" is more than livelier and more creative than anything else. The sets and suits are so rich in a MGM music, that the script is based on reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "Women", "Gentlemen Blondes Preference" etc.), Rodgers and Hart tunes (MacDonald-Eddy regularly routes Bob Wright and Chet Forrest Herbert Stotart ("The Wizard of Oz" won the Oscars), in the best way, "singer lovers" seem to be entertained with their modern dresses and strange processes. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" for uninitiated today and they may still be hard to sit well but this is offbeat, bound to entertain the fast paced fantasy.
