Channel 4 is a channel that gives you more rogue things than other channels, this show was certainly naughty. Graham Norton was once just a perfect gay host for a good show (sometimes doubled), this is sometimes a chat show for adult adults, four times won BAFTA and won the British Comedy Award. In the middle of it was one or more celebrities. They were basically a great idea, either general, humiliate or humorous, but some are not heartwarming. Women, singer's xenophones, women in the bath, men without pants or pants under the church, and women with more general but hilarious thoughts were women playing the sound recording unit. Enjoy it, not just adults! The Best Comedy Show Award for the Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), won the BAFTA for the Best Entertainment (Program or Series), won and won Emmy for the 18th episode The Most Popular Promotion Two National Television Awards were given for the show. This was 52 numbers in 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very Good!
