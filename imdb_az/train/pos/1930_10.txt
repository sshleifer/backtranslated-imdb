This movie is hilarious, original and beautifully directed. I have become a BIG BAD SWIM group, watching movies everywhere and wherever I am. I now saw half an hour and every time, the enthusiastic audience responded that I heard that it was one of the best films to go out for years. At nearly every festival, he has sold, sold or won the Audience Favorite Award. People love this movie, even more precisely why they clarify it. Cinematography is a perfect, characteristic, moving, brilliant, ending fantasy, compassion, wisdom and perfect art. It is difficult to believe that Ismau Setton's first film. I hope soon everyone will be able to see it.
