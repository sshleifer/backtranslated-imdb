I just love this movie. It is a perfect example of some of the best circular striking stories from Asian cinema. This film has a new regulation in Hollywood, Richard Gere and just awful Jennifer Lopez. Please do not mix two movies. The original Japanese movie is gentle, delicate and beautiful. Hollywood version is just the opposite. I was surprised when I first saw the trailer for the Remedy version of the United States and played a leading role. Worst Hollywood unoriginal crass trading. Reconstruction cements prove that some foreign films can never be upgraded. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why this film will not work anywhere in the US is the ultra-social conservative. This film features the character of a public Japanese person. Of course, the main character is awakening to live a more vibrant life through dance, but half of the film's tension comes from stereotypes and ballet dancers face Japan. <br /> <br /> Try to see this movie in its original form, not a terrifying full screen. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the "original" movie is much older and this is just a Japanese <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , this list for an outstanding movie! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian flickin falsely identities! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < 3.Player -A Korean movement pic, both Asian flare and US style plot blend 4.Run Lola Run-A German movie combines neatly with a techno score. <br /> <br /> Well, just a quick list:)
