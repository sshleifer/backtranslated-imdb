I was very skeptical about this documentary, I must admit. I was expecting it to be a type of American propaganda that I did not like in Europe. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is of course not political. <br /> <br /> Describes 11/11 events in the eyes of rescuers called to the scene after the crash of the aircraft. There is an incredible coinsidence in this documentary filming! This film was originally filmed as a blanket NY firefighter "a man". <br /> <br /> We can only thank the movie artists for their continued work during the horrible exams they encounter. <br /> <br /> It's a great piece of work. Completely stunning material. <br /> <br /> Thank you,
