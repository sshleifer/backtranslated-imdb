When it was first released in America in 1972, the 'The Night Stalker' was the highest rated app for T. film history Based on an unpublished novel by Jeff Rice, a fearless researcher named Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) described how journalist discovered the existence of a vampire in modern Las Vegas. Four years later, when it came to English television, it did not have the same effect, but my friends were talking about it at school because it was really. We all agreed that this is one of the most interesting things. i saw <br /> <br /> I did not know the night storm until about ten years later. T. VV, who has featured in "Kolchak", decided to go to the spin-off series; Buddy felt the 'Barnaby Jones' role playing with Ebsen to make more sense, and in any case the audience was confused with Kolchak 'Kojak'! Over the years, my only source of information about the show was an article in Fangoria magazine. I did not even get the Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> Then something nice happened.

My twelve year old loved him. Creepy, humorous, exciting, no Chris Carter's imagination. <br /> <br /> The show was McGavin's greatest asset. Unlike the last Kolchak, it was original, eccentric, very conservative. He was supernatural about Columbo's murder. The late Simon Oakland was as big as Kolchak's modest manager Tony Vincenzo. The comedy was full of beautiful, dry minds. For more humor content, I enjoyed more software. <br /> <br /> The X-Files came in a few years and filled the gap, but to a degree. Kolchak and Vincenzo wanted to get back. The show is pleasing, the show has never been updated. </ p> <p> <p> Stephen King first wrote (in his book "Danse Macabre ") I was very surprised to see how good it was. <br /> <br /> True, some of the monsters were in a difficult situation, but what happened? The new 'Kolchak' completely missed the original point. <br /> <br /> The best episode - The worst episode of "Heights in Horror" - "The Centr"
