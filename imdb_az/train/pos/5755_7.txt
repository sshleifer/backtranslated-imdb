This is a pretty strange movie. <br /> <br /> It comes as an exploitative film with the most violent and unrealistic situations, but not against the one who is an unusual invader in the war against the heroes of the war. <br /> <br /> The film is an extreme stereotype of Vietnamese veterans in a long line of film depicting war veterans as dangerous psychopaths. The last line of Kris Christofferson resulted in the death and destruction of the city's police chief and brother's daughter on a particularly cold scene after his death, saying, "I have not lost a fight yet." But Christopher is a pretty good actor and charismatic enough to make this villain a stunning depth. Vincent is clearly a golden boy, but he deserves a clean cut with good intensity. <br /> <br /> The film is similar to Winchester 73. Jimmy Stewart wants to endure a murderer after he has been forced to move. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , and a film industry that is turbulent and wants to respond to such issues at that time. <br /> <br /> This channel has seen a huge network playing old movies from 70 to 90's. politically twisted.
