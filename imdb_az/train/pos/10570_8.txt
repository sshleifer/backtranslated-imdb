It's hard to say closely at James Cagney's charm and energy, or the mouthpiece of Busby Berkeley's three great demonstrators. I'm giving you a Footlight Parade, the one of the funniest and most fastest in the 30s of the first century. Although the movie belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds a bad character to the storyline. <br /> <br /> And what's the story line? About Chester Kent (Cagney), who produced music, and who is now dismissed because of the conversation. Starts prologues, live music entertainment on the stage before the movie starts. He takes the idea of ​​making older people and more, leaving them out of the country. He needs a ball of fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas that can be obtained to produce these things unstable. But his opponent spies on him and stealing his thoughts; His clever cracker secretary, Nan Prescott (Blondell) loves him very much, but he is very careful; black-and-white, round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants a chance to dance an office girl; his wife refused to divorce her; a blonde gold digger puts his forks on it; his partners deceive him ... my guardian, what will come? All of this may sound like a lot of digestion, but it's all about Cagney's spinning, standing, moving, flicking, bending commands and, sometimes, the fastest singing and dancing, or just to show how. <br /> <br /> Instead of putting the show off, we need to build three shows in three days, lock the doors and start training. These three super Prologues, 40 crowns, will have a spectacular effect and ... a 40-unit unit of luxury cinema homes ... a rich deal ... all Apollon's Cinema House! Leg pain is a threat to foot pain, but it is only in exclusive suits (including Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, Sothern is quick to understand, but Lamour is more general), walking on the road, dancing on the hearts, giggling, chatting and seemingly unbearable. <br /> <br /> Chester's skin does not exist, as the owner of the Apollo era will set that night, as it is presented in separate film homes that night. <br /> <br /> First, together with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, the Honeymoon Hotel is a very unpleasant luxury of 9 minutes production, especially the brides and grooms (some may marry), bedroom and bed, and "do not disturb" gates with signs. Therefore, with the next theater and a 11-minute "Waterfall," it was likely that Accountants who were worried about Warner Brothers inspectors. These pieces are too extreme - you will not think that hundreds of girls, trees, fountains, water gondets and giant ponds - a huge pool - are depression. Berkeley makes all sorts of sensations - synchronization, human specimens, feet and weapons - and looking for many submarine photography in the water. The girls are sure game. She smiles with water in her eyes and still hits her marks. Everything should be exhausting and tiring. Ruby Keeler, one of the fastest in the water, is a little cautious. <br /> <br /> Finally, the finale ... The 11-minute Cagney dance and Keeler's "Shanghai Lil" are all unusual in the race with all the bar daughters and customers. Cagney and Keeler dance at the bar, dance at the table, Cagney fights. There are things like ship ships with fifty or sixty walking, back and forth, rifles thrown and kept. Then ... that's right ... Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle's man's pictures. It can be no Hollywood music produced by Roosevelt, a great federal agency and sexually-friendly prostitutes. <br /> <br /> This is fun, nation. This is amazing! <br /> Of course, Chester's Prologues get a big deal and gets Nan Chester. The film is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so pleasing that he blew up his weapons to help him. Joan Blondell has forgotten many Hollywood women who could have made us look more beautiful but less mind and personality. But the film captures Cagney and shakes it up, and Berkeley is a man who is not so much for most people.
