A family and a different family are struggling to follow the line between Dads' powers and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The term is kept; This bakelite light, Georgian floor trumpet, picture rail, wallpaper, short skirts, exquisite lies, Mini van, bright modern mangles .... <br /> <br /> The place is taken up; <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Love, struggle, sexual maturity, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deception, spirituality, behavior, maturity, loss, poverty, childhood, happiness, sensitivity, pride, values, freedom, power, rebellion, violence (in deep sense) sacrifice, horror, acceptance, praise, comedy and parenthood. <br /> <br /> As always, this movie is a rich expression of family conflict. Some of these can not be solved directly by the attitudes of the day, but their presence here depends on actual skill, story and direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps I was kidnapped - when the apocalypse and heart I felt when many teenagers really did disappear (**) - maybe it's trying to send this message to the movie - it's worth it. Try to tell the movie? Children: Parents are too young, parents are fighting, everyone is wrong, everyone learns, changes, struggles can be happy. Parents: Do not try too much! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the film feels like it, but you see how far it has been accused and detected since then. <br /> <br /> The film is classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - solves problems.
