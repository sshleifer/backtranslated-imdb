This is not a movie for lovers of the usual disappointment of Lynch products. On the contrary, this is a beautiful film, which evaluates a good story or is tired of something open-minded by sentimentalism and Oprah-work! - semantics (<br /> <br /> The story is perfectly formed and we believe that many will come for a while. <br /> <br /> Unprecedented, cinematography (sometimes very bright!) And dialogue <br /> <br /> A hot movie is not too sensitive.
