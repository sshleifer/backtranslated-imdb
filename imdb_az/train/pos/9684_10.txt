This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts was actually referring to Paulie's mind and heart, looking at these beautiful pictures, and knew how his followers were going to their hearts. Find out from time to time with the help of sensitive and talented directors that John has, as well as the small creatures like Paulie, have heart. Despite the happy ending of the film, I could not stop my tears. After thousands of films I've seen throughout my life, Paulie really touched me. This is the second picture that really surprises me after "Ugly Duckling".
