We still do not know much about what was previously explained by the early tribal elders, before the great division we call. In any case, there is much to do with the danger of knowing too much. On the contrary, there are those who warn us not to get ready for a warning. In this film, an aboriginal native of "The Last Wave" is killed without any reason. Responsible persons are silent, less likely to be involved when called into account. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays a Defense Attorney assigned to defend the suspect. Though he was not afraid of prophetic portrayals from his childhood, but warned him of the present signs, Burton continues to defend this breach as the Tribal Law and therefore is not subject to standard justice. The film is full of dark, confusing images of apocalyptic recent world disasters, and warns of future island tsunami and death. Black drama and in-depth rituals make this movie attractive and therefore not heartwarming; in fact, the simplest scenes can last years in the nightmare of innocent filmmakers. Good silent drama. ****
