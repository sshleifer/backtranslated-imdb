I do not understand why people are scared and film this movie! Remember the people, this is a SNL movie, a trick or an unplanned and original thing! The ladies' man is an angry movie, though foolish at times, as always, beautiful performances by Wire Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some jokes are foolish and yes, the characters are incredible, but comedy! I do not understand that anyone will not laugh at this funny movie. Anyway, I ask people to accept it as it is - a SNL, a stupid and non-objectionable comedy. Nothing to win, but still some modern comedy gold. "10-4 Kayu!"
