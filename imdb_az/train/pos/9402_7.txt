I just saw this movie after hearing about it for a long time. Of course, the actual experience has proven to be a bit anticlimactic. However, Alec Guiness is energetically leading to a beautiful cast that will be performed extensively by Britain's industrial branch after the post-industrial post-British period. <br /> <br /> It recognizes the difficulty of making the perfect daily product. Remember the running car? Remember the nuclear energy promise? In this case, it is not a worn, wrinkle or even ugly piece! Of course, the producers and their employees are horrified by the possibility of their dismissal and, therefore, is a bit thicker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < (These English men ... always lip when they are burning). The film may be shot in the same way as Guiness's weak inventions, but a good ride.
