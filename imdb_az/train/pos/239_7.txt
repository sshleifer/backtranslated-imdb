<br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ strong> <br /> <strong> I did not know about Ned Kelly or his story because I did not have the best time. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> But Ned Kelly's as a hero and a warrior for justice guarantees that he really wants to believe everything is right. <br /> <br /> This is a decisive western film for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is always as great and sexy as the Naomi Watts screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance to cables. Otherwise, I do not think I can recommend it.
