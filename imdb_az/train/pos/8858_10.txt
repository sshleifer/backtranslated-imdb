It's kind of a movie I normally get, but I've mostly rented it for the stars. Of course, I do not apologize. In fact, as you can see, I appreciated five stars. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson do not try to rob her parents' jewelry store. Crime is getting worse - starting from the eyes of three of Hanson's family members. <br /> <br /> Young brother Hank, basically, is a vida-up. Through many flashbacks we come to know Charles Hanson and understand the intense relationship between the father and his sons. He has always had trouble catching a job and goes to the very wind direction. Hank is more fearless, cowardly, and influenced by his older brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank who has achieved T, and what is his best performance so far. <br /> <br /> A man with a good heart, but who is affected by external forces, shows us. <br /> <br /> Andy, on the surface, appears to be a successful businessman, but we imagine that he is soon acquired from the company to depend on drug and his habit. Andy, scheming schemes to rob parent's store, moved with Hank's weak will. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Andy, one of the best actors in our time. Hoffman is a charming businessman loved by his acquaintances on the surface, but is an actor who can describe a person with a real bone ball below. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Of course, for a perfect part of Andy or said that with his superior motion skills, Charles Hanson is not a bad or sensitive person, but has a mild connection with his sons because he did not realize what he needed to raise a positive relationship between his sons and himself. He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish. He has always said that he has given his younger son over the age and has caused a great emotional conflict between himself and Andy. <br /> <br /> When we meet Prince Andy Andy, his idea of ​​making a spoof of his father becomes less incredible. <br /> <br /> I do not believe how much Charles Hanson remembers me in a private note, and Andy and Hank recalled my own brother and myself. Probably one of the reasons I'm very pleased with this movie as long as I'm approaching the home of a very far-off, critical father, a successful older brother, and a less successful young brother. Fortunately, my brother and I have never been able to commit a crime against my parents - as if we were using more rigid and more moral things. <br /> <br /> The complex of these personalities and actions is directed by Sydney Lumet. In the eighteenth, there are still dresses for hypnotizing characters and drifting movements. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The angry man, Devil's events and symbols know you are Dead and tough and attractive and this is definitely not a good feeling. But last two hours of entertainment.
