When I watched this movie for the first time, it was a taped image and the title was Caged Terror. I still have a tape and I admit that I've been watching multiple times from beginning to end! The film is very little budget and dialogue is often funny! I bought several friends to watch and had some great laughs from the horrible script. The movie is linked to a couple who are on a weekend camp journey, which I believe will be the wedding witness (remember as it was in the early 70's). There are some hot dialogs after catching fish and eating, and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and they ate! As he eats the fish, some of them are already back, and now they are part of them and go; "And this beautiful person!" Heavy man, really hard! LOL! Anyway, when it comes to several Vietnamese vets, I believe it's one of the flute players. (Any musician!) Children are explicitly involved with the girl, and when couples are in peace, they start to scare them at night. The boy ends up in a chicken coffin and cursed his girlfriend by two boys. In fact, it may seem nice until the end of the night, and in the morning, the kids will leave and leave the girl and the boy. The alleged man learned how to behave at the people and smiled at the girl's face! Anyway, this movie comes for everyone who is looking for a very good laugh! Anyway, he will not offend me! If I find it on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I'll buy it again, it's a classic camp! You must love this stuff!
