This is a big, ridiculous horror film that captures the essence of medium metal in the worst metal music for the postponement of the late 80s. When I was a kid, I remember being terrified by metal teenagers. When I was ten, I did not find a grave graveyard in my hometown's cemetery. This strange metal boy drank some old bodies and used bones in some strange offerings for selling. Perhaps some of the metal effects that have been exposed to me have been protected from metal, but I'm 24 years old now. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD for $ 6, and I nursed for the burial, but was surprised, ruled. All this is connected with the extravagant devil force of metal. And a guitar shoots a laser and the head of the masses needs a love scene to evaporate. If you love metal and bad movies of the 80s, this movie will make you happy. 9/10!
