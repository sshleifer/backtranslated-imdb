This movie is, in my opinion, the weakest movie in the original Star Wars trilogy, for a variety of reasons. But at the end of the day, it is defective, despite all its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> One of the problems here is the appearance of the movie. This is not the view of the movie, it is very compatible with the other 2 movies. I put a lot of things on the way of producer Gary Kurtz. In the first two films, dirty, all-tech look and so on. There is. On the other hand, even in the Jedi, the rebels also came out of the shower and dried their uniforms dry. This is for less technological film. The creatures were also extremely destructive and cutesy. <br /> <br /> In this regard, film directors are more concerned about creating a template for future performance figures compared to the quality of the film itself. <br /> <br /> Another aspect is its lack of originality. "Star Wars" created a new experience in the movie industry and Empire repeated the location of the first film "Jedi", which brought us to the world of marshes, ice and clouds. At first, we returned to the desert planet Tatooine, and then we meet them with another star of death (maybe the emperor does not think of anything new ... but Lucas or Kasdan). Also, we have these ewoks, really made up of "unfair" matt teddy bears, in a recurrent version, because of the great wookie fight at the end of Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The most unsuccessful part of Jedi for me is the poor management of Han Solo. However, he fights to appear on the coast of the first 2 movies, but sells a liner with droids. Instead of a real drama, Han was still thinking that Lean loved Luka - it never happened as he did not confess the love of the Empire. The whole thing is flawless, and the Solo character hides the fact that it is not part of the film's central story after its release. Ford, for himself, looks bored and has no style that differentiates his previous speeches. It resembles Ford's performance in the 1990s. Fisher looks high in some scenes for his own part. Lando is an interesting character presented in the "Empire", where he remained as a careless man in a giant cosmic battle. Just because Hamill has an interesting development in Luke's character, he can really do something new and interesting with his character. Perhaps he was the only actor in the film that still cares about his work. The scenario gives him more than other symbols to be fair. Indeed, his story and other characters are just as part of the package. Ian McDiarmid works perfectly with the Emperor. <br /> <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> It's hard to find a mistake other than the "clean" look of everything from a preset and effective point of view. Jabba is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most prepared. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film succeeds on its successes. But it is part of a fun and IMHO that is far superior to any of Lucas's next productions.
