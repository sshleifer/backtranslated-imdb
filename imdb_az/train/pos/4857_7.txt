This movie appears to have been prepared as Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movie - spells, dance numbers, zippy music and all the formulas ... Other than Ginger! It is definitely not clear that the team is a reunion, but one of these films has a look. Instead of ordinary sidekicks for Fred Burns and Allen (like Eric Blore or Edward Everett Horton) - although they are known as a comedy team, they are able to read and dance pretty well. It really shocked me, but the team was a nice addition and some of the traditional Fred and Zinger numbers were with Fred and Gracie, or both with George. Only once, finally dance with Miss Fontaine Fred, but with a very short and long camera shooting. <br /> <br /> And while talking to Burns and Allen, I think that's what you are talking about in the movie. I have never been an admirer of their shows or films. In general, Gracie's feeling of immorality is very boring, and I've given some bad ideas to their shorts and full-length movies. But in this movie, I did not think I was big - I do not just dance, but I think it's really funny, and Edward Everett has poured the hole in Horton very well. <br /> <br /> Now, as the rest of the movie, there's something very entertaining and entertaining. The problem for me, though, was that Joan Fontaine was not a good choice for the movie - just because he was out of range (after all, he was not a singer or a dancer) a lens ball screen presence. Therefore, there was no ordinary balance and great boy-girl dialogue. Harry Watson had a very good performance as a devil boy who did everything he could to win the cup - because he wanted to win a bet! And finally, I like the sequence of Fun House and Love Tunnel - it's hard to describe, but it's fun to watch! In general, I liked the movie very much - there was a lot of charm and perfect writing. Unfortunately, it also demonstrated a mild performance by Mrs. Fontaine, who shook one point.
