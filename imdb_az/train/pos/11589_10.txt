Man, I liked this movie! It really takes me back when I'm a kid. Teachers were still in the real-time real-time classroom movies, and if they were good, they would slowly release the movie so you can watch it back. I still remember one of the opening lines ... "It was Tutazemin's name and she was an orphan, she lived with her sister in the village." It's a nice movie for kids and is like a red balloon. In the end, other Indian children are tied to Tutazemaya and eagle. He begins to live as he wants. He blew the heavens.
