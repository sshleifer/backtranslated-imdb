This is a nice movie that is affordable for all young people, though the access to youth (at least I saw in the print) remained indifferent using some unsuccessful selection of English sub titling! For most of the film, it is almost impossible to define a certain amount of time - no modern technology, even everywhere, Chinese bikes, just a push, almost monochrome, daily life, on the contrary, a striking Sezuan opera and a festive fireworks show. Even if a group of soldiers tells them to go to a war tram, it can always be the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then a car car - in the late 30s and early 40s - we think that we are watching a Chinese because of huge sediment and that most of the world we see are swept in the disaster of the Second World War and the Communist Revolution. <br /> <br /> What strengthens the desire of the central character to adhere to the old traditions and traditions. However, the film also raises vital issues today, even in China and other countries. Part of the world: Inequality between men and women, between men and women; trade for various purposes in young children; corruption in society; unfairness; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm reading this movie very much; but I do not think so! <br /> <br /> I also think that these calibration films are a scandal that is not often displayed in the UK, and dross is considered a quality material. <br /> <br /> But do not get me started. .
