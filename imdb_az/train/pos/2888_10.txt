Any older aged child to sit in front of the screen, this beautiful and cheerful, will re-write Grimms's legend, captured with beautifully drawn pictures and beautiful music. They will read "Full Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo", but they will not be able to prepare a complete sentence, and will continue to read until death. This is a classic for all children, especially young ones in the heart.
