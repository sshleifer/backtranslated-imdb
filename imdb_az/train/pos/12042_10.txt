...........) When I see this movie, I'll watch this movie again, not a bad movie, but because I'm so scared! As I said, when I was 14 years old, when English teacher decided to show us this, <br /> <br /> When the "black woman" leaves the window and enters the Kidd bed, all the girls in my class TERRIFIED Kidd, when you find a toy soldier under your pillow and you have something to scare us that hears the voice of a child, for you ". This scene still keeps me going so far, about 7 years after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are frightened easily, DO NOT LIKE THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
