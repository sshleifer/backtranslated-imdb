I do not pay attention to the bad details of this kind of rain, the rocks of this movie! <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad movie, very moving. I do not want to talk much, I'm not going to get away from the plot, but I will say that: the film is very realistic, there are many romantic relationships that solve these problems, many families are described in the movie. I see it as realistic and real, and I see that the film is moving more and more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So it's not just a movie for teens, Id, it's all about age groups. And all is not so dark, there are some great music in the movie, band performing scenes and sexy entertainment scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
