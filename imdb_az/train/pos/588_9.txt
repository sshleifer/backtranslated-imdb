I saw all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated the love of the American people and land. Red River runs along the A River, demonstrating the lyric romanticism and visual glory of Montana's high Rocky Mountains, as well as the 19th-century landscape artist of Thomas Moran and Albert Bierstadt. This film loves visual and textual love by Norman Maclean and loves the surprising camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent Kiss, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> Redford's shooting is perfect. Rev. Tom Skerritt is a man who creates a family of educational methods, as well as a family that reflects the same problems of interaction between Brenda Blythen, mother and son Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt. MacLean. growing teenage children, and then complex youth. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally convincing, like fishermen and brothers who are united with love for each other. A River for explanation of a missing story in the many Hollywood movies produced in recent years, so men, fathers and sons, brothers and females are links with the outside world. <br /> <br /> These relationships are particularly specific, Redford provides the language we speak in dialogue. When you connect with the magnificent Montana Rivers and Mountains, it is a wonderful script screech to hear and hear. Words and settings are equal to the output of a casting to the material. The idea of ​​flying fishing can be a single device for centering a story, although there is no such thing as Redford's director. Considering the material, Redford is a much easier era and worth reevaluating.
