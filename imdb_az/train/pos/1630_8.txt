I can be one of the few really involved in this movie. I also saw this movie when I came out and agreed with the latter that "The Acedemy Up" was its way from the very beginning. The film itself is humorous, pure MAD magazine. I do not know why MAD is behind this feature. He is one of the few films that have been filming with punk and new wave tape from L.A. in the early 80's. I have a soundtrack and I am always playing. What can I say? There is definitely the worst movie ever. I do not think Porki is so entertaining to the Academy, there are really good laughs throughout the movie, and jokes fall into stereotypes or floors. Hey, no one said this would be Malta Falcon.
