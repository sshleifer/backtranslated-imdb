Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. Fried a few weeks ago. I did not look at anything at all or did not even see it, because in the "Swedish movie" category (typically) it falls, and we do not have any doubts about those who hold me (like me) by the production of Hollywood. What is hell? The film touches me, because it only saves my hope, and humanity can change in a better way. The Swedish village is an example for all the places where people live together, controlling the ability to read, meet, and read, not religious, misconceptions, indifference, predictions, secretive cruelty. a tire from abroad, to erase everybody's mask, and to live in the lives of all of us. I never stop to see stories like this, because my hope continues as it is shown above. Gabriella's song is one of my five minutes, including his story, including his performance! I would like to thank Kay Pollak for just 5 minutes, that made me happy!
