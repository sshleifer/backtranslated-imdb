This is a work of B / W 35mm film. <br /> <br /> This movie is a strange look at how you can start at the bar at 7:35 and how much it will take about 8 minutes a day. <br /> <br /> Strangely, you are using a complex story. very few elements and step-by-step understands that something is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> <strong> European street, black and white, low budget. Do not be scared by this. <br /> <br /> Because the film is only 8 minutes (full) and I do not want to say that much to say. to spoil it. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> 10/10.
