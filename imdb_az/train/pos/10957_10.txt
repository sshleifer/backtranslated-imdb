This show will probably not appeal to anyone. Sarah does what she wants; he does not require permission and he does not apologize. It's a sitcom with a team of zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars and a man playing a wallet. The star of the show is not a hero, it's a spoiled, great devious. If you can not appreciate the unusual humor you are presenting, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn, Comedy Comedy comedy, Jay Johnston, Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon's creative energies (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also demonstrates the best skills of channel101.com. (If you take part in this show, wait for the "Affiliate Media Office" in March and get it from the same talent pool.) Watch Sarah Silverman's show. This is the future of entertainment.
