Stargate SG-1 is a Stargate device and watching interactive research by SG-1 through all the unexpected surprises on the other side of the worm nose. <br /> <br /> This series is the first few seasons when it comes out for the first time, but I did not know how good this series was, 10 years after seeing a recent episode. My old impression was not a series, but the impression was more than the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a simple fantasy series, one of the best-designed, exciting, long-running, exciting fantasy figures. And why? <br /> <br /> This serial value is superior to the film built on it, but I think it's a good example of having a medium-sized television. can provide something that does not work in the film's time limitation. Created by a long-time series, it's a striking thing to watch the characters and their situation progressing over time and are added to the ability to stop the incredible, and this is the result of the great writing of the whole crew and many sacrifices. Stargate SG-1 offers great adventures over the last 10 years, but has never been afraid of the complexity of the plot and has allowed many different periods of demonstrations: <br /> <br /> First few the season was likely to focus more on the exploration of planets and different situations, probably 4/5, keeping the episodes closely aloof. always experiencing the threat of Goaul. <br /> <br /> - From 5 to 7 there were more episodes to fight Goaul and prevent attacks on the Earth. After this season, exploration of the planets was almost an excuse to put sg-1 in the Goaul / replicator / ori conflict. The 8th season is probably the most mixed. There is an episode of episodes containing events in a small area, which is even referred to as stargate, but there are great replicator moments in the final episodes. <br /> <br /> In the 9th and 10th years, the same enemy and no Jack O'Neil have. <br /> <br /> The first few episodes of the 10th season are a bit weak, but also good durability because they appear to be less than SG-1 and a battle lost after the Battle of Man / Jaffa in Ori . After 7 seasons, intelligence has often flooded the background of the planet's potential (epizod) and the secret of its secret. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> rests in a beautiful way as soon as the quality ends, and the emotions that I feel can continue; It was all the great experts involved and the series narrative offered a lot. <br /> <br /> The last season, returning to the original nature of the series, was very remarkable and most unpleasant, but in the end it was. <br /> <br /> In the end I love everything, it's hard to find out. But the great picture drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the past 10 years is a beauty and truth that longing for the crew, the prominent actors and the symbols we always remember. Collectively for SG-1.
