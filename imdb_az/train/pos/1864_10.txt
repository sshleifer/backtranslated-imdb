I just watched Antwone Fisher at BRAVO. A strange movie and incredible young man. This film is a must for anyone who is involved in abuse and abolition of juvenile delinquency. Denzel Washington is performing a great performance with a young man playing Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert - feeling good and tearful. The most heartwarming moment is when he responded to his mother, who was taken from her two months. And one of the courageous men rose to his aggressive mother and brother. In 2008, I saw this movie in Bravo and I only wish I knew it before. An absolute movie to add to the DVD collection.
