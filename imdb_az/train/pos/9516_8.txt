Tom Hanks never saw him. Hanks Michael Sullivan plays "The Angel of Death". He is cunning for Surrogate's father, an old Irish parliamentarian for John Rooney (Paul Newman). Sullivan's younger son, Tyler Hoechlin, witnessed his father's actions for a lifetime, and both of them were on the road for seven weeks slipping through the intentional killing of Sullivan's spouse and other son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer who wants to kill Sullivan himself for a chance to collect photographs of dead mobs. The drama of the 1930s dramatizes a dramatic drama.
