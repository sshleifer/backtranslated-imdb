Most Italian hate lovers hate this movie because they have nothing to do with the first two Demons. And with the name "Demons III", one will accept it. The point is that this movie is never going to be part of the Demons series. Distributors only make money for the popularity of other films titled "The Ogre", titled "Demons III". The new American DVD version of this picture has a box of "Demons III: Ogre", but the film itself only says "Ogre". I do not know if past releases are the name of "Demons III" for the film, but this new freedom seems to be just a little white lie. If you can overcome the topic "Demons III", you can use "The Ogre" a bit. It starts with a creeping application and stays pretty creepy throughout. No eye and movie movie is slow, but I still win. Do not expect to be just like other Demons movies. I can give 10 to 7 of The Ogre. Italian fans should test it.
