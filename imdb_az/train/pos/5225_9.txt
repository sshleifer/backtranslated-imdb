I think this movie is a very funny movie and it's one of the best 'National Lamp' movies, but it's a very attractive fame that summarizes what the whole film is about. The story is part of many films, including the film, Will Smith. I'm not going to end it, but when it comes to a very good end, it's a very happy beginning (Leslie Nielsen style humor), especially when it comes to collecting garbage dumps (Litter Cans). There is also a very cool garbage bag (Garbage collector) in that area. It should not be imagined, in fact, it's not very good, but that's funny, a comedy, it's empty! I love this story line, partly because it's been taken up to date and partly, it's interesting to see how thin (or untidy) it is and they're erasing all other movies. I'm an admirer of serious spoof films, but I'm also a fan of something really good and can decide what's best for these films, mostly filming (previously reviewed) or a real movie, but in fact when you're a parody of comedy films making it even more difficult, but this movie succeeds. The two garbage men are very funny, and reminds a television sketch of Little Britain in the UK. This movie is important to your collection and so far the best, fun, funniest, best story is one of the movies of the National Lamp!
