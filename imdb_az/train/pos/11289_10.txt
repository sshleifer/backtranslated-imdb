There is a good thing about a 1934 film that can be found on the head and shoulders of every Tarzan movie, including the extravagant and dull film of the 1980s, Greystoke. Tarzan and his Mate are thrown out as a firefighter offering non-stop action, humor, and romance, despite the fact that the viewer has passed the first three scenes. Maureen O'Sullivan, like Jane, is charming and beautiful and walks around the movie. Weismuller is also solid. Be advised.
