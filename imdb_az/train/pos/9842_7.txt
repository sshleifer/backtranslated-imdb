The glacial slides inside the unladen ice castle send three symbols of the never-ending moist slide tube, which has a sufficiently strong enough to spark the eyes of the kids in the same way as to captivate the audience of the star gate in 2001: Space Odyssey. Miles is different in the vision, but it is a great excitement and exciting scene. A magnificent opening sequence also tries to hide the sad valentine, as sponge. Perhaps you've seen this scene on the trailer, but as the weather goes up, the mountain collapses and the results begin when a drag begins, the domino effect. The horror continues as if it were just trying to overcome the impossibility. <br /> <br /> The film follows two heroes: a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a leggings geared by John Leguizamo to the south. They find a baby they find and then decide to follow the main figures. These include a sword cutter called Diego (Denis Leary) to bring the baby with the predator to the tiger clan, bringing the mammoth and the trap to the trap. Diego's meat-eating family wants a mammoth, but Diego's values ​​of friendship finally make it easier for him to do what he wants at the end. <br /> <br /> Throughout the trip, there are fatal natural hazards throughout the world, including a shooting volcano and a glacier bridge, which threatens to flare at once, reminiscent of Shrek's escape. The characters could have called Big Chill or Nippy Era when they thought they were doing what they were doing in the Ice Age. Some heroes wish future global warming. Another great line on mating between comrade comrades: "All great guys are never around, sensitive ones eat." Dark lines make it a lot easier to watch, with a whimsical comedy and light-haired adventure. Also, there are very few good vegetarian people who value food and meadows as 'good meals'. <br /> <br /> Romano, Leguizamo and Leary's vocal abilities are beautiful in men, children will be delighted with their antiques, and adults will adapt their own talents to their abilities. There are some moderate violence and intense content, but children will be punished with excitement and will receive one of the good and evil old-fashioned evil, and the family's tradition and friendship are thematic. Animators also make a great use of beautiful fantasy landscapes. <br /> <br />
