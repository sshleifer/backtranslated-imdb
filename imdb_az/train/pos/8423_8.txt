Thats My Bush thought, first of all, was a fun show by Parker and Stone. Very often very funny and very terrible and terrible. South Park fans will definitely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the production value here. This should be a lot of money and it shows. Many expensive details. It's not a little show. And the Comedy Center is not a very rich channel, but they have put a lot of things on this show. I understood a little, that it is costly than the death of the show. This, of course, could have been spent more and more on the will. <br /> <br /> Critics liked it and had a small fanbase, but reached a huge audience. As you know, the show is almost 1 season that stopped after 8 episodes. <br /> <br /> I have a mistake as the show really liked it. The problem of show is a kind of thing that really does not want to be. At the same time as a sitcom and sitcom tries to be a parody. Actors do a good job, some of them stay in good shape, but in my opinion, they will not get 100% of the strange humor that they always offer. <br /> <br /> I personally think that there are some characters falling down to show for the show. There are Kyle and Stan in the South Park, and it's a real relationship in the looney universe. I think the South Park works. You need some bad characters that you can really associate with, and it makes the crazy things more exciting because you are forced to take them at a level. If everything is hard to access emotional show of archetypes and stereotypes, this is really the biggest problem of Thats My Bush. Kyle and Stan are characterized by the viciousness shown in South Park. There is nothing like this here, and this show is suffering. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Parker and Stones are flirting with Republicans. The only thing I want to do is to do the same. Bush does not describe anything as simple Homer Simpson. Characteristic character. There is a kind of destructive thing in the world that can not stand it and think it is the worst president after Nixon, and Letterman and parallel comedy. so satirizes just about every move ... but it is difficult to understand if Parker and Stone really mean something. We have a joke like him, but it does not point out. This is unusual because it does not remind you of the true Bush. <br /> <br /> Besides, the show is very pleasant. Some of the jokes here are cheerful. Pro-life pro-life, a surviving surviving fetus, is probably one of my favorite jokes by any of them. And the show is packed with great stuff and sometimes sometimes insanely funny when using your head while watching.
