I watched episodes that were not broadcasted on the Internet and I was very sorry that the show would not go back. It had the best arm of talented, talented actors and a beautiful chemistry. It seemed to all the actors that they were personal friends in real life. Toward the end of the show, the show was attractive, sexual and high. Of course, some of the story lines are not real, so ... Heroes are all unpleasant and root for them. The show recalled a line between two other favorites: "Sex and City" and "Hell". Great kudos for all the cast. Note to ABC executives: Nielsen rating data does not show the right results. The show will be more spectators. I was very disappointed with the big networks to stave off reality-TV or teenage-oriented shows. We have to go to HBO or FX, why get mature, thoughtful, good-looking material? I would like to thank the network for placing only episodes online. The new streaming media will gain more popularity among the audience.
