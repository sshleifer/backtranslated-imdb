It's always nice to see Angela Bassettin play a role to immerse teeth. He is sometimes tense, funny, and even sexy in the role of a "colored" woman Lena, who is sometimes forced to give a Cape Moodbank home to Cape Cape, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at being a sympathist as his partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah Boesman and Lena give a beautiful n√ºanced performance as a stranger who discovered a new residential area. You will not be able to see the clever movie, which often deals with mature subjects. Although based on a single play, the late director John Berry (also directed to Claudine) is filming a wide-screen Cinemascope movie and opening the material. It also keeps track of things that are fun to see, as well as limiting the creativity of actors and showing only what is shown in the game. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry could have nominated Angela Bassett for the Oscars. This is definitely a movie to be searched.
