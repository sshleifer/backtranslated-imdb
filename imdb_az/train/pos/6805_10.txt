I liked this movie. Good deeds done! Great acting and drama and historically accuracy. I love Romy Schneider movies. These rocks are not as big as Sissi, they are still rocks! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and dubbed French. Well, this is not a French movie, first of all. So yeah. Secondly, it was an event, perhaps not familiar with your history. Oh and her mother played a part of her teacher, not a teacher. <br /> <br /> In this film history is very big, I love historical films and Queen Victoria is very interesting. !! I love all the historical artifacts. Like a boy who wants to manipulate his mother. She ran and met her future spouse and she showed a "new kind of dance" waltz. When the waltz was new, it was considered a scandal because the couples were very close. But his teacher was my god! <br /> <br /> I love dresses as well. The styles are large and the hoop skulls are horrific. And of course Romy always looks very nice.
