I have not started to read the Classics in literature until the age of 47, although it is never too late. Jane Eyre liked me very much, mostly because I did not have a portion of the book that I loved less, and I had more parts. The 1985 mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I could hope for. In 2006, I saw it as a full-length movie. Dalton's' Mr. Rochester was very good, but I really liked Zelah's 'Jane Eyre'. I have been disappointed with production, direction and dialogue when faced with another "Classic" movie that I have seen lately. He remained loyal to Hollywood's arrogance and arrogance. The artistic license of major works in literature is not a short summary of plagiarism. It is fraud to use the title after this license. Leave this to the UK to get this right (among others). You will not be able to read the book without restoring it with the proper content and spirit of the film. Yes, BBC.
