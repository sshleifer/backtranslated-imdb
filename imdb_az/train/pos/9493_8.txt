White Horse is going to do so for it. Together with Larry Bird, Robert Ginty climbed up from the other low-budget campaign by inclining his hair with incredible hair and super spatial mustaches. The charisma in it makes Tom Selleck look like a powder. Ginty, when touching everyone, comes into play with a diamond-prime story, the movie just rises up awesomeness. Then add Fred Williamson, some frontal bush, chain attacks and some exquisite incest themes .... this flick is delivered on all cylinders. If you are looking for some awesome B-Action, this is where it is. Now you can take my hands on my votes.
