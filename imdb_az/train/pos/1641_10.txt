I've seen PBS 25 years ago. It was very difficult to watch. So real. There was a heart attack in the winter to watch this small family struggle. Never for a long time: Fate has thrown us down and we have put our shoulders on stones and have worked. It was based on the daily journal of a woman I read many years later. As for the agenda, all the disasters and deaths of their parents, when they are less, should work on the farm to feed themselves. She has learned to mackle a non-lady. No princess was afraid she would not want a seductive, sunny, brown, handsome woman, but she was happy to know how to regain her new husband and she was delighted to do so. Both were widows and tried to build a new home together. It was so sad when my baby died. Of course, if it's today, I'm sure it would be good. It only affects the tragedy. I was very cried. But then they went out and successfully produced a new calf. Spring goes out and life goes on. There were two boys on the agenda and lived.
