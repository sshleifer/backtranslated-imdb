This film is only staring at Jared Harris's outstanding paintings by John Lennon. Harris does not know Lennon's appearance; his behavior, expression, stance, accent and attitude is pure Lennon. The Best Scene: Lennon, Paul McCartney & Wings's Silly Love Songs is a sparring in a local caf√©, with an extravagant fanatic that says he deserves # 1 in America.
