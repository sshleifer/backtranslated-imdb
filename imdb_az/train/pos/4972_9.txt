LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I've seen in 2000 and I see something better this year. This beautiful tragicomedy, prepared by the Belgian film director Benoit Mariage, is set in Wallonia industrial wastelands. Benoit Poelvoorde plays a father who wants to win a car for him (a Lada!). To do so, her son should not break the record doors. Your dad is really one of his son, because he has never never been a local news reporter for a newspaper called L'Espoir. Of course, nothing is planned. Although this movie is better, it can be compared to Aki Kaurismäki's SENSITIVITY. Just as in the film, the sound is more spectacular than the unhappiness, the surprise and the ending. This humor is not unfounded and Mariage finds striking images in artificial invisible temptations. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is by Poelvoorde. This actor was also famous for its classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS. Since then, he has only played two smaller films in the Netherlands, which he said in his interview that he did not agree with his ability to act, and all his roles were Ben's character reprisals. There must be no doubt about his player after returning to his lead role at LCA. He is just enough to make a family miserable and illuminated as a bad man, but enough to understand what he's doing, and enough to break up with it humbly. A must see.
