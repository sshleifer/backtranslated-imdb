Before watching this movie, I heard a lot about the movie and there were scenes in the movie, but it did not do it for me to listen. Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, John Voight, and Burt Reynolds are preparing for a group of people who are like hell to shoot a striking series of events that transpires the Cahulawassee River and everyone. Character development requires a little time to cover the audience with a better understanding of each individual, but ultimately you recognize these children as friends. Acting is very realistic, as close to reality as dialogue can get for Hollywood actor. Reynolds's character was as interesting as a man who was very tough, but Lewis seemed to be in the spotlight as a man with a very soft and distorted man under the manly coating (it was affected by my performance!) John VOICE is seen in the center of attention, and every corner of it looks really found in the mold, to transform into a human being (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox seem to be silly lunkheads who do not really want to joke around and they are not as terrifying as it does not seem to be ... I was really impressed by the director Boorman's look at Dickey's novel and was very impressed. You can not go all your life without watching this movie. I gave him eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
