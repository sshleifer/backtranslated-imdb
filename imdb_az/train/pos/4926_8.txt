Elia Kazan, one of the country's best theater directors, has shown that the film is equally at home. With Panik on the street, Kazan then offers a future version, perhaps a masterpiece, on the "Water Coast", while both films share water only because they are different ideas <br /> <br /> Dear, Kazan, He hit New Orleans. Adaptation by Edward Fuchs, Edna and Edward Anhalt's stories, which is the basis of the film, draws attention to the fact that when visiting the "The Big Easy", no tourists take them to places where they have no courage. One of the great assets of this movie is the magnificent black and white cinematography by Joseph MacDonald, who bestows New Orleans. Also delivers a nice touch of music by Alfred Newman and Song's Procedures by Billie Holiday. <br /> <br /> This film could have been shot in New York or another North Big City <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One thing is clear in the film that Jack Palance screen for the first time, each time you print the screen. Someone sees him. He was very tense! At the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side to him when he sees his ill fellow, and when he is caught in a deadly illness. Blackie relieves the sweaty face of this man and leaves her hands in the fatty hair of the dead. It is also remarkable that Mr Palanes and Mr Mostel have seen their actions because both actors have looked real. <br /> Presentation of the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see a family man with furniture with his young son. She later discusses how she and her husband are, so many families are able to deal with each other every day. When Richard Widmark plays a normal man, this player is not as effective as playing a more cunning and intense man. Barbara Bel Geddes, as his wife, sounds like a suburban woman in Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The film is a pleasure thanks to Mr. Kazan's direction and the excellent voice of the movie.
