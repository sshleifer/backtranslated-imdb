A few weeks ago I saw this movie and it has remained to this day. Unfortunately, two spellbinding characters in a mediocre documentary. To get the real story of Beales, I have to go through all the bonus materials and comments on the DVD and make a search on the internet. <br /> <br /> Maysil and their supporters (Edith and Edie, not celebrating themselves) are kufr, talking about the true meaning of the film because it thinks it is exploited. Little effort has been made to explain Beales or their situation - Meysles's approach seems to be just about opening up the camera and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something ugly. When the criterion is released again, the voice is poor and difficult to watch. Although this film was made early in the documentary film, it is ironic to compare the Geraldo Rivera's (!) Superior sequence to the sexual exploitation of mentally retarded patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten since 1972. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Edith and As for Edie, what I thought while watching the movie was "hell their family"? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy and dangerous conditions. What can Jackie O (or the rich Bouvier's family) marry to one of the richest men in the world to get a decent home for Edith and Edie? Or at least one part-time household servant or caregiver to access and keep them both eyes? <br /> <br /> This care may sound worse, though I recommend Gray Gardens to anyone using documentary films. Beales and a rich Backstory (in 1970) Hamptons will bring the entire bottom of the society - maybe one of them will come one day and documentary about this documentary.
