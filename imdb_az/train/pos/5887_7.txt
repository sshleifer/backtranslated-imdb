So Mary and Rhoda are old - who does not? Mary was a young man when she was premiered and was a "young adult" while leaving the air. Yes, Mary and Rhon liked to be together, and maybe it was not possible for the movie to support the comedy in the original series, but there were enough moments to remind the spirit of the array. Example: A manufacturer who does not want to consider a new set of "old men" who hires Mary and then does. Is not it typical of Hollywood TV's mentality and "beast counters" on the film today? This can be the best MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW - but it's a pretty damn good look at one of the best shows we've grown in the 70s.
