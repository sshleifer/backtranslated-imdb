This movie is like hell! In my opinion, this movie was written as a serious film, but when it comes time to the movie, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, throw some humor and decorate it!" He said. Heroes are really less developed. Oh, and the dying line is good. Despite the fact that something I hated was a hair dryer. What was all this?
