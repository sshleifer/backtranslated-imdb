My personality really liked this movie and, in particular, transferred me. <br /> <br /> The characters between Barbra Streisand and Kris Christofferson are very striking, and this is just as great as the song. <br /> <br /> I was not surprised when I learned that she won five golden world awards (Golden Globes, the most award-winning film), Oscars, and even Grammy. This film is a classic that can be seen by everyone. A great movie, often criticized (perhaps, like Streyzand, of course, as "co-director"). His art work is the greatest art, and he will surely ask you!
