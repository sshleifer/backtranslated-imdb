Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are perfect couples and featured in this film in a unique charisma. <br /> <br /> This is a typical "alternative" or indie movie with a structure that has a rare condition that turns suddenly. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average boy with an old camera and his main hobby is to shoot photographs of exotic residents of a small town. Suddenly an alternative artist <br /> <br /> Pecker's life remains unchanged, and the glory appears to frustrate the city's main inspiration, Pecker. <br /> <br /> This is an Indie movie that has an edge, but not for everyone. <br /> <br /> It may seem dull or ambitious to some people, but I still think it deserves a watch because it offers something different than the typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> In a few words: This is the typical Kristina Ricci and John Waters movie. That's it. <br /> <br /> Because I say that the Grace boards are really annoying. Geez.
