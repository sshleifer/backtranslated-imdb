People condemning the film are people who do not understand how to start the film. People who love film affection and who do not star in Leonardo DiCaprio are the ones who have a negative impact on the film. <br /> <br /> Wilder Napalm is primarily a film that can be primarily cunning, and some are not fraudulent. <br /> <br /> Especially the use of music that played a major role in the movie affected me. Filmmakers see how important the film is in the background and in the background of Vida and Wilder. The topic of Wilder, Vida's theme and Wallace theme are heard in the opening sequences and it's funny how some words are played. For example, on the stage where men perform "Earl of Duke", Vida goes to Vida and then to Wallace when she reads something like "She is my daughter", she lyric her "she will be my daughter" with a sense of tension between the two brothers This film is a bit like this movie and it may look like a flop in the outside, and the film's true student sees how good this movie really is.
