Tiempo de valientes is a very entertaining action comedy. After a great fist film named El Loso del Mar and the spectacular TV program Los simuladores, Damian Szifron made another great job. Teymur de Valientes, for moments, looks at a film made in Hollywood .Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and they have great performances here. The film is very entertaining and has funny and very beautiful moments. Tiempo de valientes is a wonderful action comedy <br /> <br /> Congratulations on all the capabilities of the Sensitive. <br /> <br /> 9
