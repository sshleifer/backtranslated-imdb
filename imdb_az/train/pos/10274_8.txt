CLAIMS This is a film that draws on grifters. But who is here? When does the hunter turn plain? This dark, dark film moves slowly and is appealing. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it pulls you down and just dropped you down, just as you think you're safe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I loved this movie because I usually do not see it. Nature, but it squeezed me and closed it until the end.
