We watched this in a series of Women's Health Problems, pointing out how many women were treated at low levels in men and I absolutely loved this movie. I'm trying to get a copy of it myself. The story touches a lot and I recommend it to everyone. I'm an admirer of different cultures, and this movie was what I needed. This is a film for the whole family, despite its rating. This is a movie that will show my kids. The professor of our classroom was primarily intended to inform women, but it was more of a movie. This is one of my favorite movies that will remain forever.
