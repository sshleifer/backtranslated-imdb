There are no stories in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a spark hung up and hangs like a bird, put it on a podium until the poke, shake it with a loud sound, pour boiling oil on it, wound its wounds, pull it with a fork and then finally <br /> <br /> This movie was very real that I did not know that it was a fake, I thought it was a poetry movie. Despite this regret, I liked it very much. He was afraid of me. I think he fills some goals. I give it 10/10.
