Finally, I finally fell around her and saw the "pure" copy of Pakeeza! Until now, I've only got a fluidly scratched jerky shaking version of Dubai TV with strange English subtitles, wide-screen coverage of headaches and her own minds. <br /> <br /> Considering that such a poor (and short) copy waits for a good idea in the world, he has been happier than expected and enjoyed a full 140 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that Meena Kumari's film was originally planned from the start and since 1958. In 1971 I realized it. He said that chronic alcoholism finally killed him after his death and was actually very wrong. Some scenes in the satellite should pair one body. <br /> <br /> In some scenes, the glasses are definitely showing on her side. The Wisdom of Life compared to the evil I can only treat as fiction without anything far away, but I have come to understand that it is a world in which India should now be widespread. It is a bright and colorful film with a simple relentless epic message, but also an intense romantic tragedy with a sense of simultaneous sensation. But for me, this is an unmatched golden melody by Ghulam Muhammad, the unknowable Lata Mangeshkar, particularly Thare Rahiyo, and attends the opening of this story, which made this movie outstanding. I have rarely played such a serious, beautiful, poetic, spectacular sound and play in any movie. In the rain Singin may be my favorite music movie, but Pakeeza has my favorite music - yet Lata said that the songs are not something special for them. Unfortunately, though, with Lata a classic duet, there was only one song of unique Mohammed Rafi. <br /> <br /> All this, however, is not blind because of her mistakes, but the Indian movie I love from Pakeezah has picked up the pace of India's westernization and is now being pulled at a time when Western values ​​are watched as it is sponsored by the state. At least watching Pakeeza, India, had to present "pop" music to the world before preparing for world drum machines, Bollywood Beat and bhangra.
