I recently took this movie with eBay from another LaserDiscs kit. Usually I go into war and action movies, but sometimes I love romance comedies. <br /> <br /> If you were bored by today's special FX movies and high bright romantic comedies, you should look at the store around Quiet Night in Silent Evening. It's about me that the characters have long been good. There is nothing fake or ambitious about them. Take Mr Matuschek for example: When he sees his wife is deceived by one of his employees, he tries to kill himself. Not only because of the humiliation, but also because of the persecution of Stewart's character. <br /> Yes, the purpose of the film is limited and the plot can be predicted. I still enjoyed it. If you love Notting Hill, you'll love the store on the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me more than Jimmy Stewart.
