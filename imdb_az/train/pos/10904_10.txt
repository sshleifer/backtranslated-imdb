The most creative and truly eye-catching documentary was created. He cried all the way from beginning to end. Watching the show was immediately captured by a man who struggled to live painlessly, to live a life we ​​had given them. For the first time I heard the headline, I was scared to see the program, and every day of my life I'm in pain. I really felt for her. The worst part of the documentary is that when Jonny chose his coffin. Do you think about doing this? Even though he was in an angry and unbearable pain, he opened his favor. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only people to be truly respected and surprised, he is a definition of a role model, a true and undoubted hero!
