Something that is most influential in this film is not that it is not killed in the same way as in the school, but the truth is done by young people like Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. Blair Wadley, Ben Coccio, who used camera-style, on the one hand, succeeds in bringing us to the lives of two companions who have some problems with secondary school, even though this is not exactly the case behind them. They look typical - many people hate secondary school, but what is it? Part of them does not believe in a zero-day deadly massacre. Control cameras in the school during the shooting are therefore stronger. You really do not believe that it really happened and it really happened. Handheld camera technology also creates an illusion that it is not a scripted film, but a bright idea that gives the theme.
