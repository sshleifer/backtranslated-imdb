In France, French critics are courteous to engage in a chain of links that appear behind Brian De Palma's films. A good part of the film, Carrie (1976), Fury (1978) Scarface (1983), faces bomb attacks without mentioning Hitchcock's debts. Here, it is possible to avoid "Vertigo" (1958) for a long series in the museum as "wearing outfit", and the most important moment of the elevator is the inevitability of the "Psycho" (1960) shower anthology series. . I do not want to revive old debates about our attractive film: Did De Palma leave Hitchcock? Instead, I would like to be generous and to classify De Palma in the category "Slay Outfit" along with "Sisters" (1973) and "Obsession" (1976). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If there is something called "Kill Outfit", we can get a general consensus among movie lovers, De Palma is a virtuoso in directing. He uses his camera as a filmmaker does. Its sophisticated camera work is powered by brilliant tension and the stability that causes a disturbing aura. The audience is easily pasted in front of the screen. It is ensured by the use of a few long silent sequences that all depend on the appearance and gestures. By the way, Psycho also has silent, durable parts for a long time ... <br /> <br /> However, De Palma's main base in 1980, and many formulaic, mixed It looks like a recipe for substances. Prostitution is the only crime scene. Then she was suspected by the police and had to move her (with the help of a victim's son at the subway scene) to watch the murder and prove his guilt. De Palma is a reheated menu, along with the fact that he has never used any of the unresponsive behaviors. The film's director ends with a series of films reflecting the opening. Yes, a perfect movie was shot, but when it comes to real function, one figure says: "It's almost completely filler." Perhaps he wanted to extend De Palma's film for an hour and a half, and then the audience knows who the killer is (and even earlier). <br /> <br /> De Palma's two main themes focus on manipulation and voyeurism. The latter theme is also available in the movie "Killa Mold", starting with the first scene, which looks like a mild porn movie. The film's owner, the main actress and his wife, Nancy Allen, is not afraid to film her dress. I am very skeptical about his approach to this topic. But it was originally thought to be a mirror of the audience, and De Palma wanted to mix her eye-catcher. <br /> <br /> I do not want to make any mistakes in De Palma's work. The influential work in the directorate reduces the global vulnerability of the story and its suspicious aspects, which cause a lively intervention in the film. Twenty-six years later, disputes between filmmakers are not ready for effort.
