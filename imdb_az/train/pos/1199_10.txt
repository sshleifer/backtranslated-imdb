Robert Taylor's most striking and excellent performance. It's a 14-year-old movie star, Johnny Eager. His appearances are still miraculous, but now there is a proficiency in this flawless, fierce role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of her breed, an angel hunter who killed her for pleasure, not for money. Her wild-eye killing is surprising to see people, not just humans. He is primarily a person who is in need of people around him, but he does not love it because of his sociopathic behavior. His partner goes to Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is sick of the hunt, and just because of something else. On the way, Charlie kills his family and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie does not want to give any benefit, but Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is a sad thing to watch, so he is fed with the hunt, wants to leave the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan is as beautiful as his crazy crack and drunken skins playing acrosties. Russ Tamblyn plays half an hour trying to fit in the white world. The group is a mix of both young and old good and bad. Finally, Taylor runs away from heroism because he is a great hunter in front of the horn, leaving Sandy with her. After returning from that night, Sandy was separated from her husband, causing Charlie to kill Sandy and kill her daughter for himself. The last conflict is in the snowstorm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. This is the whole way of Taylor's film, and in fact, it was actually a very unfounded actor.
