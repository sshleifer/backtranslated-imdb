Firstly, first of all, I want to say that I'm a great Sarah Silverman admirer, and others say that I'm out of the pilot. <br /> <br /> If the pilot had everything in the form of a typical Sarah Silverman, maybe it's not just funny, but the situation and delivery are counted. <br /> <br /> If you loved Jesus Christ, just like that. There is the same flow and same rhythm. True, not just for true fans, but for the sake of pleasure. <br /> <br /> Again, there is no way for true fans only. If you do not use it in its style, you are so funny. But, I hope you think so.
