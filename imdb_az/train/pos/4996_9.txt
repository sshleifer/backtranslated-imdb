I saw tons of HK actors and in the upper part of this genre. Event scenes are as interesting and kinetic as what you see in any action movie. Kung Fu is spectacular, pyrotechnics are eye-catching, stunt work is a heartbeat. Making the perfect pace, tension increases, and the liquefaction of the camcorder. Jet Li, directed by Corey Yuen, director of this film, was filled with the best works of the genre, including Fong Sai-Yuk's legend. If there is something missing in this movie there is a three-dimensional character, though Martin's leadership is the closest person. This movie is packed with many archetypes from characters - sexy murder, leak thief and his villainous girlfriend, hurricane robbers. So Shannon Lee has a great screen presence; It's good in battle, stunts and weapons. It's hard to get your eyes on the screen. He is good. Why is this woman a great star?
