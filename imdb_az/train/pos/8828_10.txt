I'm glad I came across this short movie. I have always had to come up with short films, so I saw and saw that I was a Candidate for Live Short Film at the Academy Awards <br /> <br /> I was in a really crazy movie, director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo suddenly suddenly turns into a song and dance number just as it is in movie theaters. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually attractive. <br /> <br /> A good short film, good correction and all actors are doing a great job. The final film is perfect. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie.
