Joan Fontaine Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen played in 1937 in the musician, "Not a Lifetime". <br /> <br /> The US State Department spokesman, George Stevens, quotes some of the beautiful Gershwin music, including the "Asthma" newspaper, "It's a mighty job, you can get it" and "Smoky Day." Astaire's voice sounds more powerful in this movie than others and has some great dance numbers. Burns plays on top publicist and Secretary of Allen Burns. He's cheerful. As others have noted, the problem is that Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Because Stevens dances with a long shot, he can easily use the trees and is among the trees. <br /> <br /> The dance was bad, and I thought it was double. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing despite its flaws.
