This movie is a fun, "Christmas Story" for Christmas: Halloween for both: relatively low budget, no-big-name-star-type movies ... and both are definitely one of the greatest and funniest movies available, seasonal classics !!! "Spaced Invaders" comes from the very beginning with the heat and humor and the top of the symbols ... all five Martians, Kleberker Realtor, Russell MP, Vern "Fuel Station" and more! You just have to believe in this movie and like "Christmas Story", it keeps getting better and better with just about every single scene and getting fun every time! A GREAT TEN!
