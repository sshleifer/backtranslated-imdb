This is a great movie. Every time I watch, I love it more. Many comedies can be very embarrassed for knowing all the naked ones, but mysterious men have a lot of integrity in the post and character that follows - Ben Stiller, like the tears in the lid of the lemon, or Hank Azaria declares Louise Lasser or Geoffrey Rush, furrer choreography illuminating, or refusing a kiss from Tom Waits mumbles or Janeane Garofalo Paul Reubens while watching the news - a delight. This is a perfect ensemble moving pitch. The story is straightforward and consistent, movement schemes are creative and not very dominant, all arrangements end. Seriously, if you see it and if it's a while, look again, and if you've started. You will not be able to watch it again for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, very good things on the tryouts scene!)
