My director's intuition can bring me the materials that need the right lie in the right direction. Young Mr. Lincoln is packed with several "old" values, although this is a two-dimensional image of the retrospective, at least in a more respectable, attractive cinema. It works so well with all its simplicity and majesty, as its historical lesson is really a great drama drama. <br /> <br /> We've all been letting Ibrahim Lincoln down and we know the 16th president we have been assassinated after the Civil War. But as an advocate of previous years, he is characterized by the most unexpected places, a funny, true gentleman. <br/> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <John Ford is not just about working as a storyteller. In fact, a lie is trying, but it does so in the studio system; at the same time making Zanuck happy, working independently, so he devoted himself to his brief experiments on "adjusting the camera" and did not move around to avoid going away from the story. In 1939, Mr. Smith's departure to Washington (not just laws and politics here) has the power of handling traditional wisdom that works with a material that is accompanied by a full bloody American. <br /> <br /> In the background, Ford is terrific at first and does not allow us to bring Lincoln's appearance blank. In a sense, it is the character of Lincol, as well as in Fonda's heroic grapes and Darling Clementine. Perhaps, probably, there is no one else who can play with him from that time: he is mature and wise, but in this case he proves himself to prove himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> After the young Mr Lincoln had set goals, he stood in front of Ford and his crew and threw iron; it is not a hockey, as we can imagine as an arrival, and has a strong humor and balance balance.
