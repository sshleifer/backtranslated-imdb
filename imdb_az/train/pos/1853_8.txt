Yes, it is still a movie that you play with your emotions and is unlike a rock film. But for me a good result for a sucker ... the player was very good and had many feelings. Violence is kept to a minimum that makes a change. If I were not for the salute, I'd give 9! All good movies with very good actors. <br /> <br />
