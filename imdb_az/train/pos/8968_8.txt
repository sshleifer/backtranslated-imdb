This film was like Jimmy Stewart movie, witty, attractive and very pleasant. Duke of Nova's Gillian, his performance as a beautiful witch who wants to become human, gentle, exaggerated face expressions, every movement and gesture, left Gillian's unique and somewhat dependent on us every word. Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester's high-performing performances, the writer-loving writer of the magic world (Kovacs), and romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak, the chemistry among them are great, but when it comes to chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady !!
