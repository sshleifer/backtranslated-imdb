In this film there are many brilliant and many clever humor that is instilled in actors. But after some time, this was just what Busser was trying to do for this movie (despite the great lanterns like Balasko, who continued part of the Dussolier and worked very well). Blier calls the parent Bernard Blier, who is led by Claude Brasseur, from the paradise, and has the opportunity to tell him how missed he is. Effective emotional capper and frankly heartily. But there is not really enough dramatic tension or emotional appeal to keep the rest of the film interesting during the entire work process. Some really nice scenes and sequences, and anyone who likes these "mosques of the French cinema" should use a fair amount of this movie.
