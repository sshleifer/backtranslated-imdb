All Dogs Go to Heaven, in my opinion, was the best animated film. I'm not really a big fan of cartoons, but there's something better than any other animated movie I've seen. Music is as beautiful as Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise and Ken Page performances, especially King Gator. "Let's Play Together" is probably my favorite song from any movie that I've ever seen. This should be absolutely necessary for people of all ages.
