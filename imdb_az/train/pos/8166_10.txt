This movie is very nice! The actor is good, Corbin Bernsen is a perfect dentist, perfectly dumped, ill-treated and tortured. At first he sees his wife with the head of the pool, and then becomes crazy. He takes revenge on his wife and the poolman, tortures the patients. The most special effects are wonderful even though some of them are actually fake (laid out for 1 night and are still red in the morning). But torture scenes have done absolutely good. Despite the weakness of this movie, which is very slow; Sometimes there are extreme boring parts between heavy parts. But for the true fear / tension-fan, this should definitely wait!
