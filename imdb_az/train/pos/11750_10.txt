I saw it at 86 in the theater and laughing at my head more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... Baseball with the best curse he has ever had." <br /> <br /> You know how it will cost, There's a great time to get there. Training scenes are very funny, but when the best scene is to try to make a makeup with Jack and Reno's wives, Falcons v. The Vikings may be trying to watch the Monday Night Football game. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to be very entertaining and do not miss the top staircase as a comedy.
