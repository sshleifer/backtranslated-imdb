Not accidentally, I have scanned the television channels and found this beautiful movie about two beautiful people who were drawn to each other very close and innocent. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Band" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV Series (Nicole). This guy and boy will be very warm and spiritually warm and think about how to look deeply into your past relationships and look at your heart with a boy or gall that you really love and have lost track of over the years. Jesse and Celine were well spoken and deeply involved with a major magnetic explosion. I'm waiting for SEQUEL in this movie in 2004, and if you see this movie you will feel the same way.
