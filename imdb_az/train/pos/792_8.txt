This is a refreshing, enjoyable movie. "Four Weddings and Paradise", "Peter Friends" and so on. You will see the familiar and talented actors of your favorite series. It made me laugh, it made me sad. I spend movies based on entertainment, and movies in English are generally in line with this bill. Enjoy!
