My favorite movie. Everyone's Oscar-caliber work, both behind and behind the camera. The scenario is perfect and unlike the novel, it creates a completely satisfying relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs. The care of other leading heroes is a passionate display by writer Peter Barnes and won Oscars for attractive visual beauty director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. This is Josie Lawrence's best work and Joan Plowright has changed my mind. By watching this movie at least 50 times, I can not find any fault. The music of the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennett is surprising.
