I love to play soccer and I thought this movie was great because it was a great opportunity to play. It was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad that you won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and were Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was very good when playing a coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) likes to play football, but parents can learn how to cook what they want to marry. Jazz meets with his coach Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) while playing for a soccer team. Only when his parents find anxiety strikes, his grandfather can play a big match in his sister's marriage to Pinky (Archie Punjabi). Finally, his parents know that he loves football and what he's going to do.
