Harry Callahan had to stay in the game for a long time, with an inevitable "old man" on his shoulder. The caller was sometimes brighter and exited, and his behavior was still indecisive. Fortunately, this film took some time to develop another type of story, one of which recreated Dirty Harry and the entire genre. Despite the fact that the film is short-lived, it's still a great addition to the series, even though it's somewhere in the trend of sexual fashion trends and new wave music.
