Instead of comparing this to Planet Earth, reviewers are concerned ... * Course * Planet Earth is even better - there's so much more. Earth Planet Earth is like a long trailer for the series and it's inevitably low and simplified. <br /> <br /> As long as a long-term documentary (or, in fact, a long-term thing) is far superior to what you see in your whole life (for as long as you choose) for long years with long-distance cameras to cross the earth with a helicopter and wait months in the most extreme environments it is not difficult to wait for some of the most extraordinary creatures on earth). <br /> When it comes to the story: Yes, everyone in England - I'm very much invited - I love David Attenborough and there is some excuse for not to be here, but only one star or three deserve to be destroyed. <br /> < He's not just a leader in Planet Earth, he's just a narrator, and I'm sure he is humble and gentle enough to understand that everything that goes to the audience is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Everyone who sees this everyone will be drowned in his fear, majesty and fame, and those who love it (that is, everybody) are going to buy a Planet Earth, so three hopes and a great Boooo for the freedom of cinematography are not more than the Planet Earth box, It's fairly cheap to buy, but here's where people are competing as artwork. <br /> <br /> The place is also quite large.
