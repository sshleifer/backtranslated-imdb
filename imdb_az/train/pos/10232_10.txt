After seeing the vast majority of Ringo Lam movies, we can say that it is the best film ever and most unusual. The location of an underground passage with these traps and dungeons plays a major role as any character, a piece of ancient Chin era full of kick-and-martial art. The action is fantastic, the story is intense and entertaining and the design is really memorable. Unfortunately, the Burning Paradise schedule has not been published on the DVD and is the second largest city in North America (like me), although vhs is not able to get your mitts. You can find it, do not hold it.
