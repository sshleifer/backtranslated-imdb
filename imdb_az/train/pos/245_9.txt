The only reason I wanted to see was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the movie was a great average. It's not bad, but really not very good. Making it good; the movie is well-paced. This direction is competent and reliable. The story is plodding. The film is acted on average by Ledger, Bloom and usually great Watts and Rush. If you are from the US, just go back and use the decor (or I'm saying Orlando Bloom). Despite the end of the film, I did not get bored or moved. Some people asked Ned Kelly what was happening at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have not paid attention to this issue. <br /> <br /> Generally, the only thing I can do is recommend the Orlando Bloom type, "I'm pretty and not mixed" appearance is outstanding), so fangirls can find the value of this matinee. Besides, you do not see him. It's good enough to have fun and it's not bad.
