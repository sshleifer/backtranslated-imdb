Since 1986, I've seen cables at the end of the 1980s, as a great wrestler. In the VHS, I saw that this "can be sold" and bought it. 1998 - After the Air Force I started training as a wrestler and it was always the people who participated in wrestling (roads that did not understand our family and friends, travel, heart failure, etc.). Henry Winkler is a funny and sometimes sad thing that someone can not understand what a creative genius is. A good way to separate yourself is the Fonz character he played in Happy Days. Also see the castle ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice) and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr.
