Jeff Wincott is not just a hunk, he can open the butt! This movie has one of the best martial arts movements I have ever seen. Perhaps Bridgette Nielson was not the first person to play a relentless politician, but he did a great job! And let's not forget that Wincott is a partner in this movie starring Martial arts expert / stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So, Cynthia Rothrock, not against whom? It's not good, it's better! (just look at the battlefield in a battle at the end of the movie, a word: OUCH !!). My proposal will buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you have not seen it, you will not lose some of the great martial arts movements.
