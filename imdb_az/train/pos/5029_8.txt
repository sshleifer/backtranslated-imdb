Today I went to this movie, perhaps a little tired by hack-and-slash movies on the screen. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was a pleasant surprise with a pleasant, dark atmosphere. Very striking, though, was the amount of blood actually shown. As with the best films, he puts something in mind and Bill Paxton did a great job in the directive. The scenes shot well in the camera, and after watching the episode "A scene anatomy" at the end of the video strip, some delicate, yet beautiful things I had seen were intentional and unusual, just one "Oh, that looks good, smoke" type. It's a terrifying movie. Nevertheless, many aspects of a dark topic are drawn in the daytime, and sometimes even worrying scenes. Acting is exceptional (Okay, I've always been an admirer of Powers Booth) and never goes above. Au Contraire is extremely well-functioning for such a film. If there is an area in which this film does not exist, it seems extremely slightly visible, but it still works at a much simpler level than destroying the message of the soul or movie. What is the message? It's something everyone decides for themselves. Generally, on a scale of 1-10, this movie is 8 points for those who love the southern Gothic genre (ie "Body Temperature" or "Midnight in Good and Bad Garden") and 5 't.
