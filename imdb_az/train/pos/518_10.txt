It is also known as the "Stairway to Paradise" in the United States. During the Second World War, British caretaker Peter Carter (David Niven) was shot in the battle, but he survived. He responds and is in love with the lovely June (Kim Hunter). But there was a mistake in heaven - he was dead! The French spirit comes to get him, but he refuses. <br /> <br /> In some cases, he has a brave voice, but this is actually an incredible movie. Scenario is good with actors playing roles playing in a totally straightforward way and the beautiful scenes of the world - Technicolor (I do not ever look so beautiful in the sky sky) and the scenes in paradise are black and white Niven is sometimes a little tough but Hunter is just (and very nice) and Roger Livesey helps Nivene as a physician who is trying to do so. All images are incredible (especially during stairs and last test sequences) and special effects are really great (the film's age is taken into account). Niven, a totally naked young boy puts a very odd number! This is a totally beautiful, thought-provoking movie - highly recommended. There is no shame in the US.
