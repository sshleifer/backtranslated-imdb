In honor of the 20th anniversary of the film's release, I had the privilege to watch the beautifully restored 35mm diameter Scarface on the big screen. It was great to see it on the big screen because it lost a lot on TVs and the overall limit of this project is not sufficiently emphasized. <br /> <br /> Scarface is the reconstruction of classic decorative items that Cuban has invested in the depths of the story of hell, Al Pacino, as drug lord Tony Montana. In this version, Tony Cuba is coming to America in the early 1970s and early 1980s when people are immigrating. Toni and his cohorts get a green card quickly after staying in a Cuban restaurant and a Cuban restaurant; Toni began his terrible way toward total misery. <br /> <br /> Many of the characters in this movie have played in such a talented way that over the past 20 years we have forgotten a few of these movies. Robert Luggia, the boss's patron, is Frank Lopez's beautiful. His character is very confident in his mistake and Tony quickly finds it gentle. Omar Suarez in Lopez's right hand is described by F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus), one of our greatest players. Suarez will do everything for his last pride and Frank; It's like he's not in his mind. Tony sees it soon, and he is always fighting with Suarez, but he really sees him as a minor problem. The recurring character, Melis Bernstein, is the Miami Drug Detective detective who has been executed by Harris Yulin (Training Day), always perfectly executed. Mel, the innocent large amount of money production, is made up of all aspects of the pharmaceutical industry. She plays Frankin Toni while she's with her on a scene from both Frank and Mel. Listening to Frank, who wanted Melin to interfere with Mel, is priceless because Tony just wants Mel's killing her to answer him. "This is Frank Frank, sit down." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Tony's rise is meteoric and fits quickly with acceleration and burning, with only speed and intensity. By closing Frank and taking his wife and his job, Tony misses his longing and can never be seen enough. As Tony becomes deep into the world of drugs, he can not be envied and recklessly kills his best friend and sister after falling asleep and marrying. This indicates that Tony's office was attacked by an army of traitors who were betrayed by Tony for not going through a planned political assassination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Toni, <br /> <br /> All this is a great description of extreme and cocaine culture in the 1980s. One of the fastest moving three-hour movies around DePalma has a wonderful job of keeping it in one place. Violence is extremely graphic and involves a number of scenes in the mind of any audience, especially horrible chains, at two points in the blank film and all bloody angels ending the film. This is a stylistically stylistically recommended movie for non-smoker or not recommended for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels; DePalma can all escape here.
