In 2006, Cold Blood has two new exciting contexts - a fluttering tension since 1967. First, the most heartwarming thing is that star Robert Blake has recently been charged with killing his wife. Secondly, the latest Oscar-winning biopic, Capote, has revealed a dark story of Truman Capote, the writer of this unreasonable genocide suit. These two new folding films are timely for a modern audience. <br /> <br /> Since only one film since that time, Cold Blood is the top bum in every way. Outrageous black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall (later "American Beauty" and "Free Way"). Many of the films from the nightclub of Kansas's short house or the back of the tree could have been sold as a fine art photographer. A great brooding atmosphere (even if everyone knows how it all depends on what's happening in real life), with Brooks's cracker-jack aspect and the early scene (perfectly corrupted by the innocent murder of daily life of innocent family) it will set a stage to stop without help. <b> <br> / The film is a wild one of Robert Blake's more sympathetic, but deliberately murdered couple, as well as with its dirty performance. Her terrifying childhood flashback scenes are very well done. Then she goes to the stage to the end of the movie and speaks immediately before being sent to the crowd and speaks the latest "confession." This is one of the classic movie moments, which is a perfect marriage, with excellent writing, perfect writing, and perfect photography. <br /> <br /> <strong > the motion of the murderers on the lam, and ultimately the mandatory nature of public commentary. The political message related to the death penalty is based on a brilliant description of the bloody murders and predators.
