THE FOX AND THE CHILD PENGUINS is the latest film by French Luc Jacquet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Part-the-nature documentary and party-fairy tales, L'Infant, one day going to school in a beautiful area in front of a deserted fox road, likely to pay attention to the child who watches France. said. In the coming weeks, the child's fox turns into a place where she sees her child's heart and will see the fox that has begun to call Lily in those days. And so it continues. Days will go back to weeks, then summer, then turn to winter and give a couple of superficial cinematography of sweeping, white winter scenery. Finally, the spring comes again and the young finds a fox and really creates friendship with the animal. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I have seen MARGIN PENGGULAR and film shot in the film was just frightened. Luc Jacquet is a very talented and really rare film shooter, and I was looking forward to the beautiful, breathtaking cinematography, broom vistas and wildlife. These lines were delivered. However, here's a screen writing loan from Jacquet and without knowing anything about a movie before the movie, I was expecting something slightly different from the 'beginning of March'. A fictional story. <br /> <br /> The child and the fox And the story is simple. A young, apparently single child resides in a home in the middle of nowhere and goes to school every day, even though it is perfectly in appearance. Without a visual impression. Brilliant. Thus, he fights with a fox. <br /> <br /> With such a movie you have to leave your own ideas about the movie and put yourself in the target audience shoes. This is a movie that is directed directly to children over the age of six. Or to families who are walking to cinemas in the afternoon of a sexually explicit market. It's not a 31-year-old man, starting with movies like the latest, bright WANTED and so on. But still being a London critic, I put myself in the shoes of an eight-year-old girl for Fox and Calle 95 or few minutes. Now I have some problems with this movie. As a 31 year-old boy and loyal lover of everything in cinematic things, I loved wildlife and landscape photography. It's visually striking. You can bridge the direction of the animal symbols in any of the Attenburton's efforts. I liked the first half hour, as an impression of an eight-year-old, a short attention - then I was interested. It's a bit of a recurring and somewhat annoying place for a small child, especially in places where it's pretty dark. As a 31-year-old man, I was a little scared of places. Wuss. <br /> <br /> So, it's not a child's movie. It's not really an adult movie and I feel a little down. Is a good family movie? Connected. Maybe you can study and the movie is a message. It's definitely not a movie I'm going to pay for hard earned green to see, and I close my mind to shoot my films to try it out. It is difficult, but I know that some will begin to see and love this movie. I feel very European and, of course, if you are a fan of wild nature, try it out. Is it true? Yes, I would like to wait on the DVD later on a green Sunday afternoon. - Paul Heath, http://www.thehollywoodnews.com, July 2008.
