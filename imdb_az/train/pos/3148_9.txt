I love this show. Period. I have not been expecting too long, it's probably about six months, but now it's my favorite show and it will probably take some time. I love all the characters, I just do not care about Donna. Why I'm not entirely sure. I just do not find it laughable and I do not think Laura Prep is a very good actress. Besides, I think the rest of the rest is pretty good. Kurtswood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, playing the Erics family, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great player. Unlike many fans, I did not totally hate the 8th season. I'm still watching and it makes me laugh. However, if you compare it to earlier seasons, it's not good. Randy is terrible. The prize was worth it, nothing nice, but good. =] It would have been a good idea to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but oh well. There is a fourth season on DVD and one day I hope the DVD will have eight seasons. Some of the worst episodes were in my opinion, 'Dine & Dash', 'Grandmas Dead', 'Red & Stacey' and 'Streaking', but I love every episode I have seen so far. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
