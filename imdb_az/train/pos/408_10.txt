I can not tell you how much you love this movie. I've read investigations saying this move is "too complex" or "floating in concrete construction". I say that these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you like playing Dungeons & Dragons ... This movie is for you (especially if you're into Eastern adventures). I'm sorry that I just did not see this movie on the big screen. (More on my big screen t.v.)
