"Police Python 357", Corneauun career and how he shot this time is a good example of his work. <br /> <br /> The police chief expert Ferrot (Yves Montand), usually in a non-traditional methods of police and a police officer working alone. The young woman Leopardi Sylvia (Stefania Sandrelli) are familiar with and becomes her lover, he has another lover: his superior Ganay (Francois Perier). When the latter learns it, he kills it in an angry state. The story of many such things is not exempt from artificial exception, and sometimes from the right. But Cornea's pedantic directorship is like a choking, ugly atmosphere. The first part of the film on the night of the crime may seem unimaginable, but it is very important to watch this key moment. Corneau, contemplative medium and small characters will again during the investigation by the simple moments and brief treatment, going back to a sober images. In spite of the poor, Corneau and his performer, Daniel Boulanger, wrote a story.

In fact, to draw water, waste water, solid recommendations Ferrot find himself running loose. Finally, the main purpose of the movie belongs to Ferrot. He is a police officer who has lost his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalism. <br /> <br /> In the background of these trillions, Orléans is effectively developing. Using the Corneau camera, it causes the hurtful charm of this exciting romantic work.
