When I saw the movie, I was shocked to see what really happened to the 60s. I know I can be wrong about some things, but it seems that the 60's really affected people. Some people said they wanted to go back to 60. From what I saw, yes, I would say yes to the excitement and we did not go. But it is my opinion.
