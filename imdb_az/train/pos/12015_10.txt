At first, this movie will be a typical Western movie, but it was very interesting, and I was extremely respectful that it was very unusual. Midway, 76, had experiments with Charlton Heston, James Coburn (Zach Provo), Deadfall, 93, and Zach Sam never forgave him and never paid anything to make sure he was paying with him. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), "The Portrait of the Lady", 96, found himself in this situation and found himself among the sexual men they did not leave alone. Sam Bourgeze had to make very difficult decisions, and ultimately I was surprised. This is a very entertaining movie and the player was outstanding.
