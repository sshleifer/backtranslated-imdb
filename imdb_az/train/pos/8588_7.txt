It could not be the best movie of 2006, but it was just a movie to excite and think. Sentinel is a good political tension movie that looks alike or even dark in some of the other political heroic movies, like the Political Crime Movie. Fire and Manchurial Candidates. The main theme of this film is similar to other films: a plan to kill the President of the United States of America. Michael Douglas is involved as a secret service agent, Pete Garrison. It only identified it after the start of the operation. Kiefer Sutherland co-stars will go under the direction of Jill Marin's agent Breckinridge and Oscar winner Kim Basinger's first lady, Sarah Ballentine, as an opponent, such as David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria named Jill Marin. An improvement for this movie could have been more action because some films were regarded as Action Films as Thriller, but a good thing about this film is not a conspiracy to kill the US president, but a secret in the Secret Service, (treacherous).
