I do not see how this show is to OC. <br /> <br /> First of all, OC centers are trying to live around teenagers and their parents. North Shore is a hotel worker who runs the hotel and is also trying to live a public life. Second, OC is held in California. <br /> <br /> Why does Fox hold a show as one of the other shows on the same network? I think this is a great show with good actors for most of them. There is a good story and plot. I love what happened and how the people care for them and how they work. The latest episode surprised how the story works. Most of the show could not be predicted as stories. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps him in the air.
