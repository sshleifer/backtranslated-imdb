This movie is a great fun to watch if you love movies of an organized crime. <br /> <br /> This can be a bit disappointing with the film's progress. <br /> <br /> Along with this, criminal offensive is something fun. If you are not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you are pleasantly surprised. I'm a little dissatisfied with some of the choices they are wise, but generally they choose a good criminal film. Some things were not logical, but it seems to be a norm with Eastern films. <br /> <br /> People just do casual personalities regardless of their priorities. There is even a little annoying pattern that penetrates this movie.
