A very nice movie. It remains in your memory. Better, flying pieces that are billed more romantically than a flight or war are really and almost always wrong. <br /> <br /> Even if the plane was involved, flying like me would enjoy this movie, not being sensitive or never in love. It is good and leaks the charm. <br /> <br /> It is superior to the "High Flight". <br /> <br /> Happiness, Boom
