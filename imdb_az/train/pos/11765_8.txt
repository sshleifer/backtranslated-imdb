This movie surprised me, a good liner and a laughable +, a stormy story with gunfire and explosions. This film was a very good twist and shockingly surprising. The area was strong despite the fact that others thought it was, keeping my whole life to the very end. As a result; this is a great way to spend time with a motion picture buff.
