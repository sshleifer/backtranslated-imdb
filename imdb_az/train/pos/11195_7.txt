The title has many meanings - a boxing kick that fights against discrepancies and dissatisfaction, a part of Mabel's trap, and Jack's troubles, and the cause of the problem is the bracelet of love as a ring that Billin gives to Mabele. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer, Carl Brisson from Denmark, began his film "The Ring" by Alfred Hitchcock. Many young Ian Hunter, who has earned such a long career in the film, plays Bob Corby, a beautiful girl, a gorgeous girl named Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis). He deals with "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), but he does not stop flirting with Bob. Bob agrees to get out of "a round" with Jack. Going on a few rounds and winning - he was a professional boxer and came to the fair to learn that he was a good warrior like Jack and his manager. Mabel suggests that Jack throw off and Jack turns off with his boorish coach (bigger Gordon Harker) to make his fate with plans to marry when Jack comes up well. Jack gets the fight and marries Mabel the next afternoon, but he and Bob have a deep grip on each other. <br /> <br /> Finally, a boxing film that the hero does not go out of the rails - Bob behaves and does everything possible. to become a champion - only if Mabel moves in the same way! He left it for Bob - at the end of the battle is very strong. This is very realistic - takes the last 20 minutes of the movie. Since raw and enthusiastic, Jack is almost demolished - and then, combined with tours to Mabel, gives him the courage to triumph. The question, why he wanted to get back - he did not think to contact Bob since the beginning - why would he not repeat it? <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with symbolism. Jack shakes hands with an entrepreneur, changing his hand when Bobin receives a handkerchief. When Jack called to Mabel's finger, Bobs wiped his arm out of place. Finally, Jack sees Mabel's ring in a bucket and gives him confidence to continue. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you will not love. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
