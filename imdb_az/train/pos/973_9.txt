Amazing! Wow! Very entertaining! Perhaps it's too little for normal American children and is actually an extension to call this a kid's movie, this movie reminded me of a lot of Time Bandits, much of the way through Terry Gilliam. Although the general narrative is quite straight forward, Miike still throws a lot of moments in the Surreal and Bujel-esquire. All the first action is violently overwhelmed by the normal family life of the parent / hero on the stage from the stage to the scene with the world of spirit. Finally, although Miike's unequivocal approach is concerned, the meaning of the meaning and the metaphor, especially the anti-war / anti-invasion message of human tragedy, is quite cursed. Like other great Miike films, funny and imaginative fun, instead of just the top torture and protection, she gives us infinite amount of monsters and yoga from the Japanese folk song, which is thought of through a creative CG and creative multi-faceted adventure. F'n reject and Miike is one of the best!
