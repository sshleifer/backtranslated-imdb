When I was first released in 1989, I saw this movie. I'm very pleased and am doing it right now. But now I realize that it's a "big" for a G rating rating, especially for an idea of ​​going to bed and paradise. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work in a beautiful place and Reynolds' singing sound is a clever dog. Unpleasant (like "Let's Talk Together") is as good as the clear emotions ("My House to My Heart"). Even though I went out once or twice in a tangent, I found the area well. The final scene of the film shot by Charlie and Anne-Mari is one of the most exciting experiences I've ever seen in animation. A live film.
