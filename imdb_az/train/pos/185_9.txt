Finally I bought it and added a copy of my collection "Show People". I can not comment on what the previous audience said and did not repeat their words, description and general quality. The masonic appearance is valuable in terms of the appearance of a large number of M-G-M silent star. Marion Davies loves the stage where he starred and met Patricia Pepoire, the main character of the movie. Be sure to read your lips, because when he sees Marion Daviesi is not a title card showing what he says, "I do not think I love him!" Cast your car on the run, release it, and get ready to drop more than a quarter of a century in the film's history. Enjoy!
