A family (parent-Patricia Clarkson, father Jake Weber, son Erik Per Sullivan) comes together in a couple of homes in the middle of winter. While they were there, they accidentally shot a deer. <br /> <br /> Some indigenous people - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and slowly moving things (very slowly) go wrong. <br /> <br /> I was expecting it to be bad when I started watching it. For this reason, most of the reviews on this site are extremely negative. Well ... do not agree. At first it is not a movie movie. Horror, shutdown does not start up to 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The first is bad things: the pace is slower than WAY; Jake Weber is a terrific player; WAY fears too many false imagination sequences; <strong> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Clarkson is as good as mother; some great directions with great sound effects that are a little intimidating; Clearly a clear sequence of clarity between Clarkson and Weber (in fact, required for the integrity of the plot!); <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sullivan's (only 10 at the moment) operation and Speredakos and an unexpected catastrophic end. <br /> <br /> I think many people are unhappy with this movie, as this film is pushing as a scary movie. this is not. So, if you can not take it into account, maybe you can do that. I'm 7 years old.
