I grew up watching this series. I was seven years old. I still remember the first episode called "New Home". I'm afraid of the dread! I have heard the statue immediately, laughing madly. And the end, O Lord! The spirit of a boy comes in the room for the child: Yikes! It was classic television and it was a series of series. I found a DVD collection for sale online: in fact 2. My question to any reader: who bought this set? It's a frog. Both sellers claim that they are in a very good copy. I have a sketchy and poor DVD on the episode of the "New Home" and a few more episodes, but if anyone knows it will be more clear if it knows that it will cost me to buy and share with me. A large number of intelligent, terrible and courageous supernatural. I would like to thank any fan of this low profile - in fact I would like to discuss it. Chris Walker
