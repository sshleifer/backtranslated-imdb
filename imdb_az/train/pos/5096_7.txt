This is a spread of the story of Rider Haggard, with an extra submarine with Russian soldiers looking for a "Force of Strength" buried with the usual extra woman and the treasure of King Solomon. It was shot very well in Africa's vast open spaces and moving very well. Patrick Swayze is charming as Alan Quatermain and Allison Doody have been employed by Quatermain to help rescue his father. It's also memorable as Umbopa Sidede Onyulo, leader of Gavin Hood, McNabb and Russian soldier (not listed in the IMDb list). All this will be explained in a good way, as long as Hollywood is unable to leave a good story alone, and I enjoyed it very long. 6/10.
