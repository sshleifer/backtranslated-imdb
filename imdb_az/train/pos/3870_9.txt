This is a very intense, strange and complicated movie that draws extremely slow, exciting details, draws attention to a novel, and watches the "IS" as if it were a novel. I did not take care of the narrator, but on the contrary, I felt that I had come out of balance with the rest of the play, which incorporates a part of the best ensemble I've ever seen and is a legend of Summer Phoenix. His innocence and naivety are unlikely to find a cross between Cinderella and Alice in the country of Miracle. <br /> <br /> This film is something incredibly beautiful and attracted by Eric Gautier and is unique in this regard. This movie shows how much you expect. It's always stunning, and despite the length, the film really needs more. In 163 minutes, one of the miracles of this film is too short for a bug. It's just packed with stunning short moments, the best you've been expecting all year, and these are finally added to an extraordinary movie experience. The moments of the family are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and this film can say what to say about theater in the film after Cassavetes's "Opening Night", or perhaps from Chapel's "Limelight" movie. But believe it, or this movie is a "little" condition. I never knew where this movie went and now I've seen, there are still many possibilities. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.
