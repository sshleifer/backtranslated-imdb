This film is one of the most dangerous black and white films of the 1930s before the Hoyts Code was introduced. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays young and beautiful Lily powers. indeed, who are doing well enough with his performance. Lily moves to New York City and gets a job when she's sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck performs a remarkable performance as a powerful woman who uses men as a bargaining champion, as if they were kings, who does not give them any emotion. Lily Powers is a woman who does not love only her strength and money in her mind. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be a bit different from the other films I've seen since there's no background music. I believe that the time when people first started to have noise and dialogue with the movie community. We've heard the music for a couple of times, and at first we showed how we were building the chain. Filmmaking and various scenes were fantastic! The director of this film is full of realism, drawing all the realities and all true tricks. <br /> <br /> This film was a direct film. The end of this film should have been as good as it was, but it did not destroy it completely. Baby Face had slow-moving scenes throughout the film, and maybe some of its predictable parts lay with her. But this is a favorite movie that can be viewed once again and has offered some people and friends.
