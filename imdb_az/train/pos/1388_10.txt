"The end of the day has come to an end" is an incredible picture. in some ways, better than "intense encounters of third kind". (I prefer large-budget splendid chewing gums), special effects like cheese, but this is a great part of fun. silent davis gives a great performance in this movie. perhaps one of the best roles that he does not have. music account is very good. The story is not logical. But ONLY MORE INTRIGUING. Like most of the best works of art, "the end of the day" is not afraid of being extremely subtle and complex. The end of the day can be a low budget indie movie, but it's not a lot of extras to compare the fifty and sixty films to the "existing" European films. (many were budget-independent ones).
