I knew that critics were interested in knowing how to respond to this rousing, inspirational film, so I went to the Rotten Tomatoes and rated 43% (or "Rotten") on the film's attractive groundbreaking film criticism. <br /> <br /> Now, I can say that if this film does not move, you have no heart. (It is interesting to note that the same website on the same website received 74% of the audience). <br /> <br /> Critics' opinions are important to me. Because I can not think of a more useless, highly paid profession. Some schmo is paid to go to the movie (what a difficult life), and everyone doing the same thing on the planet: creates an idea. <br /> <br /> I've excluded that this movie is outdated (even exceptionally). f-bomb), syrup and somewhat advance ... after all, you really know Cuba Gooding Jr., real-life Navy hero Carl Brashear (always) and courageous; strong willpower and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performance and De Niro (like Billy Sunday, a very realistic man's compositional composition) are very powerful, very inspirational, and your legs renew the scene of the film, especially the courtroom's summit. In order not to be moved by these scenes, there must be a real stick in the mud. Like our film critics. Michael Rappaport is as good as Gooding's friendly, spontaneous diving student with Brashear. If anyone sees "Ali Learning", that character will be completely saved from this character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it always confirms that I feel: do not listen to critics. See this movie and get inspired.
