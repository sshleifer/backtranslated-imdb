I came to watch the second part of Steven Soderberghin Che Guevara's biopic about Guerrilla, I did not see the previous movie, and did not get much information from China's life. At the same time, it was anxious that the double revolutionary would have a hard history lesson and a modest love letter. As you can see, this movie was more than my expectations. <br /> Gerrilla works fine as an independent film. Che's attempt to prevent the revolution in Bulgaria during the military alliance is a tragic tragedy. Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Revolutions against Revolutions. <br /> <br /> The United States has supported the Bolivian army, the hostility of the tropical environment, the suspected locals and the health of China. <br /> <br /> Soderberg's image of China is unimportant, but this movie is not a hagiography. The style is a refreshing scales, adding a silent drama to many scenes with a subtle and effective soundtrack by Alberto Iglesias. Undoubtedly, Che is in the center of the film, very few in number and we are encouraged to see those who fight and sometimes even see it. When Soderbergh wants to demonstrate Che's qualities, we can see him in a small episode, as he asks Che's leadership to offer a loyal acolyte that enhances the guerrillas of the two parties and sacrifices for the overthrow of the Cuban to re-fight for the revolution. <Br / <br /> High in all directions. Part 2 is intensely corroded despite its narrow focus, and can communicate with many things without the need for a storytelling story. At the start of the film, we see a few short clips of multiple parties in post-revolutionary Cuba, and immediately offer us the idea that it will sacrifice its old life to fight again in another country. Later on, the portrayal of guerrillas who went to the endless rain forests appeared as a very beautiful scene and helped them feel the magnitude of the task in front of a small band of revolutionaries. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is the distance between watcher and Cheney, although it allows to evaluate the context of the insurgency and its surroundings, so it is difficult to understand as a good person. True, Benicio Del Toro's leading role is completely convincing? so it's hard to remember that you're watching yourself, not an actor. However, watching Guerrilla as a stand-alone film shows that we have been given some valuable insights into what shapes Che's thoughts, words, and actions. I hope that this is the first part of the Soderberghin biopsy (I can not say yet) and, of course, the power of the second part is anxiously awaiting me to see the prequel.
