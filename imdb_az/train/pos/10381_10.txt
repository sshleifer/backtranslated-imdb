The previous review has stated exactly this. Once I saw that he was bewitched, for the first time in a week or two, I saw it for the second time again. I still remember some scenes. The stage is the opening of the 20th century, the war cited in the title is World War II. One of the scenes has been identified, which is an interesting historical record in the section for women in the public space. The moment I first touched one of the women was one of my biggest movie moments. I do not think this is a "gay movie", it is an interesting and tender period of love novel about the two heads of women. I would like to see this movie again; If it were to DVD, I would buy it.
