HG Wells Remember the "The Invisible Man"? Here's a movie that's more extreme. "Hollow Man" is no story as a weapon chosen about invisibility. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a genius scientist who is invisible and useful for military purposes. Although it was an easy part of the serum, the person did not go back. The majority of initial attempts are unstable. Until one night, this formula has improved. And someone else, but Caine was a laboratory mouse. Korilla was the first and almost died, so she approached. So when Caine did, she decided to use it for fun. Tired of not being able to see, the team did everything possible to bring it back to the body. However, the visibility formula will not work as needed, and Caine will go crazy. So he ends up being a crazy murderer. It would be good to go out of town instead of changing the lives of people close to you. I care less about those who make you wrong. Great movie, very entertaining. 3 out of 5 stars!
