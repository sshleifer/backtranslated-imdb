I have to admit that I went to Fever Pitch with low expectations. Jimmy Fallon's latest movie, Taxi, Catwomanly said it was bad and all of the trailers for Fever Pitch were good, but it was not a big deal for me to say that he did not compress me. <br /> <br /> "I love Jimmy Fallon, but the cab has fought directly in his career, and now it's steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! Once again, it's a return and return to the SNL!" or " Get crackers, but do not buy tickets for Fever Pitch. Then the film was gone and I was expecting it to be more entertaining. But hey, could not I allow my punishment to be wasted? I hate Boston Red Sox because I thought I would not care about the movie. My whole family hates them. Pedro Martinez's name just escapes to the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Indeed, in any case, my mother is an admirer of St. Louis Cardinals, and still believes last year that the World Series is fraudulent. He does not believe he believes Sox has won. <br /> <br /> "Fever Pitch" was a bit of a hit for the fans of Red Sox, but it made me sincerely. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a passion for sports may be involved with it. a level movie. If you do not have a favorite sports team, you will not be too lenient with a fan such as Fallon Ben. There is not much smell like the fresh season and a clean slate. Well, I'm talking in a figurative sense. The joy of being a sports fan. <br /> <br /> "Wait for the next year", "Your mantra, your slogan, your prayers, and Fever Pitch effectively take this essence. <br /> I think the film takes on a so-called story and it's Red Sox <br /> <br /> You know, it should be done in a modest manner, and some humor is a bit stupid, though it's a little stupid, <br /> <br /> As you can see, Ben's uncle took him to the first Red Sox game at the age of seven and left his two seasons after he died, and I did not miss a single game for 23 years, at the beginning of each season he and his comrades there is a day of project to figure out which games to go with, everyone dance for the Yankees games and one complains when threatened by Royals (apologize to Mr. Shade) and Devil Rice, this is a very good scene, and it works very well because I know those who really make the "day of the ticket bill". I have to admit that I can belong to Lindsey and her parents when it comes to dinner. Red Sox plays a road game, but instead of watching it on TV, I decide to give it a shot. One of the most dangerous things in life is to find a game and then to be in the public and try to avoid the result. Was. Very intense and scary situation. Ben, Ben, enters the zone of danger when a child, when viewed in a restaurant and looking at the game. I immediately closed his ears and started screaming like a banshee to not hear the result. Lindsey is ashamed and does not know what her parents think. Yes, sports fans can be strange, I do not deny it. But this is true. <br /> <br /> Farrelly can now imagine that you are sad about what your brothers are known for. But Lindsey sometimes says how he likes her talks as a "good shot victim", but this is a gentle, more romantic side that the bows exhibit. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the movie will be a very pleasing one. Fortunately, when the handle starts to diminish slightly, Farrellys knows when to draw. Lindsay jumped to the pitch and responded to a romantic moment running to me to announce his endless love for him, "Do you know me, sponge?" Jimmy Fallon is a permanent source of romantic comedy chances that Drew Barrymore can handle well on the big screen. Fever Pitch is a good, solid fun, with a little fresh look in the genre of romantic comedy. This is a movie that can be attributed to both children and gals. <br /> <br /> Now, if fans of Red Sox can close Bambino's curse, then I have to fight against it. I appreciate it. <br /> <br /> My Memphis Tigers NCAA basketball championship has never won, so I officially declare more than my situation. <br /> <br /> GIST Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, Red Sox, baseball or sport fanatics should generally consider Fever Pitch an eye. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
