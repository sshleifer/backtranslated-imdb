I love this movie. Well written and well-functioning and good cinematography. Story moves, humor, mysticism and subtlety blend with great sets and beautiful space. <br /> <br /> Show it, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> The act is good and Murphy does a wonderful job of describing a particularly unwanted / difficult hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found that they were interesting and well-developed with dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I looked at these people and the outcome was quite predictable (good guys win, hero), surprisingly attractive girl and survivor of the sacred child - who does not see the newcomers?) happily happy when I'm doing well at the end of everything did Thankfully, for the dignity of this film, it has never been destroyed by an accident. Hold some popcorn on the wall, watch this entertaining, happy and entertaining movie.
