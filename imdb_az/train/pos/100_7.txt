Scott Bartlett's 'OffOn' is nine minutes of pure madness. This is the first real combination of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsy-lightening flashing lights and colors, full-frontal attack and film and video in avant-garde cinema. There are no stories to talk, but Bartlett uses pictures of nature? especially human face and shape? this is to create a sequence of emotional reactions that integrate biological phenomena into the high-tech industry of modern technology. In a sense, film combines humanity with tools, machine, technology. Stanley Kubrick's '2001: Space Odyssey (1968),' and is it really bound to the HAL9000 subset of Bartlett's sequence sequence? colors burned near a human eye? Dave Bowman remembers his journey through Stargate. The images are rich in color, sharp, lively photography and a grueling video blend. We are very close to the television screen (in fact, the final product is celebrated by the television viewer) <br /> <br /> There are some confusion about the history of the movie. IMDb lists the film as 1972, but also the National Film Registration and National Film Fund for the Year 1968. Perhaps this inequality reflects the end of the film and the choice between the first public. In either case, the visual ability, sometimes reminiscent of the music videos of the 1980s, did not lose any of the interesting techno-music. 'OffOn' delivers fragmented, fragmented images that offer much of a life-giving experience in a computerized processing environment. Did I have an idea? and do not laugh at this free thoughtful comment? The outer civilization that captures the television signals of the earth can get a surprisingly unobtrusive assemblage of such unclear, wildly documented, unusual scenes of human life, which can be of no explanation. It's probably humanity, with all its technology, at the end of the film's and video's revivalable combination, cleanliness, and dignity.
