We looked at the vcr and found it interesting. I did not know anything about this true story: "Oh, no, P. Brosnan, an American Hindu (film" Red Indian "), is a bad choice, until you discover the truth about Gray Owl, the film is to show the dignity of the native peoples and Annie Galipeau, WOW, is a beauty and very convincing (she is French-Canadian, though she is a very passionate, devoted person of Brosna's independent, repressive style) The transformation of field animal into coservice is somewhat weaker than demographic. Good film, highly recommended.
