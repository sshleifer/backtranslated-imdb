There are many films about Aviation Lighter Lakeshore, but one of them is good and damn good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place at Sea Blimp operations with NAS Lakehurst (playing NAS Tustin). Wallace Beery, loved, but the headquarters of Munchausen Ned Trumpet is a pilot who tells long stories that nobody really believes in him. Dulun, son of Jess, son-in-law with his crippled son, to have a relationship. He said he would never be able to walk by the doctors, and the head would pull some strings and a Navy flight surgeon would help restore the child's crippled leg. <br /> <br /> His wife continues to join the Jess Sea Fleet, drives back to Lakehurst and faces some challenges. </ Font> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Otherwise, this movie gets good reviews for technical accuracy and gives Navy Navy a rare look at LTA operations. Cash Register Scene, Trumpet and Jess's future love is a swap between Cathy's interest, definitely hoot.
