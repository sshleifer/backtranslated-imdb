I'm very pleased with this movie. It was light, pleasant, very colorful. You can see the MGM appear from Technicolor. There are very few invisible colors in this movie. Every scene is full. Choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He is very talented. All the dance numbers in this movie are perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story to something else. The final part of the film, the great dance series, is very impressive. Gershwin's music, which makes this movie very special. Several American composers have earned a better gift for the melody. I love Gershwin's music. Magnificent. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyrical writers. She is very smart and attractive. It was a very entertaining movie.
