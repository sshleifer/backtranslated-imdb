I could not agree more with the rating given to this movie and I believe that most viewers are short-sighted. Indeed ... Did you forget that some artists used to be some kind of art before just entertaining? This movie is not fun, at least it's a fun game you can get in movies like the Titanic or the Gladiator. This style is different, it is shocking ... So most people hate it long ago, because it does not make you happy. Only one story, I admit very strange, but then, just a strange story. It's not a big story, it's not a big movie, but I believe that it deserves only 7 writers, making a story that has not been made to please the audience because of the dignity of the author and director, billions of copies and even more enrichment of large studios. This film is a European craft movie for me in the United States, and everyone deserves respect. Whether for courage, or for a unique humor concept.
