This is a very unusual movie that does not look like top half of the star with the top billing. But I've been dealing with Phantom Lady's bunk. Although Curtis is authorized as the wrong suspect Scott Henderson, maybe he should have broken his mustache and sympathetic to his behavior (although the police at least some of his innocence.) If another commentator had problems with Fran√ßoise Tone Jack Marlowe, the character of the character, is a complex way of looking at it, and there is no fear ... Elisha Cook Jr, a great actress, is again in the form of "a small man with great ambitions." The drumming in music numbers adds a nice touch to eroticism, Carol Richmond is a very talented and beloved Ella Raines girlfriend who has a talent and the presence of the screen is the tradition of Lauren Bacall, the first of what I have seen and I have to see her other roles. The film is a mystery of all the many delights that completely transmit the world of dark and complex city today. Recommended, 8/10.
