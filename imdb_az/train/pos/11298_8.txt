Ruth Snyder - In 1927, the murder of Judd Gray inspired Ogden Nash to write a Broadway game called Machinal. More Famous, James M. Gain, inspired everyone to write two short novels to anyone who brought this point to our attention - Double Tazminat and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Both were non-classic films of the 1940s, and the double penalty was controversial as the most perfect nuance. Some real-life elements of the story of Snyder-Gray were captured by Cain - Albert Gray, the Ruth's high-ranking driver, the passionate work of Ruth and Judd, and the strangeness and indifference involved in the murder and this double insurance payment. The actual setting of missing elements is very much in Manhattan - Albert Snyder is a respected newspaper editor. <br /> <br /> Cain's double compensation was perfectly designed by Billy Wilder - do not consider Stanwyck's ridiculous parody as one of the most exciting films in the movies! Postman Always Rings Twice, but three times in the Italian version Ossessione and Luchino Visconti's first film is the first of three versions. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ span> <br /> </ span> </ span> > <p> Ossessione, Postman is not always the same as Rings Twice. He has a powerful neo-realist appearance, his big movie, but most of the true nerve elements are missing. There are no keyboard illumination and non-traditional camera angles. The dialogue is not boiling hard and instead focuses more on film characterization. It is the longest version of the story and goes deeper into characterization. Lana is much older than the Turner version. We have a very honest relationship and Giovanna is very clearly a nymphomaniac. A new character of life - La Spagnola - is presented with very clear homosexual overtones. <br /> <br /> This is a study of the working class rather than murder. <br /> <br /> The audience really gets a sense of poverty and ugliness. Drifter is not exactly a tramp, his wife Lana Turner, and may even be a prostitute before marriage. Her husband is an exceptional capitalist - obese, rude and arrogant. I think the cast was brilliant for this movie. My sole beef is time to work out loose. Everything will take a long time and it will be more effective if it is more economical. Nevertheless, the fan of noir and realism will love Ossessione like me.
