This is one of the best classic Edgar Wallace films from the German series - it has all the basics for the extremely delightful Wallace crime film from the 60s: Although his glory, Mr. Kinski, is still young, Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger is still a typical the youngest Eddie Arendt, a cool, sophisticated English boy who is the best (and typically typical) role of a smart American "female player", and you (not too young) Lowitz Angels are still very 'dry' ironic (and hence , as a police investigator, and a freakish and multi-camped 'bad boy' behind a frog mask (hence the name of the movie!), you'll receive a crazed out cast soundtrack, classic b-movie motion scenes, Partially Wildest perspectives (remember her origin!), shut up screaming screens and so on. All these items are shattered with a delicious cocktail in a pure German Edgar Wallace campaign!
