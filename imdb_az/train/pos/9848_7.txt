I watched this movie with my child and I am not disappointed. The story is good, some abandoned orphans should be brought to their parents by an incredible trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal) ... And do not want to mention the incredibly small angry beast its hazenut. In short, it works, it's funny and should "see" your kids (they will love it).
