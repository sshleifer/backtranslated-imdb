<br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) return to Florida. As with their two friends (Turner, Davis), they really do not add anything to this area, but at least they like it. The girls agreed to bring children in the state of Florida, but the car has problems and can never do that. When one of the girls decided to go to a nearby petrol station, the other three cars remained. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls should use the bathroom, and there's no choice but to go into the bags. <br /> <br /> In March last year, a woman witnessed drowning. The terrorist girl escapes from this area and is not far away, but she has lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lastly, , the other two girls find each other and are arrested for entering the gas station. <br /> <br /> That's why it's great for me. <br /> <br /> This film features a nudity, a good actress, a shower scene that mimics psychology, graphic violence against women, and a decisive story. Some women will probably not love the end of humiliating and vulnerable individuals, but this is a little bit unknown.
