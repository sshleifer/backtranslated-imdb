I'm just like a Chris Rock fan, and as a man who has little in expectation of this film and proves to be wrong. The first flaw is everything that realizes that everything is happening. The number two was that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed to be fake. Finally, the best player in this film, Regina King and the worst Mark Addy, was sub-paradigm in this film. but I saw this defect past and saw a solid comedy. In a headache scenario, wait for paradise to wait, it is better. So, for all the Chris Rock supporters out there, THIS IS THE MOVIE WANT YOU, and you also like it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a good stand. <br /> <br /> Generally: 10 out of 7
