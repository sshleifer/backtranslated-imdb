This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie. I've been with my pizzas and bottles of wine on Friday night. I first chose this item and saw this movie with my sister Chasity. I was in grade 2. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend. I read many comments on how Budun left Sissy and "learn" Sissy's marriage. But it's back, and look at it for a second: SPOILER - Now, commenting on my film, not at the age of eight, Bull & Sissy's relationship with Gilley made him a stupid bull in his slide. They are in a great battle. Bud, trying to dance Pamdan, is trying to make Sissy's jealousy. Sissy then thinks that two wrongdoing would justify her, and Wes asks her if she needs any help. When asked by Bud Pam, they are all stupid at the dance floor, "Are you taking me home and raping me?" Pam answers: "You are never ready for a cane." Bud goes home with Pam for his condo in Houston after. Which Daddy bought with his oil money and his "all these things". Bud is a person who made cunning over Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day. Sissy is ONE, who left Budu. Later, Bud is to prove Sissy is a real "cowboy" and a return. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is my comment. Everyone is sure of me! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And I believe or bought a cowboy for myself! I love him too! :)
