Well, now I've come a long way from Houston, but when I see this movie, one day I was returned to a little cowgirl, and one day I bark at Gilley. <br /> <br /> If you grow up in East Texas, then this film is a clear picture of modern life. If you do not trust me and watch the movie. Or you will join those who love him (and at the same time, strange fire), or at least you can entertain the red necks. (There are so many things to do.) This film is about P.C. does not want to be. (What happened in the 80s) or white garbage item, and it is honest for time and place. <br /> <br /> For me it's 10!
