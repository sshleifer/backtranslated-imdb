(Ontario), a group of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) invited to spend a week at Tomawka, a camp in Canada by former Consuls (Alan Arkin). Writer / director Mike Binder is the primary source for gaining experience in the same camp, creating subtle and intricate yarns. Also, most of the movie uses a masking tape, which has many funny moments that are totally strange as my favorite. Newton Thomas Sigel ("Moral Suspects", "Three Kings") provides some of the most effective shots of Canadian desert. The director of the film "Against Death" and director of the "Gift" film, Sam Raimi, appears to be a human being in his right hand. What's more, this film has convinced me that a camp is not a bloody crime scene.
