"Against all flags" is not every bit of classic swashbuckler. There are all the elements that the adventurous fan can hope for this or that, and the brother who is in trouble is, of course, not in a difficult situation. Like Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara manages his enemies in the best way in athletics, contrary to the social norms. Anthony Quinn turns out to be the first three billed actors, such as merciless Captain Roc Brasiliano, and can be clever and capable Nemesis for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For a classic adventure fan, "against all flags" should be one-to-one. Even though Errol Flynn's previous work (eg Captain Blood and Sea Shore) is in the same league, it is still a fun thing to do.
