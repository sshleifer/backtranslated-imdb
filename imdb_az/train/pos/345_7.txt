It was very boring to say so little to the first hour of the film. But the Valentines Party has improved after it has begun. The hot bath scene was one of the few memorable aspects of this film, with the exception of the murderer's identification. The scene with Kate was well shot and the last scene was also 'twist'. There were a number of realistic excitement and excitement and a horrible crime scene in those scenes. Previous crimes are unhappy.
