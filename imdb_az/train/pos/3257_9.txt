I saw this movie for the second time on television. Beautiful, warm, emotionally, very romantic. Rarely, actors' actions and gestures knew better than to fall in love with another - Cibill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply prefer themselves. Masterson probably plays the most difficult role and is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> The film was married to Peggy Sue, a "highly cunning", like Harry Sally, the Sleeping and the Romantic Films, Seattle's Sleepless and Big, Returns to the Future. I hate to say this because casting was very nice and I have never changed them - so I do not succeed and I think the films above have won. <br /> <br /> Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time of the film. <br /> <br /> It is not a good post, for example, the character lines are not particularly memorable. But it is perfectly executed. <br /> <br /> Romantic desires are truly palpable, hateful to those who fall in love, the timelessness of love, and the desire to swallow, to feel lost, and to rebuild this relationship. Again, you will see that you are transferring yourself. In fact, a film that can be compared to heaven is made - the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> You see this - it's fine.
