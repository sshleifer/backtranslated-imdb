This is one of my favorite novels, and I'm really excited to see my move. I'm not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are a few things I can choose, but I think the film is a true movie. Apparently, Stephen King's films are basically a bad review, but that's fine. That's a dark story, so I love it ... and it's better than the dead ... and something about animals returning from the grave is incredibly creepy. If you see the movie you are a great blessing and now read the book! A well-written toy, actors could have done a better job (I just said to Rachel and Ellie .. it was so odor) I really liked everyone .. most importantly for me .. caught up with the novel.
