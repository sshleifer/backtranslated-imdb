Before Tuscan Sky, I saw Diane Lane's performance in another movie in this movie. Campers are invited to a youth camp and live as adults. Everyone who returns looks for something that they have lost, and it seems that this is very realistic. Maybe you really have to be a whip to get it, but according to a character who is aware of all his clothes, "so much camp!" Fighting on practical jokes and boyfriends, scary lunch lady and call early morning ... It's amp. Now, exciting work seems secular. The magnificent ensemble improves and reassures one or two dimensional roles. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Ms. Brad Paisley (likely to be the first to fall for her!) Looking for an old friend of beautifully decorated, shining colors, comic tracks (including Hello Muddah's Changes) and a funny player shots by celebrated director Sam Raimi like a movie that can repeat.
