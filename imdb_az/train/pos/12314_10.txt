After a while, the film raises the bar for every movie in every genre. This caliber's film will affect many films after it's released in the coming years. This category falls in "A Chinese Ghost Story". One of the best scandals in the 1980s is controversial; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < "text-align: justify; This story is very subtle and original, and it's dangerous and dangerous, so it's creepy and atmospheric, and there's even a little blood to keep your budding admirer, but if you're not a fan of the genre, the horror tag <br /> <br /> The scenario dramatizes drama, comedy, horror, kung fu, and romantic genres into delicious, without much nervousness, but without Hollywood's legitimate nudity and / or open sex scenes that violated love stories.The ones quenched by the romantic elements of the story can come back quickly in the sword and wire-fu. If not, actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide enough humorous situations to sell appetite for the comedy. This movie offers something for every movie admirer. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark have set up a really beautiful castle for this movie. Leslie Cheung is not only a talented actor but also a talented singer and a fascinating physical comedian. Maybe I can not think better than Chengg, who may be able to show Ling Choi Sin better than any other performer (possibly Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is bewitched like Lit Su Seen, a poetic creature stealing Cheung's character. The character of the hood is its really haunting and memorable in its description. Wu Ma is astonishing as a terrible Taoist who helps young ladies. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, this film is very impressive today's standards. Perfect direction. I want to say that Hollywood leaders today are looking for talented artists such as Siu-Tung Ching, on the contrary, they fall into commercial MTV video or Pepsi commercials. Cinematography is beautiful. Most movie scenes should be commemorated at night whenever any movie theater can look good. Special effects makeup is top notch. In fact, most of the creatures created in this film are away from the volunteer CGI ghouls and goblins that are widespread in modern-day frightening films. <br /> <br /> After the release, "Chinese Ghost Story" has two dignified sequels, full length animated movies and countless imitations. None of the movies that followed or copied could keep this classic's magic. Everyone in this movie is looking for any horrible fan or looking for a great way to spend just 95 minutes. From 10 to 10. <br /> <br />
