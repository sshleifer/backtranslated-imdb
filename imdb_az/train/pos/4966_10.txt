Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen years old when Argentina won the World Cup in his home in 1978. He was the biggest star, and one of the country's biggest players left football with restraint. <br /> <br /> Historically, Argentinean won the World Cup in 1978 is quite convincing - they did not need Maradona. . There was nothing like that in 1982. Spain was a catalog of catastrophes for Argentina. Menotti - still smoking chain - this time played Diego, but there was so much habit for such a glorious child. Maradona signed $ 7 million for Barcelona on June 4, 1982 - after nineteen days spent his first game at Camp Nou and defeated Argentina in the first bout. This was not a successful debut and despite scoring twice against Hungary in the next match, Maradona will recall the rundown website - Brazilian Batista champion, betrayer in the second round, finish the tournament and finish the tournament. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maradona has gone through some naked times in Barca and left in 1984 to return to Naples. He was finally home. The Neapolitan Tifosi has done everything to bring Maradona poor, soul to Naples. Camorra was worried by millions of gifts from young women and pocket money from young boys as the transfer fee, and the city decided to make her feel at home. Maradona has at least been El Rey so far - bringing Argentine side to Mexico as one of the favorites and with new manager, Carlos Bilardo, replacing Menotti. <br /> <br /> The story of Maradona hero This is a one-seater World Cup winning machine. In 1982, hundreds of young men died in an impossible fight for the Falkland Islands; Now the English press has made a match in Mexico (with the same result). Maradona still did not distinguish himself in the UK, but in the 1980s he recalled for a superior performance compared to Spain in England. <br /> <br /> Englishmen really started well and Lineker threw it in after twelve minutes. The main event occurred within 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> Fenwick ordered a large and limited English defender - he was afraid of not having to worry about the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After the first 45 minutes, the second half began after the tension. Maradona danced 50 minutes later, but found no way. Just Valdano's initiative only hit white shirts. Then, the deception moment that served as the Diego epicure. Hodge flipped the door into his own penalty area, and Shilton hurried off and hurriedly dropped the ball into the box. How did he do it? Simple: Handball. <br /> <br /> The most popular foul in soccer's history was slowly moving. Each of our spectators, Mr Sir al-Sharif, waited a blow to the foul. Shilton looked at the lineer and ran to the central circle. If the pope does not assassinate or become the first man to strike at Mars, the great man will be the first to tell the moment when he dies - a long-term, steady, slow-moving, appearance of the eye on his face. <br /> <br /> Burrusca scored a ball to protect Maradona on his right hand side. It was spread and away from Beardsley and Reid. It was a real Diego - he blown through Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack. Normally, Maradona would aim to shoot her near the budu - it would certainly have taken a red card, but who cared? After that, Fenwick had a brain wave - hesitated and wrapped his arm in Maradona, decided to flee - perhaps he tried to throw it? Fenwick fell, Diego hit the box. The butcher grabbed the genius, as if he were presenting the crowd. Shilton began to panic and Maradona sat around him and prepared the account. He now remembers Butcher's role and tried to get Argentineans cautious, but instead added a momentum to the attack. England came home. <br /> <br /> This magic found a successor to the world Pele in the summer of Mexico. In fact, Pele was superior to the greatest player in the world in 1958 and 1970, but had great players around him. He did not give Maradona. 1986 was the World Cup.
