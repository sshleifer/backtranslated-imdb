Will Smith is still present in the film about the weight of the world in a way that will touch even the hearts that make the mistakes in his shoulders and angry! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino met and I created a book I offered to buy and store in this movie collection as you are not tired of watching / watching! She is the only Honorary Actor, but she has no doubt about people and her life that she has a genuine love for the character she plays in the movie (IRS Agent Ben Tomas). Feeling pain and anger, Emily's frustration for her love, was always Fantastic as played by Rosario Dawson. I saw myself falling in love with my beloved. Woody Harrelson also meets stars in this Top Notch movie. I think it is very difficult to write without giving the main points in this regard ... I can all tell you that you do not have to watch it and cut it off, remove the phone from the hinges, sit back and get a mysterious life, and start working on IRS Agent Ben Tomas' ready ... Thank you to Will Smith for another Great Movie !!!
