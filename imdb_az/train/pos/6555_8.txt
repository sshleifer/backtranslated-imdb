If you've read more than 100 of Nancy Drew's books and are still not brilliant enough to catch up, Nancy Drew's FILM NENSI Drew was about 18-year-old books about not going to school. He was sixteen years old. So, naturally, it's not as smart as it is in the book since it's only in the 10th grade. Besides, I thought the movie was very sweet. It was clean and suitable for everyone. Sometimes it was funny. Emma Roberts has done a great job. She was characteristic and beloved. I liked Nancy and Ned's worry about being around each other because it was not too old to have serious relationships, as with clear books. Unlike most people, it was the PG movie I liked to use movies without sex, drugs, or blasphemy.
