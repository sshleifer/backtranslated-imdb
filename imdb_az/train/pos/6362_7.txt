I've seen some Speed ​​Racer, but I really did not see it, and some other demonstrations also saw that some of the characters, Phoenix flying birds and another ship's ship were back on the boat and for some reason, and perhaps for one in five it was really dark. In this regard, I watched nearly every episode, and at this point it was nice for me that there was some solution in this show. Actually, the bad guys ended up with a Transformers, ending with Galvatron, the last episode of the generation of anything, unlike any American cartoon, and did not produce such a result that the new kids would never miss with Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons. We are ready to try again with Cobra and GI Joe, and so on. It came to an end, and when the show evolved, it had a very cool robot that took new weapons. It was a bit bland, since he could not fly and had some really cool weapons. As he went on, Dragonball Z has been used against Cell, has a cool shooting fist like an Android 16, and then developed to shake the shooting razor. The big robot wings were then fired and more weapons were inserted into the wings. He would have taken on a female robot a few allies and a very funny thing in America called Bobo. The spouses were just hell, but a half-man was a very strange person, with a half-woman and a flying sword. An interesting show and a look at the result was a wonderful thing.
