Henry Hathaway was courageous and brave as he loved the early days of US history. However, it is unnecessary and useful to comment on this film to criticize the history of Brigham Young and the film about the Mormon people. Hautaway, in my view, was in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ until the film's launch, during which the Mormon people began to bear witness with Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> During my youth in the early 1950s, I watched this movie in the morning on Saturday. I explain the Mormon philosophies and teachings in many segments and scenes. Ten years have passed since the release of films, and before the completion of the Los Angeles temple, I was set up and made a great deal of wonder about who the Mormons were. Recently, I took this movie and enjoyed the following messages in the Hathaway movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Everyone loves for everyone regardless of their personal beliefs. 2. Good for needy or helpers, 3. Family is great, 4. Respect and listen carefully because it is important to consider and accept reciprocal messages. Work harder in the individual and community, 6. Prepare and store your future need days. 7. Hope is a necessity for a higher being and everyday life. 8. It assists a group of individuals who have a unique quality and evaluates useful ones.
