<br /> <br /> When this movie proved to be really unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Although there were several lines, this movie was something that did not know any sub or language. A friend sent a VHS and wrote several documents with all the lines translated into English. with my translation, I started watching this story (really a fairy tale) and tired of the melody of the melody during the credits I opened. In addition to a few other films (Paris, Texas and Nenette et Boni), minimal motion (well, often), absurd comedy, slapstick, thoughtful, beautiful colors, it's in the heart of everyone - without words. See it when you have the chance. Whatever you do, do not miss it. It's a lifetime experience. Oh, that's great, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and less than a thousand times - but it is rarely (never).
