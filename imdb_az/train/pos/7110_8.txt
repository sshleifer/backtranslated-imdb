John Garfield plays a Dead Sea with a bomber who is struggling with Guadalcanal and learning to live with disability. He has all the stereotypical ideas about blindness and will be a burden to everyone. Marine ships injured by hospital staff and friends can not afford it. Eleanor Parker will not return to the girl's house. Stubborn and blind with their fears, self-esteem and prejudices. Garfield plays a complicated role with a great performance that continues despite the melody of today's syurope. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where he is in a machine gun slot trying to escape from a brave nightmare of Japanese soldiers, and then goes down a clever train platform. a rider, a dark glasses, and a golden cup, all the time his lover goes away from the camera.
