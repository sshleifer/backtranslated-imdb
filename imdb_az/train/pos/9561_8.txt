"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. This woman knows how to entertain with a good story, not just a comedy, but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, the young boy Ranma, who is also a specialist in the art of marine, deals with Akan because of the great comrades and the two fathers who have brought together together. <br /> <br /> Akane is the youngest and most severe <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane are always very bad, because both Ranma and Akane are always fighting. Tanno and Akna's sisters: Kasumi is the oldest and very sweet, and Nabiki loves to earn money. When Ranma splashes with cold water and her father becomes a panda, there are many new characters and things happening. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you love Ranma 1/2 ' .
