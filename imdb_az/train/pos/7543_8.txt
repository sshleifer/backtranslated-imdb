This is a gentle adaptation of the mangle with very little dialogue. What kind of dialogue is in the word balloons as in the field? this area exists, but it responds indefinitely. The explosion book collection has an English-language gossip, a theme of 'underground novels' and a real theme dialogue that tells a bit more about it. I suggest that you check your favorite volume. Because he explains some "plot" of the film. The animation is wise enough to be pretty good, good computer use and the best part of the images. a boat, a circus, a wilderness wandering through a strange image of a hero, a cat and a brain dead dead sister. In just a half an hour, they have led me through a series of half windows and settings that the director chose a number of issues of the long-term mangle to coincide with, but the outstandingly selected primarilly. Knowing what's going on may add a little more. this reminds me mainly what they used to play at the MTV show, playing cartoon sushi, especially in a cats that captured a person's curled jack around a short house. Only in this case, the cats are more like a book of salutation, and their adventure expands in death and reincarnation and some other topics (although not easy to say). This is a DVD's director's comments and "features", but I can not comment on them because I'm not approaching them. To give a 8/10 for the moment, here is not much to compare with anime, and more like this.
