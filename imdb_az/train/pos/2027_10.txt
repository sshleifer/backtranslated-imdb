What can you say about Tara Fitzgerald's attractive performance? Like the injured Mrs. Graham, he is tough enough with his experienced, sharp, and strong will, but he does not have immunity to Mr Markham's passionate resources. Toby Stephens is a master of his character, explaining every kind of subtlety and facial expression in every mixed look and with every glimmer. Helen is a passion and hope of restoring the damaged soul. The perfect performance of the untouched tale of the graves "Huntingdon". But in spite of all this, at the end there is a human dignity that must be abandoned without starting a hypocritical game; he knows at least his own mistakes and how he destroys it. An attempt to save Helen's soul is a struggle for hope, hope, and faith in the lives and souls of every human being, but it is wrongly directed, but it can be a sinner, after not leaving her and taking her child at an unseen time. Markham's continuity can be regarded as a prize for his faith and unshakable moral character. Although the thoughtful ideas of morality are obsolete by today's standards, the story is still full of integrity, passion, and love. Tenants are more convincing compared to Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; Here's an adaptation of novel justice. I highly recommend it!
