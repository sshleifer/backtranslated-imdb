Hero's father was the best new show ever to reach the television after Family Guy. Dreamworks Animation was another masterpiece of talented people. Like the Simpsons, show centers around a nuclear family (white case lion, in this case). It also contains many memorable characters such as the Roger surly orangutan, the Italian-American flamingo Vincent, the eccentric breeze blake and Victoria, numerous patriotic Snout Brothers and the Chutney elephant. Other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roydur. They are incredibly eccentric and make everything spectacular, most entertaining everyday. <br /> <br /> The fault of this show failure is linked to NBC. Dialogue and disputed issues (drug, prejudice, etc.) with many adult mates combine favorite animal characters. <br /> <br /> They chose not to publish episodes in any way (not more logical production rules, but hospitable guests may be affected). Several times the show dominated for more than half an hour and half as long as the show was no bigger (as it was not enough for 60 minutes)! <br /> <br /> Finally, the television is a disease for the future, though after a series of DVDs and show shows, if such a genuine and brave show is failing. Now you have the opportunity to get a bigger opportunity. 10/10
