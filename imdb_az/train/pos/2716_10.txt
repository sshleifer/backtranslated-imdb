Everything I mentioned about it was perfect ... A great cast with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before getting to know more about the US audience). Excellent scripts, such as just English, - Edward Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion type secrets, but with Jules Verne twist. Like MacGyver, 80 years ago, he was in England ... at the beginning of the 20th century's scientific / technological revolution. <br /> <br /> Often, MacGyver has seen these shows. MacGyver released about 3 years ago. <br /> <br /> There's still one episode in a very bad ribbon.
