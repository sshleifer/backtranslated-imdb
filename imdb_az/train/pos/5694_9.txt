Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are in control. I have seen Kilmer at the door, but John Holmes's interpretation is superior. Nothing was slow compared to Boogie Nights. Wonderland is a film that can only portray a terrible crime from a perspective of a drug dealer and what's happening around him. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows a very clever hustler, which can pass through at least the most ugly situations that are not acne. The film deserves to be watched more than once. The 70s are sensitive and full of medicines.
