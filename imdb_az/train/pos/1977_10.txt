I love this movie. Once I was in grade 2, my teacher showed us a 16mm film. This film may be a little scary for the movie's second-graders, Bill's murder Nancy and Fagin's face on the screen for the first time. One of my friends is sick to see this movie, because he has studied in music. If I were a teacher and could appreciate the people who made this beautiful movie, I'd give them A +.
