As a child, I've been a fan of the series, and then in the early 80s, I liked the previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait une Fois l'Homme ...). <br /> <br /> These other similar Japanese cartoons, which were released later, are not compatible with Mazinger Z because they began to repeat the same mark as boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Another good point is the invention of inventing monsters, weird devices and strange characters; we really wanted to know how each new tactic was waiting for us - a new knight or a bad machine!
