The "Scorpio Tail" claim has all the elements needed to make an effective giallo film. The story is standard giallo. A man who died in an air crash, his wife (Ida Galli), collects $ 1 million in life insurance policies. The widow will go to Greece, but some terrible crimes will follow her. There is a lot of suspicion in the insurance agency and including a great explorer (George Hilton) who is a lover of the widow. Director Martino is trying to guess the identity of the traitor killer, but the story is moving fast. Anita Strindberg ("Your teacher has a locked room and only opens it" and "Who killed you?") Is a stunning hero. It's one of Martin's best films.
