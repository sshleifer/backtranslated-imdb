Always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it was just a "B" rating, but I was amazed at the two main characters. All actors of this film are very talented and well-directed. <br /> <br /> This film is for Dumb and Dumber or blood and intestines, not for someone looking for a sequence of sexuality. <br /> <br /> I would prefer this movie to many "A" films. I combine this film with human goodness, <br /> <br /> I highly appreciate this film.
