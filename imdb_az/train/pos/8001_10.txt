Certainly, I'm one of the best films I've ever seen. The perfect direction and impeccable mobility is a very entertaining and frequent movie. Denzel Washington plays one of the most spectacular and emotional roles so far, and the rest is beautiful. Christopher Walken is, of course, superior, though not as often I have liked it. The story of a great deal of treachery, in essence, against the innocence and love of the child. It also has a fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge, because it is a film for those who love action movies. The location of the Mexican city gives you a sense of seediness and corruption, which is an eye-opener. All this is a film that really is a reality. Recommend!
