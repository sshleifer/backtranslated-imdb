Of course, this movie is not historically accurate, but great fun. Most DeMille images are particularly movable with a clip that is moving slower and plodding, but subsequent epics. The story is a series of peaks that are very quiet moments. The event takes us from a Indian raid in a cabin; a good place with Jean Arthur, the film's best-looking filmmaker, trying to give peace to warriors. After that, he and Cooper are being taken to a war camp and tortured. Then comes a continuous battle with Cheyenne. All this from start to finish is entertaining and entertaining, but laughable. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of the time and is brilliant here.
