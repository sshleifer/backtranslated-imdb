In 1973, when I released for the first time Soylent Green and maybe eight times in T.V. or the videos. It was always one of my favorite fiction and / or Charlton Heston movies. <br /> <br /> Recently, in Egypt, the Egyptian theater has retrospectively taken twelve films. I flew out of state to see six films in two days. Soylent Green looked great on the big Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston, like a cop living in a corner, eats the dog with several natural resources, and how he understands that there was a world like Eddie Robinson and a world-famous man . <br /> <br /> Their chemistry is beautiful. The film looks better on a large 35mm diameter. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and cinematography, writing, used music and everything else related to it. The film is also very powerful in the future, in the dark and very visible. Imagine the worsening of the world's population since 1973, the erosion of rainfall, the resources used, and the green house's impact. I'm surprised that this movie did not play in theaters all this year. <br /> <br /> Speaking of authority, often tells people that Charlton Hester is not a great actor. I'm sure he is one of our best players, seeing El Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Penny and Major Dundee coming back. Certainly, he has provided information about many other great films. <br /> <br />
