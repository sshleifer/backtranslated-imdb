One of these beautiful, intense films that draws us closer to you, soon ends soon! After looking at the screen, "No, it was not!", Lol. All the best speeches! The player Emily Blunt is amazing with simply outstanding! I knew that the director of the Victoria film would have a solid, convincing performance that made it through the entire movie, temper and vulnerability. In addition, any kind of production is superior: style, substance and sensitivity. At a remarkable time in the history of Britain, he spoke of the end of his first birth of nine children, with a very personal and touching translation of the prince's princess, and then to Prince Albert, to the kingdom of Queen. There was a well written script and flawless editing. Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was a long time ago to watch the love of Rupert the young Prince Albert, a successful and compassionate young man, to gain the attention of a young queen. Just like her mother and Queen Williams (who did not like her mother), sometimes the angry teenager was a relationship between Victoria and her mother. Imagine and the scenes were charming, highly emotional. <br /> <br /> I advise anyone who is interested in the historical and political situation in this period, who really loves a romantic story.
