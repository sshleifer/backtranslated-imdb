When I was only 10 years old, at home, I saw Marty's Day on the Movie Channel and still remember the impact on my life. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I noticed that I could not find another place. It touched me that no movie touched me. I was asking around and I did not hear anyone's movie! I do not know, it was one of the rarest films most people did not know, because nobody and I do not want to talk about what. For years, they have searched and searched, checked the shelves of video stores and searched cable TV listings, but it's always short. <br /> <br /> As a result, I knew that I could order a special order in 1996, I did it, and probably would have been watching at least 50 times since then, and it's always crying at me. Martin Day Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but a really good boy), tries to return to the private lake, where he grew up as a boy. It was a place away from nature, time spent with her dog, and enjoying life. <br /> <br /> The cops did not have much time to find her, but Steckert was pledging to persuade her children to return the police. off. Soon Stekkert and his hostage (2nd Martin) are the best friends, and there are many fun adventures - to rob a toy car, to escape on a highway on a private lane. <br /> <br /> Steckert in the film is like a great boy in the lake. <br /> <br /> I will not destroy the end for you, but you need to see this movie. It's the best movie I've ever seen! Undoubtedly, I'm not the biggest admirer of this movie! She was able to find the song she read during the movie ("I'll be back, where I came from ...) I even plan a Canadian trip to see the lake and cottage that goes to Martine Day's movie is crazy, I know - but the movie just means me.
