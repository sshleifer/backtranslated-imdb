First, this is the review of two disks that come together with DVD rental "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> The two films included in the rental, "Wonderland" and Johnny Wadd documentary are myths created entirely by "Boogie Nights". The heroes involved in a major film trade were far more likely to do something for the money than they thought they were, in fact, nothing more than self-immoderated prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly similar to what Wiseguy and the Goodfellas have to do with The Godfather worship and the rest of the gangster romance. <br /> <br /> What's worrying about me now is that those who watch these movies and probably see and love "Boogie Nights" will be scattered, intelligent and sophisticated people who are supposed to be foolish and discreet. Dirk Diggler's "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, which is different from Dirk Diggler, with no irreplaceable quality. Holmes was a criminally miserable sociologist who used her abusive self-esteem, completely consumed for happiness, and was a key contributor to the brutal murders in Wonderland, in Los Angeles, in 1981. Linda Lovelace reinforced the story of the great Boogie Nights and the description of the brutal and miserable work known as the adult movie entertainment industry. Everyone who has positive feedback about the story should be required to review both the Wonderland DVD and the features in the "Boogie Nights".
