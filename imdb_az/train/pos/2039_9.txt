First, I would like to emphasize that some critics of this film have made obvious mistakes. <br /> Everything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly nonsense. <br /> <br /> Reptiles are a fantastic movie with incredible movie effects. Actors are very convincing, narrative-minded, horrifying and graphic content is very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> This film is very mystical. There are many questions when spectators come to strange and bizarre creatures that live in uninterrupted tunnels. <br /> <br /> "Craig" was created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A fantastic movie that is a great factor of cold. <br /> <br /> 28 days later, the movie, along with others like The Bunker, Dog Soldiers, and Deathwatch, is a must-see film and a movie that should be appreciated. <br /> <br /> We look forward to seeing more of these fantastic movies!
