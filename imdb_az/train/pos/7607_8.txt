Not well sounded, well-written or good, but the most addictive show ever seen since Twin Peaks. Each unit was so well-defined that you should see the next episode of any kind. They even slowed down the demonstration of a small amount of information per episode, but they just felt like they were all told what they wanted to know. But some of the players are just terrible and some of the duo's are obviously horrible. Some symbols are two-dimensional. Experienced actors like Locke and Ecko are really Jack, Kate, Sayid, and others. They prefer actors to play. Show development can also be episode because the next episode does not show how much the previous episode shows. Side by side fields have become part of the story that sometimes tells you nothing. However, the second season developed much more than the previous events by pointing out more about the islands. All this is not a great show, it's not perfect.
