This movie is very entertaining and is never even glamorous even in about 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Fieffer and the rest of the movie are great in the film and are very convincing. Violence was a bit overwhelming in the film, but showed how bad the drug trafficking was during the movie. The latter is incredible and is one of the best quality scenes ever. Great movie and you'll probably enjoy it.
