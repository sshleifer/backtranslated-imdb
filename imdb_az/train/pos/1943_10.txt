I had the opportunity to see this movie twice at the Moving Picture Festival in Alabama in 2006. <br /> <br /> When I think about the films shown at the festivals, usually with a heartfelt and unusual, frequent, detailed student project. Of course, there is nothing wrong with such projects, and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes we want to take a more basic approach to an independent film. <br /> <br /> "The key" is more than just a film prepared for national liberation. In other words, a movie that you will see in a regular movie theater. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, cinematography, casting and acting in this movie are all absolutely pro. There is usually no independent thing about this movie. As an aspirant director, I'm always motivated to stop me and looking for more pushed films to keep my career moving. It's one of those films. When I watched Big Bad Swim, my level of motivation was incredible. I felt like my adrenaline was thrown. The reason I felt in this way was that I was very upset about the whole production. I'm excited about the theater and I am ready to write a long-term project. A movie resembles to me, and I know it really well. This is the first long-term project of Isaac Setton and I wanted to be in this project myself. For me this is really rare. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It's beautifully drawn and directed and excellent casting. Paget Brewster provides a very convincing and delightful performance. He has a quality about himself, a ski really pulls you up and keeps it on the screen at any time. He feels you know him personally as a friend. This is a gift. In my opinion, it is missing out on the industry's often acting capabilities. Jeff Branson and Jess Weixler also made top-notch work. I can not say enough good things about The Big Bad Swim. I look forward to future projects from all those involved in its production.
