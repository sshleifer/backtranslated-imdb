<br /> <br /> Just after seeing the Perfect Son in the 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia, I write this. <br /> <br /> After their father died, two siblings met at the funeral, and their brothers died of AIDS, entering into the hearts of warmhearted compromises. These two films, as the film progresses, gradually build a magnificent effort to create warmth and respect. I have an idea in the film, but the dead brother is sick and does not care. 0 A person with a T4 cell looks pretty bad - even if the actor does not seem ill. A small grip, but it is a little more realistic. Despite a little patience, the Perfect Son is a beautiful movie and is it possible to see it? In the near future I hope for DVD freedom!
