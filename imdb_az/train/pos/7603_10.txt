Lost is one of the most spectacular television series ever seen ... and so ... those who love secrets, adventures and adventures are a series of things for you ... In the first season ... the first episode is progressing to the second season ... the latter loses a little privacy and expectation cocktails and is very accusing and discloses the secrets of the island hiding ... The third season is perhaps the second best, because it's the second season since the start of the first season since the first episode of the first season ... the fourth is unnoticed and tends to reveal a little secrets ... but not like the second season, but slightly different ... Waiting for the fifth season ...
