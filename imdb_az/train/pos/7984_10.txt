The man in the fire is definitely one of the best drama / crime I've ever seen. Despite being a slow start, the story is quite complex and sensitive, which is a very good place. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington. He is a body guard, called Creasi, who is suffering from his past, and alcohol, but does not give his last prosthetic to rescue Pita. Dakota Fanning plays a very clever, enthusiastic little girl, Pita, who loves many things and is very convincing, and has a great future in the future. <br /> <br /> This film is divided into two parts, the first hour everyone is happy, nothing is wrong, everyone is just happy to survive as kidnapped by Pita and Creasy is almost untouched. And then the second part, the rest of the film, suddenly everything is complicated and somewhat frightening and worrying, Creasy is responsible for persecuting and planning the "La Hermamdad" and Pita kidnapping, which has been exhausted from its severe injury. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us the most up-to-date skills, along with many other talented actors who have a great future in the future. It's a shame that the film is not well-known, and Washington really deserves the Oscar for a performance and it's Fanning and Director. And even if there are high quality visual effects. <br /> <br /> If you love exciting, exciting, exciting, exciting, it is to see. The most beautiful thing is that the elements of this movie are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
