The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they were not very funny and Bill was a drama element when it struggled with all the usual problems in life, but that element was a bit stunning and uncompromising Good comedy elements, dropped. The BBC soon became one of the funniest comedy series ever prepared! Chemistry between Bill and Ben's character was very funny, and each series has always been very bright and memorable sketches. The spectacular Christmas holiday was a joyful and spectacular treat. <br /> <br /> The show is very sorry for the fact that the main actor Gary Olsen is a brilliant actor in films such as Up 'n' Under, and a very funny guy RIP <br /> <br /> This unusual show is a television show our screens have disappeared unnecessarily and should not be repeated often - after a while, appear on UKTV Gold, should be shown on the BBC one or two times, and this brilliant comedy will bring a new audience
