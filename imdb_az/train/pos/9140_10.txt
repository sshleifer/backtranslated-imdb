I love this movie !!! A year after me was born violet rain and my heart was up to my memory. The princess is very intense in this movie. Last night, I went to Purple Rain for a special show and like a concert, some genuine fans were delighted that this movie was so valuable, and it really is one of the greatest films of all time. Music is inviolable. The movie is about the "Kid" played by the Prince, the lack of family, the group's hottest act of the city, and a graduate of Apollonia. I do not have any question why my favorite color of purple is my color, thank you for that. So, if you have not seen it, then you need to do it. This is classic - 4ever!
