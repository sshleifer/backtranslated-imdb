Great British Indian movie! The fantastic chemistry among the three main characters is to prepare pieces equipped with some luxurious drugs that Cheech and Chong will be proud of. See Phil Daniels on the big screen (even if the sides change from Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is also strikingly good and seeing a treat for ladies! I love the final battle scene with Zulu and nod, and now I know what happens to Arthur Brown after he shoots the Pops! ... he does not function ... really noble British hippie !!! You need to be a biker to use it and are on a Thursday post-pub review overview. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a walk and you will not be disappointed.
