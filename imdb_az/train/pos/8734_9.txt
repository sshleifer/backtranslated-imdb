The movie was completely Awesome and Cool. The graphics were outstanding and unbelievable, especially Flik was superb in the film and she was funny and she was sometimes smart. Circular insects are colored and superior in film. The Czechoser was also cool and cool in the movie. Hopper was a clean and perfect villain. Even the Dot was cute. When the bird's mistakes came to eat, the scene was good and good. Even the final scene was awesome and cool. Even Flikin's inventions were good. Creating artificial birds was a good idea to scare the locusters. When the ants set up an artificial bird, the scene was good and beautiful, I really should value the creators of "A Bug's Life".
