The Symbolic Use of Objects, Strained Pictures, the Position of Symbols on the Stage ... all of them have been used by Hitchcock for such a happy abandonment that you can see how efficient a genius is. From the corner of life to the other, as the war progresses, the color of the wedding is adjusted when it is put on the finger ... it may seem somewhat clearer than the standards of the day, and talk silently about the story without speaking. Even the hood has at least four meanings I've seen; boxing ring, wedding ring, bracelets for love, and the love triangle in the heart of the story.
