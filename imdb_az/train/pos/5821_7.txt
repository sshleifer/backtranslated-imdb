Honestly, I was very surprised to read some comments on this work. Some people were looking for a plot ??? Okay, when this video went out a decade ago, I was watching for it: a collection of music clips. This is not a movie. It does not have a plot or a central story. This is mostly an artistic anthology of long-term videos, all of which are very clever or creative. Michael Jackson may be considered a strange thing today, but this is why Thriller (most of whom have been regarded as the greatest music video all over the world) and Billie Jean and Beat It. Cinematographers and artists who collaborated with Moonwalker once again combined music and dance to create something lively and entertaining, combining with claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self-parody (Badder series). . For those who are wondering what Joe Pesci is doing there, this video came out a little before the home name and was one of the most memorable images in the movie. And, IMHO, I think Smooth Penalty Sequence (choreographed section) Michael Jackson throws something else up to this point!
