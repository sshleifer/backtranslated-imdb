I think cheesiest sinful pleasure-typed movies, the first thing I think is' 80s slasher flicks. The bad belts really. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Slasher flick revived with the 1996 Scream success. In the 80s, as well as the films themselves to themselves "hip, tongue-in-cheek parody as" tagging, was shaped masking a lack of inspiration. <br /> <br /> "Hip parody of the" neo-slasher flicks mixed recently, just to take a little budget, direct-to-video "Cut" is. <br /> <br /> Another "new" Slasher flicks, "Cut", the characteristic of a 1985 movie, "Hot Blooded", to comment on the genre is based on the production of a slasher flapping. "Hot Blooded" movie killer in a mask Scarman, near the mouth of the dark shape of a bald, students who do not have eyes in the eyes of the completed construction of pavilions for the killing by someone. Now, 12 years later, the professor in the film production students in the group, has decided to enter the vaults, the original click the actress and the film ends. Whenever the movie is shot or shot, Scarman returns and someone dies. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">. There is no character development (when the "new" director comes out to be the daughter of the original director of Hot Blooded, whose life was abolished after the production was abolished, which has never been mentioned in the field), and care for all the other slasher squirrels I have a large number of objects. Actors are not great even with direct-to-video standards, but most have fun with their characters (and for those who do not have this character, none of the characters in the movie did not want to work "Hot Blooded"), especially playing Scarman lucky ones. Like the "acute" surface, like "Scream" movies, those who "destroy" the killer have nothing to do with it. The City Legend has no cunning killings. What's in it is the original and interesting concept downloaded "well-selling, in the same way that we can write later." <br /> <br /> Hər hansı bir həssas baxış standartlarına əsasən, bu, qarşısını almaq lazım olan qorxunc bir filmdir, lakin bu "keyfiyyət" slasher janrında onun köklərinə doğru olanıdır və bu, digər neo-slasher flicks hər hansı bir daha xoş gives.
