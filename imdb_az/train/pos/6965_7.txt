<br /> <br /> This movie answers the question: <br /> <br /> Without violating the film, your beloved, dear, needy, jealousy can secure you , but along the way there is a great fun. Uma Thurman, unlike most of her brotherhood, is perfect as a super-heroine, uber-babe, mysterious G-Girl, which is not dedicated to truth, justice and the way of America. <br /> <br /> Thurman is as convincing as a comprehensive daft, still bringing it in some way, Jenny's curator. When he is less equipped, but more emotionally thrown out for a safe and well-adjusted opponent, G-Girl goes to the ballistic and is no wonder then. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this is not a disappointing superhero, but an attractive attractive place, and those who do not give it up completely, but there are moments <br /> <br /> I have this movie I really liked it.
