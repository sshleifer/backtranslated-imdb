Make direct corrections: Zombies are not available, so shooters in the movie ONLY, WORK, Hell may also be FLY. It's so good that it's the original Zombie movie. Everything has been damned as much as they do. I hate when filmmakers do everything like Romero or anything like fan guy Romero. Some shoots think that zombies should grow as a typical Romero movie, since a filmmaker can make a zombie whistle if it's not zombie again. The zombies in this movie are all very good, but they are rotting their bodies because they just died freaking! They are pretty messed up and full of chopped faces and blood. One of the best-selling scenes was a half-eaten cats. My daughter cried when I saw this. This movie looked really good at Fangoria and Rue Morg, so I wanted to see me. I do not listen. When it comes to the real fears of the fan, they are always right. 10 to 10! Rent it!
