I just saw it on television, but I'm still one of the most scary and sad movies I've ever seen. There is also a subtle but intense fear at the same time that you do not see clearly enough to feel safe, just because you have an idea of ​​life (heroine of the doctor). It's really one of the few movies I'm scared to watch. "Production Values" will be hanged, good movies are about the ability of the director to create an atmosphere using movies, actors, places / sets, music, detailed attention and ... imaginations. A real gem.
