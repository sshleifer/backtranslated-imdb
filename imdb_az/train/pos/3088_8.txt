Unfortunately, for myself, I ran this show shortly. I just kept a few episodes (about three) before abolished by ABC. I liked the characters and story - but most of the greatest actors! I've been an admirer of Sex and City, so I've seen two characters I've known (Bridget Moynahan and Todd Smith Jared) as well as Jay Hernandez and Erika Christensen (Swimfan). I enjoy watching the children of young actors, and this show will accelerate their career. I hope this will at least return to the DVD and maybe WB will get a portion of the second season? Meanwhile, I'm looking at the ABC website.
