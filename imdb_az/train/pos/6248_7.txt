Being Austrian, it was a straight punch on my face. Fortunately, I do not live somewhere where this film is, but unfortunately, the rest of Austria describes everything that hated the people of Vienna (or people in that area). And it is very easy to read that is exactly the intention of the director: to put your head in your hands and say, "O God, how can this be!" Let's say. <br /> <br /> I do not need a censor-free swinger club scene with me (in my opinion), I'm watching porn, but I hate it more than just put it in the right context. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film tells how a cheating people can survive because of lack of education or bad company and how they are trying to live in the world of extreme and boring horizons. A girl who is treated as a prostitute by her stranger lover (and still coming back) is a female teacher who finds her masochism on the line of "brutal lover" on the line, almost a mathematical daily cycle (her "official post" ), a couple who is only divorced and suffered under an old husband, of course, with his masseur and finally a naked shooter. After seeing her, you will almost never feel it. You are very shocked, sad, depressed, or you feel like you are ... Perhaps I gave 7 points and did not respond to that. If it were not for good or bad, to you!
