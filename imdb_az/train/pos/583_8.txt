Two brothers are growing in a small town in Montana. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer) and the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Reverend Maclean and they are growing up with religion-related lessons and fly-fishing lessons. In this film, knife fishing represents a part of life. <br /> <br /> The story is good and keeps your attention, though you need a moment. Probably, there are moments in the film, not about the events, but about the message. There are some things though. Norman goes to Dartmouth for education. Six years later, she returned with a beautiful girl called Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and was invited to teach in Chicago. Paul is a correspondent and known as "fishing reporter." <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <strong> good. The most beautiful thing in this film is cinematography. Mountains, forests and rivers look very nice. The film was good enough to watch when it was done for these things. Fortunately, it's more than happy.
