This film is about this dark man who wants to be a spy for a glamorous high-tech company named Digicorp. This clever man, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is dissatisfied with his strange suburban life and his spouse, and he decides to be a spy. It is likely to go to the conventions of other high-tech companies and find plans for all companies. Instead, Morgan attracts himself to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu), and most of them pass through two sides, which force the two companies to become a double mediator. How will Morgan get himself? Can she rely on her beautiful, but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, Morgan can do it out? Amazing! Wow! What a beautiful movie! After watching this movie, I was totally filtered in 15 minutes. It is very challenging and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as he does his best to stay alive. The scene in which Morgan was putting this terrible pressure was a shocking and frightening thing to wash his brain. Morgan slowly passes through an inexplicable personality until he's finally thinking about it. <br /> <br /> A clever man with bad hair and glasses turns into a person who is actively fighting his life. <br /> <br /> Last, wow, the end is incredible! Bending is very entertaining! It made me shy and crazy! Good speeches from anywhere, especially Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I love this movie!
