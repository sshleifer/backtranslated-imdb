It's definitely the first movie that fears me. My brother (r.i.p) kept him while watching him. It was on a black-and-white television and it really was not a good picture, it was interested in me. <br /> <br /> A few days later, my nation bought a color set and would succeed, the Millions Dollar movie showed it on a Sunday. <br /> <br /> I've forgotten most of the plot, catch up ... and I was so scared that I had a dream that night! I believe it's just a movie, but it's not a living creature from space, but I've never heard of it or seen it ... and it was too late to catch it once. Even now, all this time is still shaking to my waist. I've seen a real classic and even a classic thing to scare a new generation's pants! <br /> Long live The Blob!
