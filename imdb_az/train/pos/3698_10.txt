I did not know what this movie was like until I read about it in the source of life. I usually agree with LA Weekly's assessments and decided to buy tickets for this movie. movie stars molly parker (my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lukas haas - I doubt you will be able to see in the very near future. The film is entertaining, delicate, spectacular and beautiful. I do not know if the film is distributed, but hopefully or soon - soon. this is meant to be a real indie gem. even the silver Jewish music that I love! The only disappointment was that molly parker was not on the screen. even before ... was hand in hand.
