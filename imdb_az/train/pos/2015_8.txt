This may not be one of the best films, but it's a very pleasant, very heartbreaking foam that everyone is usually in for a good time. It is only recommended for a good factor alone. Okay, so Frank Sinatra's "move" is so eager for her, but she's a great feature that she read and perfectly matches the songs' romantic atmosphere. Sinatra went on to shoot more movies that illuminated her by his undoubtedly acting ability, but his first attempt at Hollywood was, not his voice, but his greatest contribution to the film. I was still watching on television, and it was the first time I had seen it many years ago.
