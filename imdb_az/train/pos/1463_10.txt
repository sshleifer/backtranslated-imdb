Mardi Gras: Chinese production provides a beautiful, intricate link between popular culture, nudity and globalization through beads preparation and discharge. I saw this movie at the Boston International Film Festival and was looking for a global introduction, but it was an appearance of shock scenes from both China and the US that I received. The eye-opening movie is humorous, profound, serious, non-patronizing, and leaves you more interested in credit roles. You need to compare with Murderball - just a good job. Young female workers in China have different opinions, and the owner is strange about discipline. The carnival delights the faithful, but this perfect movie provides a deep context in the Chinese factory without the story. Bravo to access the movie and finish the movie! I never thought about beads, contacts between China and New Orleans; Now, I think about the relationship between almost every object, at the same time, the role of globalization, inequality and entertainment. More importantly, after watching this movie, I saw that globalization, unlike other films, can make these relationships without a sense of guilt.
