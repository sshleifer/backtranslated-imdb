"Girlfight" continues from the place where the New York City School of Music has found a place for self-respect, purpose and more in the world of amateur boxing. The film is about boxing, but not about boxing. So it can almost have a sweat. Technically and artistic sense of honesty and a good hit with reality in this regard, "Girlfight" is no naked flick and no "Rocky". More precisely, it is a multi-drama drama that unites boxers who can not.
