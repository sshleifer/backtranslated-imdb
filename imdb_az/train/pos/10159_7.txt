There are a few movies or films I've loved in years. The Bible was one of them. I watched it as a young person and would like a chance to watch again. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Then I touched my heart. In addition, I was a fan of Johnny Cash and a daring job. If it goes on the DVD, I'll just buy it for sentimental reasons.
