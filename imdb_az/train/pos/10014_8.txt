The nightly listener slammed the radio station of New York City, which has longed for Robin Williams's friendship with a very ill patient, a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin). Williams did not know the guy because he was talking to the phone. However, Williams's ex-boyfriend (a beautiful job from Bobby Cannavale) is doubtful about a guy who encourages Williams to meet with a person. Consequently, Williams continues to have an unexpected effect. I'll let her go. Tony Collette is also stars. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with this film, which gave Tony Collette an unforgettable picture of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also played as Williams' friend. Night listeners are inspired by the actual events, and this is a heartwarming, almost creepy silence. In some cases, I will not rate some of the reviews I have read before seeing the film, and just because of logic, but I liked it anyway. Williams enjoyed more of this, and it was an added bonus for me more than comedy characters. Recommended. 8/10
