One of the best films I have ever seen is seven of Sam Fuller's films (including Park Row, Arrow, Running, Verboten, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this movie). Fuller represents the most manageable way. Of course, I love it when it comes out of control, but almost all things are perfect in Beijing. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket stealing some microfilms intended to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who filmed for her lover by Richard Kiley. Peters has to find and retrieve Widmark. Thelma finds her through a dove pigeon played by Ritter. Widmark and Peters are involved in each other, which also changes to the fact that Peters loyalties (it works for communists, he learns that Cold War materials are really interesting). The story of love is a bit faster and not completely convincing, but the film is not as bad as it hits (unlike Fuller's previous film Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. It should be one of his best roles, but I'm not very familiar with his career, I can say with confidence. Thelma Ritter delivers the most memorable performance. His role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and its latest scene is touched as you will find in the movie. I'll never forget it. 10/10.
