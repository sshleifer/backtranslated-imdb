Well, this movie is probably one of the most funny scary movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you're just laughing, and the player says good mel gibson. But Gary Browning, a police officer, is not so damnable, it's good. I do not know how to combine this film. 10. Do not be afraid of your movies if it is also bloody and funny. The killer movie.
