I thought the muffin was beautifully written. Not just about fun. There are gentle message tones that are trying to get Yasmin out of the way. <br /> <br /> In some cases, some of you (especially if you do not watch Basket and / or Gubra 76 times) may be confused with others. <br /> <br /> I first realized how the two films were used. right? It's really ironic how the heroes are involved. Gubra is a prostitute as an absolute neighbor. And the snooker pad chick becomes a religious man and wife of a religious man in the future. <br /> <br /> I also love the noise. Her raw is still awakenedly fresh. When Rumah touched a Gamma boat, it was not at once the Opponent's saying, "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim" (the stage when he climbed the tree). <br /> <br /> This is characterized by the character of Malaysia (and, to a lesser extent, how strange it is). For example, even children can be really sharp-tongued (full of creepy noise) and just a bad mouth ppl all the movie. And you can be such an employer and ur not talk about ppl, not out of his own life. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if my film did not exceed it, it was my hope. <br /> <br /> I was stuck on the screen and could not even take my eyes off. You can not even go inside the movie. Ha ha.
