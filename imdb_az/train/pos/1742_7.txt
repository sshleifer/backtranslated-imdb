Probably one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I've seen in the past ten years. Auteur for a very special standard of the Greeks, with very special output (especially yiannis zouganelis is great), well written script and effective direction. Certainly, a film influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs may eventually be a cadet when he flips out of some open and exaggerated situations and symbols. Nevertheless, this is a film about the Greek cinema, which is worthy of our attention and is a rare category that will be watched outside of Greece. It was a shame that it had not been commercialized in Greece and was a fraudulent and attractive product such as Politik Kouzina.
