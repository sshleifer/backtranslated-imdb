I remember seeing the promotions for this show before I appeared in 1993. At that time I was 8 years old, and now at the age of 22 I saw the beginning and end of this religious show and I feel weird to come back. suddenly it may seem so far away. Anyway, I was watching MonsterVision because I'm a big fan of monsters and scary movies. It was the 90th edition of the Chiller Theater. Although MST3K was not a Joe Bob show on DVD, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Joe Bob's comments and movies were very funny. Most of the films featured in the show were B and C, but many home movies such as Hammer from England, plus the shoulder, and many of the magnificence of Ray Harryhausen's stoppage. Many of them are oddball flicks that you can not see in other places, such as Godzilla and Metal Storm and Motel Hell, as well as other independent films, such as Japanese Sci-Fi movies. Film protection and more independent thinkers would be a good show for MonsterVision IFC, the new decade, because they have already hit IFC's grand home show. I am convinced that this show will be repeated for a day's nostalgic reasons, perhaps to wait and see. Until then, it is "Great Television"!
