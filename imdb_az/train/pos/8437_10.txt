*** CLAIMS *** *** ALLEGEDS *** When I see that I'm a big H: LOTS fan, maybe I liked more movies than normal people. But this movie is still excellent. There was something very surprising, and it was closer to the series. I was pleased with the general feeling I felt when I was saddened by the murder of Bayliss.
