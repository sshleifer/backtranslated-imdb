First of all, I love the film and its courageous message to live a full life. Very poetic, heartwarming, funny and sad scenes, very lively, enjoy watching. Although my "exceptions" are as follows: The film was too long, and added a lot of additional conflicts in a way that began to lose the main story line. In other words, the presence of many people with "strange" problems in such a small village is unrealistic. I think it was absolutely realistic! There are incredible dramas everywhere, and we just do not know what we are talking about on the surface. I did not like the endless and extremely endless end. It was a bad taste because it was so bad. Many of the great things in the group seemed to be dramatically marked (some people are "embarrassed" to act individually in front of everyone, while others are accusing others of something else). And self-defense is the most powerful instinct of man. So why was Daniel not beaten to defend himself on earth and never fought? So he was not weak, at least attempted to defend himself while attacking, but he was amazed at not seeing me one thing. The storyteller seems to be trying to force a message like "no need for violence", but the way he chose to do was not good. I am also opposed to violence, but in spite of all the attacks, he loses his character when he remains unprecedented. And Gabriella ... Why is it that when she is arrested for a few years with a woman on earth, she will go to that person and say, "I do not want you to hurt anybody, just like all of us." Indeed, it was very bad! Is he a saint or what? It is normal that his suffering is not "sacred" and therefore not human. Daniel's music and music were so great that he forgot what had happened to him? Oh, please. So these were the moments that were broken. Nevertheless, all this is still a beautiful movie. See it!! ;-) "
