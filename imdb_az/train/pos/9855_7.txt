This is the first CG animated movie I've ever seen. Usually, the appearance of other animated films is sensitive to me to see them. Not the ice age. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to the story "Garabagh", the past three decades ago, An animated version of the Man and Baby. The visions were great. Simply fine. Ideal aninmation is something to create, something else to create visually imprisoned, and Ice Age is a great thing to look at with stylized images. Blue Sky Studios is a company that will look in the future.
