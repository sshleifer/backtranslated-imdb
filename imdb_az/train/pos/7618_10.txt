Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard that the idea of ​​fun was missing from a partner with disagreements and loved it. Well, I watched and snoozed an episode or 2 in the early season, so I got tired. I lost a few years later. bored with current sci-fi costs. Wow surprised me. Gravity is good, cursed, I drank. Driving and scripting are very good, with some of the flash forward / rear facing lamer characters, but not all at all. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack. Jack and Michael are absolutely immature lights, very spoiled and not grown. Kate was a step above 1 step above Clement Kate. In the case of Mr. Eco and under the Charlie level, both died. A black-haired boy talking with Jacob (on the back of the road) is a real concern. Generally, a very decent series: looking more. <br /> <br /> Thank you
