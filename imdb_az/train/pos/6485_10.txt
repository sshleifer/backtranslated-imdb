World War II is one of the best documents about World War II. <br /> <br /> The 24 episodes cover the war and its related countries. The first episode tells us how Hitler was in power and how one of the strongest armies in the world was formed. They also think about military operations and genocides they took during the war. One of the strongest and best documentary films. Everybody should wait for it. Excellence! 10/10
