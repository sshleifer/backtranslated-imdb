I liked this movie for a while, though it seems less "faded" than the other Fred and Zinger films, but it does not mean Harriet Hillard's slightly problematic cast in the romantic role. Once again, the plot is a little bit out of the way - Astaire is a very difficult sailor (a bright old hoofer (of course!)) and the Rogers elegant dime-a-dance music hall. Hilliard and Randolph Scott are drowned despite the fact that they are bright and entertaining to watch their relationship in a way that does not succeed in finding any chemistry. <br /> <br /> Hilliard, despite having a last-minute decision, is very sweet and happy in this movie, but has no screen to give what he needs. The film might have been used by Lucille Ball's clever cracker to get a bigger role in the glittering world of brass, and in such a sparkling film, Roger had a great Helen Broderick-tip hit, "Stage Door" this was the next year for beautiful scenes between the two fantastic actresses). Scott's one-dimensional Neanderthal character, Astaire, who fell in love with Hilliard, is more convincing than the Sea! <br /> <br /> Now the important part, singing and dancing: "Music and dance" are brilliant, moving and perfectly fulfilled, and I often take the stage with tears in my eyes. Other songs in the film deserve some recognition; "Giving All The Eggs on a Jumping" Astaire and Rogers are a great example of comedy instincts and enjoy spontaneous, perfect synchronized dance bursting communication. Other lights "I used to bandwish from the beginning" and "Keep it busy," can show how these two beings can be one-sided. Astaire is one of the few (if not the only) one we saw playing on the piano brightly. This man's talent was endless! <br /> <br /> Generally, I really like it's the ball hat and the "hesitant time" (only though). it is hard to love entertaining entertainment.
