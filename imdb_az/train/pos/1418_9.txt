I have not seen this movie because I am not very excited about the penguin's walk. I promised to finish a tree that would mostly see Disney's opening weekend, but it was simply amazing to see it after leaving; the fact that photographers can draw inaccurate images is actually worth your money. As you never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic, you also see different creatures, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena, apart from touching your spirit and raising the problem of humanity. our life shows how we come from the nature of nature and the miracles that surpass our biosphere. You just have to be a lover of a documentary or an environmentalist in a wooden environment to appreciate the magnificence of the documentary. You just need to have an exciting spirit asking for the value and wonder of life. Enjoy!
