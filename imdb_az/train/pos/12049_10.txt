I gave this movie at 10/10 for some reluctance, because it is difficult to praise something that is very painful and terrifying to me. The danger of a woman on the black face is purely terrible, and music that accompanies her only worries her fears. <br /> <br /> I've been to television for the first time at age 10, and it really has troubled me long ago. I was very interested in what many users say about it. Many film studios are thinking about how a movie might be awkward or terrible, but you believe in all those who place it in the squad, which is truly incredibly powerful. I really love horror movies, and in general, I think they are more funny, but it really scares and probably most of the people are worried. I have not seen it since I was 10 and still do not want to watch it, but I'm afraid some might have some sleep nights. What can I do exactly with my finger, but fear is something that protects the woman as the biggest weapon, and so we feel completely frightened, as sensitive to the audience. Other viewers are attentive to this. <br /> <br /> I also saw a scene that was a perfect production ... but nothing can be compared with that.
