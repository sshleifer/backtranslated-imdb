Direct co-operation between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (Mann worked directly before leaving Mann's nightclub, not less than a star-friendly company). The Farther has shifted the main viewpoint to the presentation of another portrait of a dragged man, struggling with every step, without letting his own reluctance. This time, he is a livestock division that meets the labor problems - the harsh blows to the clash of the road leading to the conquering of John McIntire's Roy Bean School of Law School by a lazy judge. <br /> <br /> Their return and the Canadian border will soon lead to a self-defeating conflict between the judge and the judge. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a great surprise at the end of the road, surprisingly along the way, is an awesome challenge, even when he is not a problem with his comrade, he exploits the anticipated avalanche survivors alone to avoid a group. Most of the film has a hair width between him and McIntire. The judge immediately understands that he invites him to a brotherhood spirit company, which is widely planned to make him lynch. The townspeople, who believe in him on many occassions, are likely to recognize him - although he is appealing to the good nature and burial of the good nature, there is a clear confession as to the only one who can oppose the judge. <br /> <br /> With Mann, as always, there are exceptional utilization of high-end country places, though it will be reproduced lately, and the movie is supported by Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (young romantic interests of Corinne Calvert causing irritability). Unfortunately, the Canadian Rockies' great cinematography is somewhat less accurate, as is the case with a single theater novel.
