Having heard about it on several motorcycle mags, I saw a front view of Freebird on TT Island in Man. Although I'm mostly racing, Phil Daniels proved to be enough to get away from beer and parties while attending a motorcycle movie (yes I love it as Quadrophenia everyone). Finally! we did it! The English did actually make a great motorcycle movie (and no Torque like that) with the best of English comedy in the meantime. Celebrate my words, this is Phil Daniels's best screen performance, and there's a new English legend that feels his name because Geoff Bell is about to come. I liked Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' Fantastic Dead Mans Shoes, where he gives a quiet touch that can add proudly to the growing movie reputation. This movie is not just for Bikers, but I think for everyone (even my darling loved it). I believe that, according to tradition, the same brilliant answer to the Island of Man. As I will break the entertainment of this movie, I will not go into details of some of the classic scenes of this movie, but I want to say that you enjoy and enjoy one of the best nights in the night. I really think this may be a cult classic. As they say in TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
