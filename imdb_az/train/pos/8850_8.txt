The legendary director, Sydney Lumet, gives us one of his best movies on this very tense date and gives a shocking story about a non-functional family as a child. Philip Seymour Hoffman (here's an Oscar-worthy performance), with A-list led by Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, is not the only elements of botched criminal wisdom like reservoir dogs, Ordinary People. <br /> <br /> Many viewers can be mixed up and do not feel the construction of Lumet's construction here. Instead of linearly, Tarantino went on a route and showed a central scene of a robber who went wrong in all its forms. Personally, I found it very enjoyable and I guess what happens next. The scenario with Hoffman and Tomei is very strong with some great scenes between his father and his son, Finney and Hoffman. All actors are attractive to watch entirely, and Lumet is a fun thing to focus on, in general, a style that's not in the way. It's a rare movie, a lot of movement and mobility to capture watchmakers for two hours, but for a moment.
