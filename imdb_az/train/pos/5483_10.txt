I really liked the "Revolutionary Television". <br /> <br /> Twenty-seven percent of Venezuela's wealthy citizens are surprised by the fact that they have all done so in Venezuela. for eighty percent of the poor, for decades to make decisions for centuries. However, when their coup failed; The provisional government, the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the Ombudsman, the Election Commissions, and all civil rights were abolished and were not allowed to leave their homes abroad. They did not even go to prison. Key officials live in Florida. And the protection of their "Bolivarian Constitution" was accepted by most Venezuelan people. Not just the bites date. Democracy, if you leave it empty, you can give you a liver. And in Venezuela this is empty.
