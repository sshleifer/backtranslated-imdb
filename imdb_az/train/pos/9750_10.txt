Yes, Giorgio is a good movie. Yes, it's part of Giorgioun, a little romantic, great music, wonderful scenes, comedy (a great food experience) and a little taste. Any movie buff would enjoy this movie. Those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us at the feast for our eyes, ears, and hearts need some escape now and then? A must!
