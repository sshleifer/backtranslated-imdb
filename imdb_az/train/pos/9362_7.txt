Greetings from the darkness again. A film is rare to explore the soul that men have lost in pain. Adam Sandler, like Charlie, who lost his family and lost his family career in tragedy in the 9/11 tragedy, was living and controversial. <br /> <br /> Sandler, along with Don Cheadle, the guest room of the Old Dental School, was in a perfect life (Sandler, likely to be 9/11). Of course, these parallels in the lives of men are obvious, showing the feelings of men in a movie is really refreshing ... sensations other than lust and revenge, that is. It's painful and heartfelt to see how you've been helping one another. Writer / Director Mike Binder ("The Anger of Upside" and Sandler's accountancy in this movie) gives a different look and feel to the film. Some scenes also do not work, but are generally well written and firmly directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. The character of the sand is reminiscent of the wonderful performance "Punch Drunken Love", but here it brings more depth. <br /> <br /> Supporting work is as good as Jada Pinkett Smith (Chad's wife), Liv (Liv). Chad is always beautiful and does a great job of expressing the burden it has. <br /> <br /> How did film shooting, film shoots, movies, films, movies, movies, movies, and how that day's catastrophic events affected one person, mostly destroyed? In addition to an exciting story and some big shots of NYC, you'll love any movie with Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltreyn's vocals, as well as Eddie Vedder's Daltrey-like movie. Not a complete cipper treatment movie, but a cool movie with an unusual story.
