This is a pretty good movie ... Yes, some of the parts are lame and extremely comfortable, and casting a big star in the movie (AB, SD, Tanuja) is not really right. But I was really impressed by the actor Kay Kay Menon (not singing with singer KK). At first, Amitabh's response to the nature of the incident, a man looking at the EU could only look and say that he could not say a word, and I still thought he was strong, he is a good actor. In fact, for the second time, he proved himself worthy of the Sarkar alongside the EU. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> It's very easy. And the little love angle shared with "face to face" was absolutely unnecessary. But he is a very good actor (as seen in the DCH), Sunjay Dutt is always cool to watch. and the EU ... what can I say? I do not know the greatest admirer in the world, but I know that I can compete absolutely for this place. <br /> <br /> Although Hollywood is a little inspired from its old artifacts, an exciting hour of Bollywood, like the "Big Escape" and "Bridge over Kwai River".
