The re-imagined Battlestar Galactica show has always exploded in the show, which has always led me to tears. <br /> <br /> For the first time, a fan of fanaticism, I love to think that I can choose the best things from BS, and it was good things. A few months ago I had a feeling of gastric illness. I was afraid that the Battlestar would be used again in Caprica, which would make it so successful. <br /> <br /> The story of the BSG was perfectly conveyed by the awesome terrifying survivors, trapped in rotten star boats and admiring the unusual music and the better players, guiding the sequence of prophetic visions and pseudo-miracles. <br /> <br /> Caprica is different. Where BSG occurs after the breakdown of a great culture, Caprica describes this civilization's cold and sedimentary pinnacle. All the vibe I received from Caprica was dependent on the minority report, over-the-counter and effective counter-productivity. In the original BSG format, Caprica solved the nature of religious freedom, racism, God's morality, and human souls in the first few hours of the program. <br /> <br /> Caprica casting is also excellent. <br /> <br /> Every actor, actress and actress have their own roles for each character, obsessive and remote scientist-merchant entrepreneur, anxious and deliberate daughter. <br /> <br /> Strongly in the BSG, Caprica also plays an important role. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and terrific bathtubs served very good subjects. Caprica uses more orchestral sound, and this show has a different feeling than its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely a show from the Battlestar franchise. Look forward to the full series.
