It's too old to know (or care) about the difference between rap and hip hop. Before I became a Canadian, I never saw MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I've seen that this movie was very bright and I thought it was a little satire. Hip-hop culture is very common today, and it's hard to over and over again. (We only say about bagpipe music). I have at least got jokes (at least I think it). Of course, this is achieved from the Spinal Tap, but there are many targets that tap assignments. Carpenters are not holy.
