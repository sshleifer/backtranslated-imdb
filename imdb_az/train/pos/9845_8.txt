I will not lie, this is a great movie. I saw 4 months ago at the local theater. I saw for the second time and missed the slow scenes. Sid (flattering) is not all that flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, in my opinion) is really good in the movie. The animation is superior and the story ends with a touch. Children are worth 10 or less, but teenagers would probably be a bit boring. Also, the uniqueness of the characters is very interesting. As I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I value Toy Story 2 or Shrek better. 8/10
