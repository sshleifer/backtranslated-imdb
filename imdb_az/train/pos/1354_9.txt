For people interested in business and corporate world, this show is just the best. As one of the former competitors of the show, he wrote in his blog on this innovative show: Businessmen finally became a spectator. All ideas are perfect; they have a group of traders in the best places in the world, competing in business-related positions in New York City. Donald Trump is perfect as a boss, though the ego is bigger than the infinite universe. <br /> <br /> Season 1: Great season, the best season is the "normal" ones. This season was a lot of things about actual business skills. Then, the series plunged into marketing tasks by placing multiple product placements. Great and exciting competitors are, in general, the most popular character in this series: Troy. I know that Trump World Tower episode, Amy and Nick, were fake to win this special job. Season 2: It's also a great season. There were a lot of tasks and there were many interesting competitors. Jen M was terrifying and never gave it to the IMO in the final. Also, this season was the worst fire (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Terrible. In fact, the book liked the concept of smarts and street smarts, but the cast was so terrible that all the season was a total disaster (that Trump turned out to hate all casting). Season 4: A perfect season, for a very exciting and entertaining reason, good moments, second episode (motel renovation). participants of this season (especially the general disaster that Randall, Alla, Marcus and the name of Toral). The episode "Take me to the Boardroom" is one of the absolute classics of this show and is remembered by the fourth fire. Unfortunately, I think we have been robbed of the Randall - Alla final. In my opinion, Trump was afraid that he could win and that did not happen. <br /> <br /> Season 5: In the busy season, there's really nothing special. Brent was just a shame and obviously to create a drama. Their responsibilities were terrible (how did they deal with the job?). <br /> <br /> Season 6: I can see LA as a new place to show, but we looked back. An error. New York will always be this place. This season has added a lot of new things, many of which were terrifying (for example, the loss of a team wanting to sleep in tents for PM). The tasks were terrible and Trump chose the wrong one. <br /> <br /> Season 7: The popular edition. The best season. Totally different rules (like rolodexes use), but all are fun and fun. The biggest problem is that many contestants, especially those without me, were not really real, except for Omarosa, who was not known to me. This is a total disgrace to everything that is involved. It was the season of Gene Simmon, but during the Kodak's mission he made himself a fool, and another man emerged from the shadows: Piers Morgan. No one has ever dominated the season. He crushed his opponents and faced a great sense of humor (though some Americans (but not all Americans, they are not wrong with me) did not have social skills to graspfully regret it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This is the UK's version of Valentine's Sugar for the lovers. In fact, the English version is better and tells something since the American (and original) is a really great show. The UK version is that the contestants behave as the right people in the hall, in the normal version, unlike steady screams and honest behaviors in the US version.
