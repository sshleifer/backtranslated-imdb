I remember seeing this movie a few years ago, maybe BBC2. I would like to look again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? I was reminded that it was a particularly strong film, especially the striking scene, with horses with gas masks. Besides, I really can not remember a lot about the story - so I want to see it again! I trained on the Internet, but I will not find an unusual copy of my experience - maybe there is no DVD or VHS on this marketplace. I appreciate any assistance that everyone can give me. Thanks in advance for your help. My best wishes are Albany234@googlemail.com
