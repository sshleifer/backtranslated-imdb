Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. Government officials are advised to choose more electrochemistry or to take some practices when they get rid of the power supply. He chooses experience and is placed in a large metal cell, which is a poor offender who escapes from the power supply. They can have whatever they want in the room, but they can not abandon it. After a few days, the meals fall to one each day and the room temperature is about 100. It is not possible to sleep after more alarms are heard in the interval. One day, a "cad" enters its own cell (even though it is a glass part). I am here in minority, but this is very interesting to me. <br /> <br /> My price: C + Media Blaster 2 DVD set Extras: Disc 1 Trailers for "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack on gasoline usage" and "Deadly smuggler Rekka" Disc 2) Theater cut; Comment by Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Casting and crew interview; Making; Original Trailer; and Promo Teasers
