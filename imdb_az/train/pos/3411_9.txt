This is easily a wonder, even anxious thing, that Michel Serrault, imitating Dr. Petiot, a legendary French serial killer, is more known for more funny roles in the previous part of his acting career. <br /> <br /> Every moment and every moment the actor is not just behind the character but only the best of them earn this feat and when they do it is only the best part. The whole story (a true story of the 20th century) is so strong, very bad - a long and long time reminiscent of a very strong film.
