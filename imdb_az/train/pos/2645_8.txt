No movie caught my attention as I did. As you can see, I have been watching this movie for twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> I remembered the film's memory that it touched deep feelings. there is a great desire to watch it so deeply. The film's intrigue by the man looking for and seeking the father / son is sure to touch every person who follows it. <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> My memory was real. Rating reflects the content of the movie. I would like to watch this movie on DVD, which removed the quality of the VHS used in the production of 1977.
