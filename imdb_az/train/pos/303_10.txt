When I went out in 1981, it has been one of my top three favorites since I've seen this movie. I'm very glad that Amazon has written down below and only on 10/17/06 - finally, on the 25th anniversary of the movie. <br /> <br /> The last credit in this film is his appeal - "I thank the Manhattan population for the shooting of this island." A charming and witty romantic comedy, everywhere (West 12th Street, Ansonia, old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and the city limit of a country and western club). Like an ensemble itself, it has an impression that it clicks on off-screen, and this proximity is clearly reported. I laughed, cried, it was better than CATS. Not Dorothy Stratten, but Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (he was the next poster) and his inner beauty was seeps on the screen. Take a great bath with a great miracle and have fun with your favorite guy.
