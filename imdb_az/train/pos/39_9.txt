It's undoubtedly one of Shemp's first shorts with Stooges. (This is the exception to the previous andudeville year with this team). But the trio comedy is the best case here. In addition to the powerful rifle scenes, others are more subtle, but laughable. Follow Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera to shoot him. Or look at the realistic object of Moy's respect, "Oh ... very polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is in an irritable moment. And the ram may seem scary, but not so laughable. <br /> <br /> This is an episode for those who love our chestnut. This is not disappointing.
