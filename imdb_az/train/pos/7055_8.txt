Although Cinderella Jag and Guusey were not an open choice for my next favorite, I did not hesitate. The format of the mice writing Cinderella is inspired. I am very happy to write my own stories and I hope children will encourage it. Three stories are cute and entertaining, though the songs are forgotten. Jag and Gus were my favorite characters, but I am also glad to see Lucifer, Bruno, Mice Chorus and others. Pom has proved to be a perfect companion for Pom Lucifer and I liked the government. Right result for change. My rating is 8/10.
