Here's the "nanooky of the north", the last word in the archaic semi-documentary "eskimo". How wrong! As a handful of skiers, I was up to 330 hoping to get some hand-made 'skins'. The movie did not leave me. Any student of skiing / umiyak construction should look here. <br /> <br /> But the film was clearly beyond narrow interest. Despite the fact that others have said that the movie is a bit of a hit back, they are just a little worried. This movie (from the viewing of this amateur anthropologist) was probably the perfect time to create this movie. The Early Thirteenth: "conversations" are new (including Louie B. Mayer), allowing Inuit to speak in their own language. And despite the obsolete melodrama, it was still a great deal, though it was genuine. They are really poack bears, whales and whacking this caribou. The yearly version of this film is called "Stars", "Technicolor" and others. It would be very surprising. The seventies version? Not even. In this manuscript, a very good companion associated with the "white shadows in the southern seas" (1928), a mirror of Eskimo, in a privileged and profound way connecting western culture / technology to a person without suspicion.
