I saw this movie as a child and broke my heart! No other story has come to an end ... I grew up in a very big anime movie and this was one of my favorites because it was unusual - a story about injustice and cruelty, loneliness, life and choices can not be abolished and the need for others. When Wolf's mother killed her mother, Wolf was alone, but when Wolf was in the mountains, Wolf was alone. Although the hero says that he will eat tomorrow morning, he will not kill the lamb. My assignment is broken and used. I'll fix it and watch the movie once and I'm crying as I did as a child. These stories are so rare in this sense, with this depth and feeling, and in meaningless sense. This is a sad story, but I have never encountered a better way with any catharsis. I'm glad to see this movie, and I'm glad to see it as a kid.
