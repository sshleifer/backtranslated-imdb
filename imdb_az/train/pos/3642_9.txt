I saw this movie 3 years ago and then was presented by Disney President Eisner and Real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> A month ago he returned to TV and this time I banded. I had to watch at least three times since then. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful, inspirational and good film that is cleverly written and believes in everyone's movement. <br /> <br /> Children continue to read books <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In my opinion, as Hollywood goes, it's normal people. <br /> <br /> This film is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; this is a dream come true. </ p> <p> As B4 says, the film does not try to go with a big feeling, Dennis Quaid, as usual, <br /> <br /> This film has a great deal of excitement and respect for the writers. <br /> <br /> A gem comes out of the picture before the big game in the film, and his wife sings on the stands. and reaches his family. <br /> <br /> If you want to change the speed, select this movie.
