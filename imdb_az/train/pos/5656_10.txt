I did not remember the name of this show. When I was 8 I used it to watch it. I remember when I was late because I could not watch this show. It was the best show for me. I remember it, it's still great. This showed that Lucas Black showed her as the first boy she never had. I'm from the country, so the guys who highlight it do not ask me, but I would definitely make an exception for that. After seeing Crazy in Alabama, you need to see the lights on Friday and the Tokyo Drift. He is a great actor, and he was a child. I miss this show and I hope you will come back. If someone sees the season sold, please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
