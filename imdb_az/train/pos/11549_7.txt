There is nothing unpleasant about Odd Couple and it's not surprising that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a very successful comedian team. But there is something about Neil Simon's adaptation to the trick-stroke game, which looks like a sketch at a sketch comedy show more than a full-featured movie. I have not seen games, but Simon has to think that the screen version is very loyal, so errors can not be blurred on the screen. There are some interesting ideas in this story: two divorced men have been married at home when Simon is no different. There are still fewer ways to kill a few hours.
