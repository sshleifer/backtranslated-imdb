I did not expect much, and for the first time I did not like this movie for being honest, but still watching it, and I realized it was very nice. Of course, this is a joke movie, but it's a funny naked. <br /> <br /> Someone wrote that it could be better written and may. I think this movie has the potential to be my Cousin Vinny's advantage. But instead of a lawyer, with a horror host. Unfortunately, this is a waste of opportunity. May be classic with a little more writing. Children are still not used because they have to join Elvira. Except for obvious reasons. It would be great to see the development of their connections. I know it's a comedy, but there are differences that make good movies bright. <br /> <br /> Elvira is always entertaining and attractive. It is impossible to speak of taste. Every time you laugh at you. It's hard to shoot when the main character is very attractive. And that's really his appeal, let him deceive you thinking that his appearance is a kind of tart. Well, he's. But that's fine. The type of person you are allowing your children to look at. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he looks like himself. <br /> <br /> I just do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> It's just a bigger set. He has incredible pairs of legs.
