The main problem I have seen with this film is that it is a scream that shouts with every note: "This is a cheap comic film." There is nothing more to say here. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;" > It is a dialogue between Martha (Adrien Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman), which appears to be the leader of Martha's experiment. During this dialogue, he always knows that the audience is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words, the cessation of disbelief breaks here. <br /> <br /> The integrity of a convincing dialogue between two people is sacrificed for compelling information that the filmmakers want to convey to the audience. <br /> The third problem was the discharge of Adrien Barbeau. Honestly, I believe he is a great actress in his creativity, and I feel that this feeling can be very long. The main purpose of the mesh's invisible performance was to have a character from a problem-loving family of his own and to a woman like Rambo on a mission. This aspect of the scenario would clearly be an extension for any actress, and Barbeau could not blame much of it. However, as long as I have played enough adolescence, I would only say this is a medium-level problem. Finally, in the first half of the film, a climbing factor has done a great job, especially when it comes to horror. In the second half of the film, as a mechanism to prevent the fizzling of the procrastination factor, the film feels more useful than any of these flashes. <br /> So what's my overall rating? Because you had to make a movie to produce this movie on a limited budget, I'd give it a solid C + B. Even when faced with two heavy or two serious problems, the film is based on the solid area of ​​the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I do not see any problems with the development or adaptation of the field; with the exception mentioned above, the dialogue is clearly bright on the ground, in particular at the beginning of the movie, all important moments between the mother and daughter; As noted, the creep factor was well established, if fizzly in the second half; <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie, though, is a favorite with a Nazi. :)
