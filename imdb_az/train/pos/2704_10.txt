When I did not accept this movie, I was disappointed if I was not surprised. Once again, Billy Zane proves to be more than just a Hollywood beloved boy with a quiet performance that combines a spastic rifle with simpler pants. Calling a silent movie is inaccurate because it has many music and sound. It has a manic speed and Ed Wood can finally lead to the evaluation. See the cast list and understand that everyone is shining. There is no one to show your face. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I believe that he has participated in the movie these days, to show Wood's assessment and to have a wide-ranging and physical activity to be seen in these days. <br /> Be more sensitive to a movie than to show that you are aesthetically valuable to any kind of movie. And IWUETDID has no clearer target audience. He was largely deprived of the love of the Woodun script. After his death, fashionable social parasites hit him another serious blow and deprived his world of a small classic. This is really a very entertaining and really experimental movie that is worth the DVD to live on.
