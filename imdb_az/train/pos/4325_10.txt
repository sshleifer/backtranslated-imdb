This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of the classic novel I know. The presentation of the Chancery Court as "character" is spectacular. The invader is awesome from the terrible Tulkinghorn to Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and two young lovers. But the network of luck and cinematography are all over the place that collects all the spiders together. What can the BBC's copyright statement say is that this version does not appear on the US video or DVD for many years? I tried to learn from them, but I encountered a stone wall. Finally, I got a DVD copy from Canada.
