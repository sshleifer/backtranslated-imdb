ODD COUPLE is a classic film version of Neil Simon's most popular game about a television presenter called Felix Unger, a well-timid, obsessive-looking, stupid, Oscar Madison, his best friend, divorced after his wife, Frances. She is already divorced, Oscar gets her best friend and regrets it since doing so. Neil Simon's classic comedy for Broadway is played by Art Carney and Felix and Walter Matthau for the first time. Jack Lemmon takes Carney in a movie version with a memorable performance like Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only laughable in his role, but faqih Unger is a living creature bringing a melancholy element to a better figure. Fortunately, Matthau was allowed to resume the role of Oscar, one of the kind of comic performance that ensures consistent laughter throughout the whole. Lemmon and Matthau were the funny gold again in the other nine films. With both of these actors and us, this classic look is more effective, but less funny. Simon's game has been greatly enhanced for a screen shot of a suicidal attempt by Felix, who suffered from depression through a silent prologue. Oscar's poker players include Monbia Evans and Piedgon Sisters, Carole Shelley, Oscar and Felix's gallery, Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines, and David Sheiner. Of course, then there was an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there is nothing like the original. Joy from start to finish.
