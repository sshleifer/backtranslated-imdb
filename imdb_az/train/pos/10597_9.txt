I praise the pictures that try something different. <br /> <br /> A lot of films like repetition of old ideas, so Passport to Pimlico is a very important reason. <br /> <br /> The film and post-war shortages after WW2 and Londons rasyoning looks like a "dark" ride. The film is called Pimlico in a small neighborhood in London. They are sick because they can not afford what they want, but they do not see any way. Here is a hidden treasure, and they accidentally a few hundred years ago, this neighborhood is called as a sovereign nation to repel an arrangement! With this document, they live as they want to live, Skip, and all your mind and think of coupons. Because they are not really English subjects! You need to see yourself where the film is gone and where the crisis has finally been settled. Leave your bright minds to come with Ealing Studios!
