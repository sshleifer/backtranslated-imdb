It's a beautiful film, painting, cinematography, music and suits. In fact, this movie is more beautiful than the Akira Kurasawa's leadership. In this case, he wrote the film just as it had been written a few years after his death. <br /> <br /> So if the writing goes, the dialogue is well written, and sometimes the story is interesting. But this story is still inadequate in some ways - all of which is a story of a group of women working in a prostitute. Interestingly, prostitution is regarded as a more favorable job in Japan, but women continue to live a better life. <br/> <br /> <br /> Thus, in general, it is up to 7 - mainly for everything - but the article. The weakest link in this film is the story of the great Kurashawa.
