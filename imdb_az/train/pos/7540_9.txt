I liked this movie very much. I've always been an admirer of Whoopi Goldberg, and this film just emphasizes it. She describes an African-American family home lady, who has her husband, Danny Glover, attending a social chain as her attorney's attorney. He moves towards all the neighborhoods that make people friendly. Various events that occurred during the film's course laugh at some, but apply to many more emotions. This movie is not a comedy like a drama. I give a strong 8/10. I recommend that you rent it on TV or as soon as possible.
