It was played at our Amsterdam theater, and the movie we wanted to see was sold, so we had a documentary about the planet without knowing anything about it. We are very happy to have a very strong film about life and the fact that we all share a sensitive balance with the people living on earth. This movie has the most breathtaking photography I've seen in a movie, and I've seen deserted oceans in the rain forests and I have never seen movies, television or books! "The Place" is a film that every student needs to see before the exhaustion. I will encourage my nephew to see this movie because we will inherit the planet we are leaving. This is a movie to see on a theater screen or on a very large television as photography is very powerful and exotic.
