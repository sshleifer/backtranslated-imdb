Gordon Parks, a photographer of the prolific Black Life magazine made a true ticking-timebomb of a movie here - nothing around! Based on the true story of two NYC police, he later denied the names of Batman and Robin, who applied radical tactics to clean up their independent drug neighborhoods, a period prior to becoming a police-friendly film. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <strong> These two police officers begin as a security division in order to vacate dealers who are outdoors in their spare time. But instead of applauding the city police department, they take nothing but resistance and contradictions by their peers. <br /> <br /> Both David Selby and Ron Leibman, both of them go to the police station and legal corruption, boneheaded assignments that would be used on the streets, and the potential is fantastic; part of the entertainment watchs Leibman's flawless comic performance on every stage and sees Selby's player down and simple. These two stories create all the comedy aspects of the work - gutsy is a palmable frustration that is mixed with determination. Director Parks, who are familiar with the controversial issues in photography, do not escape from the source of the story. Instead, the film does not agree with reflecting the stiffness of the police world and street criminals where these two people live. Adding this realism actually originates in the roles playing Hantz and Greenberg as technical consultants for the movie, and as a real actor in the two friendly officers who mock their heroes. <br /> <br /> Why can the MGM / UA allow it to stay in the cabinet for 30 years - but can you give it a little? A home video or DVD broadcasting in the United States? It is a small work of 1970s.
