Turquoise! OK, the kid playing with Oliver is a bit too cute! You need to see this movie, starting with great cinematography, color, costume and the most impressive performances. I've seen a great deal of adaptation of this great novel, but it stands above to instill in them all and its music! This is a master Fagan, never leaving a character to make a song. You will not know if you really love him or not. In other versions you hate it from beginning to end. When you read Bill Sykes .... Hess is an average, and he's in this movie. Oliver Reed was a master. His wife ruled this kingdom. I went and saw his latest film, Gladiator, not seeing the headliners, based on his very good performances. Music is time and mood. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You must be!
