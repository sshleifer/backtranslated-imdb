The Dirty Harry series began with a very strange move and almost instantly lighted up for the Magnum Force. During the event around the "Enforcer", Dirty Harry was less than a television police show (saved by Tyne Daly only). Seven years later, Dirty Harry finally returned to his roots. Perhaps this time has long gone. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is the first Harry film that Don Siegel first made, and this is also a significant help. Harry is a darker character, he is a beautiful cop that is translated. He can say the words "Future, make my day" and really mean it. "Sudden Influence" is a continuation of a true Dirty Harry. "Enforcer" should never be. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7.2
