My story is about my family, my father, Milton Raskin, played for the Dorsey piano. After joining Sinatra, my father worked with him the last hour. Then, at one point, my father told Sinatra that it was a good thing to connect with a small band (band) and that he should use it. At that time, Sinatra had received enough credits to "do so under the pipeline"! <br /> <br /> Dorsey never forgave my father, the rest is history. </ STRONG> </ strong> <br /> <strong> I've seen Sinatra more times than I ever wanted to, and its films will never be old. . . Thank you, Frank
