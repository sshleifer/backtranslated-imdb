I had a good time watching this landscape and I was amazed at the more research features. Firstly, it is cheaply made with film, cardboard sets, limited settings and creative scientific details. The actress is changing between the very poor (from the two robbers), the gothic overstatement (Leslie Daniels auxiliary Kurt), the first degree with Virginia Leith, who is just a professional (Herb Evers, leading man), as a prime victim, for the luxury passions of science and her fianc√© will use it. In terms of scenario is very good and dialogue is fantastic for this first movie. The role of science and medicine in our lives and their boundaries increase. This movie is a very thoughtful movie. However, do not be too fooled by the true intention. It is a dark story about the creation of a perfect woman for a man with the best of the body and soul who is capable of combining his dead dead daughter with a perfect body. Another of the many other aspects of the film is the signal that the doctor cries everywhere for the beauty of the city.
