Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-combine all their songs when they create a trio called "Creme" 35 years ago. The psychedelic days of England and America looked at these guys: all skinny, too long hair, wild clothes and loud music. <br /> <br /> <strong> Black and blues combination and most of the good things. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are now 60 years old and still can read and play at a high level, this beautiful DVD shows us on a gigantic disc. Of course, I've always been familiar with Clapton, who has never been in the spotlight, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, and I did not see them for ten years. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was as strange as he was after his death. Now he looks solid, playing in shape and playing his drum was tight. Bruce looked a little dark, but his sounds are as good as usual and it's a delight to hear those old songs. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized this exhibition for its low level. I do not agree with that. I have no complaint. The concert sounded very well. <br /> <br /> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;
