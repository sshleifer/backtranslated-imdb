I found it to be a very romantic / dramatic, with a great feeling, which was a wonderful ending. It's not Hallmark Hall, a family movie prehistoric "Famame", which is considered a "normal" behavior, but stars are Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, but at least I was expecting a very hard-core movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is that it's important for you to read and write when you are an adult. <br /> <br /> The film's biggest theme has some impressive scenes in this movie, but the movie is not memorable to be honest. <br /> <br /> I am still happy to offer you a fairly soft, beautiful tale.
