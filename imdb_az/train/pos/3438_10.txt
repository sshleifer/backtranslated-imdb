Despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes, the film was very prominent. In fact, such things happen and, therefore, this film shows many. All this has begun with a recently-graded Maya (Rosario Dawson, a superb job). She is faced with Jared (Chad Faust with a terrific performance) on the side of a frat that comes out to be genuine gentleman and sweet. She invites her to eat. They look at the stars from a bridge and go to his apartment. They talk and take him to the basement and confuse each other. He tries to end, but he is raping. This event scares him. She sees a club meeting with a bartender / DJ Adrian (played by Marcus Patrick) and gets drunk and helps before getting away. They hit a friendship. He also makes drugs and Maya begins to use it. In other words, it introduces him to a different world. She goes to school, works as a TA (Teaching Assistant), and as one of the students begins Jared spots. Students are deceiving Jared, even though they are busy. Jared is trying to make the Maya talks, but the upper side still wants to invite her. History will repeat itself? Or will it be a surprise to Maya Jared? You watch the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson attentively and faithfully describes this role. Chad Faust does not like being harassed, but he does a terrible job like Jared. Marcus Patrick is a brilliant man who rescues Mayan and trains a new world. This film is worth the prize.
