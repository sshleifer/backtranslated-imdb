Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played with such conviction that I just cried. Glenn's role as Ruth showed that she wanted to deal with the situation, but she was under her husband's control. Robert Duvall's character, Joe, sincerely said, "Think about what he did for the story, describing a village family that was involved in the angry death of his son, a stone man, who was so embarrassed and unhappy that he emotionally became a philosopher. Jason Presson's character, Arnold, was a strange one, and I was deeply impressed with it, perhaps thinking of the horrible things that I had seen in my life, and personality and character of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs. I thought Frederick Forrest, a mixed, brother-in-law, played a foolishness to try to help the situation, and his wife Lou, by Gail Youngs, as a foolish lady, was confronted by Arnold's misery and his troubles. I did not want to apologize for this, though Lou tried to bring his marriage together, but they did not solve their problems effectively. They did not really do anything for the movie and were absolutely funny. Wilfred Brimley, like Mane, had a small role, and he touched the only character Arnold showed. I felt the role of his role. The players were sufficiently good and felt quite good. But I liked it very much, actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. Hillermans were still a family. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were very realistic.
