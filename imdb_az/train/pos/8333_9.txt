IQ is a beautiful original romantic comedy like the Cupid assistants of the 20th century's greatest and deep-minded scientific minds. The side view of the heart and mind is the main theme of this light hearted but thoughtful movie. You know very well that you are giving a part of the time when you see great scientists to develop love that is boasting, but at other times you hear some of the deepest puzzles of their age / time span. The final result is a funny movie all over the world. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates an interesting, destructive brain mathematician and Tim Robbins reveals the contradictions of a poor educated businessman, surprised by science. Together, they form a farcical journey through love and knowledge, mind, and heart.
