I did not see all of Jess Franco's films, and I saw 5 of them, and more than 180 of them. Probably maybe a little early, but it is better for me than the "Necronomicon Getr√§umte Sunder" (better known as 'Succubus', but this cut version), of course Franco is the best. Franco was known for his "Vampiros Lesbos" movie, which became more popular in the mid-90s after becoming acquainted with Jess Franco ("known" can be somewhat exaggerated). The happy little man discovered through the soundtrack and discovered what was expected after seeing the video clip "The Lion and the Bodring": Jess Franco is a great director. When the phone rings during 'Vampire', I call. I just wanted to see more movies. Since then, Franco has never caught me. But then I shouted at this movie. I think it is better than Vampiros Lesbos. Franco is looking for a story and what he can do with the camera. We know he can do a lot. Of course, I did not expect to find the "Necronomicon": at first I was not surprised. Remember that before I saw "Vampiros Lesboz" (despite the chronological aspect of the previous three years), both films were shot straight. But then the story happened, amazing and grungy, beautiful camera work, and what you want to see what they do not distribute God's political messages. Later, I heard a story about the art in the movie or I'm not old fashioned. Adam says all movies should be old because the audience takes a week after filming. But the girl "Bunel, Fritz Lang and Godard drew a film yesterday morning" replied. Janine Reynaud is an exciting leading actress and, of course, Franco is also on Howard Vernon. Fortunately, the player is good (Franco can cover many of the movies for you, but not this). But of course, look for the puppet scene. Erotic tension, attractive leadership and tomorrow's film is a must-see film that many should see. Of course, it is less favorable than Vampiros Lesbos.
