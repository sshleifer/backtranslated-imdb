You will lose some of the things mentioned in this document. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of movies. Director Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Road, Mullholland Waterfall, Slow Duck, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and Conversation (Coppola). <br /> <br /> Segway movies, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but these are the sources of doubt.
