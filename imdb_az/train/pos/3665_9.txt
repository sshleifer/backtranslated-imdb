They did it. And, guy, they did it fantastic or what? The BBC finally brought up on Tuesday the doctor was on the screen! And they do it with style! <br /> <br /> ONE EPIZODE: "Rose" - One of the strongest new series is Russel T Davies, a writer and producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what other fans want, and he is an experienced writer, so he knows what other people want. Another phenomenon perfectly illustrated in this first episode is the character of Billie Piper and Rose Tyler. Finally, the Doctor's wife gets an incredible story and a strong character. <br /> <br /> TWO: "End of the World" - At the start of this double project, it is good to see the return of the Eurons for the demonstration of TARDIS. 'We're ending with a story that's all powerful, special effects! Now they have the technology to create a real, believable environment and monsters - no more rubber suits! <br /> <br /> FOR THREE: "Surely dead" - We also talk about the episode "Doctor's past" at the end of this episode - there was a future, now allows the past. The first episode of the non-Davies was somewhat flat in some places, but it was developed by Simon Callow's Charles Dickens and suddenly twisted into the field when angry Gelf appeared. The Fourth EPISODE: "The Aliens of London" - The results of the doctor's actions are investigated in this series, at least through the effect of Gul, who fled together with GÃ¼l. Moreover, we have the first cliff; It's not the best loser. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> first. Also, clips from the next episode at the end of this episode are boring and disturbing for people. <br /> <br /> Under EPISODE: Dalek - Yes! We have the future, the past and the present, but now good things - the Doctor's return to our rear. Here, we think we can finish Christopher Ecclestone - he was as brilliant as Doctor, and then in this episode, when he remembers the pain in his mind when he saw the pain in his face and he was almost a Dalek essence. SEVEN SEASON: "Long game" - a story to really act as prolog for only the serial finals. Simon Pegg was kept in a fun party by Smarmy Editor and Tamsin Grieg. The Mass Media Manages Us - It's Never Before ... <br /> <br /> Six Eight: Father's Day is a great episode. The feeling of human emotions and heart failure for the rose and the real results of what happened when you look at the history. Here, Billie Piper is awarded a full mark. <br /> <br /> Episode: "Blank Child" - This child is not very scary. Sorry, but I do not know. It was a good episode, but the cliff could have been better - the Next Time bits that destroyed them. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> John Barrowman is here Captain Jack is introduced as a conjurer conman - he's been around for a while with a good actor, but now just seemed <br /> <br /> EPISODE TEN: The Doctor Dances WW2 story - a very good historical context. When the "Mummy" emerges, is it a bit confusing for younger audiences, but happiness ends? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "Boom Town" is probably the weakest of the series, but that's not bad. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Slighheen" and also an interesting characteristic of Dr. and Rose. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - this is quite foolish, at the popular television show Blighty. Even though things are rapidly turning to deadly serious, and eventually the single series is the best cliffhanger! EPISODE THRITEEN: "Road separation" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. In Fantasy Doctor's many ways, David Tennant has to really work his socks to be as good as her. Finally, the regeneration scene is beautifully played. Oh, and Daleks is back - too much! God bless CGI because they will never be able to do so in a normal way! <br /> <br /> Generally - bright! 9/10
