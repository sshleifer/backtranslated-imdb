This first part of the BRD Trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less than that of Veronica Voss. Political Muslims show these: we see deprivations after the war, how gypsies manage to manage most of their day-to-day life (Fassbinder is trying to sell a full set of games while playing naked) <br /> <br /> There is some irritability at the first hour. With a black soldier cut off by the appearance of Hermann, the scene in Maria's room should go faster. Maria stumbles on Karl Oswald's train scene when she insults GI - and I was bad. But if the story develops and years pass, I have been attracted to this bright and cold world.
