I've seen this movie on the previous night's television. Then he went to the title of "The Staircase to Paradise." As a young boy, I remember the story being deeply involved and interested in the visual effects of the judicial process. Such imagination! A perfect mix of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this film goes with the greatest classics most prepared: native Kane, Casablanca, Wind. This film was highly rated by IMDB voters and therefore - evaluated 10 to 10 out of 51% of voters; More than 84% raised to 8 or above. I was surprised to see that this movie was not listed in the best 250 movies I have ever seen / appreciated compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this movie will be broadcast on 1st (North American) DVD, so 1), I can buy it, and 2) others find this hidden treasure.
