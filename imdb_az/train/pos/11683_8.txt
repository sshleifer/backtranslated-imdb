I really liked this episode, it was a great surprise that I took into account that it has a bad reputation. From the perspective of pure writing, the '16mm graveyard' Sterling is an absolute cure for typical fantastic dialogue and character analysis. Particularly, I'm delighted to balance the episode's philosophical gifts, the basics of truth and truth, and to balance it with more psychological issues, such as denial, pride, desires. The 'sixteen millimeter tomb' is an episode that removes these ideas from the rest of the world, which does not want to be changed. This is a fantastic example of the cerebral Twilight Zone; It explores the mind more than the world abroad. <br /> <br /> This episode does not consist of mistakes made mainly on Lupino and Leisen shoes. Simply, I felt Lupino's heartfelt and could be considered memorable. This, of course, was absolutely ashamed of how he wrote the character of Sterling. Moreover, Leisen did not know what his symbols were related to most, and sometimes he did not do anything at all, sometimes explaining why he had taken Lupino's poor performances. Fortunately, Balsam is doing a good job of covering many weak spots, helping get the show back from at least one moving perspective. <br /> <br /> As I said before, you should not be as bad as the classic movie and a fan of cerebral science science, sometimes sometimes. In addition to the above-mentioned article, the episode has some fantastic photography features (still shows that it looks good about fifty years later) and is a fairly decent design. Generally, the 'sixteen millimeter tomb' is a great episode, and above all, of course, one to think.
