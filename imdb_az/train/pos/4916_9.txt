The author replaces femme fatale with this high-end sound bomb shot by Elia Kazan in New Orleans. The boiler always boosts performances of actors, also shows a charming defect for claustrophobic tension and is a combination of intense compositions and stunning single-shot discovery scenes. <br /> <br /> A person who runs a country illegally is killed after a card game. In the form of a bubonic tuberculosis, it is important not to kill the killer, but to vaccinate all those who are in contact. City and health officials carry out a privacy plan, not a warning to the perpetrators to escape from the city and fear the spread of the disease. A watchdog and epidemiologist is an alarming concern when using the balancing research style in the sea. <br /> <br /> Sides raise the public's justifiable ethical issue that the media may have a greater risk for the public because it claims massive media confusion. Regardless of the result, you will find the actors of the film for the second time. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark's brief tempers like Dr. Clint Reed and Paul Douglas, like Detective Warren, respect for each other and search for murderers respect each other. Reed's wife, Barbera Bel Geddis, has good moments with Widmark on some local scenes, bringing tactile (more funny) from the tension of desperate search around the crazy lensed by cinematographer Joe effectively on the New Orleans coast, McDonald. Zero Mostel is stealthy and condemned as a minor offense, but sometimes sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance skeleton Blackie (Black Death) is just as superior. With riveting intensity, Palance prefers every field, not only with extensive danger, but also with its charm. In addition, it demonstrates a great track record, especially in the strongest recent allegoric moments of the film, which gives greater durability. <br /> <br /> The panic in the streets is probably the best Brando movie in Kazan. It is tense, suspended, well-paced and edited. Local setting ensures that the environment is increasingly real, allowing Kazan's visual style to go beyond the film scene and succeed with Panic.
