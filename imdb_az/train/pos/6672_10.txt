I have seen the Mystery Men Police a little bit in the press and the general public (eg imdb sounds), but my common sense is that Mystery Men is more profitable than most movies, comedy films and very elegant. Good by the way, like Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits Ricky Jay's Kinnear's limousine is a perfectly 'spoiled movie star' and its character is smooth with comic book quality and reality <br /> <br /> The places and visions that I will admit will be a little far away from the pacing, but of course it can hurt to characterize more, but at the end of the day these are high conceptual films - the Little Tiger What is Lily? "- and there are many adults in this movie that is worth seeing again and again.
