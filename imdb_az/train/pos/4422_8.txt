<br /> <br /> If you're one of Kathana's film nuts (like me), you'll appreciate the crashing of the samurai, which causes metaphysical Katana's bloodshed. <br /> <br /> Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) & Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This helicopter war between Heiki's clan and the Genji clan touches the zenith at the latest show on the Gojo Bridge. <br /> <br /> Demons, magic swords, Shinto monks will make beautiful visions of Buddhist monks and maestro Sogo Ishii. <br /> <br /> Blow up for a good Japanese rainy summer night.
