Chuck Jones's 'Hare Conditioned' is a fast paced, often fun cartoon movie. Strawberry Bugs Bunny uses a 'Hare Conditioned' multi-purpose structure in front of a store manager with strange yellow leather that wants to fill it. Chases, bugs and their followers carry through various departments, and they quickly take them to the inspirational sticks that come out quickly from various departments wearing this part of the store. This great stick, with a really inspired sequence, is a mask for lifts, Bugs covers the store manager wrongly, delivering frauds without hanging or extinguishing elevators. Unfortunately, a brilliant climactic set piece that gives you a very funny ending gag. In addition, 'Hare Conditioned', one of the great chase films, exploded in wild energy. Though some of the bugs are more sensitive to other cartoons, 'Hare Conditioned' has shown that it can still be attractive as an anarchist character.
