I read countless articles about this game like Max Payne, when I first played it, I thought it was a bit strange arcade game, from Max Payne style (not just a bullet). When I played for several hours, I realized how fun it was! and unlike Max Payne, maybe the bullet times are a bit like but I think it's a different way of playing. This game is a non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a coup'em up, very fun, DTR's storyline Max as a big fan of Max Payne, Payne, the graphics seem to be the same in some medium and some levels, but If you want a little bit more "bullet-time", you have to have this game.
