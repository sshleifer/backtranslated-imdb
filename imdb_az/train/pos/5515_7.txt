Before I watched this movie I wanted to read something and know it, it was a real hero for the people because he just wanted to see equality for everyone and he hated what repressive forces did to the people, as well as all other Latin Americans! Now I do not know about others, but for me it has done something right for everyone to pay for the fair share of sociology. But a powerful elite would not go for that. Thus, in addition to not understanding what Che Guevara wanted, they were forced to kill him to prevent the revolution. There were many other friends just from where they left their jobs because they did not work. A good example of this was Castro's leadership in Cuba. Before I died, Chine said, "If you kill me, it is good, but you kill only one person and never kill it!" <br /> <br /> Here's 7 films out of ten.
