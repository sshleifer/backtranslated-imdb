Deserved to be awarded the prestigious Hollywood Award, this is a little gem with lots of pizazz and some pleasant surprises. Perfect funny scenes include a hilarious shot (and re-shoot) on a WW1-popping scene like a comedian comedian Clyde Cook with a com and a unlucky McDoakes as a Boyer / Colman messenger? all in the eyes of Ralph Sanford's unpleasant surprise; a lost McDoakes managed and redirected by equally astonishing Jack Carson; Deputy Director Chandler McDoakes is delighted at an opportunity: "I'll be a director!" <br /> <br /> Ace has a double role, playing both McDoakes and McDoakes both comic O'Hanlon! It is strange that Richard L. Bare, who played himself in one or several other appearances of the series, refused this opportunity. In real life, Bare, six-foot Rock Hudson lookalike, but here he was a veteran actor (over 500 films!), Signed by Jack Mower.
