I do not understand what fans of this genre do not like this movie. It was really entertaining. The special effects were amazing. I generally agree with IMDB voters and analysts, but this is not the case. When I came home, I waited for another reason that I would not like the movie. I believe that special effects films should appear on the big screen, but it's still not. The film is compared to two films released simultaneously. Blair Witch and Mummy. The films I thought were terrible too. Blair is probably the most terrible film of all time. Mummy made the money gobs and it was purely clean. People like it for their special effects. Movies like Mummy and Haunting are not rich in character development, but more funhouse rides. The similarity was Mummy Haunting's E-ticket B ticket.
