I read Schneebaum's book (the same name of this movie) for the first time, and readily translated it into the "other" (with the ability to see and enjoy Amazon's and many others). a way to live a decent life. Her subsequent books were not strong, but she showed her ongoing research. Cain's relationship with his men was in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness were pleasant. This film expresses the beauty and genius of a beautiful person, and ensures a perfect solution to the "irresponsible" responsibility of the "cultural" men in the integration of traditional societies (in this case, not a moral positivity). Nevertheless, Schneebaum itself has become a kind of great guilt offering the possibility of rescuing humanity from its own destruction.
