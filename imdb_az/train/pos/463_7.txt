Of course, the film is stronger than the script, especially in cast film. Very nice things to see. In particular, one aspect of me is the idea of ​​antiseptics - Luzinin (Turturro) - an old teacher working on his slavery. His chess rival - three pieces and ruddy Italy's nakedness - acts as a real paradise and a really good chess player. His rival, along with his plan to finish the final match for the championship after the death of the "rival," went to the finish line (Lujin pulled a tape from a window - but sadly left it), in the death of the unbelievable genius widow (Emily Watson.). Lucy's defender (who understood it at last) was allowed to play. It praises the Italian gent and makes it brilliant. Dramatic "last game!"
