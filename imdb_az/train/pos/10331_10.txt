TRIO prepared after Quartet continued the quality of previous movie versions of short stories by Maugham. Here are three stories VERGER, MR. KNOW-IT-ALL and SANITORIUM. The first two are funny (THE VERGER is a long joke, but with a good payment) and the latter is more serious (related to health issues). It is probably the author of movies and stories. <br /> <br /> James Picker is the protagonist of VERGER soon to become a signatory to Samuel Pickwick. He keeps a small job in this church, but the new Vicar (Michael Hordern) is the intellectual snob. It burns when you hear that Hayter does not study. Hayter has earned a lot of money, as his wife, Kathleen Harrisona, is interested in getting a small news and a tobacco shop. His eyes are good, his eyes grow. Soon there is a chain of shops. When his grandson was christened by Hordern, the latter admired how bleak his past Verger was. Bank Director, Felix Aylmer, talks about the diversification of his investment with Hayter. <br /> <br /> According to Maugham, she was acquainted with a person like Max Kelada (Nigel Patrick) at her visit. At MR. KNOW-IT-ALL The future is a compressive, sincere type of business on a business trip (due to jewelry in the Middle East). His wife is Mr. Gray, in the state room (calm and proper Wilfred Hyde-White). Max can animate things and soon embraces the boat's fun. At this point, the story is actually a non-Maugham story and movie, part of the film CHINA SEAS (1935). Max claimed that he could tell a fake jewelry piece (after the jewelry piece he actually mentioned). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Roland Culver's "Ashen" (Maugham's so-called alter-ego - a writer and once played a spy, as Hitchcock's secret agent). Here you have to use sanatorium for several months because of your health. He is a sad, but beautiful young woman, just like a young Scotsman like Finlay Currie, a Currie of John Laurie, a young man with a serious illness that threatens his life, as a second scotchant in the "war" with Raymond Huntley Michael Reyny shows his internal crash as his wife shows. As the three stories between these characters, Culver watches reveal its results. The latter, dealing with Simmons and Rennie, is ironic, but deeply moving. <br /> <br /> The previous QUARTET was a sweet surprise and it was necessary to watch.
