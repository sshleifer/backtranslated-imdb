I think the story context is surrounded by other posters, so I would like to write about the effects of this movie on me. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I saw the year 1987 in this movie. My school visited the cinema to see him, I think for a RE project. We are all naturally excited, because we went to a movie school! We did not know what our experience was. So far, I remember the feelings that I have inside me, and most of my friends cry. I think we were shocked and sincere in the age of injustice .We had the same effect as the same year I joined the Anti - Apartheid Movement. <br /> I had a goal in my job.
