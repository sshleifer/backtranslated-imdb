Amazing! Wow. I liked the whole series, and I was shocked by the comments of those who think they are misunderstood. Maybe waffled a bit on season 4 at 5, on television it's better than anything else. However, there were beautiful permissions on topics developed in the first three seasons, especially 6 and 6b, especially. <br /> <br /> 6B this kind of confusion began with a mood and a line that Janice was always looking at with family intentions - knowing Toni's skills, sitting and watching. Anyone who misses the impact for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's concerns about psychiatric research and the self-sensitivity of the sociopath for pets and animals, a panic attack on the ducks leaving Tony's pool, and Phil's "wave-bye" br> <strong> The episode of the past episode hates his predecessors in advance (not in Chase's dark humor) <br /> <br /> I can continue, but added that the final show - Tony's family's AJ's SUV and or just beginning with the Vanilla Fudge opening strains to keep the ironic foreshadow ("Leave Me On") moments when Phil's head was fragile or explosive at the explosions. <br /> <br /> The best television. <br /> <br /> In a changing environment From a pathological point of view, "jack-off fantasies" AJ immediately (and then immediately subsides).
