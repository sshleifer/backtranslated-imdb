My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {Cut, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Playing <br /> <br /> I have never seen a director's style to get the previous style. It is clear nowadays that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's nudity, embarrassing, striking editorial method. If I want to choose between love and hate, I would love it. Sometimes it draws attention to the borderline, but the result is extremely good and it's nice to see a creative edge of the director's style and some originality (even harder than MTV videos). <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley plays the role of the bad badass award hunter Domino Harvey and even this style shows itself as strangely as his dialogue looks strange dark. Otherwise, she is playing poorly because I hate her character, and despite her suffering, she did not tolerate her. Domino is married when we connect with the respected giant hunter Mickey Rourke, Rizvan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew wandered around the FBI and suddenly saw the reality show at Christopher Walken's television producer (Christopher Walken knows what he's doing in every movie). I believe that this is a clever movie, because now Tony Scott uses the very spectacular MTV / Reality Show edit as it likes. <br /> <br /> At this point, it's part of the MTV culture. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the story is read very fast at very strange speed, with many strong language and severity of arms. There are some funny jokes; but also all modern and surreal. This is a mess, but it is a very unpleasant mess. As a result, it is wrong in many ways (actors are trying hard to make their characters "cool"), but they work. I give a weak 7/10, which can be generous compared to the overall consent of the film classics. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong>
