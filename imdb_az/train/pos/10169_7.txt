It was a beautiful movie in his dead body. It was pretty funny, though it was decent and fun. There were several clich√©s, but I found the most things fresh. First, I did not think it would be all good, it started. Although the first 20 minutes, the movie becomes more interesting. This film did not laugh with laughter, and OH MY GOSH was not that nice. If you were just a movie you could sit down and enjoy it as it was enjoyable. I do not see how bad this movie is. This rating is a little too low. I could deal with 5.5, but 4.8? Also by giving this movie 1 is disgrace. It was pretty good, and there was not enough terrible thing to give most of.
