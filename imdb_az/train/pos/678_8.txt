Peter Weir's first international success, LAST DOUBRE, is an effective nude with an interesting back story based on Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer who draws his life away from the reality when he engages in a criminal case involving the Aboriginal tribal competition. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects. It is doing its best to manage Chamberlin on the eve of "Dreamtime", and the history and people of Australia are a special alternative. Due to some budget constraints, a film that is somewhat lower than bad effects is determined by an indefinite atmosphere. Nevertheless, the fact that we perceive the "truth" as a concealment of the surface and the feeling of fear is an interesting film that will stay with you.
