Psychotic transsexual Bobbi kills a prominent doctor (Michael Caine) (Angie Dickinson), and then follows a highly expensive prostitute (Nancy Allen) who holds Bobby's look in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is under suspicion and is coming to his team to catch the killer's son Keith Gordon. <br /> <br /> It can be summed up in a few words: very sexy (Dickinson and Allen looks great), very bloody - generally protected with splatter films and the boy is well-prepared. Writer / director De Palma's script is good, but it's really a human-to-film structure. It's very successful at visceral level and I'm really interested in these characters and am interested. <br /> <br /> I remember the respect of Hiccock's standard de Palma - at least one of Master's paintings. <br /> <br /> And there is a professional and convincing player to overcome all of this. <br /> <br /> This was the third movie with De Palma's former spouse, Nancy Allen, after "Carrie" and "Home Movies". Meanwhile, actress Rachel Ticotin's assistant producers turned into a dancer. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> br /> 8/10
