One of my favorite "in-house" movies. I do not know if there is any person in our country who does not see this movie. It's funny and sad moments ... I do not know that we should accept this movie in different countries around the world because we have to know some moments in our Serbian history and the character of Serbs. The first half of the 20th century is to understand this! <br /> <br /> In some cases, there's something very good for me. first to learn how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Applause.
