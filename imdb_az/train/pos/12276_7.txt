Can the main purpose of such an environment be successful? Was this the proper adaptation of the Allende novel? Obviously, yes. Bille August was able to create a superficial, superficial film, which is the ultimate incomprehension of the basic elements of the South American mentality, which is simply presented as side events. I can not believe it's a production group that can not understand the book! Of course, this movie has a technical quality and the actors do their best with what they have, but something is missing. And that's the most important part.
