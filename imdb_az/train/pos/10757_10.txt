** Caution! <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand it's hard to cancel a historic documentary, but I'm showing some archives and methods. <br /> <br /> This is not an exceptional documentary, but rather a story behind it, not just for illustrated footage. Because they do not explain the story of Naudets 9/11, but rather a firefighter, relationships with men and the audience is more realistic and stronger than the standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> The 9/11 textbook is a textbook. If events are a real script, the characters will be superior after they have been created, and then they will be able to react. The story is even more beautiful considering the pain and emotions of the images that the directors should spend to put this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film is a look at the fire station. in particular, how a bass has taken on the staff of the veterans. This part is pretty good and maybe it would be strong if the documentary was allowed to go. Brothers are realistically showing the process of becoming an NYC firefighter. <br /> <br /> Of course, all hell remains empty. After watching WTC attacks, the chaos explicitly appears because the different symbols we know are thrown into horrific situations. Not only the attacks, but also the first-hand reactions, is a very moving image of the excessive human emotions. <br /> <br /> According to the information that the survivors are missing and discovered, the human tragedy is at its peak. Life and death remain in balance. Unlike many movies, the audience does not really care about who lives and dies, but really cares about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing that I have to say about this is Robert DeNiro (I want) blurbs uninformative, unnecessary, and the story is not premature. Of course, they were added to attract more television viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: The best document I've ever seen. Unusual drawings of human emotion and drama. 10 to 9.5.
