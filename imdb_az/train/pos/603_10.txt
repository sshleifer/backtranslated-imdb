Albine's music covers this movie. Played with original devices (for example, a piano, but never a full orchestra) once and for some time, but is often redesigned with various modern ensembles (such as guitar) and treatments (eg jazz piano). Sometimes it is only the focus of the film: music is often the most common dance, often flamenco, but not always. I guess there are 1214 scenes that are not associated with one area. All scenes do not reach height for individual viewers. In my case, more than half had reached the peak, but everything else was fine in its own way. Those who worked for me took me gas and me to aesthetic pleasure; Indeed, the last scene was crying with joy. In some magic way, this depth brings Spanish culture. Do not worry if you do not like subtitles. Although each scene is a part of Albeniz, the movie is actually inaccurate. When I see this beautiful movie, it sharpens my complaint that none of Sauran's films is available on the DVD in the US. Especially I think of the flamenco version of Carmen, but there is a great art work in Europe (where European DVD can not play DVDs). This is a scandal.
