After watching this movie, the first word from my mind is "beauty." I think that Kenny's character was only white, because beauty all around, in the actor's game (Andie is always as superior), well-prepared shooting and the red line of writers. this is another kind of drill and predictable life of the three children. His interaction is that Andie's character is in a fun way, maybe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the events in the Caucasus. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> <br /> For some reason I love this movie, the British are in all ways - all houses and "fags" and emphasis :))) Andie is doing something again, this is a shame that this movie has got so low.
