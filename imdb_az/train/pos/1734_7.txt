I first saw this movie for the first time and liked it. His dance was very entertaining. I read somewhere that he was involved in this movie because he knew to dance. The decoration was great. Yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful. She laughed at the extravagant kissing scenes, but it's a great thing about old movies! I grew up with him and was delighted to be watching him in his previous films. These may all be the best, but you still need to watch it and see it. I slowly get all the movies and watch them as I get them. I have a great collection of memories.
