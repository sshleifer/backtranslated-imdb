I saw this movie at the West End theater in Louisville. The scene where Dr Carmus found the coffin of gardener and the dead body he breathed there was the most terrible part of my film, but only intensified by the film's darkness. I was also interested in people who are dependent on trees until Blackwoods family name has been renamed from Blackblood, and it is well-known that the family has a multi-ethnic diversity. Sir Thomas Blackwood smiled at adding the deaths of the family. As I go to the gate of Foster's cemetery, it is careful when you see the gate of the gate that was at the end of it. I will not hesitate to recommend this movie to those who love the movie.
