Inspired by this spin-off television series that has drawn just one season and twenty episodes for the "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" prepared for outstanding television, it's really a shame because the best program is often the win-win and extremely exciting funny mix of confusion (Toni Vincenzo, a constant and patient press critic with Carl Kolchak's neat and patient passwords, was always a cure to watch and hear), intelligent writing, fraudulent supernatural dangers (love the unusual and original creatures) "The Spanish Moss Murders "," The Center "and" The Heights in Horror ", such as zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches, can not go wrong with n'true frightened favorites), colorful characters, cool guest stars (legendary biker flick icon William Smithin is a rare one to fight against the "Energy Eater" heroic device in other episodes), the peppy effects of Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels in the other episodes), the real pitiable moments (especially the summit of the Spanish Moss Murders) was really awesome and, alone Darren <br /> <br /> Kolchak was every hero in the 1970s, the first was more than 70 heroes. a clever and sensitive friend, with a powerful nose for a delicious spoon and a failed skill to enter into any trouble. In addition, sometimes the bumbling Kolchak was something but superhuman; He usually had a certain internal strength and courage, which, while fleeing a deadly danger, was closed or spilled, still allowing the human race to save time and time from other rescued enemies. The armchairs were covered by a few delightful secondary characters: Simon Oakland's perfect Carl's chronic illness boss, Toni Vincenzo, was perfect as he prepared for the ideal comic foil like Ron Updyke, after Ruth McDevitt's sweet Miss Emily Cowles and Carol Ann Susi appeared in only three episodes Missing Refuge Tank was very entertaining as Monique Marmelstein. Of course, the show suffered from anhydrous makeup and special effects (unfortunately, titul lycanthrop in "The Werewolf", "unfortunately Yorkshire terrier!") And the last episode is a few funny junk monsters ("Chopper" headless motorcyclist, Cathy Lee Crosby Even in the "Youth Killer" as well as Trojan Helen), even the second-rate shows are redeemed by the brutal sly sardonic mind of the trademark of the program and the existence of McGavin's infinite vigilance and engagingly knives.
