There were over 50 fantastic movies. They made great shots at Drive's theaters. Many of them even went back. This film and 'Life in the World' is on the agenda and both are well-aged in their own way. Starting with the eerie theremin musical score (which is strangely appealing since theremins is still used) The Forbidden Planet takes people to where they go. Speaking of Star Trek, there are many things Star Trek has taken as a pilot for the TOS series; interactive captain / first mate / doctor, mad scientist, foreign creatures, short skirts, computer intelligence; All right now is rigid, but it was first of all. At the same time, it has also done good deeds and good deeds, which have caused some fear in the picture. Imagine how well the Great Krell machine has been successfully described. I saw it when it was a new movie (a drive - 0) and was afraid of me. Certainly, every movie was scary with excitement, but I remember worrying about the invisible monster. The Forbidden Planet movie can watch a fantastic fan several times and find something new with each one.
