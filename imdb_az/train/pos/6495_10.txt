From 10 to 10, this brilliant, proven documentary should be seen in movie clips from the war that people have not seen for many years, until they are shown in 1974. The films shot in this documentary, Something, some clips made me lilac. The entire series tells a storyteller with a long storytelling and war with more than 20 episodes and Sir Lawrence Olivier. Simply this is the best warfare document and is now able to make a huge blow for over 25 years. Although there are a few episodes, I have to watch this for a while, and you will be affected by this documentary because this documentary belongs to those who suffered and died in the name of WAR. ..
