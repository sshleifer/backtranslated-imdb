Wow ... what a hurricane. The 30s is a decade-long film, which I can imagine, especially during the early conversations. There were painful static and loud movies like Bella Lugosi and Dracula, and sometimes there were good ones and sometimes those who did not have a good rest. This is one of the few films that can not stand, and this is both a surprise and a regret. Lloyd Bacon, who oversaw the 42nd Street, had to be the king of the music of the Depression cycle, and he was thrilled with the sounds that had been brought to the world of cinema because he was full of this picture. You should not have a full or two minutes without a musician or a speaking person. Not totally crazy! I was thinking about the 5th (or 6th) film because the pacing was very bad because it was insanely fast and I did not even know what happened and what to think about. The heroes were not interested in me, and probably escaped to places they did not speak to. I would only be rewarded with little headache. Lloyd Bacon also discovered that "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, throws women's lead at 42nd Street, and the end was the best part of it. And what do you know? The same thing happened with "Footlight Parade"! The latter is completely incredible! It has become the most effective music I've ever seen. In the last part, we are presented some music numbers, and I believe it's something that sees the rest of the movie's value. Numbers are flawless! There are three big bits, and the most effective, of course, is the second one. Suddenly, the screen was full of bright and inventive camera work, nice people and a straightforward fun that I forgot about my little headache.
