EARTH (2009) *** 1/2 "Planet Earth" with a great example of greatly adapted nature in the BBC / Discovery Channel series, with truly awe-inspiring nature, "these footprints" are the natural environment in the natural environment, (a large white shark drops the shadow seal as quickly as a meal) and cute (different children and their rents)). The basso profundo tones of James Cullen Jones say "God's eyes" and depth. The captives of the word have been captured for centuries, only fidelity should be in this IMAX format and may even take longer! Oh, well, there's always the next time (since Disney Studios is preparing this number on a number of future). Alastair Fothergill & Mark Linfield.
