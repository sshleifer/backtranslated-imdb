For the first time, I saw this movie while watching movies with my parents on DirecTV. It was on the Sundance Channel and it just started. I love music, especially in the 1960s, as BJM (The Dandys alright). Everything about Brian Jonestown's massacre forced me to use music, Anton and Joel's personalities, and use illegal drugs. It was funny because everyone went with my parents and when I watched the first party scene when they decided to watch (their faces were priceless). Anyway, this is one of my favorite films. Because he introduced me to the Brian Jonestown massacre, which is my favorite band of all time. <br />
