I've seen this classic a few weeks ago. I thought that fear moments that started 30 years ago would be very discreet. Boy wrong. There are a few nice moments that can shake my back. <br /> <br /> The real picture of life was as follows: Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was very nice. <br /> <br /> It may be too slow to start slowly at an extreme start, but then you can not stop it. All photocopies, e.g. Nightmare in Science Street, Scream looks very modest. I can not say that Carpenter is really the best, because I did not see a lot of it, and I can only remember one of them, Starman (I think). Halloween is the merchant achievement of the horror genre.
