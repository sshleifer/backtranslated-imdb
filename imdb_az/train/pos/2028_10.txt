Burlinson and Thornton, along with Dennehy, perform well in this film. But, in the first place, he really thinks about love, but it really deepens. The beauty of nature attracts this movie and puts it among the best I've ever seen. Horse scenes are absolutely fantastic! Any horse beloved here will love this movie! <br /> <br />
