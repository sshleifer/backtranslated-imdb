I've never been an admirer of Farrah Fawcett ... So far. It was really nice in this movie. After re-capturing, the feelings that should not be re-captured do not think. It was a very difficult movie to watch, because the subject was incredibly unpleasant and just like a brave man, you feel as if a woman exploited is sitting and watching. In fact, I felt that when all the comrades returned home, they shook me a bit, and eventually I did not get any results. The director was very eager to use the height of the shooting and loved to reflect the mirror, so you have to pay more attention to speed in the second half of this piece. I'm sure that a powerful piece of theater, this movie was just for me, though it was short.
