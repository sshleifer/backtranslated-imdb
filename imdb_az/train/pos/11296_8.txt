There was a particular interest in this movie. At the age of 17, I just went out of the high school. As a member of the Employers 'Union and Hod Carriers' Union, I started working at Fox in the 20th century. After one or two weeks at the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier), enough clothes and so on. She wanted to bring suitcase with her. When I arrived the next morning, the bus was waiting and about 20 people came to the south towards San Diego. Only in a short time we stopped at Camp Callan or an army base called Camp Hahn. At one time we ran bunked a few miles north of Camp Pendleton, a large offshore base. There, on the beach, we began to build what should be Japan's Pacific island base. It includes a water tank, a warehouse, a sandstone bag and a dwelling place for a week or ten days to complete the installation. All this was a very high fee, sometimes a "golden time". <br /> <br /> After our work, I did not look forward to the excitement because it was a war and it was very difficult to get good meat at home. about eight or ten months will be filmed. Then I waited anxiously for two hours after the screen was coming. Then, three or four minutes (perhaps less), the base of the film's heroes began to blew up. A bit frustrating, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite disappointment, I was very pleased with the movie and did not see it anymore. Then I learned that this movie was captured by the government, and Fox paid an expense plus basis, perhaps considering the exaggerated payment and lifestyle there. Bob Weverka
