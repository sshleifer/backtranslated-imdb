I've seen and added this movie and the game, that's the most impressive story I've ever seen. Before seeing this film, I did not know how terrible a life was and what was still happening to South African children and adults living and living at that time. It brought tears to my eyes, and it was so sad that my story was just strange for any human being to fight for survival and to divert his children from that area and teach them to move and pretend. It's just over five stars, and I rate it at 10 degrees. I would like to thank Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a surprising story. Though it's been 12 years since the story has been clarified, it's still a heartbreak to my heart. If you have a VHS or DVD in the game, please ASAP.Thank me. PS He hoped that helping someone who wanted to know the problems and circumstances of other children would be able to help their hearts and suggestions.
