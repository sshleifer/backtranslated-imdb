This is one of those western, standing alone in the void of this dialogue. Very few people can stand at a long distance. That is, the rest are pretty bad. Nevertheless, I am eight years old, because there is no other western to pursue such a long-standing good dialogue, with perhaps the exception of Western Bunch, Junior Bonner, and perhaps a few more. <br /> <br /> John Drew Barrimore, who is rich in wealth, looks at it most. But there is one really memorable scene. There is no such thing. Immediately after killing Wichita's sheriff, Jack attempts to replace Elams with a fight. Beautiful things. Thank you in the best way any westerner.
