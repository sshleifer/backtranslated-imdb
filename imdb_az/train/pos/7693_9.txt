"GOOD TIMES", in my opinion, hit a spectacular CBS! I have not seen each episode, though I still love it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I love the theme song. If you ask me, it would be good for everyone to stay on the show all the time, even though I love everyone. Everyone has always exhibited a good performance, the design of the design was spectacular, the suits were well-prepared, and the writing was always strong. As a result, it can now be seen on the TV Land, though it is recommended to capture it when it is turned off for good weather.
