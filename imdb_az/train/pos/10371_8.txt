It is based on a very powerful work-movie that can be confusing to watch. I'm telling how angry media that can hurt people, and in this case there is an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their baby. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was known for his performance after leaving the movie. but I thought it was as good as Sam Neill. Let's say that both are good, but it's a bit difficult for Streep, because he should learn Australian accents. <br /> <br /> My wife loves me. <br /> <br /> He is a wife.
