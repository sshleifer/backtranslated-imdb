This was the first attempt at the Bollywood world, and I am now enjoying it! Okay, so you require a different mindset to watch US movies, but you'll never enjoy being disappointed once. Songs are superb, melodious and very appealing. Actors have the vision of Karisma Kapoor, one of the most beautiful players in the world, especially in any part of the world. Places, colors are respectful. If you want something different, and if you want to rise, amaze and encourage, I recommend that you take this movie.
