Such a nice movie! Very warm warmth. Love for Gigi's character can not help. She grows up as a child, a beautiful and sensitive artist. The whole film is sitting around it. He lives in a beautiful world? all life lives? curiosity, desires and expectations. She has a brother who wants to steal her fame, but she really is in the shade of her life. The father is a very stereotypical Italian and mother. My father wanted to come to the final stage and unite with the mother? We need to cry and laugh at them. I also wish that at least some of my brother was back. His identity seems completely out of the way. Passion and ardor? this is the key to life. And looking at the camera ?? pay attention to small details and fill the subtle details of life.
