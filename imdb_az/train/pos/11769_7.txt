A few days ago, I bought this movie and thought it would be a similar feature film. But when I dropped into a DVD player, I was very surprised. James Belushi Bill "The Mouth" plays very well as Manuccie. But Timothy Dalton plays a very good role as a sheriff. In Bill's house, the "final" scene is a very nice, good camera work, nice dialogues and very good moves. Bill "The Mouth" stole $ 12 million from Manuccie Mafia. She lives with her husband in a witness protection program in South Carolina. But the Mafia follows it and wants $ 12 million. Bill can only rely on the only person he knows.
