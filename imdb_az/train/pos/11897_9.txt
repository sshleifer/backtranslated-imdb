Now fans of the films really appreciate that it is a little bit terrible. It has good action, many and deserving plot. The weavers will be remembered for films such as Eyes and Pumpkinhead. Obviously, the budget is not all great, but the movie really creates the atmosphere and the performance of the actors who seem to be lacking in most of today's big budget special effects movie. The film really moves together and has a great direction and good camera work. There is no empty scene, so the length of the film is a bit short. In addition, the latter seems to be creating an opening for the next, and it will also be very interesting. So grab some popcorn, turn the lights and enjoy it.
