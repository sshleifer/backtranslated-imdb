When I first heard about this movie I thought it would be like Duchess (2008), but when I first saw the 30 minutes of Young Victoria, this would not be a solid film. <br /> <br /> In this movie, almost everything is great, the dresses are really stunning and the settings are beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only thing I really really missed is the performance. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) brings the life of Victoria, the star of the film, and shows that she is a great actress and maybe her first Oscars nomination for her performance. Rupert's friendly is almost as soft as Prince Albert, but there's great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is strong like Lord Melbourne. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have both supporting roles but also memorable. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is felt as never before. Maybe the scenario has changed much in the script, I know, but what do I think about the movie? <br /> <br /> But in general, a big movie about Victoria's early age is from Emily Blunt.
