I was very surprised by this movie. Paulie touched his way to find his little girl "marriot". Humor was also very good and I did not hurt the story as I thought it was likely. In fact, while waiting for "paulie wants a cracker," even if there were jokes to hurt the film, it was on a very humorous scene, which turned into a very touching when it was at the press conference of the paulie research lab. So if you want to see a good "animal speaking" movie, in my opinion Dr DOLITTLE better check this out. PAULI also has a very shocking twist that is very nice too.
