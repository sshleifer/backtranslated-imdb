First, we should take into consideration the time when this film was prepared in 1995. Remy was a socially uninteresting teenager, could not travel and could not meet and was friends by the Nazis. All of these are not difficult, but as most gangs fill the missing space, whatever the economic, social, emotional. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was a suspicious business ethics and a hot shot star with a chip on his shoulder. <br /> <br /> Kristen tried to find himself and was a young white girl after trying to sit down. <br /> <br /> <strong> Kristen tried to understand himself and his situation, and history was harassed. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < I read too many comments about the bad lists, but I was badly white (Nazis).
