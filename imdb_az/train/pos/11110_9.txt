I can not add a lot of positive comments to the magnificent, balanced writer, versatile characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, and many positive comments in the life of the Millennium. The use of psychiatry combined with Toni's main problems is particularly fresh and humorous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Especially criticisms, "make it clearer of violence / respects one of the Italian Americans Most of the writers and actors are Italian-American, are they attacking? There are many positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco, Dr. Melfi and his family and Cusamanos next to Sopranos. Indeed, Melville's old husband says Mob's relationships with only a small minority of Italian-Americans in the 1st season (in particular, it is less than the number of African-Americans involved in crime): Poverty and Poverty are both the biggest reasons for the case] <br /> Most of the cartoons do not really choose their lives, but their family roots or conditions usually transfer them here, for example, during the second season, Matthew and his friend - outsiders who want to join him (even Italian shareholders) respond to heartwarming results. check Whether you want Frasier to become a psychiatrist or Did you say that Will and Grace want to go to homosexuals? No doubt, you will not listen to rap music that discusses groups, or discuss r'n'b or narcotics discussing anxiety (or any other combination ) discussing rock music? People are not as stupid as some of you are ... <br /> <br /> However, everything is not perfect. Many characters appeared only once, when they look at all the logic or at least pointed out in previous episodes - Daddy Tracee, Meadow's friend Ally, Uncle Junior's lady (probably 20 years until they are divided into season 1).
