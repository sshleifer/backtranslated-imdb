I thought the whole movie played in a beautiful way with fresh pictures and exciting cinematography. Actors were on the back side of the character at about the perfect time and it looked great. The music was watery and well thought out. It even had a decent bending end. So what does everyone vote for? The story is not entirely fresh (it seems like the remains of Running Man with the idea of ​​a television show), but the theme of Christianity and Judaism is really the theme chosen by the people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The word "Allah" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <STRONG> Every horse of the film is the one who has never seen the world, especially Christianity, more acceptable and forgotten most of them thought it was fun and original. Check out that you do not insult the TV viewing of a recent TV show about the possibilities of modern Christ approaching an entertaining movie from the city of Madrid, Spain.
