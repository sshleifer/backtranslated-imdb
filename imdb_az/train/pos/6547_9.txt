I took my 10-year-old daughter to meet with Nancy Drew on the weekend and had a thoroughly enjoyed myself. Firstly, it was clean and I would like to state my standards. Most of the children's films are full of humorous humor and world-wide jokes to shed some cheap laughter from the crowd. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew is so clever and humor is subtle and clever. <br /> <br /> The main role is played by Emma Roberts, a sensitive and polite, irresistible, vigilant, without being annoyed. Unlike The Brady Bunch, which is ridiculous and ridiculous, the Nancy style is treated with respect and dignity. A great moment when Nancy is dismissed by the LA "style conscious" girl boutique owner with her Paris Hilton streetwalker dress, with her penny loafers and home-made Butterick embroidered dresses. This movie attracts more Hollywood movies than this golden girl we need. <br /> <br /> Nancy is totally self-sufficient and her values. <br /> <br /> Mystery is hard enough to attract. My daughter offended my arm, but there were several shocking scenes. All of this is based on tension and mood, and is very fun. Support, especially Marshall Bell, is as good as creepy guard. <br /> <br /> Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis, have many moments to adult smile. <br /> <br /> This film deserves better ratings than some of them have. He was not happy to be dragged into another computer cartoon where he was talking to animals and gasping somewhere else, but I also enjoyed it. If I were there without a child, I still loved the movie. This is a DVD that will be my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
