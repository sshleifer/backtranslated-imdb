Honestly, everyone should see this movie at least once. As I watched, it really puts perspectives. Although this movie is fictional, this is something that your children can do. <br /> <br /> It shows how easily two children can hate their schools and plans to kill innocent students. This movie would not work in another format. <br /> <br /> Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold recall 20 April 1999 after 12 students and then killed themselves. It also reminds of the coming media storm. Everyone wanted to see Rampart and everyone wanted to see the basement strips. <br /> <br /> This is a proud version of our dreams. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this film is that it has not done a good job on the market, and even a few know that it exists. <br /> <br /> In some of the films, Zero Day, Zero Day, and Best Movie are best suited for the movie. little ones who really try. <br /> <br /> <strong > this movie, hire and watch. After I finish, I will not be silent.
