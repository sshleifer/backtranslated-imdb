First of all, it's one of my favorite movies of all time, rather than buying DVDs since I shoot this movie in VHS. I read a book, but I think the movie is better. Dear Knightley, I like Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam as an excellent choice. <br /> <br /> This is a 10/10 movie! <br /> <br />
