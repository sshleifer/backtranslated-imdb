This is, in fact, an awesome little flick that does not resemble any budgets that have not been filmed. It needs some time to warm up. The player is very bad, and soon he gets the charm of zen. After a few scenes, do not differentiate unusual lines or rehearsed voices of some disadvantages. All the heroes, especially Richard, create an interesting attraction. Do not forget about Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I want to play a crazy psychopath. He likes it very much! There are some truly visual effects shots that are mixed with ghostly dark gore and zombie insult scenes, the "Midnight Skater" zoom through the black hoodie campus, looking like the entire world as a cross between Grim Reaper and Silver Surfer. These shots, almost the terrible things about the characters skater seem almost unlucky. The soundtrack has many fun Garage-Punk tunes, and the film's mood is good, progressive dignity is good. Do not go, I say.
