After watching at least a few films in Bravo's 100 films, I've been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. Field simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) goes through an apartment building with an entrance to hell. Sentinel is a low-right, scary movie, even though it's a bit slow. This is a mix of Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The actor is good and there are many really bothering as the angry orgy scene with the dead father and the orgy is in the middle of the cake sowing and laughing. Ending is a strange mixture of people who are deformed and a fireworks. Very striking, but in the end, I really believe in a great movie! One of my 70's favorites, even if nothing special. It's awkward and extremely creepy! Probably one of my all time. 9/10
