This movie starts out nicely, there are some slow moments in the middle, but generally good moves, there are very good moments, and then abstained at the end of the 3rd law. It was possible to see it twice in LA prinsers (with 2 different endings). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not a man tomorrow. He is conscious and self-conscious, but he plays a good helper. Julia Stiles is not "okay" in her role as a new comedy, but does not steal this movie as a "star of a caliber". It's hard to keep track of an actress with so much potential (10 Things, Save The Last Dance, O), and continue to play the role of 'average' and then do not take on her role and film (in Daniel Gail-Day-Lewis). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and one 'okay' job. I did not expect my academy to be rewarded, and she did not, but her performance was enough. Chris Koch presents a film "on top of the average". Probably the problem is more than anything else in the script. I did this movie! But this is not a movie that's coming to you ... "It was great!" ... This 'story' has been seen before, and there was nothing new here. The rehearsal dance scene was the best in the film, and Larry Miller gave an incredible performance in a supporting role (the best surprise of the movie). If you want to see a movie that will laugh a few times and enjoy a good evening, I can still recommend this movie, but still do not change ... again on the church scene, or you will definitely be disappointed.
