Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. He fled simultaneously with other programs like "Teacher" in school life. For over 35 years, the Bromwell Highun line in the teaching profession is more realistic than the "Teachers". Purposeful spouses, pupils who are shameless, recall the deepest pupils, the schools I know and their students, where the whole situation can come from benevolence. When I see an episode that a student repeatedly tries to burn the school, I immediately remember ......... .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to unload one of my teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I think that many of my senior adults are Bromwell's. Unfortunately, this is not it!
