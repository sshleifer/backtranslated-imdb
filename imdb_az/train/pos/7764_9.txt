Wealth, an airplane, you call it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always been troubled. Mitch finished college, Kyle was shot. Mitch is not a rich home. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, controls everything in the city. <br /> <br /> Kyle at NY, gets acquainted with Lauren Bacall's beautiful dreams. After a hurricane romance, she gets married and brings her home. He responds to his father-in-law, who tells Kyle how difficult he is. Kyle lies with a gun under his pillow. <br /> <br /> Kall's sister, Mary Lee, was voted by Dorothy Malone, the best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays the faithful friend Mitch. <br /> <br /> For Kyle and her bride, it's been a year of unhappiness that Kyle says he can not have children. <br /> <br /> When her husband told her that she was pregnant, Kyle thought the child was Mitch, was drunk and was accidentally killed on a memorable scene. Mary Lee Mitch always likes, works, but fails to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. On a scene in a memorable courtroom, Malone finally pulled out all stops in the process of accepting that Kyle's death was a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <br /> <br /> Douglas Circus was a master of the soap opera films of the 1950s, and it is no exception to the wind. *** 1/2.
