What happens when there is a great deal of social discomfort that some people stop acting? How can one man alone? What happens when we have a lot of hell that we have to do to become a part of society? Frownland investigates these questions. An astounding original debut from the Bronze. The tone is bizarre and claustrophobic because we are in the mind of a boy named Keith, who can hardly have a sad punishment. She tries to get in touch with people and works day by day. Most of us know such people - people who say "very sorry" or "I appreciate it" when nothing is available to evaluate. We know there are people there, but why does someone want to shoot a movie about themselves? Yes, because interesting and Bronstein and leading actor Dore Mann will do an excellent job. This film is non-commercial as it can not get as a movie. Several friends pulled it out for a few years as he earned a living. Beautiful budget shot in 16 mm and scratched movie view. Finding with a distributor can be challenging. I think that last year and so on. Hopefully it will be on DVD at a time. I saw him at the Silent Cinema in Los Angeles. Among the audience was Crispin Glover, and there were 10 people who said something strange about this movie. Be advised.
