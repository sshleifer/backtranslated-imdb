I watched this movie once and again, but I think that although Jamie Foxx is good at the film, I think Alvin Sanders can use a "less funny" character. Foxx scenes are funny in prison when faced with Edgar Clenteen (David Morse). David Morse is again a beautiful portrait of the police. Its tough, but more silent features are perfect for its role. Morse was introduced to Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) at a time. Morse expires on Hutchinson. Each movie is perfect for this scenario. I personally love this movie in a movie where actors are in the same state as the previous movie, both of which were at The Green Mile. In general, it was a pretty good movie.
