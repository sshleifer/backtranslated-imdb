I first saw the British television in the early '90s, but then I liked it, but I missed a lot of years, but the film was always compressed with me, and I lost hope that I would look at the TV again, the main thing was the last one with me, the hole was really touched by me it's easy to follow, it's a great story, great music goes from the list, OK tells me good, if you see the best bits after looking at it, yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch, but in a very small part it shows its age but now it's part of beauty has become, and I am very glad that it's one of the best 10 films of all time on the DVD. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG>
