This is a rare ship, if any shows are worth 10 in the last ten years. This allows us to escape from a time that is simpler and more entertaining. This show, full of heart and laughter, laughs for three decades. The furniture was woody, the clothes were colored, and even the drugs were tolerant. Hair was festive, music was accompanied by roller skates and, according to Merle Haggard, "being a partner was a bad place." Take a trip to the largest time in American history. Being in love with the characters and feeling the good of the small town, which is beautiful to each other. This is a classic "Full House" television. Do not miss it, always "Strike your treachery!"
