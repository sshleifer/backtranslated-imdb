In all my versions of Odyssey (or the Greek mythological story), this is the best I think. The real scene line is almost correct - some minor deviations and inaccuracies, e.g. The absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that the Eumaeus Odysseus secretly recognizes the cottage in the shackle and the original decor and suits help create a truly memorable work, not like the Hollywood sword and sandals B-Flick. Though the dialogue and subtitles are completely Italian, they may be familiar with the story, but the happenings and what the actors have said can be tailored (in the hands of Odyssey). At least I was encouraged to study Italy to better appreciate the film.
