Lars Von Trier never stops trying out new techniques. <br /> <br /> He describes Germany as a nightmare journey later on. Many cities outside the castle, Leo Kessler, have to help restore a young German-born American. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds him as a night conductor on the Zentropa Railway. His job is to meet the needs of passengers. When a shoe is polished, a chalk mark is on the dishes. A terrible controversy occurs when the passenger shoes are polished but not dry. There are many applauses for German scholars to follow such stupid details. <br /> <br /> Railway travel is like allegory representing the course of man's life through all the trials and difficulties. As a consequence, Leo passes through the rear carriages to find what's missing from the half-slippery objects that Auschwitz has escaped. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Given some supporters, the bomb falls under a carrier. He returns to his cabin and connects with one hour. Then he jumps from the highway (high speed) and lies on a cool grass on the riverbank. Looking at the stars above, he decides to destroy and destroy his work. As the train to a giant bridge sees, it runs at an angry pace to sit on the train and stop the clock. If you analyze the situation, it is a completely impossible task. In fact, it's funny. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Despite the widespread use of the film, Lars I prefer Von Trier's next films (Breaking the Waves and Ideologies). The bomb scene described above really left me. Perhaps I'm real.
