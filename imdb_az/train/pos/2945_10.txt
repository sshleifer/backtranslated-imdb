In the 1990s, I watched this movie a few times and each time I laughed at the sides. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but it's another thing to stand up. She is very funny. Even P.C. The brigade would find it fun. You have to wait and it's better if there are girls or girls for a kid. Michael Jackson's appearance looks like him, if you shut his eyes, you believe he's reading it. What he describes is true for life, and if you think it's not funny, you have to have a serious humor bypass. My local video stores do not make this video more accurate, but I'd like to point out that in my hand, I'm old enough to show my husband and guy in a single copy. Anyway, the high offer, hope to enjoy it.
