This is a fine music from my favorite composers (Gershwin) and an endless account of a wonderful Parisien atmosphere with a lot of charm, but in terms of a story is not good. Or at least not very well worked out. Acting is not so right by Caron. But I enjoyed some dialogues, I liked the scene in Seine, I liked the color and colors of the Levant; of course, is a very beautiful dance. <br /> <br /> 7.5 - 8 points to me.
