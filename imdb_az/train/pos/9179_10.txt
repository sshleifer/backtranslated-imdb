This is the right and most accurate version of Bronte's work (so far). Dalton is a little hard to imagine as Rochester, who proclaimed Jane Eyre's "amazing". However, Zelah Clark, who operates and is so wealthy, is dominated by and fully convincing Jane Eyre. This production is a long time, but it is worth it. Almost directly drawn from the book are scripts and you want to see it as the most "romantic" in the literature. I have every copy of this movie and read it again and read it again. The shooting of the film may seem somewhat strange now, but nothing like this happens.
