Hitchcock was of the view that the viewers were not really interested in threatening the heroes - only in danger and should escape. <br /> <br /> This film proves that Hitchcock is 100% accurate. The police believe that Jan Simmons is guilty of an offense that he does not clearly disclose. Trevor Howard decides to work for the best of action. <br /> <br /> All the exciting things - the body of the movie, jumping across rocks in the waterfall and dropping trains, buses and coaches, but I could not think that it was all unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
