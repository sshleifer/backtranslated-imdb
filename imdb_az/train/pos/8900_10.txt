It's an incredible classic monster with over 50! I just love the appearance of just 50 cars and music. In any case, I love the appearance of the blob. Everyone comes into the theater at night when it comes to horror and gets into the explosion and crashes the party. Another thing I love is that it occurs overnight, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> Steve and Jane see a meteorite drop down when they prepare. Blob inside the meteor. When Blob consumes a human being, growth is bigger and bigger. The city's population is trying to convince the people of darkness, but no one believes them later. Can anything blobby this vitality stop it? I'm offering BLOB!
