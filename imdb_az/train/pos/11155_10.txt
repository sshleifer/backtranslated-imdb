Young, beautiful, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texasa to Texas, thinking he will live as a stud. He finds out that there is something that can not be easy - he's going through an insult training one after the other. At the end of his rope, he mixes with Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). They try to live together and get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, exciting, but exciting movie. Director John Schelsinger painted a terrifying portrait of NYC and its residents. In this way the history - the city could have been bad in 1969, but it has been so far cleared up. The book also uses every camera trick - colored black and white; trippy sleep sequence; flash forward; flash sets (especially vulnerable to exploitation); Shock cuts; Strange sound effects ... you call it. <br /> <br /> There are not many stories - mostly based on friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an idea that they might have a lover. <br /> <br /> This was the first time in 1969 for X - MPAA's parents were portraits of two damaged characters with only one reason for not thinking. I would like their children to see it. Nevertheless, this was a big hit with high school students (X was none of the 17's). He was the only X movie that was awarded the Oscars as the best picture ever. Hoffman and Voight are up for action rewards (mysteriously) as Sylvia Miles (perhaps) in the form of 5 minutes! When it was carried out in 1980, it eventually dropped to R. <br /> <br /> Also in this film was presented the song "Everyone Talkin" and a great hit. br> <br /> A great movie --- very dark. I can give it one. 10. Do not see on commercial TV - it is cut with ribbons and it is incomprehensible.
