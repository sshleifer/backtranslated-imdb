Return to 36 rooms, Shaw is one of the classic Kung-fu films drawn in the 70s and 80s and the genre is equal to the Spaghetti West of Hollywood and the protagonist of western Cord Eastwood Gordon Liu. <br /> <br /> This movie is a simple and good story. It is said in the film that a digital remastered and a new edition for the Fantastic Film Festival is presented in the framework of "Shev" <br /> <br /> Three movements that give more or more details about the martial arts films at that time. <br /> Employees working in a small village have cut their salaries by more than 20% of their mane gangsters. They can not do much about exploitation because none of them is a talented battlefield to deal with pirates and their managers. Initially, they signed a small success for Liu's highly skilled Shaolian monk (one of the best comedy series), but often steamed their steering wheel to a degree of reliability. The Alliance shows the hero who wants to return to two camps. But the true battlefield is artistic, it begins to travel to the Temple of Saul, breaking down and learning martial arts. After some slapping moments, she is finally accepted by the abbot (whom she has shown!), But she is disappointed in teaching methods - like the style of Matei Miyagi, in the cinema, Karate Kid builds a building around the temple rather than pulling meadows. Nothing can keep a good person down, and he unwittingly creates power, intolerance, and learns kung-fu in an extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> The Triumphal Battle Festival begins. With the most effective sound effects, the maximum effect is given to contactless contacts in the movie. However, watching the battle scenes here is very simple, sparring is used to highlight stunts in different angles, with broad angle shooting and slow motion to highlight clarity and detail among their partners. The speed of the battles that are very slow can range slowly with a break, but when Yuen Wo Ping and his style use ad-nausem in Hollywood flies, they do not give up fighting scenes as they are! Return to 36 rooms and re-appear on Monday, so if you want a game for a nostalgic trip down the memory lane, what are you waiting for?
