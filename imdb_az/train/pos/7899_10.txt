It was a beautiful movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There were many beautiful images and something unrelated to a great deal of compassion. I was thoroughly enjoyed and I was happy when I finished the story of Tom Robbins. Now, I did not read Robbin's special book, so it did not match, but I do not think it could have been a bad comment. The film left a lot to identify yourself. This is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel. <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie of all of those who said these words, I'm sorry how little your heart is in the dark. Worst of all, this movie was very glorious. Long life cranes.
