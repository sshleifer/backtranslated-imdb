A good adaptation of the novel by Amrita pritam. Urmila and Manoj did their best. <br /> <br /> The film has some natural disadvantages and I felt it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because this is a religion that relies on a human life, will not endure. <br /> <br /> The best part was that he did not make a drama with numerous tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
