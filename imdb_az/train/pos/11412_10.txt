Even though there was a lengthening of the imagination, two young girls played a beautiful and clever way, like Frankie, like Mischa Barton and Ingrid Uribe. <br /> <br /> Young Hazel, who fled to Bahrain, appears to be out of place to be honest. <br /> <br /> Despite the good work of the player, there is no real drama in the film. Perhaps, how was my valley green compared with Pollyanna? <br /> <br /> Let's also note that Joan Plowyt makes his role somewhat low. The middle part of the road viewer is a good fit for younger audiences, and it is rarely beautiful to be inclined to the rare classic music! <br /> <br /> I think it's a bad change that reflects this movie more than anything else, for the years to come, thoughtful values ​​and no violence, thank goodness. Take a hot family movie.
