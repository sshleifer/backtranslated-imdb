I watched the "Last Wave" in the beautiful art library of the school. It's all about Peter Weir's stuff, but it's not always like being careful about me. The thoughts that made me happy (because they are very well managed by the film director Weir), at the same time, I did not give them enough stimulus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> It starts with a strong air sequence and has a great mood effect (especially strange, "noisy" sound design) and its strongest direction; but it did not just entertain me, just like Weir's next movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because, <br /> <br /> God bless the prophet Weir. For him it is only necessary to watch this movie ... a very organic director. Malick as Aussie's reaction! I would give him 7, because there are enough ideas to overcome his boring moments.
