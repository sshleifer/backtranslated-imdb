There is much to say about this movie. Your typical nunsploitation is not. Of course, there are nudity and sexes, but this story is almost no coincidence. <br /> <br /> In the 15th century, Otranto was appointed at the time of 800 Christians being martyred. A battle between Muslims and Christians is a good part of the film. When anyone fled from the Muslim meeting, he would ask the mother, "Why are you afraid of the Muslims and they will not do anything to the Christians?" Of course, there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Brother Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a monastery to challenge his father. He is witnessing in the process and endures many things: a stallion, a raid by a new Duke, raping a child who was able to overcome Tarantula Sect's visit and fled with a Jew when he hit himself. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Garabagh" . Finally, he joined the Muslim leader as his lover and they threw the monastery out. It is possible to see more meat here. But tragedy is to come. He succeeds in giving a complete revenge to anyone who is involved with the Duke and his father, but his Muslim lover is exactly the same. <br /> <br /> I do not describe what the saints of the church do, but what I say before the occupation of Saw or Pansion. <br /> <br /> Nunsploitation fans will be pleased with the attitudes, but movie lovers will find plenty of food for digestion.
