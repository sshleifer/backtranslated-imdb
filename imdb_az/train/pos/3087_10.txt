Six degree amazing show! I was really upset because I watched the entire season online and would not have only 2 seasons: '(and ABC has now off-line, so it can not be viewed online) ABC has created such a beautiful show that, with a great storyline and was created with a great symbol to pull the air out without completing fairy tales. Obviously, ABC can place at least the show on the internet for the audience attending the internet.
