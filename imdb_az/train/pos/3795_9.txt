When I see this movie in the SF Independent Film Festival, I wait to hear how a copy has been taken. Jim McKay talked about the film's (Q & A) forward-looking situation: how to broadcast a movie that describes minorities (women, non-white) working in solving conflicts (teenage pregnancy, teenage motherhood, race identity, single mother) and all this It is thirty-thirty men to write a loyal article on topics. Many racist, multi-sex spectators, fantastic stories of the film, detailed heroes and fantastic illustrations of the "real young life" have told many adults. The majority of teenagers left the building - this is the best movie made by adults by children, as a starting point for meditation, as many adults say "About them." So how do we look at sharing questions? The Internet (retail) would be a great way - it's a movie that will be buried like "Pups" or other radical modern teenage films, and McKay seemed sensitive. As for his / her credits as a writer / director, McKay has worked in his work accurately and accurately - joining the Crown Heights neighborhood where the film is shot, working with actors, and trying to symbolize his own thoughts in his thoughts. results - results are disarmed.
