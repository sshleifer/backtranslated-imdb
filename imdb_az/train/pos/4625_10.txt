Bars The Shakespeare was the most surprising and enjoyable movie I've ever seen. It's a proper reminder that the prison program rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare game every year over the past 14 years, California, somewhere. The film follows the performance of the "Railway", and learns very good things about these men who are the most serious in this process. The truth is very strange compared with fantasy - when everyone tries to fit this story into a fantasy movie, the audience will never buy it, but knowing it is breath-taking to watch - from the word; Especially when I learned about the murder of the talented felon. It's a little funny as Ozun has some loppy episode, because characters and strange stories are real.
