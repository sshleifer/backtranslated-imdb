A strange Persian in the world of glamorous soap operas! This movie is fun! There is no doubt that there is a taste for shouting, hysterical dialogue, overlapping movies, and melodramatic playgrounds. <br /> <br /> Sally Field, Celeste Talbert of the Daytime TV's "Hero Hero" plays. Celeste's cushy life is thrown into desperation with the unexpected arrival of his long-lived brother Lori Craven (Elisabeth Shue), but also Celeste's long-time lover, Jeffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline, always beautiful). But Celeste hides a deep dark mystery, and the arrival of Lori and Jeffrey can only bring it to the surface. Add diabolical Montana Moorehead (perfect woman with full testosterone for the full directing), who tried very strongly to destroy Celeste's career; David (Robert Downey, Jr.), a soap maker who is planning a secret with Montana to destroy Celeste; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Nuts'?), But when it is well done it can be quite damn funny! A basic ingredient that is indispensable for any good comedy is often casting to experienced professionals who know that it's often seen as funnyest things, not an expression or appearance. Fields, Kline, Goldberg, and others all work well and have a good time making it harder for them to get energy and enthusiasm. Shue is a vulnerable link, but he is careful not only because he is surrounded by Field, Kline and others. Moriarty, you think of the hottest curse you've ever seen, a stand-out in the role of cunning villainess! There are also very familiar faces you know small (but all very funny) roles, including Carrie Fisher, Garry Marshall, Kathy Najimi and Teri Hatcher. Director Michael Hoffman continues to accelerate the speed and the histrionic plan moves to the great finish. Robert Harling's scenario should also be prepared carefully for a soap opera inside a soap opera. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> and put your hands on this situation by having a great time. If nothing else, it makes a good mood and makes you laugh!
