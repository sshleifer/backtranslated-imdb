It was really a great movie. I liked Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very unpleasant actor watching. When they got something together, the team chemistry was spectacular, just going to show what could happen when you came together for one purpose. This team had a lot of time losing everything to win everything. <br /> <br /> Besides, Dennis Qaid's character has a great place in the world. You can not do anything, but it's the root of this man. It seems even when someone needs to do something, we'll do it. <br /> <br /> According to a true story, you really think that this movie is "nothing is impossible."
