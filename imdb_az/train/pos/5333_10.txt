I do not know how this is a cult film. <br /> <br /> The "Fugitive Car" tries to test itself as a progressive tension, but by taking the quality of the activity (good God is bad), the story really is able to do with the devil in the car and the practicality of the baby evacuation site It's not something you want to know, but to laugh. And you will laugh. Films are made to entertain us and may be an indicator of the value of a movie that they do. This movie is the most important thing in entertainment, and laughed from beginning to end. At one point, I breathed and nearly drowned, and at some point it's funny. I was hysterically laughing when a robot pilot succeeded in maintaining the same speed as the car, and a helicopter with a helicopter had been sunbathing with an airplane and flat flat flat plain. <br /> <br /> When the baby began to slip in the air, he approached a bridge and walked almost in a tree, and my tears ran away from my grapevine. <br /> The man who plays the video on Madonna's "Like a Prayer" video tells the black police. He would come everywhere.
