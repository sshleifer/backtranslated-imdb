This was probably one of the best in the Zatoichi series. Many are as good as it is, but the plot and symbols appear to be too complicated for the line at this point. The situation is unusually interesting: farmers in the province have a philosopher-samurai who starts with two champions, a good cartridge (once) and some sort of Grange; but also increasing their gambling income and afraid of the usual local gangsters wanting to succeed in increasing their chances of closing some territories; their head or powerful ally is drinking and gambling, but in secret they bring their distorted appetites. (He then dwells increasingly in Zatoichi's tricks in Dracula.) These symbols have enough meaning that they deserve to be put on Zatoic as he did, but now he has lost a lot of nuances, and a good boss and an angry sister of a man Changes in some characters, such as Zatoichi, require more time as if the story appears as though many scene shortcomings. In addition, the film shows the virtues of the majority of others in the series: the well-functioning, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a lively, convincing and unique landscape (in a random episode, the director misses only) and the nature of its nature does not cover itself: the imaginative use of limited sets, restrictions were not available. And, of course, there is the main actor who has done all the job, up to his performance. It should be one of the best continuous series in film history.
