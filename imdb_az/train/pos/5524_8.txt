While slaughtering everything from the coup in Cuba to Bolivia, the second part of Soderbergh's Che Guevara is a tragic hero. As with Che? Birinci hissə, Boliviyanın rəngli dağları ilə bu partlayışa əsaslanan partizan müharibəsi qaçışları, ehtimal ki, kifayət qədər insanları məyus etmək üçün hazırlanmışdır, buna görə film (və xüsusilə də Benicio Del Toronun çıxışları) Kanndə yüksək təriflədir? <br /> For example, James Roky called it "a revolution, not just a revolution", but a work of art. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw called him a "defective work". Is my first argument going back to my first argument? the price is described in particular as a hero. And when it was the surface of the poor hero role models, it was not fair to see a proud glory, even if some of the few favorite episodes of his life cooled down? It is a psychological hero written by the great scotis writer Thomas Carlyle, in his seminal book, Heroes and Hero worship. Heroes can be real or imaginary (or somewhere). But we are focused on higher targets and high goals. Compare this with the unusual "heroes" of the standard Western story: where a person is subjected to trials and difficulties before getting an incredible reward? usually the eternal love and material wealth? Like the divine studio intervention. Is real heroism so morally courageous? Lost Ark's courage-deity or James Bond is not super toys. They are rising and allowing others to rise, the best they can. In the first part, O gains success. Second, he is unsuccessful. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> Guevara conditions that provide intellectual clarity bərabərləsdirərkən armed struggle is wrong with him because he does not want the moral courage, but a) all the best plans can not succeed, and b) a person, mistakes are inevitable . Conditions that can succeed in this armed struggle. <br /> <br /> High in La Paz mountains, breathtaking colors. Sometimes in the Che - First section (the U.S. will not allow the Soderbergh movie in Cuba) there is the mise-en-scene reality. Increased natural lighting and groundbreaking and realism and groundbreaking vision enhancements are increasing. RED cameras. It is a high-performance digital sine camera with 35mm film quality and pure digital comfort. The package for comfort and functionality weighs only 9 lbs. "Shooting with RED is like playing Beatles for the first time," says Soderbergh. "The RED sees the way I've seen ... so beautifully touched the nature of organic, very beautiful phenomena." Che would have tied him with a mystic invincibility if he was to succeed in a successful Cuban revolution. The failure in Bolivia shows that there are only human constraints, but not political triumphs, but spiritual moral values ​​mentioned. Critics Will Say? and for some reason - his armed struggle led to less dignified character for tin-pot dictatorships. The development of his guerrilla war tactics is not good or bad in themselves (and has been used since then). <br /> <br /> However, there is no dramatic and narrative tension for the whole film definition. We will not stumble any more than one run, and we will eventually face his death. I looked at my look and thought it would be shorter. But did it work? He talks to people from all sides and even gets one of his former comrades coach Guevara about Minutiae in Bolivia's operations? the film is a priceless success. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> is one of the largest cities in the Caucasus "Che" heroism "This is a failure. Others have failed, despite the efforts will not be wasted, because it can give others hope and moral courage can. of course, it "killed" can be described as complex and, of course, there are many religious people. But Che does not sacrifice himself. He did not make the best effort, you can give a good example. <br /> <br /> United States, Cuba's long-term and illegal blockade (all the "freedom" in the name) to me, "Che Parts 1" & 2 in the United States failed to get out is very good. But the film to be withdrawn seriously, an effort that is to do. I hope that you should , many viewers will be able to see the inaccuracies of Chei's politically uncertain mistake, whatever their mistakes, Soderbergh's Ocea ns 11-nin populist saçmalamasından reabilitasiya edir. <br /> <br /> Lakin əgər Che Guevara və ya Part One görmədiyinizi yoxsa 'ölümcül' ifadəsini Marksist 'ağızdan köpük etmədən, mən bu filmdən nə alacaqlarını təsəvvür etmək üçün mübarizə edə bilərəm. There are also the same people and may be.
