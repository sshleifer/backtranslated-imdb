<br /> <br /> "Days" is a typical family drama with a small attitude - the show must be related to any character feelings that can be truly appreciated. <br /> <br /> [Not available for those who are not familiar with the Spoiler Show. <br /> <br /> The show, for all those who are watching the show, is the story of Cooper's Day, the middle-aged family. She writes her days with her family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day for her observations. His parents include a mother, a father, an excellent brother, and a younger brother. The first episode since John Scott Shepard's been a little stupid has created this situation - his sister and his mother are pregnant. This is the first case the author has shot. Then the father stopped working from a law firm. His youngest son is a panic attack. The middle child is fighting with his brother's wife. <br /> <br /> I am amazed at this show. I dont know. It's a little surprising but I like it. First, I thought the camera was a ripoff, but then they used it and started loving it. I liked the quiet conversations under the dark lights. I like the feeling of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked the actor. Stunned by the story. Then I do not want the second day of the second day. The 6th episode released on ABC slowly became an admirer of this. This is really a good show and something like OC. Both have nothing in common with. So hopefully fans will stop comparing them <br /> <br /> And if you can connect with Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, this will be like the show. Many.
