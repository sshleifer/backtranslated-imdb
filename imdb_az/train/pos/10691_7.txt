Yesterday evening I took bread bark. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia three times (I took our two children). I can not put my finger up because I like this movie except for seeing the "bad" turns "good" and "good" sort of "half-bad". I liked the appearance of Chaplin in all the movies. Whether it's good or bad, the same look (and works) like "I can do that". Great ending. 7/10. Give me or take my food as I am.
