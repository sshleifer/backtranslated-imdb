This movie is fond of humorous, charming and easy-to-enjoy fun. Hollywood is a challenging place for serious historical lessons, so I just accept it. Bing, in his usual unbelievable manner, is like a blast, like the blacksmith Hank Martin, in another epoch, when King Arthur's time reached the good. Rhonda Fleming is a breath of Hank's effects, like Alisonand or Sandy, while Henry Wilcoxon is brave and strange Sir Lancelot. <br /> <br /> King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wend. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) decorated with a towel suit and, first of all, set out with a bag to live in the kingdom. King Arthur's "I'm saying we are not alone" is one of those moments of the movie, when he gives a good shake of his cool clothes. The description of William Bendix is ​​rather ridiculous, not to mention the strange attempt of "old English". <br /> <br /> The story is not deep, but in my opinion it is good and I love it more than I can see. <br/> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;
