Enter into a remote forest area to hunt for four ma√ßo rough boys and three sexual gals a month. The spectacular ram team is a stunning aoul who does not care for anybody who melts suddenly from Vietnam's veteran Jesse (effectively creepy description by Alberto Mejia Baron). Director / writer Pedro Galindo III connects the capture story with a steady pace, creates a good job of nervous tension and blasts a pitiful killing piece (bursting a sore throat and exposing it to a degree of a shotgun as a certain terrifying splatter emphasized). The talent provides a particularly striking job like Pedro Fernandez's beautiful, humane Nacho, feisty Alejandra like Edith Gonzalez, cheerful Charly like Charly Valentino, and Mauricio, such as Tono Mauri. Even better, the beautiful blonde Marisol Santacruz and the beautiful Katie Adriana Vega provide some delicious eye candy wearing missing suit suits. Antonio de Anda's slippery, agile cinematography, breathtaking Sylvan decoration, Pedro Plascencia's robust, frightening, blending computing, well-developed characters and pleasing 76-minute working-time horror / motion hybrid victory.
