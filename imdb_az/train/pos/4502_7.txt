I've seen all of Cynthia Rothrock movies, and this is the simplest thing for me. It recalls early Jackie Chan films. Undoubtedly, MR Rothrock may not be the biggest actress, but it is good to watch as a martial artist and a very cute young lady. This film was probably the most fun, though not all of the movies.
