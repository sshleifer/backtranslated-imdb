I just saw this movie on television once and did not repeat it. This is strange when you consider repeatedly a trash. Generally, fears for me are a source of fun, but it really scares me. <br /> <br /> READ THE NEXT LIKE THE FILM WANT TO GIVE BEST! The city's inhabitants were wildly looking at the place where their husband was dead (they were poisoned). Anyone who is hell will ask you. They give each other real identities. A girl who acts as a deaf to break her husband and say, "I am Lilith, who loves Adam before Eve."
