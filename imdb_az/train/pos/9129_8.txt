When it first appeared in 1984, it was one of the hottest events around the prince. Everyone wanted to see this movie not as much as a wider music video. The player was pretty bad, but what can be expected from the musicians on the big screen for the first time? Nevertheless, it was still a fun movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide a classic comedy for all time, especially when it comes to Abbott & Costello, who is thinking of doing the "first" baseball routine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is very attractive. And of course, the album's soundtrack is one of the best Prince ever recorded. The Prince then had a disaster with Warner Bros and changed his name, but at this time he was at the beginning of his career. <br /> <br /> This film is a great category of time, but quite entertaining.
