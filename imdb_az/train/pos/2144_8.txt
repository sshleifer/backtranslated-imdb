A sweet and completely charming movie, will you be dancing? He made me laugh and cried. For the first time, Sugiyama was not quite attractive - it was a speed driven on a single family, easily attracted by a single window. His cautious goal is far and cold. But at the end of the film I liked him, his wife, daughter, all dance teachers and dance students. Conversion and renewal is a bit unusual I like to see a bit of a tough story.
