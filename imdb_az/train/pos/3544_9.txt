Kids and dolls should be one of my favorite music movies. A very entertaining movie for watching and more. people describe what they forgot about musical music - music, not entertainment, but fun. Right now we are in Chicago, which rents and has great music and good movies, but we are unlucky to bring a healthy fun with no strings. The only thing that troubled me in the film was Marlon Brando, the boy could not read! It was very boring to read and talk when it was unable to understand her. If it were not for Marlon, I'd give this 10 stars. Kids and puppets provide rarely old toys that we have recently acquired. See for a good time!
