I liked this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely beautiful in this area. Plays the role of the modern wizard's advancement. (And it's absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie has devoted me to a role-playing role-playing game, Mage: The Awakening. <br /> <br /> D & D love and Jeff are similar to each other, not a masterpiece, but good work, and absolutely delightful. The site moves fast and adds its simplicity, the special effects are so good for such a low budget, and the script is, in spite of everything, not bad at all and is cheat in all the right places. A good way to spend one evening.
