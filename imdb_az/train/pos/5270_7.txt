This movie can be really bad, but it's a lot of fun. The worst-looking and poor-minded direction increases the hystericality of the film. The Twins are very funny in the Conanesque roles. If you go to this movie waiting for the First Conan or Excalibur, you will hate it. When you look good and mildly, you will have a good time. Brothers, see where they're trying to hang the most funny scene in the movie. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 to work!
