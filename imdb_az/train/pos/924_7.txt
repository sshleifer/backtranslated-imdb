The pride of his dignity is a pleasant surprise: It has funny, witty, and some great voices. The show is about a family of Lion who acts as a Siegfried & Roy show. Of course, all are stereotypes, but they are so funny. FOTP is a kiddie-cartoon but includes some raw adult humor, but in a very gentle way. Popculture is full of references and celebrity brides, and many of them are well executed. I'll give 7 out of it on the show because it's very nice, but not very original, I've seen many of these stereotypes, even in this way!
