I liked this movie. When I was 20 I first saw it (just four years ago) and I loved it the following day. The comedy played well all the participants. I always have to take back and recall the scene, where Mr. Tsanders explained why he had 6 meters in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for the father of Jason Robards playing Mr. Retch. The talent fled to that family.
