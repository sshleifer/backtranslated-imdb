It's an average Jackie Chan flicker for a fantastic final and a great miracle, but nothing else. All the characters are pretty cool and the whole movie is fun, and Jackie Chan is beautiful! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan were fantastic chemistry together and also very funny! And I thought my main opponent looked really scary! But the dubbing was simply afraid! Character development is above average for such a thing! And the main fight is simply fantastic! However, some of Jackie's this is tough! There are many humorous and indifferent humor in this, but I have fun and the end is not funny! Plus, all the characters are very enjoyable. This is pretty cheap, but generally very well prepared and Jackie Chan would expect from a flick that enough to watch if there is no amount of fighting, plus one of my favorite moments, Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger) plays with a rifle and turns it off! It's a high average Jackie Chan flick and great humor, due to this fantastic final, but then another great thing is still worth watching! Direction is good. Jackie Chan is doing a good job here with a robust camera work, fantastic angles, and fast storage for most of the movie. Acting is very good! Jackie Chan is as beautiful as ever, and here is incredible, he was fantastic chemistry with some crazy stunts, Wai-Man Chan, extremely enjoyable, cheerful, threw this ass and played this beautifully rude character, he was beautiful !! , I just want him to dubble! (Jackie rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, and I love him very much, he's a very good warrior. I say the rest of the cast. Overall good watch! 5 out of 5
