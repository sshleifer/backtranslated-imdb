I would like to invite you to an older audience like a true picture of young love for the college. There are sleeping and descent, twists and turns, and made me a tear or two cast. <br /> <br /> This film can appeal to an elderly, unusual black audience in a college campus and two people in the city, to meet and fall in love. In the background, various friends get acquainted and make them feel better or worse. Some may say the typical area, but it was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I was rooted in my own history to keep my relationship with couples alive. Deep meditation and inspiration came from performances by actors. <br /> <br /> This is a bright film that confirms that young people are in the heart and in love or in love. Great movie. Looking for a copy to add to the movie collection.
