<br /> <br /> Last year, a film has been released to win its attention. "Former" Audrey Tatou is worthy of "Amelie", the French title is better: "Le Battement d'ailes du papillon" is a summary of chaos theory as a control element in our lives. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tatou's gamine-ness is less disturbing here, because he only sometimes burns the smiling smile across his dream adventures, and since he is part of a large, multinational ensemble, he has spared me for a long time, especially some cute guys and older women some of them looked like me, and I fancy that some do not believe that they should do it. <br /> <br /> But I liked the city's coincidences and love for immigrants, full of suburban cars that would allow them to hang around the caf√©. <br /> <br /> The subtitles were quite uncomfortable, as was the case (first, 12/8/2001)
