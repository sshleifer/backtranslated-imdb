First, do not expect Revolver to Snatch or Lock Stock, this is a different gangster film. <br /> <br /> I saw the Gala night and this movie tore the audience. How is this half divided by the audience? It was terrible, would the other half leave thinking? It was cool. Personally I love films that I do not understand, namely the Mullholland Driver and the Ordinary Suspects, and I'm pleased with Revolver. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not perfect, though. After a mile away, I saw a huge twist at least part, and although some empty ends are not disclosed, Revolver creates many unexplained questions. Although scenes, animations and Sorter's killing of the sort (in fact, one of my favorites) were scenes, the awesome scenes to watch were like being there because they were awesome to watch. <br /> <br /> But many There were good things to do. The actor was superior to all the major actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (a pleasant surprise). This film has definitely kept my interests together with a great, decline, action, scene. When Ray Liot is kept under table, you should see it well. <br /> <br /> Although it's a step below the movie Fight Club, Mullholland Drive, and "The Judiciary Suspects," you'll often remember the end of the movie that many curves and an awesome fast paced, psychological, action movie, featuring shifts and tones.
