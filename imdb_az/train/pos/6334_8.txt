There is something quite beautiful in this movie. First, it should be based on a true story. This, in turn, is great for many tornadoes to reach the same city day and night in Nebraska. I'm surprised that the real city's name is "Blainsworth" (the movie's name in the movie). There is a Ainsworth, Nebraska, but Blains - a city that begins with something. <br /> <br /> This is the fastest moving tornado ever seen by boys at home. On the other hand, the scene of the television is fuzzy. Before the Doppler radar and the air radio, you would tell us that a tornado has come to us if you turn your television to a specific channel (not cable) and adjust the brightness correctly. The problem then you would hear it. <br /> <br /> This movie was fun for me, as I knew something about mid-tier tornadoes. I love Twister more. I do not mean to give me a break - there's no way you can put yourself through a good pipe house through F5.
