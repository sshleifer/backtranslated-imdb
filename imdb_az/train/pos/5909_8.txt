I remember when I was five years old and my parents thought this was an animated film .... except for the bumps and bullets. Everyone and everyone, everyone and everyone, discriminates, I must admit that everybody and everyone faces this movie .... but the truth is deeply hell. I advise anyone who loves cult classics. Try also Fritz also lives in the cat and Fritz cat's nine. If I was right, Ralph Bashki made this movie. Family, street, work, etc. Includes a cat that has difficult days with. When I was old I leased all these films. Since Coonskin was an attacking title during this period, he was labeled as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also played the role of the youngest Brad World in the Cool World. Heavy traffic was another cartoon of a young man engaged in street life.
