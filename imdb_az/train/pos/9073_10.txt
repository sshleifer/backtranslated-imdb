My husband and I took my 13-year-old son to see this movie, and I'm very happy with the strange fun of the movie. There is an additional appeal to men and women who reminiscent of their childhood, but even women say, "Kids are very strange" in the film, especially by Hallie Kate Eisenberg. It unapologeticically refreshed to see a movie that shows boys and girls that their emotional and social makeup is really different. The boys really do these strange things, and they generally stay alive to explain the story and scare the minds of their mothers! We liked the movie so much that my son and 11 year old friend, a 23-year-old man and my daughters, went one day to see the next day for children. We enjoyed the second time around and everybody raved about it. Television is clean and enjoyable by an early lover who remembers the classic "Freaks and Geeks". Above all, unlike Freaks & Geeks, there will be a smoker who does not survive the first season but sells the DVD version. Especially if you have guys, you see this and encourage conversation and entertainment! Girls, "Boys are very strange!" They will love it for the opportunity they say. Do not miss it ...
