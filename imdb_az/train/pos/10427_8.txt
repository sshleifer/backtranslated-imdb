Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two edges on the European train. Both come from different backgrounds, and the American, he speaks French, steals Jesse Celine and steals them together with Vienna. Within the next few hours, the two cities have something to offer to everyone in Vienna and to be horrified with each other. <br /> <br /> This beautiful romantic comedy is a pure air breath for a genre falling. Linklater, written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused), is actually "pre-Sunrise" because of small sediments. In fact, it grows because you love their characters and have a nice character among them. Smart dialogue is important for these romantic fans.
