It's really strange that a movie does not sweep this boat (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). Actors, beautiful settings, places and surroundings, deep emotions, sweet songs (especially the sound of Udit Narayan), everything was just beautiful. The imperfect element also touched a drama to create consistency and provide a genuine resolution. Alok Nath is such a terrifying actor, so he is open to the feelings of the characters he describes, and he takes the show from the young stars almost. This movie is for anyone who loves true romance - those who go beyond superficial beauty like true love - Hindi or something else, which is one of the best films!
