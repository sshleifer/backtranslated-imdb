A good movie with him - although very powerful for him, is a dense, widespread, very dark story that John Ford's "The Searchers" is probably reminiscent of. The story begins fast and does not release Stewart's Jeff Webster, Ronda Castle, and Sheriff Gannon with a few scenes of really good dialogue. This film is in some ways reminiscent of the "Sea Breeze" (1952), also reminiscent of Mann-Stewart, but I found it less sentimental and more interesting. There are several warnings: very fast-wrapped (and quite sentimental) ends; The 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not as convincing as a naive young Frenchman, and of course, the movie takes place at a scene that does not apply to the real laws of the West, the peoples and physics. But these are very important. James Stewart is astonishingly a dark man who thinks he is not cared for by someone else, and the mountain decoration can not be overthrown. A beautiful Western costume drama.
