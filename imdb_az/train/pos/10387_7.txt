After reading some of the other comments, I was expecting something terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: Original series was not good. Some people remember him with greater love, but the scripts were weak and weak, unlike the pursuit of the car and the Daisy Duke's feet. The duke guys were very clever and respected for the backgrounds, the shadowy Boss Hog was too tough to be bad, and Rosco was instantly hyper-screened on each screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the film's return, it lasted for a long time, as it ran from the first line of the storyline. If you are watching the movie yourself, it's not bad at all, if you compare it directly to the TV series. The real star, of course, is General Lee. Those who come after the car and are awesome are very good, and what is this really? all about. Johnny Knoxville, with his usual eccentric self and Cousin Bo, coupled with Sean William Scott, did not really get anything in this movie really a funny Dumb-And-Dumber kind. Happy Jessica Simpson is a speaker like Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds is a very improved Boss Hog and M.C. <br /> <br /> Gainey, Rosco P. Coltrane, was convincing, always to be. <br /> <br /> If you do not like slapstick humor and naked car stunts, you will not be watching this movie because you know what to expect. Otherwise, if you like an entertaining car moving film, do not graze your brain with a lot of good laughter, and then see this pleasant taste with an open mind.
