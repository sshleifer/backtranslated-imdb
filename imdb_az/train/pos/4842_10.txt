Do not worry about Arthur Askey, but you can watch and enjoy Ghost Train at the same time, just like a Beautiful Back Room Boy, just a curse of a movie is a good movie, even showing the performance of the leading actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe because of not entering the world, it is not a groundless expectation that many people do not come to the wrong place. Ghost Train has such a strong atmosphere that it takes you in a deep and dark world, unfortunately, a little cheaper and entertaining flag distributors able to get into the hopeless early stage, '40s and I have seen a few people watch once imaginative film Casting, unusually, is unusually good, maybe Linden Travers is a bit thick, but it can not play a kayakcule and it does not matter if it is in the background of only one railroad station during the war. This year's passage of our beloved Carole Lynne has broken the last passage we have had with this incredible movie and is now in the past, but is eagerly awaiting patience.
