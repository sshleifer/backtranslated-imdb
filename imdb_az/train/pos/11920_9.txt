Christopher Lloyd is funny and really convincing as "The Chief Angel of Things". <br /> <br /> This movie is better than it was for the first time, but it's never been a better plot or post. <br /> <br /> OK - it was written for kids, but adults are as entertaining as children. Tony Danza does a very realistic job with his role - but this is not a cab meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is actually good and even seems to be a lot of people with a sense of change, for a pleasant change. <br /> <br /> See at least once - it's worth trying to grab it.
