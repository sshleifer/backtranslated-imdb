For a long time, I did not see the beautiful animation feature. Because I have a good reputation for Pixar, I have to say that Ratatouille or another film can not be compared with that. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are beautiful, mindful of the background, almost every object is perfectly laid in each frame. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it felt like I was down the hill - I loved the many things I saw. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely romantic. An animated film can be as romantic as its structure. Heroes favorite, especially Hector, blue rabbit, it owns, pawns, rocks and rules! Other characters are also very nice. Generally, the creators did not make much effort for that. I have always been different from Pixar & Dreamworks, who are working hard to think about something new. And I'm very glad that the product of the European animation studio was very nice. <br /> <br /> Only minus is a foolish start and therefore 9/10 is not 10/10.
