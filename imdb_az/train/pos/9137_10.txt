This is the only film I've seen on the Prince, but it does not matter. And I thought he was just a boy when I read, and I made a mistake. This is probably the best performance. Music is very good. Why in 1984 Oscar won the best music (or something) for a music. Now under his belt is Oscar and Grammy. KÃ¼fr happens with the movie (although no small child or room). You can not say a word without revealing the field. If you have not taken this movie, you really get out and your movie collection is not complete. What else can I say if I go and now buy this movie?
