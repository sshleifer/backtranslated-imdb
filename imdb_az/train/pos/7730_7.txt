If you adapt a book written in the 1990s, set a bloody 90-ies of the 50's. Look, the 40-year-old mores and values ​​will not play until they're off or they're ringing in a real ring. This is a simple rule that Hollywood is normally in violation. And it's a problem with this movie. This was to be determined during the written period. You do not think this is disappointing. I do not want to know, but bmacv's interpretation is well understood. I restrict Rachel Ward's comment. It looks like he is totally self-destructive for this role. As a result, she looks like a cocoa ho in chemotherapy and is sexy as a gay leather boil in a drag. I find that "I can die at any moment", despite the fact that she is very upset, she regrets the "heat" and "sexual tension" that make up the film. In addition, the film was very good; From 10 to 10.
