I was admired by Edvard Burty≈Ñski for many years and is very pleased to see the work of a man with a documentary by Jennifer Baichwal. In Bangladesh, the awesome shingles of ships, the stone quarry in Vermont, the big assembly plant in China, and the ancient neighborhoods in Shanghai are waiting for them: these landscapes are well-caught by the photographer and the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought of old TV documentaries in abandoned coal mines and plastic molding plants; I watch the things that are growing. Burtynsky's work is a sign that industrial activity has only crossed into Asia and that it has not stopped. The most surprising scene for me was computer scrap in China. The waste was dangerous, and the workers were very happy.
