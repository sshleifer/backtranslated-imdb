Etien Girardot is only a character actor - the name of the identity can not be named by anyone. But one of the only actors in the "Philo Vance", once playing his role, once plays coroner. I've already seen twice and I love her every time, because she was so funny and took a fresh breath. This movie is also great for watching, because in addition to Girardot, Git Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. includes. Warner and Nat Pendleton. <br /> <br /> These great characters are one of my favorite B-films. . According to mysterious writing and mystery, the mystery itself is rarely terrible, but the movies are really pleasing. As for this film, Vance is played by Lowe, but as I said, the mystery is part of the foolishness that covers the height and suicide. Unfortunately, you will not hypnotize anyone to do something - I'm training in clinical hypnosis, and if I do what I can do in the movie, I would do it! Many of my second-hand car dealers and old bosses would have been an open target! <br /> <br /> Generally, though not the best Philo Vance movie, it was very good, and it only played once. In fact, besides Vance's five-times William Powell, the Serial has been a long, long sequence of actors like Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) playing Vance. <br /> <br /> This is a similar issue to the Bulldog Drummond series, which drove many different actors playing the lead. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that she is excited and excited, it is not possible.
