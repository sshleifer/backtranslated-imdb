This movie was excellent. It's a sad fact that culture can deal with sex. This is just a great hot fuzzy movie. Traditional and kind kind you have master, doggie, with a cute ape, with a thousand facial expressions, despite being a girl to win her love. This is a great happy movie in the end. This film does a good job to show that they can have traditions and, therefore, emphasized their willingness to die without sharing their secrets. You see a culture that has been before you, that you will increase the drama approaching the end of the picture. Cinema-photography, the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers, is excellent. He decided to be in Oscar for the best foreign film.
