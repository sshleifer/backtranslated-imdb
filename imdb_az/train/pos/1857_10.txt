This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to everyone, much better than expected. This was definitely a magnificent film of heartbeat. A wonderful story with incredible actors and creators. Denzel is definitely another big movie with Washington. (no wonder anyone) Derek Luke did a wonderful job.
