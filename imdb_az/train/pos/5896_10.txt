A real big movie and a true story. Dan Jansen is the biggest skater ever. The family can be touched and a beautiful movie. Jane Jansens's story of battle with cancer and Dan Jansen loves her sister. Jansen has been given a key promise that Jansen won a gold medal to prove his sister Jane's right to believe in his speed skating talent. This picture is worth the time. I want to see more quality than this film. Thanks for a great movie with great actors and a wonderful story. It is a wonderful family support for children and a story that is very touching about faith and a special desire for younger son and sister.
