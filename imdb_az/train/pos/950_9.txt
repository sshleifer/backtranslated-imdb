Imagine and actors, for me, this is the best of Dickens's classic fairy tales. George C. Scott is very much like the rest of the castle. His Scrooge shook with nastiness until the end of the movie. Then his character really changes to one who repents. A city chosen for the 19th Century English language, Dickens creates an ambiance and adds the purpose of this film. This is a movie watching every Christmas together with real Grinch and this is a wonderful life.
