This movie is a story of a young woman during a battle and is not really a movie, it's a great story, I am amazed at the story of this movie, the actress and my love, and that Maruschka Detmers's life I feel sorry for the rector on the grounds that he wants to end it. I recommend everyone to watch this movie, especially with young people and movies. You can compare this movie to a movie soldier from any or all of the real story of WW2.
