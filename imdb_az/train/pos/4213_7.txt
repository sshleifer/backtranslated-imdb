Director Samuel Fuller is preparing a brilliant visual structure: a rough pickpocket raises some microfilms from an unidentified female bag; He saw a courier for the Communists and now he and the police are watching by the police. Film Noir Formula is all about its glory - including coastal segments, floosies, saxophone soundtracks and hell in a cimactic slap fight before arriving at the ingredients. Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are targeted and intelligent, sharp scripts are quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscars nomination for the role of knockout support as a "professional stoolie". Exciting, atmospheric, difficult to nail like. From ****
