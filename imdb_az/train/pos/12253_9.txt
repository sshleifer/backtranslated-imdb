This was one of my favorite traditions of the Austen novel for a long time. It is not in the same category as the great "Pride and Prejudice", though "Emma" is a tough and relatively loyal television version of the Austen novel. The biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good thing, because Austen's unnecessary snobbishness at the end of the story has been removed from here and is replaced by the character of Emma more in the rest of the book. I thought the selected characters were well chosen to describe the roles. Kate Beckinsale goes through a thin line between girlishness and social snob with a grace lost in the '96 version of Gwyneth Paltrow. Clever blonde locks that fit her character and character, as replaced by Harriet, which we know from the book Simper, accompanied by Samantha Morton's previous role. Mr Knightly's role is very good in my opinion; as well as the hero's sophisticated novelty and his compassionate compassion, take part in this very indifferent and magnificent film.
