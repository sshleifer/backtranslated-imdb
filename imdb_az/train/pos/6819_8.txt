I've found a 'Time At The Top' entertaining and stimulating experience. I must imagine that it was generally not brilliant, quite acceptable and sometimes very good. Certainly, as a film directed at young demographics, of course the genre (Sci-Fi) is one of the best things to do. Normally, Canada, the UK and Australia are preparing for the best movie and television shows for children, and "The Time At The Top" is something that will make this theory worse! Sustainability and great play are important for young people. A good field and a creative scenario is more important to them. Both of these films are abundant. Special effects are better than avoiding the story, or exciting viewers from their own imagination. It would be a lot easier to shoot more than SFX in this movie, but it would have completely destroyed Raison D'etre. <br /> <br /> Settings and camera work in this movie have very high standards and complete the beautiful wardrobe and historical accuracy. Generally, this movie is at a high level, and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of their children or myself! Now, you really need to read the original book as soon as possible.
