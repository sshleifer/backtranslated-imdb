Virgil Manoven is an elderly man living alone at a remote farm house. One morning, Manoves, who has changed his cats to the surrounding woods in his estate, sees the likeness of a young child being killed in the middle of the tree. for the police, but no body will be found. The worry that worries the visions will be further explored and ultimately directed to an ugly orphanage where the events are a supernatural turn. It's a fantastic experimental horror with a very creepy atmosphere for "Digg", and this minimalist film is almost entirely deprived of dialogue. Some scenes are actually a rainbow and the player is very good. Land kits provide very unhappy: Eerie Maryland Trees "Blair Witch Project" is a chance of horror movie.
