I was watching this movie very strangely - I placed Netflix on my list and why I did not remember why (except I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman knew). <br /> <br /> My husband and I returned to about 45 minutes when we watched him and said, "You know, I do not want to decide what I hate about this movie, but I'm not sure about it. the thing will not refuse to follow me. "<br /> <br /> In the middle of the film there is a half-scene scene. <br /> <br /> This is the only Sidney Lumet movie of the last credits. And I thought - Wow. I'm surprised that Lumet really took badly about what was broken, telling a really small, small little story really. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good at this movie. Good afternoon. Put it against Capote and I would argue that Oscar should be in this movie instead. <br /> <br /> I also recommend a special feature of the movie about Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman - a fun and educational, student who wants to learn the master feet with Hawke. Lumet teaches first-hand how to work with actors - always kiss her teeth! <br /> <br /> If there are all words and words there are many fierce, melodramatic films with blank passwords. And there is an element in this movie that actors fill the air with a small sense of peace and nothing has left the smoke cleaner. But Lumet had given us the Network and Twelve Anger - each with its own way to the highest levels of cinema. <br /> This movie is not at this level. But there is something about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
