I'm very pleased to have had a very modest drama, thanks to its pretty unimpressive 6.6 rating, nearly missed; I rarely give any movie that is rated below 7/10. By saying this, I was so glad that Stone Angel was very worthy. <br /> <br /> In many cases (though not all), it should be said that it is rarely sensitive, thoughtful, living in the world. its theme, execution, style, production, etc., Stone Angel reminded me of a very notorious "Notebook". I was very surprised that other commentators have repeatedly denied many similarities to this movie, so written commentators will still not see the Notebook. They will not share the subject of Alzheimer's, but I can confidently say that if you like Noutbuk, you will find a lot to spend time with The Stone Angel. But if you have not seen a laptop or have taken this action, as the book has been read, I have to find a lot to convey your attention - do not include the fast-paced driving excitement of your favorite genres. <br /> <br /> This is a film that can be seen by thinkers and those who want to recall over time, as the life of a movie has passed years and as happened in people's lives throughout the year. <br /> <br /> In a strange way, in fact, the big movie is actually worth about 8/10. I blamed the current rating of only 6/10 of 11% of the charmers he earned in 1/6. After all this, writing less than 300 voices. Nevertheless, 11% of the lowest possible rankings really did not expect the car to follow and explode ... Why did they not look at the film's premises and promotional lines for a few seconds? Oh sweetheart ... Whatever the world, do not miss the least falling ship - but only if you have a brain (ie your first Transformers, Fight Club, Terminator).
