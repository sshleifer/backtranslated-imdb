What a good movie! Finally, an image that uncovers an unknown side of the rock: the imagination of glory. Notable Rockers are music, old and forgotten. With a good sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll I've ever seen. For example, it is much better than the spinal cord. Why? Because it's still bare, people are competent. They have a different view about rock, love, and life. They want to catch up with young people who are very attractive. Apart from the story itself, we see symbols with their personalities, weaknesses and dreams. <br /> <br /> Spend a good time watching (listen awesome soundtrack!) And finally consider your future. <br /> <br /> Bye!
