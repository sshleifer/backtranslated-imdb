<br /> <br /> <strong> Tony Scott can be good movies and bad, personally, I think he may be a bit embarrassed and confused, and his case is obviously suffered by his famous brother, but this is, of course, , is the best film. <br /> <br /> Scott makes this movie a good job, giving Denzel the time to develop a realistic warmth and sensitivity relationship with Dakota Fan (better than the day of training). It is not quite boring to build, though it takes time - it is attracted and finds a little way to the characters - including the main role for Radha Mitchell. All of these serve to make the actions more effective because they are explicitly exposed to symbols for obvious weaknesses. <br /> <br /> This film is on the edge for integrity and at the end is not the police. <br /> <br /> The film, of course, could not have been anything without Washington. I'm often surprised to get many duff roles there, which is pretty obvious as almost any leading person (I really like Daniel Day Lewis, who is stronger on the screen today). This movie should be great considering its status and performance and the quality of the movie. Only a handicraft is going to show that it will end up in a flat video if it does not return a movie. I wish I could see it on the big screen.
