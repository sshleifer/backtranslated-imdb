Father and son communicate very little. In fact, they speak different languages. The conversation ends when your son goes to Mecca about 3,000 miles (3,000 miles) for pilgrimage. <br /> <br /> This film takes us to the hearts of these two travelers and is really a great journey to both the audience and the two authors. All images, especially the latest in Mecca. It emphasizes how different it may be for me, but it is equally similar. It was the same for both father and son in the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Tell your friends to see it. You'll be glad you did.
