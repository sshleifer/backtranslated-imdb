After reading the original game, I thought it would be more difficult to adapt to the screen. Donal McCann, as a public attic, is performing a great performance once and for all, a repressed antagonist, clearly displayed on the screen by his alterego-Private Gar. <br /> <br /> Eamonn Kelly also plays great "screwballs" that can not communicate his feelings exclusively with Gar. <br /> <br /> If you find it, it is worth the rent.
