I am grateful for this dark ship, which is included in the recently released Grindhouse Experience box of the Italian exploiting cinema of the 70s, though I think it's free from the disadvantageable and stupid alternative under the titled "Get rid of Death Row", but I honestly think of the subtitle options (dubbing is really terrible), a restored picture quality, and a unique, luxurious DVD edition with a special bonus feature! Heck, I do not even need the picture quality and bonus features, if the movie can be viewed in its original language. "Medieval Frank and Crazy Tony" is a moody / criminal dissatisfaction with a lot of violence, comedy (undoubtedly not always working), feminine beauty, and two witty key characters. Toni Lo Bianco is astonishingly small, Thug, who claims to be the city's largest gown. The real crime lord Frankie Dio (Li Van Cleef) comes to the city and offers an opportunity to climb the ladder by offering its services. Frankie did not see a small cross at first, but Frankie's entire criminal empire created a new French criminal, when he opposed it and ultimately killed Frankie's innocent brother. Tony Frankie helps escape from prison and is heading to Marseille to take Frankie's revenge. The scenario of this unhappy crime is funniily jealous and moves with lightheaded bats with comedies such as cunning cars, for example, followed by nerve French mountain trails. It is extremely difficult to set up a typical mafia performance (to lead a perfect Riz Ortolani account) and the real murder is sadistic and cruel, and it is likely that the film will be regarded as a classic scissors. The film does not have a strong ladies' frame because Edwige Fenech, a lovely and amazingly beautiful beauty, appears only on several scenes and then in the background. Cameras responsible for superior cinematography were just Joe D'Amato. The great movie is highly recommended to fans of Italian exploits and I hope to see it again soon in the original version.
