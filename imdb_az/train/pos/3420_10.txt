This movie is a film that everyone needs. The Congress should be in the eyes of everyone like America, from the point of view of this true documentary soldier. The point that we have completely missed at the previous glance is to show the truth about the teachings of our soldiers to kill non-terrorist people, but to reveal what is in the "enemy" territory and the soldiers. Before the killing or injury of another man, we must bring them home and support our troops. This shows that the government does not help veterans, mentally injured, post traumatic stress disorder, or physically disabled people. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
