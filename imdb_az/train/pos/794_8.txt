I was very surprised by how much this movie liked. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and hot. Andie MacDowell's performance is sensitive and sensitive. Once, the director of a MacDowell film did not create another character in the movie. Romanticism between Kate and the young man is great to watch and plays very well. His relationship with his friends is also a thorn and balm in his yard. Imelda Stalinson, who has been a MVP in many British films, is doing a great job in this regard. There is a tragedy in this, but I think the film is about to shine bright, clean, and witty writing. The quality of the movie is very good and music is good, it does not exist in the soundtrack.
