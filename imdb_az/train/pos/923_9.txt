I did not see it on television, but I gave it to the DVD via Netflix, when I realized that I was there. I had high expectations and did not disappoint. It's funny and animated. I would only expect quality levels from feature films, so I was amazed at some bad comments. Maybe DVD has developed animation animation? It was fun to see both versions of a bonus pilot on DVD. I'm older and I really understand that for adults. It's not the kids who love the cute animated characters. Some say that it is not "dark" anywhere, but I see that some of their parents do not want to see her. I was very disappointed with the cancellation. I would like them to produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
