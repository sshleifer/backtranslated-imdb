When I went to 1986, I saw the Dallas Texas film. I remember that they gave their awards to see the film. Why can I see it after seeing the movie? The film was not bad, nor was it nice. The problem with this film was trying to explain a side story. They created a new story, a new character, and tried to climb around the Masters Saga. My biggest complaint is the second wave of robotech masters attacking the site. Even the same scenarios were used by Master Saga from different dialogues. As a child, I liked the movie. But, unfortunately, I have not seen him as an adult and can not give a better view. I'm disappointed to look back, but now I want to see the movie and re-evaluate my position. Who would leave this movie to be released for the whole world? I love Robotech and I do not expect Shadows.
