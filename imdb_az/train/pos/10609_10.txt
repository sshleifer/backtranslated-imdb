I watched this movie on cables last night and that's something unusual. The thing I love most about it is simplified and low, but deeply sincere. Henry Thomas' (played a child in ET) speaks skillfully (he is a man of few words). David Straithner is a beautiful nudge. And in a miraculous way (as we refer to a Hollywood product here), a baby serves as a main character, but it does not move or lines, but only IS (light). It is interesting to note that Thomas was a mysterious affair. E.T. laid the foundation for the film; its bonds w. <br /> <br /> Behold, the child is the basis of "A Good Baby". <br /> <br /> Then there is music - oh, what music! Gillian Welchin's melodies are beautiful and a great hill country music with all the money. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great atmosphere. I highly recommend.
