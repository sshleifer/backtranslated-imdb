I guess that the Feng and the Child came with great expectations by filmmakers who brought us to the Penguins Martini. From the harsh winter of the South Pole to the hilly desert of France, the narrative is now a part of a documentary and partly fairy tale about the friendship between the two-legged characters, the fox Renard and the friend of the boy who loves it. Bertil will be performed by Noel-Beuneau. The story is obviously simple and sometimes it looks like many Japanese movies that these kids are hit by friendship after the development of trust in different animals and how? they resemble one another and deal with the appropriate enemies and acclaimers. <br /> <br /> Behold, the child gets acquainted with the elegant fox in the mountainous area of ​​the child, and many beautiful picture postcards need to go too fast to capture a cinematographer who provides perfect shooting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. The child is constantly trying to connect the garden to create a fun, but of course, the fox is another idea. Unlike the prophets, unlike the cats, the documentary elements of the film, the life and the era of the life of a film, unlike those that reflect the interpretation of the human experience of events on the screen, <br /> <br /> <br / <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> o. Otherwise, it was smooth sailing and both of them fled as much as they were exposed to a magic signal on the shots you know while playing with each other. The movie really did not fit for the kids, and there were surprisingly dark moments in the same hall that they were suddenly missing out on their eyes, so parents would not want to worry about your teens and not worry about it. <br /> <br /> As a movie, I would prefer it to be a full-fledged penguin gang, but I think it's the way it is, so it's likely that we should not interfere with nature, and that some things should not be considered and remain as it is. Bertil is a film that resembles the power of Noel-Bruneau and chemistry, and is a film that plays Renard many fox-worthy films.
