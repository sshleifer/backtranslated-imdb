This is the best movie version of Dicken's classic fairy tales. I've seen it in the VHS, and I recently got a DVD version for the television (not a widescreen). My exciting ideas about this TV show have been featured in British actors since they have been featured in other films in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise, like the Spirit of the Christmas Eve, is Edward Woodward.
