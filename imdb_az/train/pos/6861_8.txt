Today, Brian De Palma continues to look better and better when compared to what's going on in the 80's to have fun. "Kill Outfit", "Divorce", "Body Couples", "Scarface" and "Carlito Road" are all beautiful works of the cinematographer at the summit. It is a pure Hitchcock with an erroneous insolence in the 1980s, a lot of unpleasant stories and many imperfections, great help in style, surprising Pino Donaggio account and trashy, giallo-inspired area. The De Palma complex helps the camera work and sweet, blood-stained visions help eliminate logical holes, Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife) and Michael Caine Virtuoso give you a real, terrible, immoral, Take odyssey and use every frame to "Kill in the Closer".
