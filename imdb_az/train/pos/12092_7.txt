I remember seeing it in the 70s after I spent the night on the night television. I was afraid of Hell. <br /> <br /> MANY PEOPLE (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a wonderful example of the Italian horror genre of the 60s, Mario Bava's Black Session (1960), Death of the Dead (aka: KILL BABY KILL) ( 1966) and Mario Caiano's NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want a spooky atmosphere along with excellent post, then check it out. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I appreciate the first Poe films that Roger Corman did in the same period. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Sinapse DVD from the French press, and it would have been on television for years - scan-scan. The film actually adds a few minutes of conversation (in French), which does not add much to the whole movie, but it's good to see it completely. Unfortunately, the DVD does not really offer any additions regardless of the movie. <br /> <br /> I was on a flock opening scene, the man who smokes the side of the camera, the front door of the inn. As far as I know, the editors did not catch up at the moment, or maybe they did not care, but for the first time I did not notice. This is the miracle of the DVD. See all the filters, errors, and details that are not visible for the first time. But no matter what. <br /> <br /> But whatever happens, imdb is still at 7 meters
