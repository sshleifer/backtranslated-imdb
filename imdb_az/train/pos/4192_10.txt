Perhaps I think Fuller's best films on the list (that is, I see more and more Shock Corridors) can find himself on my list, Pickup Movie on the South Street, no femme fatale, and male hero, not stereotypical in the genre. Fuller announced his experiences as the vast majority of his other works, and the New York style that Hollywood had not. In a small budget - at least for Darryl F. Zanuck-Fuller and his actors creates such a dark atmosphere lovers. Good guys will not be intensified with you, especially if they are looking for extra money. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter are all terrible things in the lead. Widmark is a few actors who really think of who he is from this character. There is a bit like bugs Bunny, as he might be a wise donkey, which is a little secret. On the other hand, the character of Skip McCoy has a number of values ​​in his life. He does not go to other people's jobs and does not take care of most of the business world outside the small sacks in the river after three years have been removed. He is unaware of the fact that he overthrew a woman (Peters) on the train and canceled something under the Government's control. He may have some secrets to earn more money. What is the main purpose of the film? Patient Moe (Ritter, one of the best and most beloved actresses of his time), the old woman (volunteer Kiley) and the police station. <br /> <br /> Fuller's previous position, along with the boxer's, is dramatic and dramatic, and the thematic elements described in the journalistic style, the dialogue is fresh and engaging. One of Fuller's camera movements is a spontaneity. And what is a third move. Even though you are not familiar with Fuller (which is less strange than his subsequent work), it's a worthless, intense film-noir that's worth checking out.
