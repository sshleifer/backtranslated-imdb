Kirk and crew lands on a single planet caused by the sun burst. They intend to evacuate the residents, but they will find a place to leave the place, except Mr. Ates, some kind of high-tech library. Ato is indifferent to their questions, even though they try to get a flat answer about where everyone is, and they have to choose between "still there." They do not know what they are talking about, but on the contrary, viewers are looking at disks as mirrors and see the past pictures of the planet. Then, while on a disc viewer, Kirk passes through the gate and looks magical in time to the 16th century Louis XIV (1660s). When McCoy and Spock are watching, they are sent to hell in a different disc viewer and an ice age. <br /> <br /> Kirkun's visit is quite short and not all that interesting, because very late at the McCoy's Spock and Spock are more enthusiastic, because they understand that they have a time travel car and store in the library for Mariette Hartley - this is a terrible punishment sent to the place. The scenes with Spock are quite interesting, and the normal logical guy is very atypical. <br /> <br /> It is an exceptional episode that the spokes out from the norm, blatantly inventive scenario and from many different areas - worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - a great character actor Ian Wolfe, played Mr. Atos. I'm a great admirer of old films and I've seen him as a little player in a number of films in the 30s and 40s, and I've almost been looking at it as it has been in this episode since 1969. In spite of the fact that he has lived for another 23 years, he dies more than 95 years!
