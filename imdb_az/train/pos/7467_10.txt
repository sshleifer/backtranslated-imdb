David Aames is a rich-looking man in New York City. After falling for the Spanish beauty Sofia, the "lying partner" Julie Gianni is very jealous, she tells David that she is the only one who loves her and loves to fall into it, but as he fell in love with Sofia, decided to commit suicide with David in the car. David had an accident, but he left his face. He is then charged with the murder of Julie. Certainly, David does not know what's real and does not like this strange desires (the majority of which are actually the nightmare) and some of it just keeps having unreasonable flashbacks. <br /> <br /> It is almost like Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Tom Cruise. Noah Taylor, who performs well in the film. In the film they are really happy, sad, angry, and so on. <br /> <br /> <strong> Vanilla Sky shared many exciting moments with regard to shooting. It's not just a tension, but it's a real psychological tension. Filming is really good, but the film depends on what can be done. It was very well directed here and there were some really nice scenes here. Generally, it is a pleasant film that really needs to be careful. I'm convinced they will do a lot of films in the near future, "Let's die if they're dead".
