It took me a while to watch this version, unfortunately, I will not be able to rent a video store, only the other version, but I liked it. With Emma I was always in the limelight. Gwenneth and Tony Collette, because English does not have to put emphasis naturally, and it does not seem to me either. It is supposed. I'm sorry, but Toni and Gwenneth did a great job there. He could not look hot at any of the heroes, but this version is more like a heartbeat, and I think he is more Emma. Undoubtedly, from now on I will come back. It was a dream that Mr Knightley would not look better, but he was convincing. I love Jane Fairfax (played by Olivia Williams). In the movie version, she never frowned on her, but it is better described in this version. To think about this, all the characters (except for Mr. Knightley) are played better and are very small. Unfortunately, it also appeared simultaneously, and the Paltrow version received more promotions. Frank ...... Finally, I love the new scene. Good work for Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a Jane Austen fan, do not forget to watch this one.
