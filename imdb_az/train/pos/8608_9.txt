It was a great film with a good cast, all hit all the cylinders. When Dianne Keaton is the best, there's nothing better than that. But Tom Everett Scott was always better, underrated. He must be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is an aspect of the scenario. Not one of the heroes did not recognize that the dead girl was not always a good person. And she did not have her mother playing by Keaton. At one point, he breaks one of the words he describes, and does not reveal that he is lying around it. <br /> <br /> Another commentator said that the movie was a "political agenda." It's a shocking thing to say. There was no politics in this film.
