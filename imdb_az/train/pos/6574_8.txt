It can be difficult for some people to get into Hollywood production styles. The director is thirsty, it's just the scenery and the sound quality of the scenery here is bad, and there (people are competing with the sounds of noise, sometimes). <br /> <br /> While waiting for my friends, I watched without knowing what to expect, and the first scene postponed us. It looked very strange and surprising. Then we listened to the content and really enjoyed ourselves. <br /> <br /> It's funny, though it's some darkness. If you appreciate the great dialogue, give it a chance. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is certainly cute.
