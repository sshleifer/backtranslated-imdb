The PM Entertainment product, John Woo "is over enough!" It is full of bullets enough to say. Of course, it's not as nice as Woo can deliver, but it takes over 90 minutes to exploit it. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret police in the near future. As soon as she was framed to kill a governor using a cyborg as her husband's view, she was about to erase the name Ericin. Van Damme is playing Wilson's heroic rifle and his bad cyborg doppelganger role. The reason why the academy does not warn is beyond me. The PM's car tones exploded in 4 minutes for the first time in 5 minutes and went out. Especially, I love the car in the car before approaching the truck, causing the explosion. The other thing I liked was the neighborhood girl who came to perfect Karate in Don's simulator. In 1995 there was a chance to show some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effects.
