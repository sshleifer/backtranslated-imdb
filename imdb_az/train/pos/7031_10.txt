This is a great movie, played a while ago. There was an extra zing. I liked Vanessa Williams as Rosey and Jason Alexander gave a good vote. That was excellent. The setting was also very good. 2 hours and 50 minutes, it takes too long. I usually give 8.5 stars. They also added a few pieces, but it was still cool.
