This game was really big and quite difficult. There is a great, exciting story line and graphs are also very good. I recommend this game to all fans of Horror, and from beginning to finish. <br /> <br /> A really great game for RPG and Shoot'em'up fans. <br /> <br /> A problem with this game just loved me more weapons,
