Then I watched movies ... I thought, "Why was this film so successful at the Korean Box Office?" I even thought that the film was an intelligent / non-scenario scenario, the player was not good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I liked battlefields. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is a movie for you. But I admitted that the movie was a kind of child ... 6/10
