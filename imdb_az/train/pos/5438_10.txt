Interesting adventure form director George Stevens (remember MAMA in 1948 and I remember GIANT of 1956). Based on Rudyard Kipling's poem, GUNGA DIN continues the journey of three military officers in India in the 19th century. The Necip Trio should have the courage to fight a number of other threats, including a battlefield and a temple full of heroic and gold. Their screen adventures have been excited even after six decades, and inspired almost everything from the addicted space opera to the RAIDERER, described by STAR WARS (1977) as LOST ARC (1981). <br /> The biggest cause of the success of the film is the perfect performance by three of the most charismatic film actors. Victor McLaglen is rarely better, because it is a difficult boy hitting Cary Grant's funny foil and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, as a hero who writes it - perhaps more than the rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry of three actors could not only be perfected, and such warm and convincing comrades are missing from the most up-to-date motion pictures and eliminate obvious physical inaccuracies. Human sweetness and calmness are characteristic of nature. A great hit on his day (film is the second largest money maker of 1939) and the best film is the best film.
