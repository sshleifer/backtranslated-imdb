A good and creative production released from clich√©s reminds a story about a close friendship between a person and a child less than an ideal situation: a runaway prisoner who is kidnapped by a youth. A progressive storytelling film by Alan Gibson delivers freshness on nearly every scene, and felon Martin Steckert (Richard Harris) believes that a successful retirement decision is worthwhile, but in the end a successful run-off scheme can be found in his childhood's dwelling place in the lake after leaving the spontaneous character to escape. Frequently singing or dancing in a few steps, whimsical Steckert gradually relies on his captivity and gains his love and comes closer to the inevitable endurance of the police, coupled couples help Steckert and a strange police colonel (James Coburn) responsible for his "prisoner" manhunt was denied by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) appointed to do so. This is a well-rehearsed story of Harris, a man who has a capital performance, a frequent circle and a new adventure, with Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black as Justin Henry. Supported by Wilfred Josephs and top-notch cinematography by Frank Watts, a beautiful post with all the images shot in the province of Ontario.
