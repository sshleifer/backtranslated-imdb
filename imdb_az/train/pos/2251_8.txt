I have a very good view of Alan Jacobs, but I have the opportunity to rent a DVD with a comment from BSU's Curator, Motion Picture Archives James D'Arc. LDS Prophet Heber J. Grant then confirmed that the film understood the deviations from historical content for dramatic expressions and telescopic events. For example, the film showed that Joseph Smith had been tested. Brigham Young has been condemned in spite of his great longing for Joseph Smith's defense. Then Joseph was killed. Joseph Smith has never been deprived of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston, and Joseph Smith was arrested for this special trial. Joseph Smith and his brother, Hirum, who had previously been murdered.
