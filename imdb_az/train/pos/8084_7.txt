<br /> <br /> I took this movie on DVD and watched the other night on the first night. I have devoted 4 years to Tolkien's work. I did not grow up in this movie ... maybe my mother took me away. Not necessarily for children. Graphically, it's not bad, but the issues will go over the top 10-year-old heads. Generally, this animation was perfect, though it was made in 1978/1979. I thought the story was followed by a fairly good sense of the book. But I think that the Prime Minister did not add up to 40 minutes or more, and that he was worried about the return of the King. This would make his last movie. I was disturbed by the end of my mother, and then heard the King's Return, and I was even more worried. It was not a very bad animated movie. He could have gotten more votes than I did. I'll give it 7. I just hope Peter Jackson will do fair books with new live action LOTR.
