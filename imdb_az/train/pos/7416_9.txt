This film acts without groundlessness - it is meaningless without ambition. <br /> <br /> This explains a simple story of a family that the technology breakdown and the family-controlled work of an ever-increasing society is increasingly unbreakable. <br /> <br /> The westerners are likely to hear about these actors, we must be long-standing - honestly and respectfully play their characters - these are the main weaknesses of each one, genuine humanity and kindness, this story. <br /> <br /> We need such films - there are more Western cinematographers who create similar films.
