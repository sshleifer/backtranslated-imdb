When I was watching, I found myself in love and in love. Altman had a connection with zooms and was there and I was expecting them to comment on the characters and their circumstances. Unfortunately, as I have seen, sometimes it is sometimes ironic, sometimes clever, and sometimes very old when not showing ironic or other relationships.
