I liked this movie because I wanted this help! I'm inside my dwellers and there are many friends in the music business ... they still try to be adults .... no fan, group, money and so on ... and they make such a tough time for a normal life. new bands and so on. as they see, as ... as it should be re-started ... this movie is now a word to many of the old rockers of the 70s and 80s ... and I find the film in a sad and surprising place. THESE left an old rock star and describes the life of an abandoned life. In an incredible way. The young girl who came to the street house reminds me Hollis maclaren (Ugly) ... and she is a lady in a movie that will make her happy. The rise and fall of the tapes in this movie, recognizing members and watching them as frustrated and fades.Siz is almost a perfect movie ... sade but somewhat positive .... because the whales. A SACRIFICE BIBLE!
