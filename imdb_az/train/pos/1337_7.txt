......... and Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this movie is less open (or even) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new theme for Bollywood. The subject was accepted, but Jism is far from Murder and Julie. To answer the truth, the subject is presented in a very clean fashion. But plot is the number of clich√©s. The beginning of the film is presented in many "movies". There are very small holes in the ground. When the film feels that Rani is watching something other than a typical movie, she pulls her down. Otherwise, the entire family felt very much at the beginning of the sequence. The player could not have been better. Salman Khan is sometimes surprised and sometimes puts you down. Here he gave one of the best performances. Moreover, his role is well written, and you always welcome the challenge. Rani Mukherjee was enough. Throughout the film, you feel his character most, but it shadows Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta's picture is perfect. Of course, it's a run for everyone's money. When he is innocent, he is surprised at how convincing he may be. And trust me, her daughter is far from Madhubala. This role is one of the reasons I value her high rank. With the help of the government, the family you see in HOPE has the power to do so, yet they do not care about the area where they are enduring. These songs are beautiful. The title song, along with Dil Tera Mera Language (Hearts), is my favorite. Mehndi Mehndi (Kinnah) and Dekhne Walon Ne (See The World See) are two songs perfectly fit. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), Punjabi No. 1 could have been shortened when faced with drilling despite good dance. Otherwise, the film is definitely worth about an hour.
