In the middle class neighborhood in Willard, the fictitious city of the 1950s, this dark comedy is a weapon of mania and the protection of violence, materialism and Joneses, the fear of others, the slavery, the golf, and the dead. Yes, everything is a little bit heavy, but it's trusting me, it's almost like a bird. <br /> <br /> Zombies sounds great among the characters. Numerous questions arise: who will be zombie? (90% of the Willard nation chooses this last path, but 10% prefer traditional funeral)? How many zombies do they have in their tenders like robots (they are a sign of social status)? What are the possible relationships between living and reincarnation dead? <br /> <br /> Please note that director Andrew Currie wrote a live script (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), laughing at these extraordinary materials for about an hour and a half. Timmy, a innocent child who is supported by young K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett, are fairly convinced of the dignity of minors. (When I saw in Memento and The Matrix only, I did not know Moss Moss did not have such beautiful comedies.) <br /> <br /> Design and music of elegant 50s, a tee. Maybe this is not for everyone. This will definitely be a tough movie to defeat the annual Bizarro Award. But smart comedy, which is funny from the start, is one of the earliest gains in filming. Anyway, Fido is a line for me! My notes: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Viewed on 01/30/07)
