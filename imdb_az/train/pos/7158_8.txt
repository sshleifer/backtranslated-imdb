Holes (2003, Live Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> Stanley Yelnats IV is sent to Camp Green Lake when convicted of theft. In this camp, the Manager and his two attendants, Mr Sir and Dr Pendanski, tell the camps to dig after the hole after the hole. But why? <br /> <br /> <strong> Even though you are familiar with the filming of the "Prince", even if you are not an admirer, he is not worthwhile. 'Holes' is one of the Disney films that the whole family can do. The story is beautifully written and is a wonderful idea, including flashbacks from the past. They do not draw attention and really give a great story. All casting is great. The young stars are moving well and it is a joy to add John Voight and Sigourney Weaver. Shia LaBeouf shows that even though she is 17, she can do no flawlessly. <br /> <br /> This is a Disney movie, you will definitely live like a family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
