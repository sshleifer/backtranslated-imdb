The clever, stylish, and entertaining entertainment of the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic, a solid place among the best films! <br /> <br /> If a housewife strangely killed by an angry stranger, the son of a victim <br /> <br /> Clothing made for killing has created a strong impression of the day's followers and good cause. De Palma creates a dramatic story that begins with an interesting structure and builds a mystery that is strongly durable. Finally, the result is especially "uncomfortable". This really shocks the chair. Although De Palma's elegant aspect, this film is not only intense, but also a peculiar and dark atmosphere. Kill is sometimes a very erotic movie, but in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio delivers a beautiful piece of music. <br /> <br /> The film is another powerful feature of this movie. Michael Cain is a great time as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is beautiful as a bad selfless housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a recruited street racer is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter of the investigation son. <br /> <br /> Many De Palma movies are criticized for having Hitchcockian elements and this movie is no exception. However, any similarity between Hitchcocks and De Palmas can only be regarded as a good quality because the "rip-off" of this film would offend a beautiful backdrop. <br /> <br /> Must be a must have for all movie fans dressed in killer. <br /> <br /> **** ****
