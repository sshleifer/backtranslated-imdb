One of the movies to be seen at this theater is that the magnificence of cinematography can really be appreciated. Gambling is amazing and simple with every gesture and smile and nod-bearing meaning. Brad Pitt gives a brilliant performance and is as strong as the father who preaches Tom Skerrit. The film acts as a river, you must be ready to follow through the blessings and streams, but in the end it's worth it.
