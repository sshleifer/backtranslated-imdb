If you are looking for a true movie or someone with a strong and convincing structure, this movie is NOT for you. Nope - you will hate it. <br /> <br /> Toni Randall works for the IRS and shows that he is investigating a very good farmer who never understood. income taxes. However, she tries to convince her of the seriousness of their visit, and every family is happy to have the company. They hit him and act as one of the family ... and they plan to deal with his daughter, Debbie Reynolds. Indeed, everything is there. But the movie gets a great score for a fun script and decent activity. A really nice little curio from the late 1950s.
