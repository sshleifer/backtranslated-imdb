I thought it was a very good movie. We looked at the film for a couple of years ago, knowing that the same boy was the one who loved her before she was killed. I am sure that the film will be very different in this way, so this film made a good movie. This shows that you can always get it, regardless of what you are able to do, and if two siblings are engaged with a boy, the pain and the wound (the same guy) are better and easier to work between them. It is still a pleasure to see stories of love that are terrible, something that can happen in someone's life, which may even draw closer to the end of it. I really enjoyed watching this movie and, as far as I am concerned, I'm doing it right now. When I come to myself, I will follow him. If it were part of the movie, it would be nice if perhaps the elderly brother had come and become a baby, which would have greatly resulted in boasting since he died.
