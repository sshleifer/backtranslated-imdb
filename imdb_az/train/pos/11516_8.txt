I'm not complementary to John Cleese (though "Fawlty Towers was brilliant"), but I'm an admirer, and when I did not see this sitting on a shelf in my local Blockbuster I saw that I decided to give it a try. What I received was a wonderful surprise and was one of the funniest 50-minute experiences I've ever had. The typical English "goon show" was schtick. In fact, like an audio sketch, it would not leave the place at the Firesign Theater, but the performance and the timing of it, and this "Strange Case" raises an eternal performance that can create British comedy fanatics throughout the lifetime. <br /> <br /> Englishman claims that Holmes' image of the Arsenic and Seller's "Inspector Clouseau" seems to have been obsessed, but Cleese- For Physical Comedy, he has the ability to maintain himself. However, unexpected treatments Here's Arthur Lowe, who plays a modest, humble way with Watson, with such a great timing and approval that makes the movie the best feature of the film. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it is very important for me. <br /> <br /> Some people do not bother me. Care for "strange occurrences", especially the English screams, is not the "cuppa river". But I'm glad to see it before losing it.
