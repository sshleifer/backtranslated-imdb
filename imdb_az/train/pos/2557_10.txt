I love myself, watching cartoons, still am a child in my heart! I remember watching bugs bunny when I was a kid, she was still my favorite. I thought of people, it was a big "new" show on television and my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember him when I was a young man" and I, "Dad, Bugs was young". So she is absolutely satisfied with more than one generation, maybe 3. I love a good show for kids and adults, okay, everyone. Very funny, both my husband and I have been watching the shows in the 20s, and we are working again. This show brings back many memories, happy ones. Like Tiny Tim with Tweety, I love very special Christmas, it's cute. I can not choose the character Looney Toons because they have changed over the years. Of course, when I was young, there were Bugs and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always loved it. In fact, I have my best friends. This show is 10 to 10, because there is a great show for all ages, very funny, voice player is incredible, only defect, unfortunately, was over 20 years ago, but it works great again!
