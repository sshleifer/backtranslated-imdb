This film is one of the most popular films of its time. While watching this movie, your action is over and if nothing really affects you, the humor does not match. A bloody blend of us, the brilliant writing for a movie to show off a crushing criminals, and the general public is a near future where blood thirst for all. Its not one of the best liners.I do not want to spoil anything for you, but Arnold can tell you when you give her a "I'll be back line". I love this ship as much as I do.
