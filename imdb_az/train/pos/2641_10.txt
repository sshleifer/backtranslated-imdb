Green Eyes is a great movie. In the context of today's support of our troops, it is interesting that this film does not have respected soldiers who have been able to fulfill their duties during this time. From the historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam War has been a part of everything we can to remember and learn. He was very proud of this film and he deserved the credits he had received from writing the Green Eyes. I agree that I do not understand why this film is more or less accurate. This movie is the type of movie that is shown every year on television. A man's going to his lost son is entirely moving. I'm a friend of Gene Logan and I'm proud to know him. Rocky
