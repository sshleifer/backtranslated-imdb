After the success of the second part, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third look. This time, Tudor times or Elizabethan instead of Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA Rowan Atkinson has been nominated) lives during the French Revolution. Blackadder, accompanied by stupid but beloved Baldrick (Tony Robinson), is a loyal butler for Hugh Laurie, the King of Wales. This third series is doing its best to be rich and powerful for the beautifully-written sitcom Blackadder. Trying to choose a lord for a bad land, trying to sell books, The Scarlet tries to make a bet on Pimpernel, tries to become a car and finally creates as a prince. This is a very good taxi for popular comedy. Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. BAFTA won the Best Comedy Series and was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup.
