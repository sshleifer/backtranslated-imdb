First of all, this movie is painful. Anyone who works as a light / composer in 3D CG films, the images blew me up. Every second I was surprised by the things on the screen I came to the story and it was good. <br /> <br /> If you do not intend to turn the world into flames, but if you like Futuristic Blade Runner-esquire tales (and who does not?) <br /> <br /> I want to say that the sound was shaken from a particularly mild and whole movie. I saw it in English in the film, but I hope there is a French version floating around in one place. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing.
