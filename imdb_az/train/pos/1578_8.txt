Rosenstrasse is a bold story about the difficulty. Reichdeutch women find that their Jewish husbands are locked up in their deportation. Liana Fischer, an aristocrat who was abolished by her family, finds himself among the group as General Gudara's sister. However, rank and privileges do not pay particular attention. <br /> <br /> It will not be studied that Basbug serves as a women's prison in Afghanistan. In one of the most terrifying scenes of the movie, guards take the wedding band from her husband. Considering that we believe in the typical German honesty we are in today with today, we have been deliberately ordering the arrest of Lady Bush, the mother of the detainee US service members, because their existence was silenced. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Fischer, in the first place, refuses to accept Ruth. Even Lena Fischer's brother, Colonel Artur von Eschenbax, kept Lena against the Holocaust's awareness and opposition to her. <br /> <br /> Lena chooses to adopt this idea with the US rebellion, even though Ruth is renamed, and Helga Lehman, the most aryan voice. <br /> <br /> Siege is beneficial on Rosenstrasse, but Lena does not cry: What happened to Ruta after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, examines her mother's background and is excited to write 90 years of Lena's personal history. <br /> <br /> I thought Hannah wanted so much of her family, but she never checked out the fate of her last father, who served at Ostfront.
