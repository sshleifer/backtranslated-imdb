The "Hidden Sun" recalls "The Rapture" (1991) by Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this is a better movie made in Korea. The Korean super-religion in the state of Korea reflects Korean Christians and their relationship with the main characters after a terrible personal tragedy. She is a widow of only one widow, from Seoul to Mylang, a Chinese-made "Hidden Sun" with her younger son. He chose Milyang because the late husband (who was killed in a car accident) was born there and needs to make a new start to a new place. He does not respond well to the excuses of local Christian zealots, trying to convince one of his members to come to their church and prayers. Shin-ae is a true irreligious and brushes these people as polite as possible. In fact, for anyone who starts at Milyang, it just brushes, but some are persistent while trying to occupy their world and the results are often cheerful. It would have been possible to give more films, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the leading role (Jeon Do-yeon) is vast. Reading the 2007 Cannes Best Actress Award, I was looking for a decent job. But Ms. Jeon is attractive and can not be removed when you're on the screen. The film is a kind of Evelyn Waugh-esquire's work, which shows how Fate can feel strange inevitable.
