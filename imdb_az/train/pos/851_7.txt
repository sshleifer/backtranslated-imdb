Pierce Brosnan wetted the last Martini and turned out to be an ugly self-parody as the unlucky, blasphemous devious assassin Julian Noble, who has a special love for the young girls, bullfights and sticky clothes. During a business trip to Mexico City, he gets acquainted with Danny (Greg Kinnear), a flat-faced, Denver suburban businessman in the city to make a living in the hotel bar. In spite of their completely different identities, Julian's raw and insincere words are friendly. <br /> <br /> The directors of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear have played a major role, director Richard Chapard has said Pierce Brosnan did not write a movie, but without it we can do it without it. He proves that there is a real talent for comedy and more than just James Bond and the Cold War spies. The scenery (stunning sets and beautiful pictures) of two people in a bright hotel bar are really part of the toy skills. The scene takes almost fifteen minutes, and although it's probably cautiously scripted, two actors are mostly improvised, but they're a great way to succeed! It looks like a new standard on the instant-acting screen. Emphasize Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel's thoughts and add one of the most delicate pieces of their typecasting (especially Brosnan's James Bond) from many genre clips and actors and get one of the coolest pairs of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story is gentle after a while. An hour later, the film goes out of steam. Nevertheless, I can not put my finger exactly, I am very glad. Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre sometimes feel very fresh and original with Melville, with some tips and lighting. Other symbols are not given much, but this movie offers something new, and it turns out that all the conventional genres that make almost all the effort go into great entertaining. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
