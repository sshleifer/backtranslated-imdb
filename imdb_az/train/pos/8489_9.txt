I teach Japan for a high school online and I take cultural events to help students learn languages ​​with the country. And Gung Ho is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent a movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students see their world and their lives differently than us. Many of my students said that they loved the movie and that they would get a picture for themselves. It's really interesting to see what we value in this culture and value it in their culture. I could only get a cleaned TV version. I'm not really in the raw language she uses always.
