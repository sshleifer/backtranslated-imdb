I really enjoyed this movie and it was a bit tricky for your brother to make mistakes in 30 seconds. But this movie liked me very much because I was accustomed to an ordinary HK action movie. Most of these films do not look at the storyline, but look at the stupid movements. And stupid movements are right. Jet Li Jump, spin, hit, punch, shoot, make jumps and make dodge the countless bullets. It is a fact that this film was released to a larger audience, as it was with Lethal Weapon 4. This is one of the reasons why the movie's ratings have dropped. Most likely, they were looking forward to seeing a polished movie as a North American film. However, most HK movie budgets should be reminded that they are not nearly as high as the North American film, and an HK motion film style is usually very different from what usually happens in many wire jobs. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p>
