If there is no genre of any admirer, this is biopic. Always with false information, incorrect information, dramatic scenes and cheating around, biopics are almost never implemented. Even in the hands of really talented directors such as Martin Scorsese (The Aviation) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often give a big refusal to those who are trying to shoot. Skepticism replaces sweets with the majority of biopsies leading to large screen and is not different from the Notorious Bettie Page. Some critics and filmmakers protested against Gretchen Mol, taking into account the role of Bettie Page, which was no longer a part of it and did not open a portion. I did not doubt that he could handle some part of me since, but as never before, I did not expect him to move away from his performance. Mol is a fairy tale of Oscar's fairy tales as a cat-girl born in 1950 (one of the few casualties that can be overwhelmed by tears and delusions from an early age) becomes one of the most discussed models of all time. The picture takes too little space for 90 minutes, but it may be part of the story, though less than three. The fictional writing by co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner is not as sharp as the ending. However, two women should be given a credit to create an impeccable biopic trying to blend on both topics and masterpieces for decades. Come to Oscar time, Mol, Turner and Harron should be nominated. It will surely happen, though there are three women who are more worthy of them. 9/10
