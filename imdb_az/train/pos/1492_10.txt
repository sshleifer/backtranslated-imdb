Muhsin is a good movie about the first love story. Probably everyone has one and is a young man named Mukhsin, a writer and director of Yasmin Ahmed's story. We know that his films are semi-autobiographical sources based on personal experience, and indeed, the sharing and translation of these emotions on the big screen, the films always show warmness and honesty. The opponent is not different and is probably the most prominent job of the most polished ad today (although the basket still has a special place in my heart). <br /> <br /> Back to our favorite family back - Pak Atan, Mak Inom, Orked and Kak Yam, this time we return to Orked when we were 10 years old. The heroes are smaller than the songs from the Lord to Gubra, where Sharifah Amani's sister, Sharifah Aryan, and Sharifah Aleya Orked and Mak Inom, are likely to be in the screen for their excellent chemistry to play their sister roles. As you can see, Kak Yam, just played by Adibah Noor, even has Pak at the head of the Father! With the tough movie, we come to the full circle with the heroes and the world that Yasmin presented to us. We came to learn and understand a certain family on the days when we were in the campus of Orked Chinese School (Revised). Orked entered the Chinese school and was struck by a few blows (and you are surprised by the explosion of the energy in Gubra, well, he had it during his youth!). <br /> <br /> The family's long-term tomboy and rooted child prefer not to play "mask-masak" while playing with girls, preferring to play with boys in the game, and suggests that your favorite tours come out of their family football games. <br /> <br /> A good friend is a kid named Mohd Syafie Naswip, to come to the village, stay out of the orchid and bike with the villagers, climb the trees, and kite kites. <br /> <br /> Muhsin has moments talking about himself who revives the story and laughs. Because some people did not want to cross the border between friendship and romance. We lived in our own lives and sometimes served as a shooting to remember our childhood. In short, these scenes shouted "entertaining"! We observe a typical campus where some people are hospitable, others, exciting parkers, and chatterers spread gossip from jealousy. <br /> <br /> Yasmin's films have 2 additional family dynamics, as always, as always, from one another's close neighbor, and two from Muhsin's. There is something special for Mukhsin, who has the perfect music and, as the "Hujan" song writes, as well as "Ne Me Quitte Pas", the Yasmin films used in the film have been centralized so far. watching, watching, and connecting to each other, forming an attractive family drama, dealing with universal issues such as separate topics and national romance, love and forgiveness. </ p> </ font> </ font> </ font> </ font> The parts of the perfect Mucina are different from the Yasmin style or deliberately created in such a way. I thought that as a story about childhood reminiscent of memory, there is something to be sure of. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, I felt that Mukhsin did not give so much information, and the latter paid attention to what was to be memorized in important episodes. <br /> <br /> Another highly recommended movie and rare one I feel to be all age - bring your baby or brother!
