A child who is ideal for changing things around him. A child who has to be a human being according to the system. It is a system that hides true and destroys its own rights. A boy inspired by Martin Luther King, stands and tells the truth. A separated family fights against it. A movie that you hide. You see everything and feel the things you hear, and your death did not happen until now. A child who does not accept things, like a boy who does not accept balls or things, ends this movie, as if a child who acts as a pro, does not do anything else, and that he does not do anything wrong. Everyone who wants to see how they were misused at the age of 60.
