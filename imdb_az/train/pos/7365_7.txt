When I came up with this movie like Spike and Heaton, I was together to avoid being told that this film was not a betrayal along the way. I think that the relationship between the two has come to the foreground as I put aside the chase I thought. I have already estimated that there are gay intentions on the Heaton side. My favorite scene was that Heaton and Spike had been stuck in the swamp and Spike had to leave, so I thought Spike would come back. I do not mean that if the teacher was not a teacher for the film teaching, I'd never seen him. In general, I thought this movie was very good and I would recommend it for anyone who is an admirer of British films.
