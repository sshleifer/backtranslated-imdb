I read some of the other user comments and decided to put it one at a time. Some users remain in the "reality" mindset. This movie was to be a 'fantasy' ... if you have a 'fun' movie. It has never been "real" or serious. The Challenger explosion shook the tragedy, though it was very pleasant for everyone I know ... At the age of 30, I enjoyed it - the young man loved him! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she loved it. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie, so it should be just fun. All "realists" in the world should watch documentary films or documents and avoid other films. They apologized to the young people who first watched this film and were able to go to one of the real SpaceCamp (Alabama and Vandenberg AFB, California) - they did not expect to find the same environment described and then feel 'irritation' ... I imagine their parents fantasies and I guess they did not explain the difference between reality. He is excellent. If you love fantasy-entertaining movies and have not seen it, I love it! Enjoy!
