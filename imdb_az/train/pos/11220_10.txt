The purpose for the ball! Gunbuster is one of the series of classic writing. This series is absolutely gorgeous and so far it remains my favorite anime. Although not Gainax's first animated product, it was the first OVA series. Gunbuster, steam, started as a parody of The Ace For Ace (Ace O Nerae!) in the 1970s, as a drama for the ending of the 2nd episode of the episode, as Noriko Takayan was killed in the beginning of humanity's initial encounter. when he was forced to express his father's death, humanity is in war. Noriko's death because of his father's death. However, his confidence in it sometimes tells him to go and he falters. His friend, Kazumi Amano, even doubts Noriko's election as a pilot. However, coach of Norikon Koichiro Ota believes in him. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he has done his personal mission to see the success of being a pilot because he is the savior of Noriko's father's murder. Among other symbols are Jung-Freud Noriko and Kazumi's squadron pilot, Smith Toren, love for Noriko, who was killed first and Noriko's childhood friend Kimiko Higuchi. Kimiko's presence is of interest, even though Noriko is far away, Kimiko remains on Earth for a normal life. And due to time-dilating moves, when Noriko Noriko was at the same age as she was leaving school, Kimiko was aged normally on the ground. At the end of Serik, Noriko is about 18 years old, Kimiko is in the middle ages. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a beautiful animated series to watch if it is a fan of this giant robot. mecha and Gainax animation. If you love Hideaki Ann's other shows or if you are an admirer of Haruhiko Mikimoto's art, give this a chance. It will grow on you.
