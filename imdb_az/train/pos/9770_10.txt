This movie is perfect and I recommend it for everyone who owns a local video store. Or, if it is even better, you can buy it, because we intend to watch this and more. I can watch and watch this movie as a child, and then I've had a very good time. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This is worth 10/10 and I I hope they will soon (next to the fingers) make the next. If you've got your baby or looking at small children for something, then I advise you to rent this movie as it will continue to have fun :).
