There is a need to do some work in the 2nd season. Virus and Ames White, along with Max and Logan, are also combined with the ancient, super cult. The only thing that kept me watching in two parts of the season was to check that Max and Logan would get rid of the most affected virus. A very good drama in the season two. Of course, like all television shows, if there is something wrong with it, the broadcasting company will take off the air. I'm serious about the third and last season. <br /> <br /> If you're reading the book by Max 2 Allan Collins Season 2, you'll know what happens then. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel needs to return to the air for a season, to get all the original actors back. Jessica Alba's carrier fled after the show sky. If so, you need to have a movie to complete it. FoX is, of course, like the Firefly show, which was canceled.
