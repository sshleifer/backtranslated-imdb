It's just funny, look! <br /> <br /> Their 10 lines are OK: This is a parody of wolf films from the 50's / 70s. Many satires, some political. It feels like an early Clouseau movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less rifle bar. If you love movies Naked Guns, it'll love it (it's a slapstick again). <br /> <br /> In fact, humor light varies between sexually innuendo (inevitable in a teenage comedy), really boring social-political satire. It's really fun to change the lunar high school from 50 to 70 years. The consistency of changing heading portraits is brilliant! OK, maybe it's brilliant but still funny. <br /> <br /> There are tons (histaric) cracks, beginning with the Cold War Parades of the 50s and the Inflation of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you have a chance, watch the movie!
