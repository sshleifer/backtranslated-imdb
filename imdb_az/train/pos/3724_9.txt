Tigerland follows the lives of a group that has recently been drafted into the army called to combat Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this point, America knows that there is a missing enemy war and director <br /> <br /> A 16mm-fifth documentary film was shot at the Tigerland training camp in Louisiana, USA. <br /> <br /> Film is not a realistic field of character research but Roland Boz, a clever man who wants to get rid of the camp. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and very memorable. Directors are also very fond of film and style work, and always look like old-fashioned movies about Vietnam. The film shows that all battles and problems attach great importance to fighting this fight. A special scene away from the gray study shows how the instructor is used as a radio torture, just summarizing everything related to the war ... and that is nothing. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> >
