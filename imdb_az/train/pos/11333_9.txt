It's just a joke about weight loss; It would be good if you could never lose weight. Anyway, what I can say is that I love this movie. In the same sense as the same sight and innocence, there are movies like Stand By Me and Goonies. Jake's Closet shows the beauty of simple things and how often they will look at them. The film reminds us of the world of children's eyes and all the magic, mysteries and horrors they see. Jake's Closet, a childhood, presents a tale of compassionate tale that can both be related to love and affection. See with friends; watch with your loved ones; build a castle wine optionally.
