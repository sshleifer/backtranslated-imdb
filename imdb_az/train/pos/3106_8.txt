I did not want to see the Bourne Ultimatum when I did not see the movies before (and was not able to stay near Matt Damon) for AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I liked that a movie in Damon was also nice. <br /> <br /> Rapid battle scenes, bare motorcycle drives and ALL explosions have been removed from your seat on the TBU. <br /> <br /> The closest missions between the CIA and Bourne have taken you to your feet and have fun with longing. <br /> <br /> However, many things really burned my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the film was a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence was recurring and eventually boring. Damon amused us and was a little uncomfortable with Bourne's constant survival, although the CIA was always a step ahead. He pulled out a car and found it as if it had come out! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> And the second (inevitably) - SHAKY CAMERA. It was totally different and was very shaky that made me and everyone who went to see me and my class (even the tutor) seasick. According to educators, if we used it in a classroom, it would be wrong, and we said we would use a tripod. <br/> <br /> <br /> While chatting between the Sea and Stiles, Greengrass would be fair enough to be seen, but surely we will not be able to shake our heads violently! <br /> But it's a bad movie on all TBU and it's worth a hour. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
