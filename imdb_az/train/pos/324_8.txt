I did not expect how much I liked this movie. I just bought it, and I saw it in the list of the most controversial 25 films of all time. Not particularly great. <br /> <br /> I was greatly surprised to find out that this is one of the most memorable movies in the memory. <br /> <br /> A 20-year-old woman wants to know everything. It keeps every bit of information it collects in a large archive. He provides experience with sex, political activism and human experience. The film crew, the film making, and the reactions on this subject and watch each other. Nudity, open sex, and controversial politics were protesting against the seizure of the customs, despite the fact that the film was shown in the United States. Film is a talk. Nevertheless, a document showing the background of film artists in the story, the fourth wall is broken. This movie is the way to get the most out of a movie I've ever seen. The film works primarily as a time capsule of the 1960s, consisting of psychedelic efforts, freedom struggle, and sexual freedom. <br /> <br /> I did not want to spend time with the blue version of this movie, but I really do. This movie is a buried treasure. Try it out.
