In addition to the perfect direction, production, activity, and drama that can be predicted, there is an important message in the script: <br /> <br /> "Listening is all the way" Listen to the sound of the voice. Listen with the voice. Listen to yourself. Listen to the needs of every situation or others. Scenario writers convey "the mystery of life." The match differs from itself. Other emotions awaken, especially the vision and the horizons. One's soul can also be discovered. The art of this film, "as in Heaven," revealed life not only joy and dreams, but also life itself. All of these are the first instruction of the leading character; <br /> <br /> "Listen only, it leads all the way"
