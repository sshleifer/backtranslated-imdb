I'm very pleased to see this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I'm sorry. Tess Nanavati is a clear-cut screenwriter and I would like to see more of his films. If he had done what he did with the budget of this movie, I'm very worried about what he could do with a big picture. Kudos for their terrible performances (for that little girl was gold) and for whom to compose music. Your hopeless "Row Your Boat" blew me up. Very creative film around .... I really hope to see the video or DVD, because I'll buy it in a second. If you have the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
