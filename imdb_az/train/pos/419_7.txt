The Cecil B. DeMille epic of the Old West may have the best performance of Jean Arthur, a mysterious, eccentric, remarkable amoral, selfless, dull Calamity Jane. He really pulled it out! Gary Cooper is in his most terrible place, but he runs some random words: "The plains are great, but the roads are sometimes crucified." This story is down to the end of all the decoy. All Cowboy Heroes of West Lore are in place together with Jesse James. Even Ibrahim Lincoln personally opens this story (or at least DeMille believed us). There is no room for sensitivity, which is a "fairy tale" for the masses. But what is remarkable about this film is how soon Eisenhauer was finally given a full-frontal attack on behalf of the "military industrial complex." It's not just a story about armed fighters, but everyone's money arming and doing it from Washington's heart. But let's not go into politics, let's put DeMille on it, so it can be made to be superficial. After all these films, this film has its primary interest, using its first film scorecard, produced by George Antheil, who, in his biography, has said much about "Bad Boy of Music". Antheil seems to have emerged from the "great voice" source adopted by all the West, the plains sound with noisy noises in the sky, point to the open places, and reach common melodies. That's why everything is unusual, because we have heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have summoned the entire Sage Brush's united symposium to the symphony of the open sky, included in the American myth of lore, and, first of all, it gives a noise that has not changed since then. but maybe it's appropriate. Anthony Quinnni is fun to see in an early look like a Cheyenne Indian. Gabby Hayes is somewhere, but you're putting it in the crowd. Gary Cooper threw them all together, but he never went out loud?
