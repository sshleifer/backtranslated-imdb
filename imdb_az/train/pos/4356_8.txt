"Things about my people" was a surprise. I had no idea what to expect. The film, shot by Raymond DeFelitta and featured by one of his stars, Paul Reiser, was a pleasant time. Despite the predictability of the film and the outcome of the outcome, this is probably the first time that Ben's was in the life of an exploration trip that he knew who his father was, and he saw what his father really was. <br /> <br /> Film, a star for Peter Falk and looks like the movie runs as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most beloved actors in this period and in the past years, is an emerging actor, and he should also be considered. <br /> <br /> For me, as far away as his father, Sam Kleinman, he is a man not only by Ben, but also by his entire family and forty-seven years his wife. <br /> <br /> The matriarch of the Muriel Kleinman tribe runs away, and everyone is starting to panic because it is important for everyone to live together because of the strong family of the family. <div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> his father, from Manhattan on a journey to look for a home where he wants to buy his own family home. The ride suggests that Ben has no connection to his father in any way he knows, because the old man has always shown a betrayer to his younger son. On the way, he realizes that both father and son love each other and misunderstand old man's children. For many years, Sami's love for Muriel has met each other; <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is spectacular in the film. A perfect Sam Kleinman, suddenly wants to change his life in the worst way. <br /> <br /> Ambassador Falk shines like an old man, and there is nothing wrong with interpreting the whole world under his throne. <br /> <br /> If Paul Reiser is not an admirer, we must admit that Ben Kleinman is right. Ben and his father describe his love for mother, Muriel, who is both a partner and a surviving parent. Olympia Dukakis appears only at the end of the movie. Makes a good contribution as a runaway mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel in a great style. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful look thanks to Dan Gillham's cinematography and Steven Argila's excellent music account. Finally, the film, directed by Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, shows a great team effort. <br /> <br /> Although this film is aimed at a clear audience, it should ask everyone.
