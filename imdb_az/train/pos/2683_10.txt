Franco reiterates that he is a surreal and erotic film prince. True, most of his work can be regarded as entertaining sleaz, but when he gives Succubus (Necronomicon) his ability to occupy his creativity and gives a film that is truly angry and mysterious, Eroticism is in itself. Jerry Van Rooyen is a striptease artist who can be schizophrenic (Reynaud) or a realistic (as mysterious states) trial, when the viewer is thrown into a strange scenario, and he agrees with the world he lives in. A beautiful and magnificent piece of cinema did not even give advice to an alternative cinema even with past interest.
