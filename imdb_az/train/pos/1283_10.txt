The film takes place around a man who believes all media is outdated. The idea behind his art project is to uncover the funny culture we are experiencing. Of course, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. These attacks stop funny (caw, caw, caw), rock band, models, blockbuster Hollywood movies, and many other things. Finally, he finds himself in the hands of the weapon he is moving. The film is five years old and sounds more and more everyday. The best description of the post-punk rage I've seen. This is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
