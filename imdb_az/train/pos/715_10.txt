All the people who sit here and say that this film is a weak link, says Ramone, probably, that Amadeus is not good for this disturbing cortisone. Rock and Roll High School was centered around Ramones. Everyone can watch it, and Joey Ramone is a suit of hell spots to keep him out of eating meals cooking, obviously a swamp square daddy-o. Ms. Troqar, who is exploding white mice, patrolling the hall ... immediately classics. <br /> <br /> If you do not love Ramon, you do not know rock roles and you do not have the right to watch a movie named ROCK AND ROLL High School.
