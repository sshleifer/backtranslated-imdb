For Columbo fans such as me, Columbo is so exciting and just episode episode that really creates a really good situation. Ruth Gordon is always playing with Abigail Mitchell, a day-long smart criminal writer. Ababa calls on his nephew to sign some documents that he has inherited. He fulfilled the dirty act of his dead son (Charles Frank), regardless of his nephew's death. More information can not be considered. Mariette Hartley plays a complicated role as Abigail's personal assistant. Columbo is in this class episode. This is a really good television movie. I would recommend it most.
