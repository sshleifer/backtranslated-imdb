Holes are a great movie. I love it and it's one of my favorite movies. One of the few flicks that are not cheesy by Disney. The holes are generally very cool. I want Disney to take more pictures. The holes are really cool that shows a rare Disney flicker. Do not get misconceptions, I do not mean bad mood Disney, but most of these are directed to children and OKAY. Children also have fun. But Disney is guilty of trying to appeal to a teenage audience, and they are usually unsuccessful. But not Holes. The type of movie that can be watched at any age and enjoys it does not seem to be pessimistic at all. <br /> <br /> Those who are destitute are not a good job of being a good family entertainment, but it is very unattractive and lives a bit on the edge. Hopefully, Disney gets more risk and gives you similar scratches.
