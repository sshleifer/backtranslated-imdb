This Oscar-winning film, which was released two years ago, has all of these features: Rich Technicolor sets and suits, breathtaking cinematography, Gershwin's music from excellent wall, superior choreography, lightweight weather scenarios and great performances by Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetta and Caron. Hollywood does not do anything like it anymore. Surely, this is my favorite movie of all times and it is a standard that reviews all other films. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
