An adaptation from the novel "Pet Sematari" by Stephen King. This story, after the sadness, is an American, a middle-aged family, entering a country home. His family is Louis and Rachel, and their two small children, Ellie and their elder son Gage. The house could not have been better and the family met a strange but friendly old man named Jud. He takes an old road to a forest where a forest cemetery lies the day before - filled with large quantities of graves. And beyond that there is a sacred Indian graveyard that looks like a strange force. When the family cats were killed by the church, Louis saw fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and after a strange time, the Church returned to his life. But now there is something bad about him, he is not the same cat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I can say that the book is better than the movie. You can not say that the film is not bad, because it's not a - the book is a little better. The true power of this film is also strange, but extremely original, that the King's stories are usually well-known. The scenario is very well adapted from the story and, though slightly different, is a very good page display. There is plenty of ground hole here and there, though a great deal. In addition, this movie is really scary and this is what it is going to do. There are a number of scenes that really bothered the movie, and I have to say that Rachel's sister Zelda is following one another. I'm honest, it's one of the worst, worrying things I've ever seen in a horror movie - it's not terrible and bloody, it's just a fix. <br /> <br /> Speeches in this movie were very bright and I really did not have problems there. This film is actually in the darkness, there is little consistency in asking for all the things there, including the shocking ending. In general, "Pet Sematary" is a good movie film, so I love this movie, but I recommend Stephen King or those who are genre fans at all. The story is the biggest asset of the film, and this is a creepy man. One of Stephen King's adaptations is better. 7/10.
