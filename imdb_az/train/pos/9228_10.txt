<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p> <p> <p> There was a time when the film was set up. Of course, it has not been applied. Women (and Jews and poor) are very low and are bound to spots in society. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) throughout her lifetime proves the oppression of her time, she can no longer sit there, and there are catastrophic consequences, but there is really nothing about it. <br /> <br /> There is a Flavia as a young man in the vicinity of a battlefield sequentially. He sees an injured "bad" Muslim soldier (some still alive) and tries to help him. Before him, the hatred of his father attracts the head of the soldier and heads his face (large family dynamics, huh?). He then forced his father to join a monastery where he witnessed more injustices. Despite scenes of violence, aggression, and nuns, I will also consider a more dramatic drama. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there are many items for dirty exploitation, but the player is very good at keeping this level of camera work, story and music. Most of the films I have seen are basically based on a monastery where a good girl is in any way a monster, where monkeys are a high monster, who loves to whip people and / or make life hell. <br /> <br /> Flavia spends most of the first part of the film, questioning all her conscience that is around her. Many of his passivity was forgotten when he was acquainted with a strong spirit (but some lying - he does not want to work as an outsider, but easier for the children) brother Agata. While attacking a group of Muslims, Flavia and Agata are not afraid of others. Their attackers are actually acting as their own liberators (brutality and close service). In fact, this is not a Christian but a Muslim, not a slave, but a dear brother Agata. <br /> <br /> After Aqata's death, Flavia sends a violent messenger to those who are exposed to violence ... His father looks at him as a dirt. His Muslim lover often falls short of time. I do not want to give more of the rest of the story, but ultimately to be shocked, to be devastated and ready to be sad. This is a great movie, so do not waste your reputation as a garbage epic. And how do you feel about a movie with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli? I know other things of Maria Casares, but my brother Agata is hell. <br /> <br /> I've read many great reviews of Sinapse (US) freedom, but my German X-Rated Kult DVD copy. Not anamorphic, but at 16: 9 but there is actually a lot more information on the edges than Synapse's. <br /> <br /> And many great, wise or comical dialogue lines <br /> <br /> "Why is God a man?" Father, Son and Holy Spirit? They are all men! "-Flavia <br /> <br />" These men are afraid, look at them, brothers, they are afraid that their forces will be driven out of them! "-Sr. <strong> Aqata (Christians fleeing after Christians) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going? Muslims can not do something that Christians do not do! Ha Ha Ha! "-Sr., Aqata (runaway Christian women) <br /> <br />" Lord, bless those believers, fear the dignified Christians. "-Flavia <br /> <br />" Does he see the Muslim's excessive respect for you? "- Agat Agata <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Last post:" Flavia Gaetani is still a Muslim - not a Christian now - as a fugitive. The idea of ​​the film is that of the events that took place during the Musalman occupation of Italy, something like this is being remembered today: in 800 in OTRANTO "MARTYRDOM"
