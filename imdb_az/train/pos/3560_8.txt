Joseph L. Mankiewicz is now remembered as one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood history, but this movie proves he is. Mankiewicz successfully succeeds in making Shakespeare in Julius Caesar, making the hit Broadway play a wonderful job, performing a wonderful job, writing a Letter to His Three Wives and a spectacular American drama about Eve. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, and can not read very well. She is the only actor she can perfectly perfect with her cool coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer expected, and Nathan acts like a Detroit actor. Jan Simmons is a very beautiful site with great scenes by Sarah Brown and Brando Sizzle. All supporting actors, especially Sheldon Leonard, are making fun of Harry the Horse. However, Mankiewicz feels safe on the stage, but still lends a lot of money to bring a nice piece of music in his own world. All of these, Guys and Dolls are beautiful music and work on many levels where it is not at the normal level.
