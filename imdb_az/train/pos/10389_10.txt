When I was a kid, I saw this movie. That's me. It was before TV days, so a great movie could send a child to orbit. It surprised me that I went to see this movie for twelve days. The special effects used at that time were more than his time. The real Real Rex was a real delight as the Englishman. A few months after the film was filmed I found myself saying, "I want to be a sailor." I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Konrad Veidt was a treacherous character, as you would like to encounter. Also, June Duprez would never have liked it in this way. The color was superior. Give AAA to this movie!
