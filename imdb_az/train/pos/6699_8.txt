<br /> <br /> When Sabrina first came to our screens, I was about 12 years old, and for this reason I spent my teenage years watching my teenage wives come up with all the strange predictions. <br /> <br /> My always was one of my favorite programs, the sixty sitcom 'Bewitched' but this time the character was cooler. Sabrina always liked it because it was smart. He was also friendly and easy to follow. The heroes at the start were great; <br /> <br /> Hilda and Zelda's ladies Harvey, Jenny, Libby, Quizmaster, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal fave, so early) Mr Kraft has always brought the Sabrina mystery even closer. What was originally loved about the first three series was the discovery of family secrets and learning new spells, but more predictable as it went. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There was nothing wrong with Hilda and Zelda, and Miles was gone. The final episode would have made me feel better with SPAMS when Sabrina ended with Aaron on Harvey's wedding day! In general, many programs are a great program if you forget the poor of the last two or three series reminiscent of me. Magic.
