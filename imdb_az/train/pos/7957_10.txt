Hey guys, <br /> <br /> I look everywhere to find these two films and can not find them anywhere in the locals. (I'm in Australia). Please help me, and where can I buy it? General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I've ever seen and are good for people of all ages. I was the 5th most popular movie ever, and I'm still a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family love this movie, because it is my little sister because I looked at it several times. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and do not expect it to be back on DVD again. <br /> <br /> Sally
