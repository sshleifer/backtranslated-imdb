A simple explanation ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... This is a beautiful movie I can follow repeatedly. This is definitely one of the top ten comedies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Life's condition is perfectly fulfilled. With a big cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a perfect scenario for Neil Simon, based on the game. If you have a digital cable, there will be a menu at the bottom of the screen to give you something. Usually it gives the star ***% stars, but in fact **** stars are worth it. If you really watch this movie, it's funny and fresh for a hundred years now.
