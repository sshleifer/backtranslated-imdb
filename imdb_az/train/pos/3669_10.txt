This film keeps the ridiculous nature of the true American patriotic actor - believes that his job (and politics) is important to the American people as the president himself. Alan Bates holds this thinking style perfectly as Michael Baytes and I remember the immortal Bates as this character. It's a film for Canadians and Americans. This is a valuable piece of cinema, which shows how easy it is to get the viewers out of their magic and lose the full control of the producers and directors in the will of actors and countless extraterrestrial forces. Sadly, Hollywood North does not suffer from the subject he describes: Peter O'Brian focuses on accurate and complete control, and also the most serious 'scenes behind' the film, and the clarity and idea of ​​the "Bogota Flight". If you are interested in the Canadian movie's mind and power, Hollywood North is a great place to start.
