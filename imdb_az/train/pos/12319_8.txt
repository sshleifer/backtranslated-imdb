First, first of all, the woman is very nice to be kidnapped. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, 42, is playing at Xiao Qian in the movie and at a good age. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential names in the 1980s. Artistic decor and other aesthetic images are also striking. More dramatic, there was a sense of heroism in the film. <br/> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> ">">. When I watched the film, I was disappointed to see the movie, which is the film of the first place, on a smaller scale and more than a comedy. <br /> <br /> If you see the Lord of the Rings, you will see similarities to LOTR in this film. Climbing is like a mirror who fights with Ring Witch with Miranda Otto. This is definitely a laugh-out-loud. Bravo!
