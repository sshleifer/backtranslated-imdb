Happy Batman Cartoon. It is not at all at the same time as "joker returns" or "Phantasm mask". How would I like the movie's estimation of who Batwoman is? There was a nice twist. Beautiful moving schemes. I always thought that the Batman cartoons were better than the subsequent feelings of the film that continued on the Batman live action. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7.5
