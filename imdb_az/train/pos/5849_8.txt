Damn flat ..... this show has hit the clock and continues to shoot cartoons today. It is not possible to share some DVDs with my little boy and see the same shimmer in his eyes. I've already presented him to Voltron (one of the 5 lions, not one of the 15 vehicles) and one day I was laughing at him saying, "Dad ... you watched a few charming cartoons when you were kids!" <br /> <br /> In Hollywood come on, wipe it out of dust and give it a living action. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify; br /> Honors
