In 1964 I watched black and white TV with all my family as I was 9 years old. My dad remembers that "this may be - Adam and Eve." I remember the scene vividly when the man grabbed his eyes when he found Eve. I asked my dad why his eyes were dark and he said he was tired and hungry. I have not seen this episode in 45 years, and I still remember it alive - TV broadcasts are home to the planet, the headquarters of the bombing scene, and the last scene, carrying Adam and Eve home. Nature can not have been a work of art, but of course, it has given me an impression of all these years.
