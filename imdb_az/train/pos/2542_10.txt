With a special telescope, Janos Ruh (Boris Karloff) successfully achieved a meteorite a year ago, but was a very strong element in Africa. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) is an expedition headed by Ruh to find the element. Rukh unexpectedly finds that Radium X is stronger than radium and much more radioactive, and Karloff becomes contaminated and can only kill everything by touching them. II. In the classical science fiction film after the World War II sparks really fly between Lugosi and Carloff. Director Hillyer used a few sets of simultaneous "FLASH GORDON" series and also put some of the electrical machines out of Frankenstein. Universal kept the public unaware of the special effects used in this great classic film. Carloff and Lugosi were the best of them, and both would enjoy working together and enjoying future generations.
