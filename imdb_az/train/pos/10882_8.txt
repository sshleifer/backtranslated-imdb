This is not a bad movie. This is a contemporary conception of horror, a movie that is in a movie, a well-known actress who fled for his life on the first stage. This film takes the old conventional psychological killer conventional and manages something new and interested in it. <br /> <br /> So, this can be an example of what the genre is. Cut shoots all traces and really scares some parts. Welcome to me, I've given eight times.
