The opening act of the chief actor gives us an idea of ​​how many men are involved in the lives of women and all the miracles that occur in the "normal" life day. . <br /> <br /> Erik Lartigau, director, feels that she has full control of many European men's lives, but can not do without the help of women around them. . <br /> <br /> Although the film has a lot of laughter, it's better to use the face image throughout the movie, and the bigger member of the family is his clever position. <br /> <br /> Single parents are engaged in the adoption and the strength of the family in society. <br /> <br /> One of the top 50 films I've ever seen and a really prize for watching one of the five star rating. After being released to this DVD collection, I recommend it to every age.
