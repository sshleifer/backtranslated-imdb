<br /> <br /> Sopranos is the biggest show in dramatic television history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Toni Soprano is centered around the lives of a man living in one of the two families. One is a traditional spouse and two children's nucleus, and the other is a large New Jersey Mafia group, both of whom are chiefs. Tony is a fascinating, intimidating, and loved man who plays with James Gandolfini, True Romance and Mexico. Gandolfini should be given a complete definition of a feminine and terrible aggressor to make a brutal, truly well-known and perfect lead man. Contemporane American drama has never been such a prison and iconic figure like Tony. <br /> <br /> Hundreds of castles have no plain performance, and you will remember to keep away from such symbols as Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto. <br /> <br /> The true genius of this fairy tale, however, leads the creator and writers to a brave and revolutionary drama series. Twenty-minute sleep sequences, strong and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery, and really shocking scenes of violence. All this style is really welcomed by touching on the issues of love, honor, and respect for the family. The series is never cold and hearty. <br /> <br /> Compete with television and are often poor. Sopranos extends the rest of America's most original and entertaining drama. We forgot the family. Television is Redifined.
