I liked this movie very much! Although it's not like any book, it's a classic Nancy Drew style. I've seen a lot of ads for this movie, and since I've really looked at Nancy Drew's books, I've had really good expectations for this movie, and they have met these expectations. Most of the characters depicted that we read books. I'm so happy to see this movie. All actors and actresses have acted as a book series. Since I've seen this movie, I've been reading there every Nancy Drew book there. All actors and actresses really have their own symbols, and this movie has always shown when it is broadcast on the big screen. It seemed like all the actors and actresses that I am really in the position of the heroes, and of course I'll give 10 to 10 of this movie.
