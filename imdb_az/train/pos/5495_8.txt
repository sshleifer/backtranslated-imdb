One of the best documentary films ever published in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was elected President of Venezuela in 1998. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup left Chavez's part. At that time, Irish director Kim Bartley and Donna√ß O'Briain filmed a documentary on Chavez for British television in Caracas. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <Br> <BR> <BR> <BR> Their movie creates a coup and its results, is going to liberate the market from politics. <br /> <br /> Venezuela's oil has already been privately owned by leaders who want Chavez to be replaced, though he has already owned the state. <br /> <br /> Despite being the world's fourth-largest oil supplier, Venezuela has been squeezed out of poverty and its resources have been leaked by foreign multinationals. 5. The documentary starts showing Chavez's first year as president of the coup. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chavez's education has was a great initiator and wrote thousands of Venezuelan constitution and encouraged children and adults to learn and understand. <br /> <br /> 7. Chavez has promised to re-share oil revenues when it comes to power. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that the oil companies were angry. <br /> <br /> 8. The Media War has happened. Six private television stations immediately began to oppose state television. <br /> <br /> They asked Chavez's motives, foolishness, and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the coup would fail. According to Qafqazinfo.az, under the name of "Democracy Restoration", the opposition silenced the state television, abolished the National Election Board, the Supreme Court, the Milli Majlis and was taken into custody. <br /> <br /> 11. The military elite (supported by the US and the CIA) paid for the citizens' expense in the presidential palace to affect the coup. The snipers hit Chavez supporters, but private media outlets have been making eye shots, as the return fire is actually aimed at the opposition rally, which is safely directed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chavez's supporters have fired on the streets, <br /> <br /> Chavez was captured and refused to resign. Of course, the media / government has denied lying, but Chavez's cabinet members have conveyed the truth to the international community. Later, they returned the message to Venezuela via cable television. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In less than an hour this document has been very short, Nevertheless, he is the richest part of journalism and rarely touches on the form of media warfare. <br /> <br /> <strong>
