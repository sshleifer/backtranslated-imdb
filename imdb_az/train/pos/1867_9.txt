it is a film about life, triumph over difficulties, and miracles of the human spirit. I challenge everyone to avoid tearing up to the end of the movie. It's not just a tear, it's an interesting, thought-provoking drama with all the shooting, especially Luke and Denzel Washington. For 7 years, I am surprised that Luke is still a non-partisan and lead another film, Washington. Nevertheless, apart from a slow structure, the trials and difficulties of a growing child are still a story of how a person is reaching adulthood. The search for many foxes, as in the light of the light, was more than a single bed and did not gain mass critical acclaim. Antwion eventually ended up with a movie for her mother, and there were many possible ways that could have been or could have been all schmaltzy, but Washington had a full right voice, her mother had never said a word and could only pour a tear The antowne simply asked why. How could his heavy offender prevent him from saying something to defend himself? One of the most moving cinematic scenes I've ever seen.
