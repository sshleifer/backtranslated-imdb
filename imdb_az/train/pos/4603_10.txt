There's a lot of details for Jackie Chan's films, but it's here. Funny elements, though, have a very serious and serious atmosphere. Jackie is offensive and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is attacked, and only then is a man (in the form of an ordinary fever), but he can go and start from head to toe. The way you hit the bad guy in the glasses is beautiful. Every time "crack" goes. I love the scene when I go to the Jackie pub and conquer opponents who are facing their lover. This is one of the best blitzkrieg put on the screen. At the same time, all the scenes were painted on the background of a moving character on the wall (in the Soviet era it looks like a "rabochiy" poster) and on the left with a number of lines in Russian (I accidentally distinguished). It looks horrible (and nostalgia for the Russian people). I also want windows to collapse in films. There are many things here. <br /> <br /> All three films are great. <br /> <br /> All three films are great. I had prepared myself to see low-quality driving, but I've seen a perfect trilogy with incredible stunts (and Jackie Chan's character only appears in all three movies - it's also excellent and lasting). <Br / I would like to explain every single movie in a few words: No.1 is a great story (story from start to finish) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - Anger (Jackie's really * Beep sound) and painful (Jackie is tortured); No.3 - incredible (woman with incredible fight with Jackie) and bombastic (should I talk about multiple guns and explosions?). <br /> <br /> As for the rest - <br /> <br /> This is a trilogy that can be traced at least (at least by myself). His place is in the top ten among the action / comedy stones. Finally, it was released on DVD in Russia (best movie 2 - Chinese / Russian voices and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> It's 10 to 10. Thank you for your attention.
