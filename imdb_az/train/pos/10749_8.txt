I rented it for my son who was interested in 9/11 recently. At that time, he was a kindergarten and did not know what had happened. I like it as it is called a "documentary". If you have a movie that I recommend to see about 9/11, this is the one! You normally see a movie with actors well-known. No one in this movie is known. Also, if you see a movie about 9/11, a rescue warrior or two people lose their lives. I did not feel that there was no such thing! I just rented this movie and I have to add it to our collection! Very good work done! The heart goes to the families and families of the 9/11 victims!
