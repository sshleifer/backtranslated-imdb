I know that many people do not like this movie, but it's great fun. I do not know much, but the movie is a good movie I think. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the sounds are beautiful, and in the film there are many comical lines, especially about Briggitta, and not society. If you love music, I would like it!
