It's very simple to rate the movie: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This idea is based on the following: The actors' performance seems to be the citizens of that era, 1100 B.C. They can perfect the characters. The second reason is that the poetry described in Homer's poem is far better than production. The narrations given by the chorus give others a special atmosphere that translates us into an artistic interpretation. The Third Cause: Restoration of the decor is completely perfect, in the Mediterranean region where the poet's movement is. And most importantly, the emotion is in the meeting. I repeat my gratitude: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
