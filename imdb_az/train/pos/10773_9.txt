I'll give this movie to everyone. Not only the rock player Luciano Ligabue is for all fans of film-buffs. Because it's sincere, moving, funny, and right. Since Ligabue is a storyteller born and a movie lover, every frame of the film is made with love and care. Her characters are loved and ask for love. The majority of Italian debut films are bad, and this is done by an outsider because watching and listening is a real pleasure. Because Stefano Accorsi is brilliant and remembers that she is wonderful, talented and good like Freccia and lost her life because of her heroism that Ligabue easily shows unglamorous and ugly without inclination to immorality. Because there is a movie about our hearts, ears and souls. And that's exactly what I experienced with the FM radio. Thanks, Luciano!
