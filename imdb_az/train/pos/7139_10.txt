John Thaw, Inspector Morse's reputation, plays the old Tom Oakley in this movie. Tom lived in a small English village in 1939 and was the beginning of the Second World War. Though somewhat, Tom survived the death of his wife and son while serving during the First World War. <br /> <br /> <strong> Inspector Morse is old and retired if you imagine that he was twice as a police officer, then Tom Oak. <br /> <br /> However, the heart of this gravel melts. Children in London are evacuated before the blitz. Young William (Willie) Beech is being billeted with Protestant Tom. Well impressed by Willie Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs capital care. The bed behind the school is still moisturizing and the smallest problems that can not be read. <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Tom finds his love and care again. And the boy learns to love and care. See bomb shelters at the end of Tom and Willie gardens. <br /> <strong> See the first birthday party by Tom on Williams' joy. <br /> <br /> Not to give up, but Willie is most accepted by Tom after the fight, and the pair is rich in a new life for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson are watching long films that meet human-born and mutual love. See the late Dirk Bogarde and John Whiteley in "Spanish garden". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti "It Begins In Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas "Captains Courageous". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl "Face Without Man". <br /> <br /> Two center of interest. This is just a look of Thaw. Secondly, Robinson has played a part in Tom's Midnight Garden, a second film titled "Tom." in a classic children's novel.
