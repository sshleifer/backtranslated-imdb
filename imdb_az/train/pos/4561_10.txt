<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie three times and each time I see it is more personal and more emotional to watch. <br /> <br /> Acting is incredible, incredibly hard because Daniel Day Lewis is an incredible actor. Brenda Fricker, despite this, is a striking miracle. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < strong> but I will stop here. I recommend everyone who uses movies based on actual events or simply use good dramas.
