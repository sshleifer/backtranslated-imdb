Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) plays Hedy Lamarr (Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> The 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr's world view is at the earliest moments of the 1930s. an angel on a wedding gown screen. This was the beginning of a legendary career. <br /> <br /> It looks like Eva's (Lamarr) nightmare and her romantic adventures of her great husband appear uninterested. She moves away from a single bed and on a beautiful stage, she fiddles with her wedding ring, as the fulfillment of the marriage mistake overcomes her supremacy. The husband is more vigilant and harder than he is in love. Gustav Machaty uses perfect camera angles and sharp shooting frames to capture Lamarr's abilities and beauty. In the first part of the film, he can understand our happiness, our soul, and our support. It is the merger that the audience in 1930 prepared for being seen as a movie. <br /> <br /> Someone is thinking of becoming a scandal. <br /> <br /> He returns to his father's property and divorce files. The next day, she wakes up with a sense of full freedom and happiness. She just needs to go abroad and feel the freedom of the village and clean air. Eva goes for horseback riding and is on a beautiful lake. In one of the most popular scenes of film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first man to appear naked in a big movie. It was his scandalous scandal in the trees in the lake and his dingy immersion adventure. But viewers are not far off. <br /> <br /> Like many of today's films, controversies have made her a movie. <br /> <br /> Evan's fairytale adventure presents a beautiful young man who helps him find his horse flying in his clothes. After an unusual meeting, they fall into one another. Their first romantic appointments were almost controversial as the nuclear scene with the waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does a great job in these romantic moments. <br /> <br /> <strong> Eurovision-2012 song contest winners were awarded. Many thought that there was a career suicide. Instead, Louis B Mayer, who gained world fame and signed a contract with the MGM. This movie really has erotic moments, even with the current speed standards. It is impossible to imagine how it was taken in the 1930s. Again, with the description of Machaty, it was very clever, left many things for the imagination. <br /> <br /> Evan's former spouse and his current lover are probably inevitable. But this is not the result of the meeting. <br /> <br /> This movie has been repeatedly controversial and now I propose. Call for DVDs in a restored form. Only Hedy Lamarr is easily worth the sight of happiness. But the story is appealing and direction is ahead of time. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews !!!
