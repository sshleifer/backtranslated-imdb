I went to Sacramento to see the premiere of San Francisco (and back) and I'm really glad. How many Oscar-winning films were filmed in the Bay Area as a great film admirer and a lifetime North California? As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Gulf, LA Lucas's resilience, society, and vision have really resonated with me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other directors can do that in the SF, there may be other artists. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie
