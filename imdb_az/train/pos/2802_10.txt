It's hard for me to get into football as someone who never goes to sports (or Americans call it unusual football) - "bending like Beckham". But it was worth it to say, it was a cool movie! Anglo-Indian Hessminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend, Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley), love to play football (yes, I'll say British and international) and just loves David Beckham. However, Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents do not agree (his mother is actually describing football in the early days of the film). Okay, maybe it was a clich√© in this sense, but you should love this movie! And if you like me, in this movie you will not go without knowing the definition of "bend" ... do not worry, the film explains it (I did not hear David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley fought a great deal: "BILB" came out just a few months after the US, and he played equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean Pirates: Black Pearl Curse".
