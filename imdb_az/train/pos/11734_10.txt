This is one of my favorite favorites, unlike the weak 'Elvira's Haunted Hills' ... I love the movie as a goth / com story of Wizard of Oz ... <br /> <br /> Elvira, Dorothi goth, a closed town in a town that did not recognize after a good Witch (elviras Aunt Morgana) died, was very strong and inherited a "Ruby" call searched by Bad Warlock (uncle). It helps four characters, which by mistake can help grow with a dog throughout the movie all the time. Elvira has a show with her Uncle (Western Wicked Witch), who understands that she is strong in her and can defeat her. Finally, after winning the hearts, the town is settled by its people and eventually becomes Las Vegas (in Dorothin's Kansas). <br /> <br /> In general, a small magic movie ... both he and his uncle draw lines related to parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Emin and Aunt Remus ... There is no place like home, no place like home!" <br /> <br /> Elvira has a sign that crosses the Kansas state at first. But, in addition, it is true that one of the followers, "he was destroyed, hoped ... inspired by FlashDance" is a pure genius ... and if he does not need to laugh, his "very 80s" At the end of the Las Vegas show there is a camp bone in your body after its titty twirling ... This movie is Cult / Camp Classic
