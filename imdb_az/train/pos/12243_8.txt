Although Kate Beckinsale is no better than Gwyneth Paltrow, I liked Gwyneth Paltrow in Emma, ​​as well as Emma in this movie. Both are good in different ways. Although Kate Beckinsale looks even more interesting as Emma. And I liked the woman playing Harriet Smith in this movie ... she was more convincing, sweet and sentimental. There are some things I like about Gwyneth Paltrow better, but how does the humor look more clearly?
