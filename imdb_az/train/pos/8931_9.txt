"Intruder" (L'Intrus) directed by French director Clair Denis is the film's freedom. It takes its spirit with time, space, and character. It could be a plot, but I realized that I took the picture from the Netflix DVD lever. Honestly, it's best not to let anything happen before watching the movie because the viewer can put off any expectations. The film requires the viewer to think, but insults that he can not get a complete understanding. <br /> <br /> The human heart is the plot of the film. Each picture asks its role, nature, and shape. The heart of the heart watcher and Luis. The character of Louis is played by Michel Subor, the peace and mystery required by such a character. Honestly, everyone could play Louis' character, if he had a brown, willing, and comfortable heart. Whereas Subor is a feature here; it turns into a film, its identity is indivisible. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the majority of the film is sounded in my mind, but on the contrary, it sounds physically. <br /> <br /> It is poetic in its ability to hold the inactivity and fullness of the genitalization movement, but refuses to take pictures of any literature. "Surrealistic" is a term used to describe this film, but "quasi-dramatic" is a more appropriate process. Nothing in the film is beyond the capabilities of the truth; <br /> <br /> If you are attracted to outstanding images, watch your trailer several times; See the film to learn the results and freedom of the verse.
