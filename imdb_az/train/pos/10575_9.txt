Fast, funny, sexy and magnificent. Cagney is always terrible. Blondel makes you attractive with intelligent and energetic. As you can see, this is a pre-censorship movie, suits and way to touch each other by the innuendo on the script. There were bikinis before the bikinis! There is no limit to everyone. I do not understand the question of John Garfield. Is it important for you to be in this movie? If he is not so short on the screen, he is basically an explosive. See the frame to find it if you're there. I am a great Cagney admirer, but I have never seen it before. I found Turner Classics. I found it with a wonderful accident. Sit back and enjoy your trip!
