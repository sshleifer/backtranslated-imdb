One of the best films by Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music by Irving Berlin. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn are strongly supported. <br /> <br /> The author's song "Come Let's Get Yourself", "Come to Music" and "My Egg in a Basket." The last song was a jazz piano by Astraire and then presented a sweet dance with Rogers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays Rogers' s sister. "Follow me" - a song that will stay with you for days. He also said, "But where are you?" He says. Snappy and fast paced, the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best in this introduction. Classic and incredibly beautiful final, "Let's Face the Music and Dance", are best known for their number. Rogers is wearing one of the great clothes in the history of the film ... as he dances, seeing a glittering, slender number (also weighted) and slightly curled around his legs. Just fine. <br /> <br /> Although Randolph seems to be the only choice in Scott Astaire's dress, Roberta also appeared with Irene Dunne. Fortunately, she does not try to sing and dance. Grill and Ball appear to have bigger sections in 1936, but have few stages and less effect. <br /> <br /> Royers has one of his best solo numbers in his "Get Yourself Go" series .... Jazzy and thumping, it's a great song. Third time, though, we were "tired of joining the sea" in an entertaining way.
