Maybe some people think it's a slow movie. However, this is "slowly burning", which has a profound effect on the audience. This is a spectacular first scene: first, we can not hear voices; then we are allowed to see the symbols; Finally, the camera slowly dropped back and forth, and we're just another young person, just sitting down, looking at us, or even listening to the conversation, at least not really care. It shows the strategy of the film, in which the young man's leading role will be: to develop the character and to identify it with the surrounding environment, but not without much of what it takes. People come and go, live in and out. Most of the film follows it (though most of the supporting characters are determined only by the relationships with it), we believe that we are objective, as it is the director's touch.
