I continue to guess the final section of this Zorro is the perfectly supported cast and mystery villain for a good screen play.There is an exciting music score from Chapterplays.The exciting game. Hadley is doing a wonderful job like Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last, but of course, at least, Whitney and the English's great leadership.
