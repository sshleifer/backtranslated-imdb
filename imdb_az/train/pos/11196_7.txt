One-way Jack Sander calls that he is a carnival boxer who fights any person in the audience. If they can pass a round, they earn an award - a popular way to get customers to travel long before. Jack is in love with a girl selling tickets, Mabel, Bob Corby, quickly turns his head when Jack comes out to test his chances. Nobody will know that Bob is a champion, so he's still able to do Jack - he's doing a job for him. Consequently, Bob wanted Jack to become a sparring partner and to abandon the carnival period. Later, Jack gets very good, and he's a legitimate boxer. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Champ and Mabel jumped behind Jack - even now Mabel got married. So, during the final battle between Jack and Bob, Jack and Jack are ready to kill him. Is it good enough? Can Bob justify strangely enough for his assistance or prevent his performance? Tune and see. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock directed this movie, and today's film is strange for a director known for the 1920s, and he has written or written no fixed genres of Hitchcock made for this film). In fact, in many respects, this film is more of Hitchcock's silent style, as one of the next silent silhouettes of Manchman (also known as Carl Brisson as a husband of cruelty). Although it seems to be a standard boxing film of the day, it is not a radical departure for a great filmmaker - even with its extremely shaped end. <br /> <br /> Generally, slightly anticipated and Ian Hunter seems to be foolish when playing boxing champion, the movie works well. The perfect silent remote, though, is worth a try and a good blow pack.
