I think it's a great movie. because you see how Diana is in her life. she has been so aggressive and wants to prove that girls can fight. I think he and Adrian were great actors. I'm boxing because of this film. It really surprised me. the only negative part I think. The last one. Because it's good between Diana and Adrian. But you do not see how it is at home. I did not really care how your father did and did not see his brother. but I think it's a great movie, and I think I'll watch it much more :) If you do not want boxing, you even recommend it to anyone, you see something more than boxing. I had a great time watching her.
