If you love sci-fi in the 70s or like movies such as "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", it's more than you love. The Sci-fi of the 70s is a spectacular flow of consciousness, one consecutive in the 22nd century and one million years after Earth. This film is pure 70. Steve Miller's "Eat An Eagle" or Pink Floyd's "On The Black Side of the Moon" and you're ready to go!
