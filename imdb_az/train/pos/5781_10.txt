"Most of us live in at least two worlds, the real world in which we are in situations and in the world of compassion is a safe place where you can not go unconscious ..." With these words, Mr. "The Maxx" is an exciting world where the fantasy and reality of the world are united. Inspired by comic books from Sam Kiet, "The Maxx" is committed to something similar to the comic pages shown not only in the story, but also in graphic style. Surreal and unique look. But this story is an interesting and entertaining event. Moments can be very strange, but it's hard to get out when you're inside. The story and characters are beautifully developed. The music goes perfectly with the show style and gives it a proper atmosphere. Unfortunately, like a very good animation show, this was a short one. "The Maxx" needs to see one. This is one of my agenda.
