Soylent Green is classic. I invite someone to repeat it. They are reshaping science-fiction classics today (ie the World War I) and I hope that some director / producer Soylent Green will do it again. Today's computer has the potential to be a great picture with animation and technology. Anti-Utopia films can not go away so far. Human race grows and limits it without any outside influence. Though we, like humans, are able to grow smaller species of cypress, we have nothing to control man's growth, except ourselves. All diseases, wars, abortions, birth control and so on. However, human race is still growing in the petri dish as bacteria. The classical Malthusian economy shows that any type of people, including people, will go beyond their means of living. 6 billion and growing .... this is immoral.
