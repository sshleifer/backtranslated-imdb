A beautiful movie made by Powell and Pressburger, I want to explore the matter further. The film is about how real and real we perceive and how difficult it will be for you to be different from each other. Although David Niven did not appear at age 27, despite the claim that he was characterized by a good fire and action. Very nice to see Richard Richard Attenburg. This movie was watching me and then thinking about it.
