I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea. I think it's a bit on the rough side of the character "Dark-Heart" and I do not like the "middle" frog, the fox, the transfer of the picture to the boy. I made a mistake, this movie was not for me but for me. "Takes" when passing through my head. Of course, I do not "get it." This is not one of the NEW children's movies that adults will love. This is true for young people and the crew knows what they are doing. There is no political obedience. There is no magic that will save us from the world, no one has the right to excessive use and everyone is not always happy. As a side benefit, nobody DIES! russwill
