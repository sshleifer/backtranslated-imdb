I went to see this movie twice a week, and you can combine these words in just one word (I usually do not use light): Beautiful! In my opinion, the best film was made. This story group, which creates kinematic excellence in the final scenes of the film, is worthy of Oscars and other prizes when everything in the story (or unwritten) is taken in one place? The character of Daniel Dareus, as well as many senses and long-lasting feelings in people around him, is similar to the audience: You go head to head with abuzz and feel your heart. Great things! If you ask in the future what is the meaning of life, consider how you feel after a happy experience in paradise: Happy, content, fulfilled. Woolfun, Virginia, speaks with Mrs. Dalloway: "It's just enough."
