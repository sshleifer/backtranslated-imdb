One good thing about this movie is that it's not the original that stands alone. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest disadvantage. I have included several original characters in the new story, and saw how their lives are developing. Sinclair, as in the original, provides the best comic moments in excellent and great movies because he tries to deal with unusual and embarrassing situations, but the supporting player is not as strong as the original film. Although Forsyth was congratulated with a courageous attempt to carry the character and create an original sequel, the film is actually a defective and original
