A chance encounter between vendor and cunning men changes their lives. This writer is a strange film that makes an impressive effort for director Chapar. Brosnan began a stressful job in a role that was not taken seriously from James Bond, but could not emotionally communicate with anyone to help him. Kinnear, the seller, is equally as good as a man worthy of life. Davis is as beautiful as Kinnear's naked spouse. Basically a character exploration rewards the film because it feels a fresh and unexpected, very dark comedy.
