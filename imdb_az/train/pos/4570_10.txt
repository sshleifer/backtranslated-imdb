Even if you do not know anything about Ireland, you should love "My Left Foot" (especially Daniel Day-Lewis's performance). He plays Christy Brown, who is cerebral palsy. Therefore, he hunted most of his life. Even when trying to warn people about something, they just laughed at him. For him, the light in the dark controls part of it: the left foot. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan have made this collaboration, and later worked very well in collaboration: "Ata" (but "Boxer" was unnecessary). "My Left Foot" can feel many ways: sad, hopeful or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis has performed here for a lifetime. A great movie in every sense.
