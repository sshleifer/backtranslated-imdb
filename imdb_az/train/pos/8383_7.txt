Robot Jox runs a lot, but a number of battlefields - robot robots, against men and women. The stage had potential, but it seems that the scenario really needs more project. However, science was a very good science fiction film. This was part of a script because it was Joe Haldeman. For those who did not know the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel, "The Forever War". This is one of the strongest fighting armor novels by Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". And this movie is not really giant robots, but giant powerful fighting armored films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In spite of some speculation, this is not true. <br /> <br /> Despite some speculation, Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers" laid Homer's "Iliad". All of the several names were common. Achilles, whose robot's foot exploded, did not see a parallel situation in Aleppo, which had not killed Axilles. Ancient Achilles was also a noble fighter. He was the strongest, but also intense and small. Even the robot that was killed on the first stage does not fit into his pocket. <br /> <br /> <strong> was called Hercules, and Greece was Herakles in Ilya. <br /> <br /> Impacts were pretty good for the time and budget. True, a year later did not compare with Terminator 2, but the movie was worth ten times. The stops were almost as good as the "Empire Triggered Back" and "Jedi Returns" robotic marches. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> I love our life very much. There are many other low budget and better budget blockbuster wannabes with better effects but with worse scripts.
