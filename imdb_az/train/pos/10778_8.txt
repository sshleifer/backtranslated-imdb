Now, this show looks like the appearance of most other species from the mid-90s, but the first is that it can be a lot of comedy and action and a little drama. Personally, I thought it was a good show, and I could not understand why it would have been canceled. It's a good thing that the fan base of this show has been so alive since 1997. <br /> <br /> My expectations are that the World Bank is bringing the show back and even knowing the movie <br /> <br /> In any case, I advise you not to see all 13 episodes to find the DVD. Because the characters are great, the story lines are good, the comedy is good and good, the whole show is just great.
