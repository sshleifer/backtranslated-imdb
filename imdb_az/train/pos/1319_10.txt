This movie is a great fun. I recommend watching yourself and watching with your friends again. I made it last night and wondered how Norma Hurin could make the world go! It was a bit strange to watch my friends go through the same roller coaster as I did for the first time. But all of them thanked me and loved the movie. If you spend 2 hours after the movie, you know it's a great movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a man almost at the level of Norma Khouri, but there was no room in the same size ring. He was very clever and wealthy in my old Berkeley CA CA. Everyone is a group that trusts everyone. He would "sponsor" people for very good people. After just 1 month in the city, he was stolen more than 100 kg (real money in 1987). Victims were as sensitive as they did during the early months or during the week of being sober. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned crime is nothing compared to what Norma Hurin did to his old neighbor. <br /> <br /> I found this night on a movie night, I think I'm a shit. This is always the biggest experience of a movie lovers to see something and make the mind overheard. Just drag your friends to see it and tell them something. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic for all time. I believe that all the great films will come to an end. Time for this movie will be very good. <br /> <br /> The author and editor of the article were fantastic. <br /> <br /> The best documentary is worthy of win. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE FILM!
