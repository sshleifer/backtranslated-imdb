At first, after seeing it, I have responded to many people: the laying of greasy people to the sun, and so on. It was a cheap shooting. Perhaps she is meeting Diane Arbus. . . no matter what. . . but just a while ago, I realized that this was not a bad thing, and I thought that the problem was totally spectacular as the pictures were opened: we should feel everywhere with Hollywood and our films. Sexual management of people over a certain age is something that should not be seen. All this would be a great deal if the film was presented. But the story of a woman who is an overly lover and a drunken friend really hits a tone of brick: a very extraordinary story, incredible speeches, and the impression that the scene is improvised. That blonde guy is a genius actor. Finally, we want to disagree with those who say that this movie is a pity to all these people. Finally, the old man, who is dancing for her dance, is an OK character who completely demolishes this pattern, so do not feel the film upside down. Yes, the dog was killed. this is not a flowery picture of the world, but it is not. . . completely hopeless. Probably, I am very grateful to the filmmaker because of such a beautiful film. I was not as powerful as each one, but I'm telling that this film is essentially a donkey, and it's highly recommendable. . .
