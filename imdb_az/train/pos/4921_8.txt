Desire in the streets (also directed by Gadg on the stage and on the screen) The panic in the streets describes a New Orleans where Jazz's birthplace is the main claim of glory. It was the seventh film by Richard Widmer, and it was a long way to build it, not just a psychotic killer, but a really good player. Gadg himself plays a minor role as a morgue worker, but the film is rich in talents that begin with Jack Palance (still being billed as Walter Jack Palance). Local "Greater" side-impact Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emil Meyer, Tommy Rettig and Poly Douglas, rock massive health care as they touch Widmark's point of view. Unfortunately, it's a little-known movie. Keep it when possible.
