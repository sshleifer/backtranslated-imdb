I came in the middle of this movie so I had no idea of ​​any credit or title until I looked at where I saw the mixed admission of your reviewers. I'm on the positive side of this movie, but one thing I really enjoyed while watching it is a beautiful and sensitive version written in a Coplandesque Americana style. I think it was written by no one except John Williams. True, he writes sensitive and tough scores as Schindler's list, but one is usually associated with accidents like Star Wars. But in my opinion, Williams overcomes all that I hear about sensitivity, sensitivity and beauty, according to the movie's tender and favorite. Another recent account, Catch Me, you can do, still show more elegance and sophistication. As for Stenli and Iris, I like educational films like Green Wright and Konrack, John Voigt and South Carolina's young African-American accusations, Danny deVito Renaissance Man, and others. I met you. They are a story that can not be explained sufficiently, often intellectually and morally awakening. This is a wonderful addition to this genre.
