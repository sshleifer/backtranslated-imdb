This movie has already been said so much and I would like to join its praisers. Drama, comedy, gangster movie is a very unique film that uses elements of different genres without combining them. Points only laugh out loud, and at other points you feel the characters following the mistakes and failures. Sabu's genius can be shown in sequence of films. First, where every three people meet each other, there is a desire for an erotic day, when a young woman passes by on the street. It is beautifully prepared in this sequence and very well describes the characters of all three competitors. At the same time erotic and funny. Sabu's genius is part of the film, where the racers are tired. The first of them, the typical loser between the three boys, sees the woman again and again, sees her dancing with her and dancing with her in the next gesture. All the sailors have come to this point that they have something to come back or go back again. In a part of the film, they stop persecuting each other, only heroism. Here is the beauty and excitement of life that Sabun has shown in the film. Her heroes are unsuccessful (after all, do they exist?), But does not destroy their dignity. Sabu claims to be a genius Monday and Postman Blues. Look at them! <br /> <br />
