Sudden Effects are two reminder. Harry is targeted by a gang who wants to kill him, and Harry is going back to his good fortune and happy to see how it is done. This little war puts Harry into an unsettling, but goes on a little break. Now the second part of the story. He kills some punks and Harry is dragged to this paradise. She meets a woman with a secret that Jennifer Spencer wants to be quiet in a small tourist city. Police Chief is a subtle man and warns Harry not to be involved or to avoid any problems. This is followed by Harry Callahan Trouble. The Mob finds the way to this city, and hell opens as Harry fights. Meanwhile, the vigilante is hitting again and the network looks like it is figured out. Jennifer Spencer was captured and Harry came to the rescue during the film's peak. The immediate impact is not Harry's greatest Dirty Harry, but then gives us a Harry, who has many heroes ready to go to war to continue justice. Again, it is not the most beneficial, but the most memorable one. Go forward in the future.
