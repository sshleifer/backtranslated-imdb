When I see this movie about 7 years old I remember; and then he shocked me. I had seen a violent film before, but I did not see any movie with the results and reality of violence. This film shows only that, and it also shows how people can change their lives and choose the happiness. What did this movie do and the accident did not succeed. Crash tried to show how bad the racism was (and Crash was really a domestic anti-Asian approach) and come up with it's moral superior position. Grand Canyon has come to a higher place than actually crash that has come up with such a raw and realistic thing. Especially when comparing the ends. The end of the accident is what makes everything look like. Though you know that the Great Canyon ends with a quiet note, but you know that nothing can change in the life of the character, life still continues, there is no proper end. No matter how good it is ... you get frustrated. One chapter does not end with another.
