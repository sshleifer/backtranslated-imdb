At the time I wrote, I saw over 15,000 votes, with a rating of 5.8. Something's wrong with this image. Personally, I give it 10. If I rated this movie really well by people who see it, I can see the lowest or possible 8 to 7. A movie based on a comic book hero. This movie won more prizes. 3 Oscars won. Another 5 wins and 26 candidates .... right out there saying that it's better than 5.8. Some good actors, some great special effects, and in my opinion, will not be classic for the coming years. If you are looking for a clean entertainment, review Dick Tracy. A movie that can watch a few more times. Al Pacino Big Boy is as big as Caprice.
