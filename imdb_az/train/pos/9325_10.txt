<br /> <br /> This movie is available for Netflix and I thought I would give it a try. <br /> <br /> Plan, Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt). their ancestors died. Ryan and Teo first claimed who was what. But then, Theo dies only from a terminal illness, but his brother Ryan is not only gay. So Ryan and Teo spend their time trying to correct their differences. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing movie. I just saw Colm Feore on the 7th of the 24th season, but it was extraordinary. David Cubitt, a player I had previously heard, made a phenomenal job. <br /> I advise those interested in Gay and Lesbian genres. <br /> <br /> This film is given to 10 children from 10 films. Excellent movie!
