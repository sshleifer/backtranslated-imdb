I went to this movie without knowing anything about this movie and it really was a pleasure. It was not true and convincing - Some of the heroes' words and what they did were completely odd, and many scriptures were just as usual (maybe this is typical of Woody Allen?) It did not even hit the movie, not the jokes in the movie, He was trying to laugh at his jokes here - it's fragile, but if you do not take the movie seriously, it's not CHARACTERS OF THE ACTORS, but if you're looking for a casual movie, and I love Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
