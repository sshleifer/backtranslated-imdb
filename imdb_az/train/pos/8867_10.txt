I am sure that at least Cosby's first season is broadcasted on the DVD one day. The episode is a classic festivity with Hilton's excentric genius George (played by late Roscoe Lee Browne). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cosby and Mrs. Rashad have been in chemistry for many years at Cosby Show brightly rolled back and shows the dimensions that they can take as artists to put them in a more moderate role. <br /> <br /> The list of comedy dynamics ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Cosby ... classic genius!
