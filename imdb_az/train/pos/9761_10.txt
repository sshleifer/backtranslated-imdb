Now I have a flat movie from my childhood, my family is banded; but it has been found and disappeared over such years. Now I'm lucky to watch the whole movie on youtube.com; When I watched this beautiful movie as a kid, I liked it and I'm still doing it after watching again. My most favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (always remember the sweet song always). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when some of the animations began to look at the opening credits that started in the 1930s (like WOW !, 47 years).
