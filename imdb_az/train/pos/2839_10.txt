<br /> <br /> In the movie I Love You, I saw this movie in advance and found it perfectly. <br /> <br /> I love New York, exploring intelligent, funny, and sometimes shocking situations around the strongest human race. <br /> <br /> The cast is really great, with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> Brett Rattner, Shocking Capture, Natalie Portman, I want to say this romantic and funny, but this is not a romantic romantic comedy Also, there are serious stories and notes, but in my opinion this is good, see for yourself and respond, and I want to hear what others have said.
