When Midnight Cowboy was released in 1969, he created a bigger rage in rating X. According to today's standards, it would be difficult to draw R rating. Better, John Voight, as Joe Buck, has entered the edge of a city that wants to have a great place with women in New York City. Responding to a street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to accompany Buck for their own purposes. In both cases, it creates both touches and a pitiful constellation. Dustin Hoffman just like Ratso. Hoffman is often brighter, but it's never more of a depiction. He has the character as it is comparable to all those around him. Granting Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most groundless decisions made by the Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Sciences. The director, Schlessinger, has a hand in his hand, but this film has a terrible underbelly that creates a bad taste in the trap. We only see Hoffman's performance.
