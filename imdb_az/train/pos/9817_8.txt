I remember this movie. Extremely close to 11 years. Good regulation, I felt terrible for Bernard. If it had been spread again, I would have watched it again, but when I wrote, the signal went to Pluto. Robert Culp. Highlight his career. I am very glad that I did not live in this neighborhood. Oh, 70. It's a decade. I would like to correct it, it will be very severe and bloody. What are they waiting for? A perfect movie for pre-drug suburban children. It was very tight. I think it's been shot in Los Angeles. Of course, Lodi was not in NJ. The film shot by St Bernard was one of the most unhappy scenes from the best and most obvious film ... and then dropped it on the stoop. Rotten children.
