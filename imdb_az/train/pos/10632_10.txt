A movie for fun; I did not think of giving public commentary on a small movie in the world. Personally I find this movie funny, courageous and memorable. Unlike a girl who resembles a prince, she is not a fantasy. I can add this movie during the best experiments in the film to celebrate the gender of a person in 70. This film is not a homosexual or non-human, but about love, all these are strange forms. This film shows some of the reality of being gay in the 70s or California of Hollywood. Pretty boys are not older, but are looked after by very nice men. Women who have to lock deeply into the emotional closet or the risk that they have not had a career. Shower communities were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then the fantasy begins! Let's mix a lesbian with a gay and add a drink and what's up? Well, that movie, in any way, is better than this frustration, "The Next Big Thing." Probably someone should ask the crew to see this movie and then try to work better. <br /> <br /> When I saw it in the 1970s, I enjoyed this movie and still brings a smile to my lips. I give heartfelt advice to anyone who wants a strange, tender movie - have fun with some popcorn and have some fun. Need to illuminate some people! <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
