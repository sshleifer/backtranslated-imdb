There is a great many illnesses in the minds of a person who has been given life in modern times. Persistent sensitivity or information in the pistachio area has kept psychologists, consultants and psychiatrists dealing with decades of work. Sometimes some of these mental phenomena are discovered by people who have no knowledge of their protection or existence. This film is titled "Night Listner". This is the story of Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), a well-known radio subscriber who betrays his watchful experiences with his live life stories about his gay life. Perhaps his show is the loss of his original cover, which has led him to admit that he is not himself. Feeling abandoned by his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), she is looking for a deep despair and isolation shelter. Here a mysterious voice at night asked for help. Noon should feel useful and reach the hopeless voice of a 14-year-old boy called Peter (Rory Culkin). When he read his son's early life and sexual harassment by the signs of his brutal parents, Noon rebuked him and wanted to help. But things are invisible, and Noon is soon embraced by a difficult and strange tale that has collapsed from a medical nightmare. This movie is not for purely Robin Williams and Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh is not for Tony Collette playing Anna and John Cullum, it can be funny. Instead, it can be one of William's more serious appearances. ***
