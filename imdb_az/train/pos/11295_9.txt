This movie has been my favorite since we first saw it as a 12-year-old boy after seeing the film in 1962 in the "Los Angeles" television station's "late show". The heroes are very attractive from the beginning of the picture and the film is never for video cassette, nor is it shown on television (probably Moss Hart's property, the producer of the story of a dramatist and for the first time a producer / director who presents on the New York stage during World War II - it is difficult to conquer more than 50 years). When I was a big cast member of the movie, I did not see a movie for over 30 years when I could get a "fake" copy of VHS (bad video quality, but good sound). My memo was correct: it was still an attractive and exciting movie to watch. An incredible feature of this film is only part of the stars that began in 1944 in their career), or turned into big movie stars or at least renowned and fully functioning actors (eg Judy Holliday, Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy, and Gary Merrill, Don Taylor, Carl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George Superman. The scenes with B-24 Libraries are terrifying, especially with giant details (in this period) close-ups of four engine bombs (18,000+ produced, now nearly depleted) details. Different levels of training were put in place for a pilot-cadet bombardment group (of course, gender is as indispensable as the day-to-day trend: only MEN is a pilot, women are supported only in their roles - today's world can not be hardly accepted). I hope one day will be available for the new generation to enjoy.
