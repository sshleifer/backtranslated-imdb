Recap: Getting married to Zandalee Thierry is a young woman who feels more trapped. Thierry himself struggles with his father's death in the previous year and has lost his way. He put himself in work, wrote what he wrote, and Zandalee missed their charm. This is Johnny and Thierry's old friend, once exiled in exile. But Johnny kept painting and just got hired for the day. He takes it when it comes to the day and tomorrow gives it its destiny. Zandale and Johnny have a good charm and they come into a job. But Zandalee struggles with her desires and conscience and her love for her husband. But none of them can stop the relationship between them, not Johnny and Thierry, rather than Zandalee. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is defined as a tension. But maybe a heart strain than a normal tension in life and death and the threat of violence. The heart could not get a thrilling fatal proportion, but the danger comes from a different angle. I can not describe it as a genre, though it is up to the second half of the Zandale and even though it really is in the first half. A romantic drama is more than just a few other currents under other genres. There is a growing tension, but it's also a bit of a sensual erotic species. This is because all these are the heroes and therefore the whole story. I want. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is pretty good, it's definitely better than its (4.1) rating. It takes time, but improves a sense of good feelings and manages the erotic part with taste. It was always an integral part of the story, it was necessary to be there to give the story of its weight, and I felt it was a pretext to show a naked breast or something. But, unfortunately, the narrative of the story comes well before the end, and the latter itself is dramatic, though it feels flat. <br /> <br /> Well known actors like Nicholas Cage and Hakim Reinhold. But the show was almost totally stolen by Erika Anderson. Sometimes, when he performs his delicate emotions beautifully and very competently, the advantages are both Cage and Reinhold, sometimes on a boat and a little rough. Later, his career is very subtle for the abilities we have shown in Zandalee, and I can only hope for my choices. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies look like Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantolian. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie when you're in good mood. <br /> <br /> 7/10
