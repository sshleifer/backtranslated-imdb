This movie is one of my favorites. Why it is difficult to explain. Perhaps Corin Nemecin's innocence and his carelessness are associated with Cheryl Pollak's courage, but this is definitely related to sound. Also, some characters have few lines or movements or moments that are entertaining. Finally, the story is always in my heart, and the last scene is bittersweet. I love all this movie; perfect for a gooey, sentimental girls night.
