Good show. <br /> <br /> The basic foundation is a crossroads of humanity. There are some moral dilemmas encountered. People have made some technological advancements, but are quite competent to deal with new toys? In a virtual world there is moral sediment. There are religious fanatics ready to kill for attention. I predict that the Cylons will be a matter with slavery (based on BSG background). At the same time, there are other problems that bring ourselves to us. <br /> <br /> This show is not BSG - at least humanity has finally prepared themselves. <br /> <br /> Not so many episodes I have seen so far, at least there are very good stories, characters and themes. Also, actors have good performances. They can build a culture similar to a modern society, but at the same time foreigners are absolutely convinced. Like the BSG, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potentials and flaws. It may seem a little surprising that human society in a different world has tie, chariots and chickens. But these things are more than anything else to create a half-lying background. Anyone participating in these details really does not lose the point. Whether it's a mafia-style culture or a rich and high-tech culture, people and human nature are far different from what we've seen around the world today in the high-tech world 150,000 years ago. I'm curious if writers try to tell us something.
