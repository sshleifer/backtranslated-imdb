Gundam Wing is an entertaining show. I usually value it to get Gundam and anime. However, after watching Mobile Suits Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I find Wing to be Gundam Lite. Characters: A long-lasting look from Gundam is a challenge and a challenge. It does not happen in Wing. Heero is the best dog at the beginning and the best dog in the end. Men do not change, growth does not happen. The best character, Zechs, who is a hero in most of the series for all intentions and goals. However, he suddenly betrays him and makes him an unjustifiable murderer. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has suit designs. Gundam is super cool with Epion I'm my favorite. I even want to share some of my OZ costume designs with classic Zeon suits. Conclusion: In the end, Wing has been beaten by recurring animation, but there are areas of dry battlefields, but thanks to the development of plot and character. Happy, but does not act like the previous Gundam trips.
