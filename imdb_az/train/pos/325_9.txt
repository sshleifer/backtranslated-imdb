This is a great movie - esp, compared to the sometimes awesome insomnia of today's politically-minded movie artists. Today, a film that can easily combine sex, sex, politics and art is rare. While the bouillon optimism can not be restored in the 1960s, we think at least we can learn a movie cool energy and a seductive lesson. I did not know what watchers were watching for "dull" audiences - there are many things that are not in the same movie for 15 minutes.
