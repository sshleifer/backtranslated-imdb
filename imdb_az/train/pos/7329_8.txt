I really enjoyed this movie. Humor sometimes did not exist, but I was delighted with the story's dramatic and serious passage. Verdone (the other "Un sacco bello") was the only second movie I saw and I can see what the Italians find her tiring, but she thinks she played a role as a loving father <br /> <br /> It was a negative feature with this movie, I knew it was happening in Italy - somewhere in the center or south, I suppose that it was not a place to be represented. If this film was in New York City, Boston, Melbourne, New Delhi ... It is important that you always have a place to give movies related to audience. (Maybe I did not leave anything?) :) If you like Italian movies, I like it, I love it. It's not Fellini or Rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism. This is really a funny story, with serious moments that can happen to any of us.
