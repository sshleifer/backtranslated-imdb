I am very excited that Lee Radziwill, the sister of Jackie Kennedy and the uncle of these women, will be the subject of the film "Big Edie" and "Little Edie". Without a doubt, they can be considered "skeletons" in the family cabinet. Many of the extra features on the DVD include some of the latest fashion designers' credits for those oddball women. Anyone interested in fashion would say that these designers could find interesting discussions. (ie, "Are they doing nuts or missing something?"). It's hard to come to this movie. Netflix does not do this. Even though facets.
