This is a fun, somewhat horrible escape / comedy with Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: He is the most horrific horror of all time, the Dark Mistress. It was a pilot for Elvira and succeeded by the NBC Network. They pulled a pilot movie for a television series busty babe babe black, but unfortunately sit-com never passed the pilot stage due to its sexual references. But this movie is very interesting. Elvira is a modern Chesty Morgan and a linen queen. This film was followed by horrific "Elvira's Haunted Hills", which led to the filming of former Roger Corman films a few years later, but fell flat on his face. Follow this movie for a fun experience instead!
