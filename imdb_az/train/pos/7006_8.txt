Ben Smith, full of a mystery, is looking to buy a radical change in the lives of seven people she does not know. Nothing can stop him after putting his plan. At least he thinks. But I did not plan to fall in love with one of these people, and it would end it. Will Smith returned to life with the director, Gabriele Muccino, after the "Inspiration of Happiness" inspired by life. The "Seven Pounds" are still tricks, recalling their previous collaboration, and eventually altering another life-story experience that inspires you joyfully. Will Smith is also a re-producer with some others. These films are very realistic, reflecting the struggle of a common man and his life. The Seven Pounds took some time to win the real momentum, but after half an hour of the movie, it was put together to control the heart of the movie. Also, there are a few pieces that rotate around this movie, which continues to predict the audience. The author, Gabriele Muccino, once again won a sensational, inspiring message. It really realizes all the characters in the film, and people will actually find themselves in a movie. Along with the director, Will Smith is another winner with a superb player ability. Once again, the director's duet and actor act as a glamor. There are also other talented actors who feel very well in the film. Rosario Dawson, brain beauty, it can also be called. He looks beautiful and makes his part very good. Barry Pepper gives great support to the film, and Woody did not do much of the screen (though it would be better), though Woody Harrelson did the same thing. You will not forget this movie easily. Follow this movie and change your life. Top class movie!
