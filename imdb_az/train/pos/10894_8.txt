I had some speculation about this film, I thought it would be the usual bill of the breaks - a movie about Christmas. <br /> <br /> Although we were in the middle of the heat wave at the end of June, we decided to give a shot at any time, and maybe we'll see a snow. <br /> This movie was funny after each other. Ben Affleck believed in his character, but this was a real star, James Gandofini. <br /> <br /> If you want something unpleasant for a couple of hours, check it out.
