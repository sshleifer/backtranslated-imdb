I love this witness and very frankly I also found Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be foolish and holy-sweet. Angela Lansbury plays her character perfectly and I do not think people are distorting this movie. It was magic and very entertaining to watch. Each scene had a definite attraction because you know the characters well. You see, though, that despite the age and differences of this small family, you learn to interact with one another. I thought the heroes were well developed, especially Charles was "Unbelievers." Mary Poppins may be more popular than others, but this little gem, I always love and give.
