I still find "crazy" to be "cunningly fun" for those who lived in the '60s, the early 70s. <br /> <br /> My 15-year-old daughter is watching DVDs with me every single time (do not worry, it is only three times) and she likes it. <br /> <br /> This is really a loving, sad-nosed, and every actor delivers his notes perfectly. This was my first acquaintance with Bill Nighi, and I'm glad he was paying more attention to him in a series called "Love in fact". Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, and his real life could be the caricature of rocker stereotype that damaged the drug. <br /> <br /> <strong> Robinson was interested in seeing as a writer put a good name for himself. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and saw the movie I shot for Billy Connolly for the first time. the local mall (then lived here) and said that all of the time was one of my five favorite movies. He invited me to sit with me and discussed the film for a while. We even talked about an American-oriented remake before deliberately denied it. <br /> <br /> My problem with Still Crazy is not very popular in theaters, and many people do not leave a good experience.
