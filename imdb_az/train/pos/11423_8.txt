This film shows the life of the Frenchman Dalens, one of the few white families around Cameroon, a young French girl's perspective, a representative of the French colonial government. It gives a sense of life to the colonists as well as to the indigenous people who are associated with them. This is in a sense, but there is no way to know how realistic or typical it is in a sense, but another movie I've seen in Africa at a similar time (Nirgendwo in Africa (2001)). It's not just an impression - what happens in the movie - but the plot is simple. The viewer, as seen by women in Cameroon's South Caucasus, is an imagination of the story, as long as it is seen as an adult, but remains to be more effective than the directors themselves.
