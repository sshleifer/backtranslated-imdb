Perhaps it is hard to believe, but this film was condemned as more immoral immorality than any film produced before the bluenosis Hayes Code was introduced. Yes, indeed, the herd of flock said that everyone who went to see this movie was committing a fatal sin. <br /> <br /> I did not do that. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> He and Tarzan awoke in their own treetop shelters one morning. He stretches sensibly and looks stunningly, "Tarzan, you're a bad guy!" He says. Thus, they were not only sexually assaulted, they were strangely sexually active! A few years later, according to the Hays Code, people (especially women) should not be described as sexual pleasure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Holt can wear a very beautiful dress from London, which lasts a little longer; When Holt tries to kill Tarzan, Holt and Jane believe that he is still dead, and he waves with a lot of things. But when he realizes that he is very alive, the appeal of civilization pushes him. Why not? Tarzan and Jane are equally concerned: he does not have "cultural" security that will force him to prove himself as "the head of his wife." To divorce, he deprives many more of a "cultural" blow, such as jealousy. Regarding Holt and his friend, Tarzan welcomes Holt to know that Jane is an old flame, and she sincerely greets her. When Holt sits in London with a dress and slowly dancing with a phonogram, Tarzan comes out of a tree and pulls his knife. Jealous? Nope. He's just a strange music car, because he's never been seen before. <br /> <br /> Holistic civilization is a dirty idea. Savage Tarzan is innocent sexual. As Jane entered the Holt's lamp tent, Holt began to watch his silhouette when she turned her imaginary dress. Tarzan, of course, throws his clothes on the shoulder, throws it into the swimming pit and begins to dive in it, watching the most delightful erotic naked scene in all cinemas: a pair spends five minutes in a beautiful ballet. In three versions - dressed, topless and lamp - the scene was cut off before the movie was filmed, but the bare version is already restored to the video.) When Jane comes out and Cheetah chimpanzee teases her just for her, Jane teases her only "cultural" men and their hangups is not clear. Where is the "universal festival" that is so dear to the hearts of the workshop's? Nowhere. One reason for the link was that this film was offensive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Holt and his friend want to lead the elephant cemetery, so they collect ivory and take them home. Tarzan wants to turn them into a cemetery. You, the reader, "Fat chance!" and you are right. She was shocked. He said, "Elephants dream!" He says. tells him everything. Jane explains the feelings of Tarzan as a "gentleman". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Holt and his friend are hitting him and surrounded by hostile tribes and wild animals. Jane, who keeps her cool. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> Finally, a few men complained of clothes, because the film had many shots. Not Tarzan and his wife, but Tarzan and his wife. No comments! <br /> Of course, Tarzan, who returned to his health by the monkeys, went to the rescue, white hunters, and stole the elephant claws and African carriers from the place where he came to the sacred place. The last one. <br /> <br /> So it's there. Completely destructive film. All other films about complex and fascinating women (see, together with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey), who made this kind of genre at the beginning of the 1930s, and even ended up with the adoption of the Hays Code. <br /> <br /> The heroine of this film is best described by the soprano version of the best Janza's famous Tarzan octa. <br /> <br /> Come hear, artistic freedom, feminist jane, and sex.
