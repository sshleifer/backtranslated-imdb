Why do some people love this movie and why some people do not know it? Although I see some of the best bits and very impressive bits, it's great for me. The animation was really excellent as Charlie's dream. The heroes were a mixed bag of the best Anne-Marie, called by the late Judith Barsy (when I read what I was physically ill). Carface is also a very convincing villain, particularly sounded by the beautiful Vic Tayback. (I especially love "Cover with Morons Morons") and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat, it's probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth traitors. Charlie and Itchy did not just have the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some of the film is horrible as Annabelle says, "You can never go back, it's still scary. Unfortunately I did not like some bits. The story had to be calm and desperate, but Disney's Black Soul suffered from the same problem. There were also some dark scenes that young children would face, but the latter was very tough. But the biggest flaw was a very bland song, and they sang. Especially none except "Let's Talk" and "Love Shields", Burt Reynolds sings songs and sings better than Dom DeLuise. All of this is a movie that is more likely to be watched, but it is definitely memorable and I would definitely watch it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
