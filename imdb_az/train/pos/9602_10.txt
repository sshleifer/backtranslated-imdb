Darius Goes West is a film that reflects America's belief that if you work hard enough, everything is possible. This beautiful, fun and sometimes heartwarming film does not see any young man expected but wants to see what his beloved city is on the edge of Athens. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His long-time friend, Logan, Ben, and a few other friends decided to make Darius' dream come true. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Darius in Darius have started an email campaign to bring Darius into the situation of Ben & Logan's mother, Darius, not just to see the ocean but also to earn money to see this great United States of America. It would be an understatement which means successful young college friends to bring hope and awareness to the terrible illness. They saw Darius' dream and then part of it. Seeing how Darius could help Darius demonstrate his love, care and entertaining entertainments, he waited for his life to see how DMD patients could have the same characteristics. Darius volunteered for the Red Cross - he sat in his caf√© and collected money outside a local grocery store (with his wife). His beautiful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all of your needs are a group of hope and support for your colleagues. Give Darius and all the children an Oscar - no one deserves more.
