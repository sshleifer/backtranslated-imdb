This is one of the best films I have ever seen - everything is - a really touching scenario, a subtle fine art to watch a delicate piece of art, genuine elegant romance (a kind of romantic look that does not exist anymore), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially song), artistic honey and suits, and sets that you want to live in. It was a lasting disappointment that I expected a magnificent film to end in a brilliant fashion, but most of the films were beautiful there. Do not hesitate to check this movie again and again. For the first time you deserve the second time, there are many details you miss.
