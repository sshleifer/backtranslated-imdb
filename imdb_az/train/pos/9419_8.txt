Alec Guinness's starring is a very good entertaining political line of corporate industry, also a light eccentric character. <br /> <br /> Pacing is a bit slow for a comedy, and perhaps the fun type of place, except for sound effects for experiments. However, he has fun moments and it is very sensitive to his performance. The big bang part is probably the most distinctive element. <br /> <br /> The Union procedures are pretty tangled, and I remember very well; especially the female socialist, has a romantic shaking on the character of Guinness. Political logic is actually a story. <br /> <br /> <strong> Ernest Thesigner is very prominent in a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> I do not think that LADYKILLER, or MY PEOPLE, as well as the Hearts and the Corners, but even the Ealing comedy is nothing better than anything else.
