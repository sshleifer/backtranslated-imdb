My choice for the biggest film is nevertheless superior to the Canon used to be Laughton's "Hunter's Night". But it can be postponed by the "Shower" which is the most artistic Daoist movie I've ever seen. Care for others, with the flow of water, inspiration, comfort and cleaning of water, etc. The way to show it is Dao's essence. It is possible to claim that NOFTH and Shower are similar, and Lillian Gish represents the cleanest form of Christianity because the bearer operators represent the purest form of Daoism. I will not argue against such a statement in any way. Both films are a joy to see in the integration of ideas and images. However, Shower offers a unique look that resembles the holiness of daily life. I also respect.
