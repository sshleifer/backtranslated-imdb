Claire Denis's Chocolat is a nice but frustrating movie. The film provides an entertaining perspective on many characters and their interaction, giving a very interesting look at the home of a European colonial family living in Cameroon. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient. For example, the main theme of the story is that France is unable to establish close contact with others. Since these drawings, especially with Denise's framing of France's return to childhood home, the fact that the film is not close to other symbols makes it difficult for the viewer to be interested in his development (though or not) as a hero. The overall intolerance of the characteristic development of the film makes it difficult to turn into a concession area. The film creates tremendous tension between Aimee and her husband, but it's never been a complete solution to social frustration that does not please the audience. The last few scenes are powerful, but painful. Denis's work is of course intellectual and historical, but Chocolat is definitely the best choice if you're looking for a movie with an adventure or drama.
