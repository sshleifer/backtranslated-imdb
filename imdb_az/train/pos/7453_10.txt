I have always been a great James Bond fanatic! I saw almost all films except one day, and the world is not enough. The graph does not breathe anything or anything! Sound Talents ......... WOW! I love PIERCE BROSNAN! She finally Bond in a video game! He is BOND! I'm very pleased with the past Bond games: Goldeneye, The World is not enough, Agent is under fire and Nightfire. This is definitely good! Finally, Mr. Brosnan, can I declare her as a sign of respect? Yes! She was quite excited to hear the video game ....... LONG LAST !!! DUH! I saw him with Robin Williams, and I told you that they are a great team. Pierce Brosnan is funny, morally beautiful (I mean bad in a good way) and just one of the actors who want to walk around and hang up and cling to your weapons: "Pierce Brosnan, thank you James Bond," "If you had not been for James, I do not know who Bond is. "He's a great actor! I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoy, though I've seen it in several films. The role of Nikolai Diavalo was brilliant. (Did I type the character's name?) LOL !!!! He does a great job with emphasis. Sometimes I do not hear an emphasis. I saw Willem, I want to say, Mr. Dafoy is performing two films: Nemo and Spider-Man with my favorite actress: KIRSTEN DUNST! SHE ROCKS! In any case, he will never be surprised. And Richard Kiel, wow, he's definitely Jaw's nailed part. I saw him in the movie and he was awesome! In fact, I met my father, Mr. Kiel, and became jealous when he said to me. However, Kirsten Dunst is on the list of Celebritie who you want to meet me. John Cleese was breathing. I have never seen a human device that's a better person's mind-set and Q! Mr. Cleese was hilarious! I saw her work with Pierce Brosnan and Tommorow Never Dies in Goldeneye. It's awesome! John Cleese's latest project, Mike Myer, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew and Eddie Murphy, are Shrek 2. (Shrek 2 in the theater!) BEST LUCK 007! Oh, yes, as Q Alwayin says: "007 grow!"
