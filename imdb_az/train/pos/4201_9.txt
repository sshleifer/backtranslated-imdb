Pickup on the South Street (1953) contains a striking opening, directed by Samuel Fuller, who created a double complication. Subway driver Candy (Susan Peters) fights with Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark is immersed in the shadows of Sinatra's cold). It carries a valuable microfilm. McCoy is unaware of gripping. Both are unaware of the observation by two federal agents. Thus, grift determines the level of motion to a certain degree. Candy is watching twice (Skip and Police) and therefore double naive; Skip, the extremely sensitive small thief is not something that is not attracted by federal agents; Sirs, all who know it are ultimately desperate. They can not stop government secrets or "passage" of communism.
