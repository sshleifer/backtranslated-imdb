I liked this movie very much because in my opinion, the French colonies resembled what I imagined in Africa in the '50s ("my"). But I was really attracted by the rapid and famous ending of my calmness. In the last 5 minutes of this movie you have to pay close attention to what happened. I was not even more impressed with the "wrapping" of a movie. I do not remember "Wow!" I realized that it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the sofa!
