It was a good movie, which was generally the ideal end; the actor was awesome and the characters did not move away from their own people. Especially, I liked the scenario, but when you know what's happening, they still gave a surprise element through the entire movie. But I understand that it could have been a little longer (perhaps extending it) - it seemed to me that she had fled somewhat; The printer tried to draw lines before the rain fell. For example - what happened to Tristan's brother Hayden? We all know that he died in hospital. Maybe he was a man who built everything? Who knows! Maybe it will be a continuation? Can be? If you have .. can not wait to see.
