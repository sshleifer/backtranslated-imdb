"Entering Fat Dragon" is one of the most martial arts films I have the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung is a Chinese farm boy portrait that comes to visit a city friend. Like Tang Lung "Dragon is on its way." Sammo goes everywhere, difficulty begins, so it must rely on its martial arts skills to solve differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character, by imitating and imitating his idol, is learning martial arts, Bruce Lee. Even his nose is hit by Bruce Lee's head, and he is shocked. Uses nunchucks at a scene. An oil was like watching Bruce Lee. There is a big showdown near the end of the film, which is made up of foreign fighters. Sammo will hold each opponent one by one. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite films, and I'm the first Sammo Hung movie. " The Death Game "is a place where every warrior has a different martial arts discipline, and I've seen great fighting scenes and lots of laughter A rare classic Sammo Hung movie is too high for all supporters of the martial arts 8.5 / 10 !!
