I watched this last night with little expectations. The reason for this is that I do not like movies that are usually "made for TV", and I rarely liked the movie "merging". However, the critic in Los Angeles Times seemed similar, so he gave a chance. I was happy. It was very good. Adam West and Burt Ward merged themselves. But Batman and Robin behaved as themselves. They do not accept themselves, or they are very serious about this film. The film was called by George Barris, named Batmobile, before it was stolen from someone else's house. They are looking for a car, they remember about their series together. It's called flashback. Good work has been done. Young actors Burt Ward and Adam West have died. And for a television movie, he was fired on the screen and their true behavior. I give it a 9/10, I liked it very much.
