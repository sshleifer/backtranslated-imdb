This is one of Shelley Duvall's high-profile "Faerie Tale Theater" series. Ugly steps are a great quality comedy aid, and Eve Arden is a portrayal of a bad-looking mother. Jennifer Beals, in particular, with Matthew Broderick's Prince Charming, works perfectly at Cinderella's garden scene. Jean Stapleton, the god of fairy tales plays well, though I liked some lines with the "Southern Lifestyle" character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> As older people are older than 15 years old and older. The show runs well with a few small bumps and they then live happily ever after. Children under the age of 8 will continue to watch it after the parents are finally tired - I've found 3 times less than a day.
