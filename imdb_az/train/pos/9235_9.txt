Flavia Heretis is an unquestionable artworks and is probably the number one recommendation that the euro-abuse cinema should not be seriously evaluated and ignored. Is this a beautiful and intelligent and complex film? surprise pretty damn exact! This is more than just a frivolous sleaze or unequal violence, and it's time for these rough movie committees to think about it, which classifies Flavia as a banned trash. Flavia was a beautiful adolescent of the 14th century and forced a devout living in a solid temple. She refuses to accept her lower status because she is a woman, and she curses her brother because she is very tolerant on this subject. <br /> <br /> "Flavia" is a terrifying film of disappointment! Director Gianfranko Mingozzi was able to show such a realistic and disturbing thing. I challenge you to relate to a more intricate topic on pioneer-feminism than in Flavia. The camera, as opposed to cruel oppression, torture and ill-treatment, is quite shocking (in fact, at the edge of the skyscraper). All of this is not used to provide unobtrusive images. I believe that Flavia is part of a statement that it is trying to communicate: Humanity (especially the Catholic Church) has historically proven itself to be a hypocritical and discriminatory race and has nothing to do with denying it further. Movies such as "Flavia, Heretic" are brave enough to question our dear ancestors and openly punish them, and I am really amazed at it. Flavia was not a prominent and basic expedition film, but even more beautiful with a beautiful cinematography, glorious costume and decoration and Nicola Piovani's music. Florinda Bolkin is very convincing, as ambitious and hearty, but Maria Casares, who stole the show as sister Agata. He has a man-hate and loud voice who wants to make a void in the open field! Amen, my sister!
