American writer Edgar Allan Poe is approaching London by British journalist Alan Foster, who has become a target of a specific target. Believing Poe does not claim that all macabre stories are based on real-life experiences, and Foster agrees that Blackwood will not spend a whole night in a haunted castle and Poe, and his wife Sir Thomas Blackwood. After building on an abandoned castle, Foster sees that he is not alone, explaining that he is approaching by various beautiful women and beautiful men and accusing all the souls cursed by the metaphysical doctors to repeat their stories. anniversary of their death! For the first time, when I watched this glorious bit of classical horror, they were amazed at all times. The movie was really creepy and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undoubtedly beautiful. Music account atmosphere is twice inactivated. The top-notch scene drew me to a corner because I did not wait. Sinapse has done a great job with the filmmaking, because it's a damn wonder of its age and is the Uncut International version for boot. It is a film that is responsible for me from the collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
