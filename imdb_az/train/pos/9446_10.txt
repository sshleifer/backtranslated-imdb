James Dickey is a well-respected author. When someone says, "Save", they are immediately moved to the hillside of Paradise. How accurately describes the essence of the book while watching John Boorman's movie version of a book. The camera describes it as a story. These symbols are fully implemented and the illustrations are fantastic. For the first time I saw this movie in 1992 for the first time after college. In 1973, I entered a stage in which my birth was watching movies released for several years. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "All President's Men"; beautiful movies, all. This was easily the class of the group. She says a lot.
