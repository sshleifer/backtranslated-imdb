Some war movies succeed in places where others do not, and that can be measured in different ways. The very emotions (terrorist attacks, friendships among soldiers, difficult trials encountered in confrontation, etc.) Feelings of humanity have always been attractive to me. Movies like Stone Boot and A Midnight Clear are two examples of the movies you have linked to the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film also succeeds at this level. It talks about "the highest honor" and honors do something right. These 23 soldiers did something right, they were honored and recognized in a totally incompatible way of Western thought, but ultimately a true honor story. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story.
