I have not seen this movie but need it. <br /> <br /> The thesis that the Peruvians had moved to Polynesia is alive and well. I read the Thor Heyerdahl's three books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku). Considering that this squad is NO GPS and only a 6-watt old fashioned valve (tube) radio, their travels were heroic to say the least. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please describe the location of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in buying it.
