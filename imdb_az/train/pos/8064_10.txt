John Ford is one of the most influential and well-remembered American filmmakers in the history of the film, often associating his name with the Western film genre. In the early 1930s, he was an informant in 1935, fighting for Irish independence. <br /> <br /> In Ireland, it's often hard. Gypo Nolan was captured by a poverty and grayish - and the walls were closed. Gypo is great, but not the most striking lamp in the tree, there is a warm heart, there is a short fuse and never really thinking about things that are not all the way, not a crime or an arbitrary pig. While walking on the streets that do not run anywhere in life, the funny Gypo Nolan finds Mrs. Katie Maddeni in her life on the streets demanding her desperation, and only the US paid 20 manat for her. In case of chance, his friend Frankie comes back to the city at a price of 20 pounds and is hopeless enough to tell him where Gypo Frankie is. <br /> <br /> Gypo, earning 20 pounds of blood, finds this foggy night especially foggieri, and guilty is inflated on it and IRA spends all its resources to find Frankie's informant . <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen, Nolan and Best Actor Oscar on this film. His terrifying, stupid and tender bells give the character the character, and McLaglen is second to Arthur Bach's character, Dudley Moore's character as Arthur Bild's most entertaining movie drummer in 1981. Margot Grahame's performance as Katie Madden is also very good, but McLaglen and McLaglen are just the only members to be surprised. Preston Foster is particularly isolated from Ireland, not Irish, but JM Kerrigan is particularly limited to the film's only point of view because of its irritating role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some shadows by Ford's well-known westerners, such as those who frequently search or release Valance, The Informer is one of John Ford's best films easily - if not its the best. How long will the length of Oscar nominations and John Ford win? The Informer won four Oscars, including one for him in 1936 for Best Director. Ford and the company use shadows and light, especially in the film. story. Gypso's passing through the streets is explained by the apparent accusations of the gloomy state of the city and street lamps, each shadow of which always reminds its darkest act. It was nice to watch Ford's order of this technique; If the Informer is done 10 years later (such as genre requirements), it will never be accepted for the best films, but it will not prevent it from being remembered as a perfect classic film.
