"Unbelievable Grace" is so intolerable that it explains a modern story of different lives in the apartment building. The spoken language is Jewish, but drama can happen in any modern city. Family values, romantic attitudes and age group features are equally observed with aplomb. These symbols do not rule, just as the modern world tries to solve its individual problems, it offers them straight forward. The quality of the game is very good and the observations on the characters are subtle and sharp. I love this movie.
