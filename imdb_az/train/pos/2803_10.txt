As the world champion of Okinawan Karate 2 times in the past I love movies about the sacrifice for sports. But this movie is a lot more. This movie is very good and very deep. I recently suffered a very serious injury and a passion for passion. It immediately shines for me. And this foolish little movie reminded me of what life would be like, as in the excitement that gave me a deep touch. This is a film about life. Respect for yourself and your spouse. Strengthening. God, bless "Bend like Beckham" I think it is a real stone.
