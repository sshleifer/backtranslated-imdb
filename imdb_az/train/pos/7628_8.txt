This is the movie "WOW!" movies. Not the biggest movie of all time, but I was surprised. Not just a T.V movie, it was an elvis. I can say safely as many impersonators as I had only one Elvis, but I can also assure you that Kurt Russel's real thing came pretty close. This was one of the biggest impersonations I've ever seen. He really believed in me. I learned a lot about watching this movie about Elvis's life. And do not go to a part of the television, do not miss it - in fact a fantastic movie! And Kurt Russell could have been Elvis's twin :)
