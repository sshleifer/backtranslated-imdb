I have always been an admirer of the show, so I will admit that I am biased. At the end of the show, many questions remained unanswered. This movie felt like shutting down for me. It was extremely good to gather all the people I have pursued in the last few years. I thought it was probably only a Crime movie that could be expected. If so, this is a good way to get out. This movie is sometimes brutal, sometimes heartbreaking, but always happy. If you're an admirer of the show, watch this movie.
