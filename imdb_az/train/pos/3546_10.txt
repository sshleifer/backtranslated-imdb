One of the best musical compositions is an example of the fact that producers and directors are not afraid of choosing actors for their talents, rather than what people expect. The lighting and the set are unique, which has a very interesting effect (this is a special name I would not think). Dialogue is unique because no resistance is used. The film is well-paced, beautiful, and interesting, from the start to the end. FOLLOWERS are the true joy. A series of first-class songs performed perfectly from the start to the orchestra. And music is very original and very memorable, and I prefer music from the sixties since the 1930s. There is no doubt that there are more original and beautiful songs than most musical music, only two or three. It's not bad for the director who has no experience in this movie. Another quality is fresh whenever it sees it.
