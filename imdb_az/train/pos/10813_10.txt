I read that I stopped this work to see the amazing Ethel Waters I read in my biography. I'll admit that my jaw dropped when my pig chops and watermelon references started, but people can not look like a stereotypical or racist piece of this movie. It is a short film prepared by Gypsies, the entertainment industry was quite different, and the stereotypes for the people involved were old-fashioned inclinations of humor and humor. We do the same thing with contemporary black movies, but new trends (stereotypes), "ho" and "hood" and so on. Whom. If you look eighty years later, today's films will look like racist. What about watching this movie, Waters and the talented Sammy Davis Jr, its modern, Shirley Temple and the ability to look the same as the one you are doing adult. Everyone involved in this film has clearly turned this into a lot of fun. Why use it instead of what you think?
