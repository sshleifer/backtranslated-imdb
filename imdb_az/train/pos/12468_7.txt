Okay, this movie starts as an unpleasant lifestyle and does not get much better than the movie. The scenario is packed with 'cheese' and 'mosquitoes' and is not suitable for most layouts. For the first half of the film, the little girl called to my nerves. I do not think it's one of the best-performing jobs. The only reason I bought the movie was on sale and was in Ellen Burstyn. He is terrible, but this is not one of his best performing concerts. The story is based on real events and helps the film. Actually, I did not like the movie for the first time, and I was surprised to see the balloon's travels, and I'd say it's where to go and do it! But all of them are forgiven after reaching the goal, and the story is approaching. If it does not open your eyes, nothing will happen! It is cheese and predictable, but it also feels good on the world.
