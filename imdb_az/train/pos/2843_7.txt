If you're in mood for over an hour, this movie might make some changes to you. My favorite surprises. I just want one or more movies to go on 'I Love You in New York' once. <br /> <br /> Some short movies are of interest to you, some are short, some are longer, some have some end, and others do not. <br /> <br /> The majority of the story is the sad part of the capital. It shows the fund of many different nationalities. Many people feel the same way I go to the capital city in other countries once a year, from different countries. This movie explores a lot of things you know, but it's new to all the characters. Maybe some of them traveled abroad only to stay one or two times to feel new, to meet new people; dreamer, you feel sad, but saddened, because you are tired of being in your own home. I want to relax by looking at it again.
