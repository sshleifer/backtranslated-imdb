There is a very bad habit of being a Piromaniak of two different brothers who belong to an unusual and more entertaining person, and not just a "fireblock" (a thought of Stephen King's book) !! The good results (especially towards the end), from a talented player trio, and interesting results that start with a truly exciting and striking noise, ultimately make a unique treat to watch the movie "Wilder Napalm" ... this too! In a private note, I'm very lucky to grab him at my local video-rental store for $ 2,000 (I'll say it). (*** exit *****)
