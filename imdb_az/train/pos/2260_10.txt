A MORE GOOD MOVIE! One who seriously falsifies. The songs that children read in the movie gave me a sense of pain and gave hope to the future. Whoopi Goldberg is performing well here, but the actress who plays the best performance title throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I give it 10/10.
