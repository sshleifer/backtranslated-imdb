Any kind of miserable people who do everything they can to talk about, talk to, about the budget and the budget? If you've missed the edge of this beautiful movie, it's yours. Those who deeply love this movie do not pay attention to your ideas. I'm a thirty-year-old man who has seen thousands of films in my life and owns my book. This documentary film or the night had to be the actual account of the event. The most beautiful story of any attempt. I know that the 90s are in the 90's and the millennium is in a mixed, but come. Someone in this commentary complained that someone had earned a lot of money! How is it bare? He pulled out money in every civilized country in the world and became the planet's most successful film. Meanwhile, most of the surrounding people will face joy. Okay, madam, when you look at your rock, I'm done.
