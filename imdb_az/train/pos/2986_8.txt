I am very surprised to see a jerk who criticizes this old film. We usually do not win the best opera films, and here's a great opera. Obviously, the visuals are not great. It's dated. But the opera can not be defective; and I am an opera buff. You can not even detect a lip-sync; Nothing that sounds to me when we do not know it is not Sophia Loren. He is doing everything with longing! His dark make-up is good; and brought his life to a beautiful life! The rest are as beautiful as this beautiful ballet troupe. Most actors are perfect; Loren is really nice. His rival Amneris is terrific. This is a homeless person who ignores the 1953 case. Verdi liked it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi, like Aida, is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
