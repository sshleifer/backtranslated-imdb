Twelve years ago, the film "Hot Blooded" on the bone of the hero stopped. Now, several film pupils have decided to finish the film, despite the film's curse. <br /> <br /> When Scream was released, every country, even Australia, wanted to succeed. Today, the concept of death (slasher movie in slasher) was relatively cool and original. This film was featured in front of Urban Legends: Final Cut and Scream 3 (not in the US, but in Australia). This was the first film about the concept. When Urban Legends 2 was released, most of us were ready for all patients with the concept and the film was not even good, the film flopped catastrophically. Cut now is not the best slasher flick ever and does not try to be what it is. She knows that she is a sack, and even thrown a girl like the blonde version of Neve Campbell in the lead role. However, instead of adding some new and original folds, the story decided to break down slasher filters in the 80s, like the Nightmare Nightmare, and it really works. The killer is very creepy and mask is the only killer! Instead of keeping the spectators dead, we have created a very good and creepy atmosphere that protects us with the majority of the film. Although the film has not been able to see the end of the largest field hole, the film has several holes. Spoiler; I would like to say that they burned the only copy of the movie, and where did the Hellenists find the pressure on the stage? I have no meaning to say to you. Spoiler ends. In general, Cut does not nip a pretty creepy slasher with a ridiculous story but I think it's one of the better Scream rip-off that's never been bigger. I was surprised that this was not a continuation, but it was just too late. <br /> <br /> The silent Australian slasher fluttered with little fear. Cut is still a pretty neat movie and I have to recommend this one, though I think the story is terribly awkward, though I think the story is very clever.
