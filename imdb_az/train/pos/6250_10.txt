Not only by Seidl, but also by Spielmann and other filmmakers, there is something special about Austrian films. The film is angered by the reality that is never left out of the audience. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by the stories described, but also by the actors playing. At Hundstage I have never felt that these players are playing, but instead of real people. It is almost a visual sense of the audience ... The sensible retiree in the movie or your lady just lives below you in your block. <br /> <br /> Everyone living in Vienna can not be sure of a doubt. They recognize people in the movie with a Mexican / Sudern (plaintiff), secret sexual assault, and prolo mafia. It has been further strengthened by the Viennese dialect, which has been made to appeal to many as a lifestyle, in particular. A special parochialism and arrogance for Vienna is well described. <br /> <br /> In the suburbs of Vienna, where there is nothing, there is a living being in the film with unhappiness and insomnia. Moreover, they have become a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and large stores. Inbetween people, they believe, are the homes of the people involved, the happiest activities they try to communicate with, but in vain. <br /> <br /> An elderly woman is sexually explicit, aggressive, and the producer is losing her nerves, frustrating her girlfriend and her driver, and irritating the driver. <br /> <br /> No soundtrack focuses on the normal / abnormality of images. A typical feature of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) is the display of sexually explicit images. Among them are robbing an old woman for her husband, a sex scene in a hammam, a lady's sex game, two men in her apartment, and so on. Includes. <br /> <br /> Hundstage Seild describes his life as Paris, New York, or Vienna as may be the citizen of Madrid. Viewers should not feel sorry and regret for Vienna because they can be victims of alienation and alienation, even if they are in the same situation. In the end, Seidl's film warns us about the terrible state of the humane relationships that have emerged in Hundstage. Regardless of the reasons for this bad transformation, Seidl has achieved his goal.
