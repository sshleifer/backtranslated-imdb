This movie is one of the best B-films of the 90s. If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some kind of approach, a lot of laughter and an approaching approach between police officers and police, you have to watch it. Everyone can extend the scene, but this is really about the movie, and everyone is very funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to make a movie together.
