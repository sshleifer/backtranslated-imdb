I remember this series very well. It was perfect - so powerful and compelling characters, chic and sexy ... and unlike everything offered at that moment - and now ... I am convinced that Canada inspired the Canadian "Merchants" drama. <br /> <br /> Both of the season and season 2 have 2 UK DVDs. <br /> <br /> Season 13 shows 13 episodes and 10 episodes in season 2. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's over after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get it specifically on Amazon.com.
