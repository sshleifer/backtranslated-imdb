Some of the well-known Altman "masterpieces" are now gloomy for me. Maybe I am. Like the last reviewer, I love even the "little" Altman (I recently demonstrated at FMC), although it is aimed at a large audience. Organization policy such as "microcosm" for social campaigns. As part of this satirical "docudrama" is now watching the Tonight Show like Dick Cavett, I found it very funny and delicate (for example, "You're real, we're not threatening anyone"). The story is "not deep", but I liked it. And his performances are like a basket work, especially as Cavett ("himself"), Lauren Bacall, as a conservative personality as a left wing ideologist, about the holiness of Glenda Jackson (who is actually a member of Parliament) and Carol Burnett. Everything can be in the unmatched Altman style, though it may not be as inadequate. But it's pretty flawless.
