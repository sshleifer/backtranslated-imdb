Light Spoiler <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold, the man who was wrongly convicted as Ben Richards, forced the game 'The Running Man' to play. Deaths in the hands of Stalkers. Of course, people are ultimately planning to prove that the system is wrong at death and in Arnold. <br /> <br /> I have not read Stephen King's book, but this is a great movie, despite one of Arnold's best. . He is doing the best of his role as a human being, ensuring that death passes through an unforgettable liner. The classics, probably drowning a barbed wire, said, 'He was a real pain in his neck' and referring to what he saw in a vertical place in his chain, 'That was a shatter!' Dawson is extremely annoying as a television presenter and is a 'Stalkers' camp. The action is severe, but its action film. This point. It switches rapidly on the film and does not accept it within 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The previous film, starred by Starsky and Hutch by Paul Michael Glaser and after the success of the Terminator, was probably seen as a motionless act for Arnold and far away. But many today, many television viewers have seen how the film is approaching the reality. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that everyone who loves the 80 who works with me is Arnold, funny acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
