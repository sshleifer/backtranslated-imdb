Medium-sized siblings living in a joint venture with Green Gables Anne (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), on a farm in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island, help the orphanage boy in their farm. However, the orphan 14 was named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn, a veteran of Paris-Disney's "Alice" shorts, and later named after her character). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 in the source of Lucy Maude Montgomery, but the same actress did not come out of college during the story since the age of 11. The film complains little of this concession, as many of Anne's reactions and many feel that it is more entertaining than an adolescent. As in the book, Anne likes to be happy and quick to be satisfied with her name, structure, nudity and long red hair. However, being a child of a dream Anne is very happy in her life and is accustomed to the new family and environment of Princess Edward Island. <br /> In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Drama Queen" and the screenwriter of the film has been chosen to pay attention to this aspect of her character. The main tuxedos made a fun comedy from a fun family drama. A change that is pleasing to viewers and breaks the reader's purity. <br /> <br /> Because the comedy is in the spirit of Montgomery's story, I do not see any reason to resolve the issue, but it should serve as a fair warning to everyone who is completely loyal to adaptation. The comedy element is the power of the film because it is one of the most advanced self-reflection parodies of Hollywood conventions. Actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's all-time, and the film was black and white. Most of the fun is that the appearance of the hood and the color of the hair do not look as if it were on the screen. Mother regularly regulates melodramatic lines like no peasant peasant friends: "If you give up, you will be saddened for a lifetime." Perhaps the funniest moment when writing his class spelling in his class blackboard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Brown is doing a wonderful job, as Anne's love steals all the scenes of interest, like Gilbert Blythe and Cuthbert's sweet neighbor like Sarah Haden. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a kid.
