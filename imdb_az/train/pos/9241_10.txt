Hey people, what is it. This is my man, one and only Mike "Sonny Sakura Killer" Kelly. You know ........ You can not really write a script about the sakura script because we did not have one there. As we know, the story is becoming more and more up-to-date. In my life, I had the best time in this movie, and Jism ........... There was so much to escape from entertaining times. So, all of your movie was delighted. I did not really have the fights I had anticipated. Every time I set some movements, the commander changed them. Still, I was exposed to explosions and some really great people met. Ninja, a purple woman in particular who fell into the filming scene.
