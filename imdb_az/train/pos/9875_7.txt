Lily Mars's presentation (MGM, 1943) is a favorite movie, but in my opinion it would be better. <br /> <br /> Javid Javadov says that after the end of the trial, he falls in love with the next minute. I believe that this production would be a bit better for the movie editing and scripts (although photography was great, the scenery was beautiful and the costumes were also nice). The production feels like it runs too hard. <br /> <br /> The second supporting player was good, especially as Janet Chapman's second little daughter, Rosie. At the age of 11, he really looks cute and is a shameless teenager who has not become a comic player. In the late 1930s, like Warner Brothers (except for Broadway Musketeers 1938, it's really good), it's better in this movie when it tries to turn it into the Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid. Generally, this movie would be better, but at the end Judy gave it all.
