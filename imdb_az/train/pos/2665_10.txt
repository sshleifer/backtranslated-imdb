What is strange about The Shining, about this movie? This film will tell everyone that "Shining" is a horrible film, for people who claim not to be horror movies. Stanley Kubrick's classic view of Stephen King's madness and blood horror tale. It's just an amazing movie, and you've seen it or not, you've heard it, you know a few lines and get acquainted with some classic pictures. Who can forget about Jack "Here Johnny"? Who forgot "do not forget all the job" and "no naked boy playing"? Who can forget this cold end? This is an unforgettable and honest movie in my opinion Kubrick's best work. I know that there are many controversy in this section, many people 2001: Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if the movie pushes to prepare a movie, The Shining makes it perfect. It's an insulation, madness, horrific images, and the final fantasy story that goes through your skin. <br /> <br /> Jack Torrance, Jack's son Danny and Jack's wife, Wendy, arrived at Overlook Hotel after daylight hours. Old African cook Dick Hallorann surprises Danny, who speaks telepathically and offers him an ice cream. She explains to her that she and her grandmother give gifts; they called "bright" communication. Danny asks the hotel to have something to fear, especially at Room 237. Dick, the hotel has a certain "brightness" and has many memories, all is not good, and advises him to leave the room. 237. When you see Danny's curiosity about room 237 finally getting better.

But I also feel Shelley Duvall, Jack's rant, All Work is very overlooked by his scene? it's incredible, it's a frightening look and you can see her fears after she realizes that she's a spouse. In addition, an incredible scene, when Jack sees a dream woman in the wind, is one of the most horrific scenes in a horrible horror movie. This movie is well-known because it's been featured in The Simpsons, the excellence movie, and it's featured in other films and a movie that will stay with me when you see it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
