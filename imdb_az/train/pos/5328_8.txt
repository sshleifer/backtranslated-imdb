I remember seeing it for the first time on TV. I could not believe he was going to TVNZ! I must have it! Many humor will disappear in non-NZ, but go! <br /> <br /> After completing the end of the Y series, Matt and Chris have gone to bigger and better things. NZ's most brave devil stuntman, Randy Campbell, appeared frequently in the English TV series Balls of Steel. <br /> <br /> He also released his Deja Voodoo 2 album, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The team consists of the members of the Y team and the sole members, "I'll give you one another (but I'm only 6 years old) and you were not born in the 80s." <br /> <br /> The South-West Film Festival has featured a feature film, The Devil Made Me Do, which will be screened at the NZ in early 2008. <br /> <br /> If you are funny these kids, then you can only have F% ^ K OFF!
