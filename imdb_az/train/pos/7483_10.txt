Vanilla Sky is a reconstruction of Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) in 1997, in 1997. And in my opinion, more people and emotional versions. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a composer egomaniac, who is fond of other people's senses and is just thinking of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best and many friends, only friends. Penelope Cruz plays Brian's lover Sofiya Serrano, accompanying David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays David's sometimes bedtime friend, Julie Gianni. A psychologist named Kurt Russell David Curtis McCabe plays. All of these interactions and their outcome make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex works. I will no longer explain the plot, because it is stronger, and you know less. It's very confusing to watch all the people watching this movie. If you pay attention, you will not be mistaken. The film is very complicated, but not mixed. And in my opinion, it was one of the best films.
