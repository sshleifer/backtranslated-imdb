They have never seen this movie and danced and danced by Cagney and other castle members: Dick Powell, a great tenor and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays music like Chester Kent, and eventually produces the Prologues, featured in feature films in the 1930s. Chester has trouble with people trying to steal their ideas for the show. It's a very funny movie with lots of comedy and lots of laughs. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) is a very young and very helpful helper. Dick Powell started with a long and successful screen career as singer and dancer. Enjoy.
