*** ALLEGATIONS *** *** ALLEGATIONS *** After two hours of so-so tour ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry "Ani Effect" <br /> <br /> For a while , Harry continues to work. <br /> <br /> Dear Harry, there is a problem with the heads of San Francisco on the outskirts of the state of San Francisco, where there are problems with the heads of "ask before, ask first" tactics there (WARNING: Potential spoiler) , was once murdered at a time when a woman who had previously been harassed by the network and her brother had been catatonia since the attack. /> <br /> The murderer is depicted by Sondra Locke and he is a blend of Jennifer Spencer's character with an intense compassion and coolness. While trying to relieve his brother or to give revenge on the attacker, Locke is particularly impressed with the portrait of a woman who believes her cold eyes and smoky sounds, suffering and anger can not endure deadly fruits. <BRr> <br /> Enemies, especially those with a sealed "psycho nutjob" on their forehead and anatomical to join, are a lot of humiliating dignity, almost as a child. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The influence of the Caucasus is not obvious, it is quite a nightmare, and it is clear that it will please the audience who killed the attackers on Jennifer. <br /> <br /> Someone is "manipulating revenge tales. At a certain level, this is true, but it is well-worked out. What works for the film's superiority, Sondra Locke shows the power of the performance, giving us a complex character that draws more pictures than her signs or speeches. <br /> <br /> You can look at some of the errors. <br /> <br /> You think some errors are worthy of punishment. Harry (with intelligent, non-dialogue) is presented with a choice - what should be done about a murderer who can motivate his motivation, but whose behavior is not law-abiding? <br /> <br /> Another aspect of the movie is Eastwood's direction. It all is a Dirty Harry film and Eastwood knows better than anyone else. Designed with film, style, and mind, it has been modified to give a great deal of action to the scene. <br /> <br /> The "Impact of Sudden Impressions" is from Harry's best series of Harry Moments. the courage of his prisoners while delivering a fairy tale about extreme crime and brutal consequences. It is also a well-prepared and well-run riveting detective story. And of course, it's no boring. According to these criteria, this is a great success.
