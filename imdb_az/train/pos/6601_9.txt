This movie is absolutely surprising. The new Blade Runner - the noir in the future is the most strange. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Life's line is very simple with a few surprises, but this is not something I do not like, Paris's visibility is both recognized and visionary. about the movie. This is a visual cure. <br /> <br /> 3D-shaped and black and white (no grays!), with only a short color, is less sounds than the eyes. There are many "arty" cameras - closeups and unified ideas - but add to the temperament of the movie. In general, you get the impression that you are filming. <br /> <br /> I was initially impressed by the film's rotoscope, the character's facial expressions were animation levels and high detail. Renaissance is consistent and sensitive, but unlike the "A Scanner Darkly" - it suffers from an inappropriate character (or even stronger). <br /> <br /> For me, when the character is approaching, additional information and tissue may appear, but only one side of the film, in one statement, said it was a single project, although it was thrown at an average shot or farther detail. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
