This movie is a fantastic movie. In my opinion, everything about it was above directing directorship. I know that Mr. Garfild was listed in the 1950s, but most of the other films are on the video if not on the DVD. This is why this is not it? A friend would have a TCM record for me, but it would be good to have a DVD. For some special features, they were talking to a marine historian during the battlefield, and if Mr. Schmid's spouse or son was still interviewed. Anyway, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. Hopefully it will never be painted. In my opinion, it would be possible to destroy the entire film. By 1945, the movie scene was quite real. Mr. Garfield did a great job of describing Mr Schmid. Some actors might have wanted Schmidt to miss a part of the disability, but I feel it's true. I sincerely hope to go to this movie with DVDs one day, respecting the courage of Al-Shmid and the other sailors who made us very fond of in the Second World War.
