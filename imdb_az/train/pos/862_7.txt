Carla is a secretary, mostly deaf, without hearing aids. When he finds out that he is too busy, Paul can help him get involved. Paul just left the prison and his past is not entirely behind him. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting thing about this movie is how to use voice to show what Carla is listening to, and then it can not be - a kind of "point of view" (apparently obvious). Early scenes that created this, as well as the early character of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me and then returned, some of them were a little trustworthy and / or somewhat reliable. There are some unpleasant violence. After returning to the positive side, cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing, but maybe not. At San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
