When you go to this movie to see some great academy premium presentation ... oh well ... but if you want an old classic to see a comic nice fit, you'll love it ... Jim Carey was as incredible as the usual. The story line was large, adding a few parts to the history of Grinch. Ron Howard is never able to miss ... But although there are a few adult commentaries and spaces, this can be a child or family show. Really, do not enjoy the movie ... As for Ron Howard, try to direct a great movie and see how it works ... it's not as easy ...
