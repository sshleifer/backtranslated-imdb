My name is John Mourby and my story about this Paperhouse: In May 2003 I saw Alfred Hitchcock's psychic, I was very scared and deeply concerned. I started looking for a flawless film in the same way. But none is satisfactory. Among those charged and failed are The Birds, Living Dead Night, Lamb's Silence, Blair Witch Project, Ring, Death, Sixth Section, 28 Days in the Chainsaw Massacre in Texas, Halloween, Near Darkness, Aliens, Peeping Tom, Cell, Rosemary Baby, Now Care, Witchfinder General, Friday 13 and Omen. I have to confirm that I'm hopeless! <br /> <br /> Kağızhouse is called Marianne Dreams, based on my favorite book, which is owned by. Paperhouse also came in some books I found in scary movies, but did not provide information on the relationship between books and movies. <br /> <br /> Now I find the truth on the internet and after that day I took the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought I would not be loyal to the Paperhouse book. Of course, this was absolutely pious, but of course not. Marianne called the answer to my prayers, Anna, but most of the original story is identical. One day at school, Anna draws a house in her scrapbook (there is nothing remarkable about it), then ill, and every time she finds himself on a creepy old house and sleeps (and I'm really sad). More often than not, he always sees a new thing in an apple tree when he is in the dream world. Anna describes the world of ghosts as a very sad child who is actually a person in the real world. Mark is a cripple but wants to get out of the house, Anna takes a flashlight (a place to go), but it's still a problem. So Anna decides to take her father, takes her pencil and works hard, but the result is deformed, and Anna worries about her, especially her eyes. The quote "looks like evidence". So Anna tries to throw it off and restart, but the pen will not be erased (ie, nothing can hunt). Then Anna loses herself and breaks her father's eyes! <br /> <br /> Kağızhouse is indeed a Kabusun English answer on Science Street! Watching this movie shocked me and upset me. But after two years, I found what I was looking for. How to Compare Psycho with Question? Answer, 1 old dark home, 2 psychological parent's fear, 3 real shock, 4 and very scary music.
