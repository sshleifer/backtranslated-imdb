Some people think that the film is boring, but I do not agree. This is a biography of a very complex and unusual person. I liked the characters in the movie, and I think Archie has captured a mystery of humanity part of his life. The goal of a good biography is to have a person's life span, but rather the complexities and relationships that interest them. Who is more interested in making such a success than ever before? "People dreamed, imagined." Good job for Lord Attenborough. I would also like to remind you that Nathaniel Arcand really distinguished me as a charismatic actor and I would like to see him in more movies.
