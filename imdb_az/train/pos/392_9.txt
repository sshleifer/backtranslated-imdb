As I have seen, the legend of Zu was a very interesting event. I do not know, I have not seen mythology behind the film. They did not expect something in Star Wars, and that was not the case. Joseph Campbell, I believe, loved this movie. An average viewer could have seen a number of metaphors and hidden meanings. We all have a sword mountain. In our lives, we must enter the cave where our blood is sometimes. We all have to face one day with their own insomnia. Some myths are a little surprising, and I think that some movements sometimes have a bit of hockey, but I can easily make other points of the film. I would have watched him again. <br /> <br /> Is there a difference between the legend of Zu (I see in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (United States version)? the audience really appreciated this movie.
