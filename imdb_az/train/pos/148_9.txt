As in his previous film, Agust√≠ Villaronga has a more intense and high poetic resin with his vision of his predecessor, as well as in a Glass Cage. This is one of the most sophisticated and exciting pictures ever seen. Rising drama, violence and violence threaten melodramatic and farcical, but it does not take any steps. In such a way, it is almost impossible to find a job: it is very painful and it is still very painful, so it should be charged and still simplified, and even the final of the explosives is the virtuous reception of the eye. Unabashed, shiny and highly intense ... This movie is simply superb!
