Fantastic movie. One that thrills all 5 emotions. Not a genuine historical report, not all data is perceived as actual information. Hollywood actor Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne-Ned's right hand) and ugly (ruthless Geoffrey Rush) actors like the True Dutch Convention, listing and very strange actors play drunk and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This gives all the romantics a very unreliable love story for a mixture of Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to be especially sensitive to women. Even on the first scene, Ned rescued the fatty youngsters from drowning, and his father called him "the sun" and "looked at me, his hand glittered while looking at me," along with very romantic and contentious viewers Ned Kelly. Besides, all Aussies love a little old?
