"The Last Wave" is one of the brain-based films. <br /> <br /> David is a mercenary Sydney lawyer to defend some Aborigines accused of murdering Burton (Richard Chamberlain). There were extraordinary heavy rains in Australia during this period. While defending the Aborigines, David is learning the latest wave theory and begins to wonder if he is merely a mythologist. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of the film is a metaphor for the depths of a mind. Peter Weir created a surprising but thought-provoking film. <br /> <br /> Subscriber actor David Gulpilil ("Walkabout", "Timsox Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") is an interesting helper role as one of the suspects. <br /> <br /> Your chance is to "make" the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the movies, part of Richard Chamberlain's background.
