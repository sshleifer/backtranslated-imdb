This film is definitely classic for the camp. That's why Elvira and MST3000 were classic. Everyone knows the story. While traveling to the city, the scientist keeps his daughter in his basement right in the lasagna panda and checks the local chicks trying to find the body. Finally, the top of the lantern with the head of a crunch finds a real brown body. The broken head is accompanied by a failed test and the concourse breaks out of the closet and destroys the assistant's "good" arm (irrespective of the previous one's failure) and burns the whole place. <br /> <br /> The film scared the children until they had not gone into the basement a year after my friend saw it. As children, we surpassed the intimidating movies of all time, and this was the fourth. Only one of these scary movies was really good (Original "The Haunting"). <br /> <br /> I have to give this movie seven ratings for a great deal of entertainment value. Scientists are looking for corpses (complementary through pornographic sound) when they are afraid of hell from innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects are the main ingredient to talk and laughter, while being malignant production and strange sexually explicit. <br /> <br /> I can watch this movie this night, and I'm going to go to Dentist more than just watching Chicago again. <br /> <br /> Seven most I can give because its entertaining value is only good luck. Film is like a movie, a disaster.
