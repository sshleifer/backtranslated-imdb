She is a visually stunning movie to watch Petter Matte's "Love at Time to Time". Mr. Mattei presents us a portrait of human relationships. It is a film that tells people what money, strength and success is in different situations we encounter. <br /> <br /> This is a change in Arthur Schnitzler's game on the same subject, and the director moves that action to New York, where he has met today with different characters. Each one is merged in one, or another one, but no one knows the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the movie has a magnificent luxury look. <br /> How do you view the world of these people? <br /> <br /> The only thing that comes from all these souls in these pictures is the survival of every person living alone. <br /> <br /> As a good country, led by Matthew Bryza, a great city is not the best place to sincerely fulfill human relationships. <br /> <br /> Press spokesperson Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented castle are symbolizing these characters. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mattei wishes success and next job.
