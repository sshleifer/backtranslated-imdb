Kubrick demonstrates his striking ability to create a perfect ambiance for a movie again. Usually, using cinematography and skill, it creates a mixed and dark tone that thrives on the entire film and thoroughly enhances our ability to start over. Undoubtedly, this masterpiece, in my eyes, is a perfect air. Of course, Jack Nicholson gives me one of the biggest speeches I've ever seen. A genius went crazy to the terrifying original picture. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial but beautiful, but when the rest of the movie is very bright, it's easy to look at these two past. In addition, the actor owns the biggest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
