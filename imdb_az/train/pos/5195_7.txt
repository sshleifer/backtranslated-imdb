Like the lover of bad movies, I definitely pay for it. There is a lot of situations where you really have to ask yourself "<br /> <br /> This is a bad film, which has a lot of funniest, first, when Rudy Ray Moore is filmed in this movie, special effects are to accelerate doubles in the scene of the fight.There are also scenes (with eight-speed instant replay) that pull out of the bigger letters, leaving the naked men on the high wall (retreating and retreating). /> Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore movie is absolutely free and without a casual comedy club, Rudy is some of the only dances of people who have fun with all customers. <br /> <br /> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> There are very bad things about this movie, but they are fun in a bad way, and if your eyes get out of the movie sa, you should miss another mistake, the actual value is 10/10, 7/10 for cheese factor 10/10, mistakes and goofs.
