One of my favorite films made by many filmmakers is a mystifying observation. Not only directed by Ang Lee, but also Tobey Maguire, before Skeet Ulrich (Before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the players were perfect, and each of the actors gave them memorable performances, especially those that depicted a vicious person killed for killing. <br /> <br /> Basbug's biographies and achievements have earned an Academy Award) and actors are listed, and this movie is usually deleted from past performance. I discovered a DVD movie accidentally and became one of my most watched movies. However, it can rarely be seen in cables. I hope that the reasons why this movie is not well-known will be read by others.
