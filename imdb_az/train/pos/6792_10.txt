I remember this game. It was always on the shelves and it took until he decided to try something new for a change. I had 4 discs, the first to play PS1, so I was scared to her. <br /> <br /> The story of this game is very good and bent, almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII Storyline, and it's hard. perform. Execute. fulfill. When you play the game, just like a movie, you just have to deal with characters that are incredible in a PS1 game. <br /> <br /> This game is not a very bad game, and it's hardly a game of sitting, as nobody has played or liked it. The shelves are sold at a reduced price of 50%. Indeed, I always look at those who read and try them, and most of them are really good people. Heck, I've entered the final Fantasy VII, looking at a catalog and finding it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> The legend of Dragun is the only game or RPG that is better than many square Enix games. I'm not surprised if this is done by Enix, but this is not it. Any hard-to-play game is better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but it's one. <p> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> This is the PS1 guy in 1999. The story I have already mentioned is incredible, it almost hit VII. <br /> <br /> A part of the universe will reach 10 to 10. Quadrature is definitely more of a compliment than a company other than Enix and deserves a very good RPG. .
