Read all the comments very interesting. but you can tell the name of the true artist who draws pictures for a good time that someone can ask. Everyone's j.j. as a family artist, but there was a real family with real artists and did not receive any credit from this point of view. I want to tell him, "Well, I've done a good job" until someone can not name the real artist. I know that this view is for the Bible, but if you do not admit that it all touches your heart. I would still like to know if he still has a paint, or still lives. I would like to show some of my work at home.
