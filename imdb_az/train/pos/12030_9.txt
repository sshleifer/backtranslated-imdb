hi, im scott (AKA woody7739) i love Twisted Desire, and I like watching Melissa Joan Hart on Tv. I am also a young believer, so I watch (do not ask). I love nicole planning to kill a lot of things because she is sure that someone else is pulling on glasses and that's why I'm not going to give her fingerprints (very well thought out) when she came to her old lover and put a hidden camera under her shirt ran back on Nicole. I will give the ninth part of this movie and have it featured in the top 10 list of films on MY. And last but not least, if everyone sees this movie in shops, tell me you see it on television and do not write it. bye
