It was easy to imagine that the costume drama about royalty alone could not go anywhere, while Emily Blunt's striking role in Paul Bettany was a dramatic, dramatic and dramatic drama, a dramatic, dramatic and charismatic performance. Rupert's Friend, Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong are the immediate forces that help develop one of Britain's most powerful monarchs. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria dramatizes the rapid transfer of a young woman to power. <br /> Emily plays the queen, she knows the difficulty of her job, but I have enough confidence to move forward. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Putting a pledge to enter the path of the crown, and even when he orders his new position, he will be able to put his confidence in very important decisions and, of course, will give the right support. Fortunately for Victoria, Albert is a man who looks like her and is her husband's friend. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Two performers have wonderful chemistry and the result is doubtless, but Bettanyi's Prime Minister, Victorian's wise support Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong, who support the role of two parties that can be a suspicious character in the cultivation of a young girl and can apply a great deal of force. Each of the supporting characters could use a little more development, but what we see on the screen is enough to pay attention to the central character and to have a superb performance by an actress, Blunt, who has enough fire and passion. previous speeches. Here, the shortened role of his career has given him the historical identity of real life, violates the rules and has managed to manage for a long time. It shows the strength and character of the monarch's seeds in subsequent years. "Young Victoria" is not the royal epic depictions of the ruling class of England, but its sweetness and innocence, which forms the basis of his charity work and interference with social change in the future. It is a sincere story that man has grown up, and which specific terms he encounters and how he shapes them. In the end, the film is a beautiful introduction to a year of focus on war and destruction. Here's a good writing and good mediation, which is very far from us, and of course, there is a good old love story.
