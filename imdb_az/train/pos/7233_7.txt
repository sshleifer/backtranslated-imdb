I have not read all the comments, but at least one poster said that the 30-minute version was likely to be restricted. I'm interested in myself, because it's not logical for me to get the movie back in the next time. 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917. Tourneur's next film, The Weak Minor Girl, is 65 minutes, and her previous "Clan's pride" was 84 minutes. <br /> <br /> I am not buried, it should not be part of the film, and therefore the resolution is not very significant. <br /> <br /> The film you are only able to see half ... but I would recommend this movie to the really interesting view from the inside of the movie studio at the East Coast all the time. It's the earliest movie I've ever seen in the film industry itself. The main character was a movie star by Robert Warwick, then one of Hollywood's most important actors and appeared on about one in Preston Sturges. He plays a western actor, perhaps modeled in William S. Hart, somewhat like Warwick. After a really interesting sequence set up in the studio, we see them hitting a country girl (Doris Kenyon) and seeing them come to New Jersey for a very bad screen test. After this point, the film will not lose its great works in the picture we are now seeing. <br /> Along with that, anyone who is interested in film history comes to documentary value, is a beautiful example of Maurice Tourneur's works.
