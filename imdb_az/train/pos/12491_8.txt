This movie was very good. If you want to watch horror movies, I recommend it. I thought the player who played Julie could feel more behind his lines. Allan was very good and I thought cinematography was fine. My friends were always on the edge of my chair when I was shocked and screaming. This was a complete success in my opinion and did not bring it to the big screen. I'll give you two fingers! Undoubtedly, if you have already seen it, rent it. If you see it and you do not like it, you can still explain it, and there are parts that are not entirely real. I also liked how many of my movies were taken around me and my school campus.
