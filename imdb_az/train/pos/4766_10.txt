<br /> <br /> It is an unusual movie seen in a movie that is a feature film: it's as good as a movie that you can feel as little as possible without the movie's participation. <br /> <br /> In spite of the superior one - in fact, there are many scenes that appear very quickly and carelessly - a budget with a low view, a perfect structure, a man who wants to replace a curved monk and a weekly honey, Pierre Fresnay is so surprising that he is shocked from the start to a terrible end. <br /> <br /> I have never done a better job in the future, never even seen Paul Scofield, "One man for every season" <br /> <br /> If Fresnay plays a church returning to the church with a criminal case , in fact, the last one can be considered ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Other powerful moments of this film are Morand is a scene - despite a defect - there is a priest - a large number of grapes inside a cabaret <br /> <br /> Gérard - Morand A person who wants to return to the church or replace himself must drink it if he does not want to leave it in the cabaret. . <br /> <br /> At the next stage, the dialogue between Morand and the garbage collector is remarkable. "Do you carry people?" he only asks Morand to hate him for his work. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is worth seeing, but it's worth seeing because of a very strong and strange atmosphere that has always been created. I think Le défroqué is a very strange movie, but it will be done by all viewers - if there are good catholiques, it is necessary - a very rare jewelry in the film history. <br /> <br />
