The film, which was banned by critics at that time, but fans loved, has now become a classic. Marc Bolan's and T.Rex's live footage are among the other places that make John Lennon's best possible mix of imaginary "surreal" footage, and this movie gives an interesting insight into the story, not for anyone like Marc Ball's <br /> /> It was time to hobnobbing with Marc Beatles's Ringo Starr lover, and you could even find a short spot from Reg Dwight to Elton John. <br /> <br /> <strong> Tutti Frutti's incredible [and never officially published] version and pyramids in ballad versions of the Children of the Revolution. <br /> <br /> Chelita Secunda ["glam rock" <br /> The actor from Mickey Finn and Catweazle! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me when leaving Marc's dining table is a gym in front of a bundle of bare feet and acoustic versions of classics, so get On and Slider. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Highly high offer! <br /> <br /> Rory
