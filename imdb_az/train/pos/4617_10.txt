After Phenomena, I became an admirer of Jennifer Connelly and after seeing seven minutes in paradise I saw it as soon as possible. The film has gone through as many things as children and it's not just a fantomical jennifer connelly-directed movie, but rather a comedy, but not a comedy, but drew attention to the fact that this film was written in terrible writing, and it was a good consent that I liked it and you can not watch this movie again for those who have watched and enjoyed a good laugh or jennifer!
