Chang Chahin "Shaolin Temple" can be very good. The kung fu epic of this roundup is incredible - it's like Stew. Despite the fact that the field is quite a standard, choreography is commonplace, but Cheh manages the theme of making this movie remarkable and unpleasant. The feelings of respect for the history and traditions of Shaolin temple are felt in every context. Unlike the king of William Keighley's kingship in the same self-proclaimed 69th king or John Ford's greetings to the West Point on The Long Gray Line, Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" is a lovingly-arranged style. <br /> <br /> My desire for cultural correlation is to compare Shaolin's temple with Alamo. When watching this film, Alamoun will give you the same admirable and nostalgic feelings as you have had in your school years when you learn about the courage and self-sacrifice of convicted heroes. At the end of the movie, remember the Temple of Saul!
