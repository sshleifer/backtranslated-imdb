This is one of the brightest films I have ever seen. Even go to any international cinema of any reputation. I was really surprised why he did not accept this right. Sonali Kulkar, who won the National Award, is perhaps the only one imaginable. Renuka Daftardar is just astonished when she speaks volumes with her eyes. There are several scenes: When Gauri leaves Krishna's wedding in the city, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna Gauri notifies a change but is not a dialogue line. All gamut in the senses are transmitted through subtle behaviors and eyes. Krishna calls Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead. If you do not act on this scene, you have no heart <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie for gorgeous film shine and movement capabilities.
