If I only saw this show pilot, I'd rate it to 10 degrees. I immediately got involved in this wonderful new world. The subsequent episodes did not fulfill the promise, but I hope to follow and continue to improve. The production values ​​are incredible and the player is the first degree. Although it does not fit perfectly with the BSG because I am interested in premise, and there are two different shows. I'm both Esai Morales and Eric Stoltz, one of the favors of all time, in my life (once a week), and I am glad that I missed them. This is a show that requires a little idea from the audience and is always a good thing. You need to cut your head with certain aspects of the show; everything does not seem as though it is, and of course, both grotesque and figuratively grasping lines, symbols, and, of course, gray colors in different virtual worlds. We know how we all end up, but the journey wants to slip.
