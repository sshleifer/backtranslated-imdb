For a long time I've been an admirer of Peter Weir, though I did not watch any of the Australian movies until the last wave was watched. <br /> <br /> Richard Cemberlen is a lawyer who invites David Abelini to defend his five aborigines. For David's peers, this has become a drunken concern, and they must be guilty and give a speedy penalty. But David thinks it is a mystery under the guilty verdict. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify; I can say that this film will go in the direction of no one else's expectation. <br /> This is a very interesting element of the film: Chamberlain David Gillipilil, who plays the young Aboriginal, transforming the mysteries of David's abilities, and Nandjiwarra Amagula, an old man with a spiritual guide, making the film the heart of the relationship between these three characters. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Weir offers something supernatural in the film, and David has dreams that awaken the future, with a mysterious black rainfall in Australia, which can be nothing more than storms, floods and even pollution, but this is what David claims. movie, great disclosure of the film Poor Outside of Minor Events tries to create a climate of fear and pressure that can cause horror in the future without really showing anything. <br /> <br /> Charles Wain's account is fantastic, especially using Didgeridoo. Photography is also very good. <br /> <br /> The 2004 long Oscar-winning Weir's long-term DP Russell Boyd resembles a dark, creepy world full of mystery. <br /> <br /> I also note that for a film focused on Aborigines, it is an indictment against dancing with anti-white or dancing with a celebration, such as the Wolves or the Last Samurai, which glorifies their traditions. <br /> <br /> In some cases, smokers or anyone who wants to finish the movie may be disturbed by the audience. But for those who do not contradict some of the strangeness or uncertainties, Son Wave is a great movie to watch.
