I did not read Shakespeare Hamlet without watching it, but I had a Shakespeare book with me, and I could follow that dialogue. My view of the film may be partly biased because I did not read it at first, but I was attracted by this film. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever lived, and Hamlet's story is one of her best accomplishments. <br /> <br /> But now the movie ... I've seen that all actors in the movie know well what they say and can express that in a good way. Leonardo Romeo and the Cullons are nothing compared to Kenneth Branag and the King. What I like about this is not as good as a game you're studying, but just as good as FILM. You do not need to be rich with Shakespeare, but you must pass through all the graves of Misery. <br /> <br /> This movie is my two points.
