Perhaps I like fox, fox dishes, and so on, but I thought it was done in a beautiful way. <br /> <br /> When Lily is not comfortable, for example, as fire and room, we are trying to avoid much damage here). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After reading some other comments, She says she and her son look, because he explains his son with his story. The film I saw was not a mother or a son, but a girl with only one fox. Can anyone explain me about it? Anyway, I love this movie, though some scenes may be a little slower, which can be challenging for high-energy guys to sit. It's still worth it to sit and hold.
