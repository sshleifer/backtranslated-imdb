Some time ago I saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO). I've been an admirer of Public Enemy, NWA and other early racks and I've seen theaters in CB4. Anyway, the promo caught my eye and wanted to see what it was all about. Well, I knew it would be better than wet (WARNING!) And I'm right. Only parody songs are able to watch this movie (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You'll love the band of rap groups (obviously NWA), humorous rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and NWH's three members. Who Can Forget Those Who Listen to Troubles? Too bad, because this film is unable to get the credit it deserves, it's shading in CB4 releases, but in my opinion it's a better movie. If you know and love the 90s "gangster" rapes, you will watch this movie for a long time and laugh. If you do not like or like 'rap', you will use jokes for the joke of the genre.
