Friz Frelengin's "Conversations" is an excellent Snafu cartoon that warns against the spread of frightening rumors during the war. Like All Snafu shorts, "Conversations", which are shown as entertaining instructional films to military demonstrators, are extremely creative and make their very short lifespan of thinking. When Snape began a rumor about bombing, he became a rumor that America lost in the war. This is a long, rubber balloon piece and a few strange creatures, explains Snape with even worse stories about his country's army. "Conversations" are inventive, fast moving, and funny, all of which help shade a lot of work, "do not worry soldiers". It looks like one of the best Snafu shorts.
