A nice surprise for Spanish cinema. I have never thought Jordi Mollan might be such a great director, so I really do not care about the choice of movies. But this movie was totally fantastic and could never be predicted ... I always love something! He is not very pleased with the good news and I really do not think he will be released in the US market. We do not want to talk much about the story because I do not want to spoil it for you, but in fact the film is a homeless drunk, it is just a new Christian for the beginner and to earn a lot of money as much as he knows), he knows that he is drowning in an unprecedented life.
