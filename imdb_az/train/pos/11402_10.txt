When I was still at school, I first saw "An American in Paris" and I loved it a little. I went back to see it the next day and lost the number of times I saw both movies and television. It's fantastic by using the best music and songs from the 20th century's most popular composer (George Gershwin) and has the biggest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood. Oscar Levant's supportive form (as usual as ever), Georges Guette (why not shoot more?) And Nina Foch (unimpathetically brilliant). The final ballet, perfectly choreographed by author's music, perfectly uses the sights and sounds of Paris and the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All Gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but most memorable "The Very Clear" (Caron and Kelly in Seine) and "I Have Rhythm" (Parisian children joining Gene Kelly in Paris). If you love Paris, watch this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, look. But see it!
