There is a really funny movie at every moment covered by this. How can this movie be directed by the creators of South Park as it is directed by the star and David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I did not immediately notice that Coop and Doug really were Matt and Trey, but their ability to act and write was quite impressive. Later, I was happy to learn that Matt and Trey were. Humor is sometimes raw, sometimes filthy, sometimes elegant, sometimes subtle, sometimes high and sometimes foolish, but in general it is hell of a film that is judged. Indeed, his madman. Completely crazy.
