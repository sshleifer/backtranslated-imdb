Tsui Hark is one of the best films to go out to Hong Kong's "New Wave", starting with "ZU: Magic Warriors, Warriors". Tsui's New Wave's New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, and others) put a ton to a new approach to the long-awaited battle of all directors; That is, the approach to such films will need more than the Iranian touch, if there is no clear comedy hereafter. <br /> <br /> Burning Paradise ceased to endure all this and revenge. <br /> <br /> There is no humor here; but a purple composer is a man who quickly manages a part of a nubile young prostitute while hiding himself in a straw, as with the priest. <br /> <br /> The priests mentioned above are not always holy. <br /> <br /> When it's finally mocked, it's at least possible. The Red Lotus Temple is a pure nihilism that is never recorded in any of the previous films in such a film. He is more impressive than Milton's devil's "Paradise Lost": "It is better to be better ruled in Hell without serving in heaven!" <br /> <br /> If she can not go to Sheila's Paradise a few days ago, she will turn around around the world to become a hell of the world. <br /> <br /> Here's a motive that emphasizes the cruel intensity of many images. Abbot just wants to kill people. he wants desperation, feeling completely desperate, and accepting his nihilism as the whole truth. Thus, in the definite sense of the Red Temple, which shows that there is no other reality beyond the Temple itself, there is a whole universe, and Abbot claims the work of the infinite force. Of course, fortunately, the movie does not end there. Even though there is a loss, it is ultimately that human beings will eventually become ordinary people. (What you want to know, watch the movie!) Undoubtedly, they watch hell in the movie. Hopefully we will not be witnesses to ourselves; but we, of course, feel attractive in practice - and that's good for that.
