Apparently, when it comes to the point where an important part of the audience, including critics, is so terrifying before its release, it is fashionable to miss the "basic instinct 2". Sharon Stone seems to be more fashionable to descend, like all of us ... now fourteen years older and, at the very least, still look nice. The first commentary on this movie was so bad that I had to see myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not as good as the original movie, but it's not as bad as the most commentary. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, Henri Bean and Leora Barish are also Joe Eszterhas. Basic Instinct 2 is just an entertaining, average tension, and besides adding Jerry Goldsmith's original account, it looks less like its predecessor. Even Stone produces a characteristic of a different nature, creating a mysterious, devil Catherine Trimell, which can perfectly improve among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. He is not afraid of taking risks and is a clever actress who can play with his camp during his rest. Unfortunately, it looks like the main target for those who love throwing this whistle out. <br /> <br /> He has won a very successful main character, and as all actors reach that level, the time has come and will be destroyed by the Hollywood audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Casting is great, can give you better output than material. David Morrissey is a better player and more interesting than Michael Douglas: the player delivers an intense, complex dimension to another perfect character. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <head> <STRONG> </ STRONG> I express my disagreement with the majority of comments on the site, and I believe that, apart from the film, it forms the opinion of most of the agenda.
