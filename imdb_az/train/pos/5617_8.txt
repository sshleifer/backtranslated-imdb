After his classic film Noir, Chinatown Roman Polanski returned to these horrific psychological horror issues that gave him the greatest hits of the 60s, and it links paranoid and claustrophobia in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby settlements. The clustrofobic environment is the best in Polanski's creation, and it should be the most challenging and limited image it creates. The focus on the side walls and the point of departure is greater than ever, and even fewer external images are rarely seen. But rentals are not only spatially limited, but also the intensity of attention with her hero. Trekkovsky, played by Polanski himself, is not just on every stage, he is almost in every shot. The camera does not turn pale into Trelachowski if it does not appear on the screen more frequently. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> M or Peeping like Tom some psychological excitements manipulate us with regret for a mentally ill person. Others, like Psycho, seek a deeper scientific analysis of their mental state. Lessee is not included in this category? it just pushes us in the experience of Trekkovsky and we do not understand or appreciate what happens in his head. <br /> <br /> Polanski was a mastermind of a horror movie that was slowly opened. There is often uncertainty about whether it is really bad in its horrors, but it's one of the most effective in a frightening audience. Why? Indeed, they are slowly opening up and spending a lot of time trying to set up the viewer in paranoia. Later, the Polanski horror, the Ninth Gate, is part of a mess, but at the very least can still protect the feeling of fear. <br /> <br /> It is a very rare opportunity for Polanski to see himself in this way. a great role. His talent on the front of the camera was as good as it was and perfectly perfect as Trelkovsky. Another remarkable performance is the Shelley Winters, which, like concierge, is often inevitable. In fact, this rather strange, Gothic European film plays a lot more than looking at many places. And, unfortunately, most French actors supporting the role of the English version are unbearable. <br /> <br /> The renter is more polished and less pretentious than Repulsion, but Rosemary's Baby is so entertaining and entertaining. The renter is good, there are no major shortcomings, and Polanski was really a high-fashioned director, but not among the works he most used to.
