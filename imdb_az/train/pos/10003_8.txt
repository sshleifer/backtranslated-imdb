This is not a typical Mel Brooks movie. There was much less slapstick than the majority of the films, and there was actually a plot to follow. Leslie Ann Warren filmed, she is a fantastic, full-fledged actress. There were a few moments that could have been conquered a bit, and some were some scenes that might have cut off some to do so, but that's a hire and worth seeing. The player was good, Brooks himself did a good job without the audience-specific talks. Again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but Fume and Sailor also played a good part.
