(spoiler?) <br /> <br /> If the historical accuracy brings suspicion ... (and with inaccurate LOTR mass appeal ... these things are easily lost) I like the art of ness. Although not really a craft house movie. From time to time, it provides a little emotional charge scenes. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It's too short. <br /> 8/10 <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Opponent: 5/10
