*** I do not consider this to be a spoiler, but I want to be more cautious because it is very careful *** I did not see this movie when I was a little. This is my first love with my three year old daughter. <br /> <br /> Small-running Ilene Woods was a beautiful voice for Kinderella until her lifetime; very attractive; very convincing. Music really suits the film perfectly. Acting was great; loved the mice! You really "hated" Lady Tremain and the unhappy woman; They were just terrible. These cartoons describe the ugly behaviors very well. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie, especially in your lover's stories. My daughter has seen about 25 times and is still thrilled.
