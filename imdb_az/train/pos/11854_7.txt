I agree with "Jerry". As I recall correctly, solving the mystery was a kind of change in 2001 (but not "disassembled"), it's a very low space film (of course, because a computer that controls the spaceship is actually a computer, like HAL, they have tried to separate their own "mind", but not to its mechanical parts, but to the disaster with the HAL, there is at least a funny moment ... Christopher Cary, who can not find any food, has a kind of troublesome moment when he finds an abandoned animal bird, then something clearly does not happen.
