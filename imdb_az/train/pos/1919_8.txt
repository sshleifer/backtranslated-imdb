I did not read the book based on the origin of the book. Some of John Ritter's (RIP) latest work (others in the movie role) is hoping someone is happy. And that's it. Almost every time it participates in this work, in fact. Most of the sludge, as well as regular, play well and have a lot of material. He is the father of three young people, Paul Hennessy: Rory, the usual boy of that era, Kerry, Bridget, a popular depressed mid-child and fashion-loving, ditz who fights for reasons and enlightenment. Sagal returns to become a woman on a sit-com, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed slightly after Mr. Thompson passed, and for a while he could not imagine laughing or trying to go to be respectful and respectful. Perhaps you might be surprised at what or why it lasted for quite a long time: some supplements were happy (if you like David Spade, most of it is dealing with his lineup). My favorite episode is last season. Humor is a wonderful blend of "dumb men" jokes, primarily for high school students, quietness, dark comedy and raw materials. It deals with sex and other adult topics, but is not graphic. The language is bland and sometimes moderately strong. I recommend this to any admirer of those who do it. 8/10
