I loved watching ABC's TGIF Friday night, Sabrina, Teenage Witch. I think this is one of the best demonstrations of TGIP. <br /> <br /> Together with my friends, we come together every Friday to watch this show and we will not miss an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. She was very nice and very funny. Sabrina's lover, Harvey, liked me too. He was hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Looking Through Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: Teenage Years". These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> Generally, I was really looking forward to this show. One day, ABC brings back new episodes. This show will give 10/10 stars.
