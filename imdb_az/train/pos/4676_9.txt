I was thinking of this movie and its uncertainty revives the world of films that we love to "love good guys" and "bad guys". A very nice television actor, Scott Cohen, sees a great deal to describe a family of black sheep / missing children who want to win their father's love and respect. history. <br /> <br /> As part of the Tribeca Film Festival, I saw Judd Hirsch playing with his sons a triangular father, against his image of a good man, and has always been rejected. <br /> <br /> It is a successor to the classic "Ordinary People". I realized that this was just Judd Hirsch!
