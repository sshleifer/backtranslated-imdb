(WHY IS ONLY FOR PERSONS IN ONLY FALSE SUBJECTS?) - Almost everyone liked it! It's nice to note that everyone likes it! Certainly, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and to describe the Prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way. In fact, these points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith is a human being ... but despite all the terrible negative attempts by the enemy, he has shown how to deal with the work of the Almighty God. I advise everyone!
