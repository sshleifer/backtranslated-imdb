Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I am not a psychologist, but I know for 25 years. He said that Scott Wilson described an unusually good sociologist (conscience). Agree! Robert Blake says he describes a man who has a conscience but who can not control himself in a superior manner with anger and steadfast control. Agree! What a heartwarming, big movie. I've seen more than 2000 films and I'm 100th. My wife regularly deals with clients as my spouse. My only criticism is the narration of the end of the film. Many people grow less than ideal conditions, but they are treated as one in two million.
