My friend, who invited me to be a producer in the film, went to this movie in a cast and crew show. Forget about what you see on the ads, forget what you hear, and go for this movie for yourself. I was very surprised. In The Grinch World, Charlies Angels, The 6th Day, Unbreakable, comes here with a hard-earned dollar movie! A beautiful scene, a beautiful cinema and a cast that wants to eat with your heart. I think this is one of the most courageous films that have ever come to the orbit. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar nod. It would be a movie if you could give an Oscar to everyone who took part in the package.
