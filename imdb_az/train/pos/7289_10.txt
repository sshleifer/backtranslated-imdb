This was one of the first CREEPY films I was seeing ... At that time it was about 5. It frightens me well! But at that night I had to put a gum in one eye to be like a wolf ... my mother was very upset. I had to clean my eyes with alcohol and my eyes smelled like the SECOND MINUTE the following day! NOW THIS MOVIE! Hey, this was a great movie. The head sitting on the lab was as real as it was later. And if it's 5, it's scary! Children are already spoiled by special effects that show a lot of things and do nothing to convey your thoughts. You can imagine your mind more scary than special effects! (IMO)
