Get Ready for It: This is one of the most favorite films of all time. I do not differ from David Mamet's (writer and director) works, but I can say that this movie is a genius, after watching this movie half a time (I'm happy to see it). This movie is very well written and takes you around the fraudulent, conservative and back room hustles quickly. The feelings of the film are very similar to The Sting (1973) and give the film a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty psychologically complicated movie and you will begin to think about different areas and motives. shaded characters. In general, the actor is perfect, especially Joe Mantegna, who said that I was not interested in the movie. It's a good idea to be a gambler, a smoker and a thief who does not have a thief (Lindsay Crouse), as well as bad 80's hairdo. <br /> <br /> If you have little information about the area of ​​this movie, Mamet's newest movie, like the Spanish Aggressor, will be more effective. Just sit back and get ready for a movie that is approaching a ghostly danger.
