This is a very fun movie watching Macbeth's NY-made training. Despite the fact that in the modern world there is much to say about the power, jealousy and longing (Macbeth theme), the film works well when it does not take it seriously. Known actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury acted as key roles, but was an entertaining scene prepared by the murder of Banquo (John Elsen). It's probably a fun movie for the audience, but everyone who likes Shakarpar should use this movie.
