I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. Offside, who has been featured in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, is brilliantly engaged in comedy and tragedy. The film follows the fate of a group of young women wishing to enter the football match at Tehran's Azadi stadium. The country's religious leaders have ruled that women do not have sex with men in sporting events so that they are not exposed to cursing and other immoral behavior. It does not stop the country's young female fans, and continues warnings using various tricks. But Panahi is captured and moves on a small group and is held when he is harassed in close proximity to the action. The compressed soldiers are begging for them to move or at least watch the match. Soldiers told them not to admit that they could watch the game on television with their home. <br /> <br /> A young soldier has a very funny sequence that takes one of the girls to the shower. Because there are no women in the stadiums, it has to clean it before allowing any person to enter the room. Moreover, she can not see that no woman is a woman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Iran footballer Ali Daei's poster is used as a mask. <br /> <br /> In fact, even the soldiers are banned, and only commands to pronounce the end of their compulsory military service. One soldier complained that she should remain unauthorized because she could involve the family in the village. Small, girls and soldiers are talking to each other, and there are very few sad actions on both sides that are mostly good people living in terrible situations. <br /> <br /> Unlike the majority of Iranian films, it is a constant danger that recalls the "head" of the soldiers. Offside, known for its powerful vision capabilities, is a non-operated realist style. In fact, the film was produced in the actual qualifying match against Bahrain on June 5, 2005. The "field" was determined by the pitch in many ways. If they win Iranian match, they will fit. If they lose, they will not. Since the World Cup is over, I do not think that Iran is a spoiler who says it has won the match. At the end of the film, the celebration scenes were real and spontaneous and gave the true truth of the film. <br /> <br /> Along with this, it is possible to see how deeply the law of Iranians is concerned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, one of the young women refers to seven adult fans who died at the end of the film at the end of the Iran-Japan match. March 25, several weeks ago. Police began to spray the mass with water to move in a certain direction, resulting in death. <br /> <br /> This is a real-life tragedy, adding another step to the celebrations. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go on a long political tie, but this film hoped for a change and hope in Iran. Iran is a nation of young people, and it is only a matter before replacing its elders in the political circle. Such films show the pride of the people of Iran, despite the present difficulties, and it is a sincere hope for me that there is a bright future for them.
