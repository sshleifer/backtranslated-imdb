Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of his life in care of his father. Now he's dead, he's free, but he does not know what he wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who ran a monastery to taste more. She accidentally met in Algeria, fell in love and got married. But it does not leave behind its past and can not survive anymore ... <br /> THE WAY casts silly romanticism filled with bad dialogue and situations. Dietrich and Boyer are doing their best to make good appearances, but they will not be able to get a part of them! Still, it's classic. Each frame is shot in beautiful Texnikolor where it is beautiful to breathe (try to see it on the DVD). Dietrich always shoots in the 9th (even in the middle of the desert) and creates a hysterical pose for clothing and his body. Boyer just walks around the curled view (there is no shock there). Still, I was never bored. It was nice to look and the stupid stupid dialogue kept me stitching. Finally, it almost fell off my chair because I was very laughing! Now I love romantic romance and give them a lot of space, but that's really amazing! <br /> <br /> As classic as a camp, I give it 8. As a serious movie - 1.
