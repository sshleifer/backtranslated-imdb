Meryl Streep is perfect in his unworthy and stingy performance, as Lindy Couberlen, who has been accused of and accused of using his nephew Azaria Chamberlain and his alleged misuse of naked backs. According to the book The Evil Angels and the Australian version, the DARK is an ugly movie to watch. <br /> <br /> There is a very realistic scenario for us in the United States: witch hunt against a person is an easy target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Couberlen was this woman. Someone who is mentally speaking, not a sympathetic card, and who has a hard time trying to survive despite his terrible test, was labeled suspicious and even hated when he understood I did not kill his own son. The press has begun to occupy a pace of confusion and confusion by breaking up the fragment of this family and placing it on the whole nation. <br /> <br /> Lindy remained stoic at all times, even though his wife Michael left. <br /> <br /> This position, of course, is in power. People react with it resolutely. They want a hard mother to weep and cry, and sometimes to look weak at every turn, to sit there, and to look blank. People do not realize that everyone will not be saddened and others decide to become stronger, and they start speculating. Meryl Streep extends this delicate woman, and by doing so, she creates a cold, but heartfelt lady with her own convictions, despite her freedom. Therefore, the character of Sam Neillin is slowly allowed to be despair - for whom it is necessary, or Chamberlain, would be very independent and nobody would want to see it. This is another news medium outside the monster, which was in the writing. They always eat train crashes and bring the blossoming flowers to an informal public.
