After seeing the A Perfect Spy mini series just once, Smiley has a clean work compared to other Le Carr√© minis, there is nothing else, but there is no other quality. <br /> <br /> Alex Guiness on the Smiley miniseries, and Smiley, who stole the show, can say that other actors also support him. <br /> <br /> This is an ensemble and a significant story here. In recent episodes, Peter Egan is a prominent actor well-behaved, not charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan is just a man named Magnus Pym, lying, unusual, and loved by people who are big and small, who say they want to hear people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> His life is very young After a period of persecution, we understand what makes it possible to turn it into a treachery. The ability to lie and mislead everything makes it 'a perfect spy', as the Czech worker called him. <br /> <br /> We realize how difficult it is to follow a straight and narrow path to follow his life. Although nothing is economical, except for the promotion of his MI5 spy masters, he makes corners straight. Everyone is happy, while fraudulent information flows! <br /> <br /> Magnus' father, played by Ray McAnally in a beautiful way, is not always a good person imagining schemes to carry out his money. In the years that followed, he was the only son who killed him. However, with the example set by his father and uncle, who was a guardian while his father went to prison and his mother was sent to a refuge, Magnus immediately learned that lie was a survivor of the truth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Firstly, she substitutes for some time, but she quickly learns to speak the truth, and tells those who want to listen to herself and her father, Alex, a Czech who is exhibited by Weigang, creates the English MI5 with the help of Magnus, who has been falsely informed for many years and years, along with fake information. Before and during the war, the German spies - agents in the UK were turned up, aborted, and simply returned to the Das Vaterland after being replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> Young boys playing Magnus in the younger years are doing something wonderful, and most of them are more charismatic than the old, less funny and tired Pym that Egan has performed. However, you can easily buy the difference because it is a way of life that changes frequently from sadness or indifference. <br /> <br /> Really worth the money!
