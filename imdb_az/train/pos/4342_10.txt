This movie really did not surprise me, so it just got better and better. I thought: "Paul Rieser wrote it, okay? Well ... how do you see ..." Then I saw Peter Falk. Thank you for Colombo. Although I will not be a great fan of the show, I have always watched Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul's performances were natural, so I felt like a tip on the wall. I played very well, so I enjoyed it practically! ... I did not drink too! <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that I wanted to go to Paula and tell her I love her very much! but he could not find his number. <br /> <br /> One of these films was that I had no idea what was going to happen or who she was. But now it has come and I thought, "Well, why not? Let me see if I do not like it, you do not have to watch ..."
