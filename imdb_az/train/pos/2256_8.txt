I did not know what Van Damme's partner and friend / trainer / and most of his films would expect from the choreographer for the fight. It was nice to see that the "Kickboxer" and "Van Damme" acted as "TONG PO". Now he has himself. He and his wife are creating a great team, which is the director of the movement and the evil man. His wife was a writer, a producer, and directed most of the scenes, did a great job with the movie, worked a great deal, the story was meaningful, the scenes were good, the adjustments were real warriors and looked good to each other - the story was a good one and if you believe it ... no evil language, sex, just move.
