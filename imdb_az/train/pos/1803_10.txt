<br /> <br /> My dog ​​recently died and this was a movie that was loved as a child. That's why I did not see to work for joy. <br /> <br /> (Avoid the sting, Spoiler means) This movie is not just for kids, it's nothing special. It was settled in New Orleans in 1939. First, this dog was not described as an additional family member in this film, but as an adult with a difficult life. At the outset, Charlie does not differ much from his business and charismatic partner with Carface. At the beginning of his character, he says, he is the order of death, the greedy and the only escaped death. The difference between Charlie and Carface was that Charlie could learn and listen to others; Anne Marie and her sidekick, bloody. Carface will not even listen to the ugly dogs with the big glasses that are closest to it. <br /> <br /> Carface tries to kill heroism because it will not solve a 100% German shepherd's profit in its business, a very unusual way to die - just 50%. In addition, you eat a prehistoric crocodile, which can not survive to read, whether it has a child or not. This is a cartoon and therefore it is logical here. <br /> <br /> Charlie's success is the best revenge, Carface's revenge, which believes it to be a financial success, is a crime. After his death, he began working with a high-skilled girl who was able to communicate with Carface's livestock source. They all win a race and Charlie says that he will give her money to the poor - hint tips: Charlie and Ithchy live in a ditch and are therefore poor. He uses his money for his casino / bar / theater and the other is not "poor". The reason why Anna Marie is able to talk to animals is compassionate and attentive. She teaches charlie ethics by pointing out gambling, lying and theft. Charlie tries to prepare for her by buying her clothes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Garabagh" Charlie loses everything and The rest is all that little girl. Finally he had to choose between his life and himself. She keeps her first, and builds her when the girl begins to sink. Both the girl and the watch looked cool and she had to pick one and she chose the girl. <br /> <br /> It is a great deal about a movie that a person is misleading over time, and that a child's ability to fight with the naturally occurring pets is never an immortal person! The clock symbolizes life, while the clock remains under water and is stopped. All deaths were even effective because of the conspiracy. I did not cry so far in this movie, and I got a lot of things to write and share with you.
