Presentation of the presentation of "Ancient Mariner's Rime" is the most beautiful and interesting performance of Coleridge's legendary poem. <br /> <br /> In 1798, this charming filmmaker, who has been building a two-century effort to demonstrate the epic poem with world-renowned artists and Michael Redgrave's perfect story, deserves time to take this beautiful visual work. <br /> This type of television age is a valuable tool for young pupils and adults to learn and learn the value of great poetry. I know that such work is really rare; regrettable As a world-class student and former collective professor and academic advisor, I need to "translate" more epic poems such as Coleridge as "Eski≈üan Marinerin Rime". Though a film is not a critic, despite the fact that readers of classical literature are the most readable, I do not want this wonderful product without any conditions.
