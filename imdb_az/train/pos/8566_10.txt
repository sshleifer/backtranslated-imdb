When I came out in 1996, I love the 101 Dalmaisi, and now in 5 years I went to see 102 dalmation in 2001, I thought it was fantastic, but I think 101 is better, because more fun, more humor and cartoon version of this movie I am surprised that there are plans for 103 Dalmation (one hundred dalmation (1961)) based on a story like this. Perhaps, yes, maybe not all of us have to find the diving supporters in the future if there will be 103 dwarfs.
