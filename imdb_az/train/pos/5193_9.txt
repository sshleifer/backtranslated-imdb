The sword of the war was out of this world, today is a widespread way of wrestling scenes without flight over a wire technique (to the end). The scene with Chan and Pray was perhaps the highlight of the film. The characters in the attacking palace were clich√©s, but the film was comfortable with it. <br /> <br /> Humor injection from Voo <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tension and good time surprises are a good sense. The depth of the story is sufficiently intense for the flight film of this genre and does not go much with kung fu flicks.
