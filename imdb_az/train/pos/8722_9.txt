<br /> <br /> Bug's Life has a classic Disney story, but that's something. good things about the movie. The values ​​of the family are described and the main characters of the film finally evolve in order to stand against the locust. And Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, of course, has a great noise by Kevin Spacey (of course) ... But in fact, the most beautiful thing about this movie is the animation. Just fine. All the details, great colors, different colors, each ant, have beautiful roots ... And children and girls in Pixar have made all this true. All this is a very nice piece of work. Best animation by Disney since Aladdin.
