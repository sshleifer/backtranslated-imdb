"Citizen X" is very well described in the history of one of the worst serial killer of history. Where and when did this story make even more attractive? It was the Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Victor Burakov (magnificent played by Stephen Rea) is a newly-appointed court inspector for the Rostov region police. He presents crimes that were not solved by the person in the past and at the same time. The crimes are not resolved, because no one has been forced to make sure that no evidence is properly investigated. He is guided to find and stop the killer. His only instruments are his dedication, skill and honesty. Its barriers are the Soviet system's corruption and political ideology, which hinders the search for truth. Her sadness is her chief, Col. Not for Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically weak person who understands the game and how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. Burakov's official party "There are no serial killings in the Soviet Union!" Nevertheless, Burakov shares the desire to reach justice. Places and gangs are the perfect rest of the Soviet life of the last day. Randy Edelman's score is particularly good. More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal case with intensity and anxiety. It was a wireless movie made by HBO Films and they were a great resource for films that would never have been created.
