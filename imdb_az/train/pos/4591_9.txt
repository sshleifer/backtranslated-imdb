It's hard to see where Jackie Chan is. He has been an unbearable hurricane, blows, beginnings, and incredible stunts. To be fair, he can expect a slowdown in the fifty years. But with the "Rush Hour 3", it's located on the rear seat for Chris Tucker (from all people!) And then there is only pure voice, but there's 'Kung Fu Panda' that has its character any dialogue. It was a great deal to say that Jackie Chan saw better days. <br /> <br /> This time it is time to just watch a dusty old old VHS cassette and Jackie's teenagers throw a few donkeys. <br /> <br /> Insert the "Police Story". Jackie Chan plays Kar-Kui, the task is to protect a witness before an important judiciary. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, to whom does he show kindness? We watch Jackie Chan's films for the story. <br /> <br /> We watch them see Jackie Chan see the stunts of the sting and see the fist at all. <br /> And at this level, the "Police Story" is not disappointing. At the end of Jackie's collapse, down the giant, high-voltage car, there's a great show at a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> If something like this happens more quickly, no man will go shopping for clothes. <br /> <br /> Michael Maggie Cheung is a girlfriend who never forgave her with everlasting suffering and appearance. <br /> <br /> After a few days of meeting with her husband, I'm not sure that there is nothing in the 'Police Story'. Director Jackie Chan understands exactly why he watches his films (and he does so) and we know that we are waiting for the next battle to begin, the last thing we want is the depth and the inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So the "Police Story" is an explosion. As in most of his films, Jackie puts things you see on the screen from the head and shoulder to the opponent. I do not mean that Jackie Chan really depends on an umbrella bus, a new "Wow!" Factor is added to action.
