Family-friendly pure film. I laughed, I cried ... I liked it. I do not see Steve Carrell as something, but I was worried about Michael, who did not leave the office. My son, I made a mistake. He must win the Oscars for his performance. I'll buy it when it comes to DVDs. My husband is pleased with this, and he is not included in this "kind of movie". I saw the other two 30-year-olds and we all agreed that this is the best film we've seen for a long time and in the best way. Only 1 cuss word! Even PG13 is not sure what to do. I'd recommend this movie to those who love comedy, drama, romance and more!
