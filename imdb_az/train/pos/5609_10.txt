When this film was opened in 1976, the legend was welcomed with massive luxury and sadness, which was regarded as a major failure. <br /> <br /> I remember that Ebertin gave you a star, and it looks like a Cannine. <br /> <br /> It seems that these people are not hard to comprehend the film because it is very esoteric, dark and decent. I read a lot of reviews here (even after about 7-8 images), previously the elements of a very shining film. But even if we do not even grasp the psychological background of the story, we still get a cracked silkworm ... even if we get paranoid and oppressive character that started as a wave of tsunami in Polanski's two-hour workout. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The study of source material reveals a more exciting novella --- more exciting chapters by the underrated novel Roland Topor. Polanski's Trekovski is one of the highest levels. The first is, first of all, one of the men who has been drifting slowly throughout his life, allowing him to turn to him, even though it is a sin other than the day. There are a few strong feelings he likes and dislikes. He pushes and softens himself in this way, but he does not go beyond the form. <br /> <br /> In this film, the film is more focused on the drainage film, but at the beginning of the film there are some tips. <br /> <br /> When playing a woman's apartment, Mademouiselle Choule, who has recently been suicidal, appears to be the most courageous in the effort (even effectively lowering the savings on the market). Soon, he finds more ways to pay for the "good thing", because he finds itself in the center of the maelstrom created by a building full of freaks controlled by neurology, which is sensitive to even the slightest sign. <br /> <br /> <BR <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> >. <br /> <br /> If you think someone is suspected of the fear of Polanski, she is talking about herself, dressing herself, and so on. As you can imagine. an artist would recommend a good way to see this movie. His trademark black joke is here (and sometimes embarrassed) and --- God bless him --- his own butt of himself. It is a performance force performance in one of the richest, most dangerous, most gothic horror films. More and more people saw that this was not a real crime.
