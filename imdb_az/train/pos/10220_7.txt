This charming line is characteristic of these naughty sisters. (It's ridiculous and unwelcome, too laughable on its own terms). Only two sisters are really bad. Boy, they are bad too! One is given to pinup poses and righteous interpretations. Other stood up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has sensitive, slightly fragmented lips. <br /> <br /> All three sisters are played by starlets. The man who fled to their lives is played by John Bromfield. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps the first major soft market in the world today. Of course, then it is not the first, it is not ahead. <br /> <br /> Girls are wearing as little as possible and do not forget the female audience: Bromfield is shown with shaving with a razor blade. was this a fetish? - naked-greens. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> Here's also a real area: the girls' family is damned. <br /> <br /> This movie is not bad. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" I do not really know where it's being shown, but maybe it's for drivers, and I'm wrong, I've noticed that typical male audience is not the main target here. <br /> <br /> But the guy looks like the main focus, not everyone in the movie likes it, but all the girls love it. <br /> <br /> I think the audience is also meant to be. <br /> <br /> It's very entertaining and has its own terms.
