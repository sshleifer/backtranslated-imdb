I am always threatened by my family and friends for my tears, and I'm not disappointed when watching them. I've cried many times, but I believe it's not a happy one. How do I get sick for my family? Denzel was incredible as always, and that was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, even know me; Years did not help him. My husband did not have to watch the movie again unless it had been historically accurate combat movies (snore !!!!) He watched this movie five times and I'm going to look at the DVD because he left the band and jumped all the time I watched.
