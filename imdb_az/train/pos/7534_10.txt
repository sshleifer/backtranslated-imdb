I totally disagree with other reviews. It's mostly negative. He took a chance in this movie and was truly my happiest. It was real. I could not find anything wrong with that. There is no period.The script is original. The actors are all likable and convincing. The reminded Marcia Brady of Smart Brady Bunch. This gal is truly excellent in setting the act.The Australian Outback. Beautiful decor. Great soundtrack ie Paul Kelly. God bless Paul Kelly.The The Cranberries Both have seen this movie twice less than 24 hours. Probably, I'll be watching again. It is interesting. He thinks. This was probably better than the ninth part of the so-called "blockbuster" of Hollywood. Beyond a likable.Well could not find anything wrong with the film.I check it out. Check it! My first review!
