I believe that most people already know this story - it's a bad thing. Ebenezer Scrooge His Ways in Three Spirits (Christmas, Past and Present, Ghosts), which emphasizes part of their lives with the hope of saving the soul and changing their lives. Dickens's classic story stopped the time test to become a favorite favorite in one form or another time. <br /> <br /> I grew up following Alastair Sims' version of the 1951, and I was amazed at this version of Scrooge, released when I was at school. George C. Scott is convincing and says Ebenezer Scrooge, and actors playing ghosts are pretty scary and dangerous. David Warner is best Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully shot and uses more modern film footage for the 1980s, which is for black and white version of 1951 for my kids. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the story is a worthy adaptation and is one of the followers of almost every year at a point in the Christmas season.
