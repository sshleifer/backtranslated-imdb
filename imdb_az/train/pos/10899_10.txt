He laughed in this movie to offend my face. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a beautiful boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives a typical performance. The whole shooting is comic, the story is pretty good and comic moments are awesome. I will not wait too long for this movie, maybe I'm so glad to get embarrassed and I've lost hundreds. I would recommend this movie to everyone who owns a comedy, and I can meet with soloists and / or relatives during holidays. The best part of this movie (in any case) was laughing for a long time after I completely protected me and stopped me from the audience. That is, the scene of the Christmas tree illumination. Go and have a good smile!
