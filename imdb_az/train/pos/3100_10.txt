At the end of the first hour, my jaw sat beneath my feet. The movie never lets me say it, never allows it. It may be motionless, but it is motion. Every member of the bench is perfectly fitting. Explosions were realistic, sad scenes were possible, and the battle was incredible. <br /> <br /> Matthew Damon will be Jason Bourne forever. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, every Bourne movie is improving and this is no exception. Campaign, stakes, plot. I will not know how to do it. I welcome the person who wrote these films on each of the screenshots. If we did not do a great job with the first film, we would not have to talk about it. <br /> So, do not see it in theaters and practice in theaters. If you still live somewhere, but if Borne arrives home on December 11th!
