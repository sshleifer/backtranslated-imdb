First of all, I hired this movie for my daughter's dedication to football, and I was not disappointed (except for interference with football scenes). As a father, I am a little surprised to apply the subject of lesbianism - but as a parent, I have to admit that these issues are completely accessible to today's children (worrying about the topic). In short, this feeling was a segue for the movie - at some ages you should trust your children to make their choices. This dilemma is presented by a young British young girl - Jasminder (Jess) - an eastern-indian legacy with dreams of playing professional football. In her traditional Indian marriage, the long-awaited marriage of her elderly brother creates a wealth of opportunities to explore her hopes and fears in the future. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
