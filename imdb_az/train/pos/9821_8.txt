I saw this movie in the True Movies movie (it made me doubt about myself), but in fact it was good. Why? According to some films, film shootings or breathtaking dialogue (not very small), but in the description of the teenage pregnant women in the film, Dawson's Creek, with their delicate knowledge, The mystery is not greedy, joke characters. They behave like children and children. <br /> <br /> They are confused about everything, confused and worried. Yes, it can be an accident and they can only be a bad player, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney (who does not try to be cool) gives a very convincing performance and I liked it. Patricia Arquette was heartbreaking and boring, but were pregnant and teenagers? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on your pillow. The area was very predictable and what was it? I believed that his stress and ability to cope with - courageous but attempts to mislead some of them brought them closer together. I think everyone's characters are really annoying and unbelievable, but they did not. They reflect the speed of the situation, sit in the classroom, and lead the child to the campus. I was furious with her, and I was angry with her to accuse her of being a child. <br /> <br /> See the scene where Dermot Mulroney has gone through a catastrophic consultation session - a career.
