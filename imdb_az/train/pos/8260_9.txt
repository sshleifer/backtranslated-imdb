The French and the Germans have a long history that does not resemble one another. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or translation in translation occurred in 1931. A few years later, Hitler will besiege Germany and plan to become a victim of his ambitions. But this is the time of calm compared to the future. A group of miners working on the border tries to cross France for work. They returned to the nightclub by French neighbors. Then the disaster occurs on French mines and well-prepared and written scene, and a group of German miners decides to come to rescue. Not a simple story? Pabst was a silent film poet, and I'm not sure if he was his first soundtrack, but his poem could be found. He is not fussy, but brings a stronger realism to trouble. Even the story of the WWII, which takes into account the essence of this story. I suppose, on the basis of a real event, the film events are proudly carried out directly and remotely. Smetimes is a must have a movie.
