This movie is really nervous sliding Cliffhangin movie! Stallone is always as good as it is! Michael Rooker puts a stunning performance and John Lithgow plays an excellent helper! The music is fantastic especially the theme! If you follow a Cliffhanger after a Stallone fan, you will not be disappointed!
