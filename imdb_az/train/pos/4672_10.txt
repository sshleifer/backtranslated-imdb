I saw the shadow of a brother at the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as their father and son. The film returns Scott Cohen to his family in Brooklyn without divorce in Alyask. Due to her brother's death, she goes on to restore her slowly relocated relationship to her uncle's father, who is his brother's wife and child and the family's black sheep. This story deeply appeals to the hearts and minds of this family and gives us a deeper insight into the complexity of their lives. Also, the treework and the background of Brooklyn touches the portrait of this rich and obvious family.
