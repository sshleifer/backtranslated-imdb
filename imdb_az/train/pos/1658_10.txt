If you see this movie, you've been to Puerto Rico. I lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and in general, drugs that are the main cause of shooting and murder we are experiencing every day are experiencing a real chaos. These people will always be, everywhere and everywhere, and many innocent people have died. We do not feel safe now, and in addition, the so-called "justice" is transmitted with money, influence and power, not with truth and honesty. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on realistic, pessimistic facts and really describes Porto Rico's three main problems: drug-related crimes, money and power that manipulates our courtroom, violated, and even dying of innocent people and children. Ricardo and his wife Poli were brave enough to portray this all as bad as their lifetime driver and the award-winning direction (**): Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, it will not end! ** They won the Copper Wing Award for Best Director at the World Film Competition in 2006 as part of the Phoenix Film Festival.
