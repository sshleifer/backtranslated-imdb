"Ned Kelly" is a beautiful Australian film that honors the true Australian hero. <br /> <br /> Film explains Nedin's actions and perhaps justifies it because Ned is brought to the world of his best friend, Joe Byrne and other Kelly Gang members. everyone who gives the perfect speech to the film's life. (Great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe playing the role of a very good, loyal ladies. Now I swam. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are not fictional, and it is a little regrettable, as the true Ned Kellyin (and supporter). Perhaps, the film could have gone longer to cover more of Kelly Gang / Ned's life - I felt quite covered. <br /> <br /> Several flaws, regardless of whether it moves the movie, any feelings. (And hey, I assume it would be better to watch Mick Jagger not trying to show Ned in this movie ...)
