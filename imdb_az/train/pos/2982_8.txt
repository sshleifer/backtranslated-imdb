I enjoy thoroughly this flick. I believe that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the comic genius of our time. They are in a realistic way to add absurd at this level of pop culture and make it rational ... if that makes sense, there is the ability to uncanny. This is so spectacular to the South Park. As it's possible, you'll see a message delivered in every episode since it's the most intricate and horny animated movie. This is clearly visible on BASEketball. Although David Zucker's leadership is totally alarming, he has a sincere message about corporate America and major league sporting disgrace. I am also an admirer of sports, because I sometimes find this movie sad because it is a strange way that people hate to love. The opening forecast is brilliant ... laughs tears, and every footballer starts to Riverdance! Some people do not like this movie, because it's not everyone's tea tea ... but like South Park, once you look at the absurd ... it really delivers the true message through a literal comic genius. I gave this movie to 8 out of 10 stars.
