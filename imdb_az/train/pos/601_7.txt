I was amazed at the low rating that this film was watching. I saw a night on the television and hit the ground - I think it's the first time it appeared in 1989. But it's a good recollection, a nice twist or two, and an ambient ambience in a wind farm farm. Michael Pollard gains a favorable look for his role as a complete endorsement of his unpaid career, and everyone is right in front of him. Some of the somewhat strange appearances in 1989 may seem like a shame, given that modern "edginess" is usually used as a handy marketing tool, though it is a kind of tear to resemble.
