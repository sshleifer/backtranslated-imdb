Maybe I'm not a sage, but it's the sweetest movies! I first saw my 4 or 5 year olds and cried. Now I've seen more than 25 times (and I am embarrassed at the age of 15) and now I've seen everyone crying. Do not worry about being tired of tiredness! And it's not the whole handle! There are also many humor and comedy inside. Usually all the talking animal things can be a big drift, but this is not the case in this movie. My only suggestion: Do not see the tone, even if you like it! I suggest everyone to check it out ... no matter how old you are, you will not be sorry!
