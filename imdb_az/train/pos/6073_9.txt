University professor says that Othello could be the best drama of Shakespeare. I still do not know if you agree with her. I took this video version of the movie. First, like Kenneth Braunagi Yago, it was a great complex and it did a very good job in the adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not direct it, but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as with English actors. it was not a British and American issue. In fact, if all of us work together, Shakespeare can reach masses with a very rich dignity. Apart from the other Shakespeare tragedies, he is dealing with this race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better, and showed the complexity of the union. Although Othello likes Desdemona wholeheartedly, he is weak for jealousy and fear that he has lost to an unclean person like Cassio. At the end of the film there is a great scene, but I will not end. IT only needs to be watched. In my opinion, most of the lines are 2 hours, but they always make Shakarpar.
