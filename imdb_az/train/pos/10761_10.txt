My guest room bought this documentary and invited me to watch it. He came from China and heard a lot about only 9/11 and wanted to know the truth of the cold truth and asked him to give him more information after the documentary. <br /> <br /> I was afraid I was watching this documentary, it was like a feeling of fear and tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> However, I am extremely grateful to see this documentary because I am sure that we all know where we are and what we do when we hear it all, and we can only answer some questions: "Why?", "How? ? "," What happens? "," Oh, my God ". Almost all Americans were grateful for courageous firefighters and police who risked their lives to save others. But as we think, we really think what is happening. It really did not mean to be a documentary about the 9/11, the cameraman just spent a typical day at work and they just walked out of the World Trade Centers a few blocks away, inside and outside of everything. <br /> <br /> On September 11 I thought myself, "Well, police and ceasefire will save the people." I thought it was an accident to be honest, I was in high school and changed the gym and was ready to go to the science class. Someone dropped a bomb in New York! When we went to the locker room and watched the first tower on television, we all wore clothes and fled to our classrooms. Only 15 seconds later on the TV, the second plane crash turned into another World Trade Center and we knew it was no accident. A few moments later, we heard about the Pentagon and realized that it was a plane to Chicago, but it was shot. Many thoughts fled our heads and I thought what would firemen and police do? <br /> <br /> The first tower collapsed, we knew it, many people lost their lives, the second tower collapsed, things would never happen. same In this documentary film, ceasefire showed courage, confusion, and power, and the true human emotions. They did not know what to do, they were as strange as other people in the towers. The people heard that people were jumping from the windows to the ground. And here I was crying in the classroom just watching everything going on. I was amazed at this film and I just wanted to go to New York and thanked all Americans for their help. I know they are just doing their job, but more and more, they are heroes. From September 11, every day for three weeks, they knew that they were not alive but hoped and prayed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He must see the reality of this tragic day. "Why?" He asked. I did not know what to say, and it broke my heart that could be bad. "This click sounds, but it was a normal day for everyone," a firefighter said in a documentary. No one waited for this to happen. People at World Trade Centers or the Pentagon or abducted airplanes are just doing their job, whether they are there or even just passing through. They were not just killed, they were killed and abducted, doing so with a song in their hearts. While celebrating all the people in the Middle East, why do people do it? Mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, nurses, brothers, etc. <br /> <br /> So, thanks to these people to prepare a documentary. You really think about the firearms, the police and the troops in Iraq, and I hope this is the best people in the world. <br /> <br /> Thank you to all these people, you are our hero. <br /> <br /> 10/10
