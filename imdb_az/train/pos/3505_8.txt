At Amazon.com, I have no idea how he / she evaluates the IMDb's analysis, and there are very few negative reviews for this movie, which speaks the same, somewhat dark talk, almost words. Campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, it's good. <br /> <br /> She has been working in Brooklyn for over ten years since I visited Queens in South Bronx. But I did not find anything unreasonable and exploitative about these children. Is your granny a strange character? Yup. Does the dialogue and the organization admit it? Yes, fortunately, they do it. Are other films depicted in LES and Dominican / Puerto Rican children? You know. Is this movie a crime? will I suggest some of my comments (astroturf)? Very hard. <br /> <br /> This, Degrassi JR is better than any episode. High or Degrassi High. <br /> <br /> The purpose and the tender spirit of this movie did not compare with humility, but never told about it and touched me. <br /> <br /> I said that behind all this is behind! :-D
