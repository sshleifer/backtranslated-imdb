This film is a true reflection of the Australian skill that the country has to do over the last 200 years. Gung-Ho is not as strange as the English like Americans. It would not be disappointing if both of these countries were able to break down what they were doing. In English, we believe in ignorance or the superior attack on the American side. "Right" Australians (ie, non-imports) can only be superior to modern military conflicts because they have borne the majority of their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
