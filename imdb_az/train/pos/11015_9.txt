This film is run by Rennie Harlin's fin miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Mouse in the mountains with sad and terrorists. Rennie Harlin knows how to operate. Stallon needed this role to go back on track. It is a good place for the snowy mountain action film and it is better to direct the film to the place where it is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than the French man. The action is good! The film's music is magnificent. Bad guy John Litqow, other stars Micheal Rooker (serial portrait), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). It's a beautiful place and is a very interesting movie. Overall good movie **** / ***** Extreme Reminders: a special collector edition, with good additions. Soon to shoot a video in Finland.
