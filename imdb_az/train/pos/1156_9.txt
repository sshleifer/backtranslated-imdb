Years ago I watched a soap on TV. So, I was interested in this movie and rewarded it for it. This jealousy, the insults of ordinary actors, and all kinds of beautiful things are wonderful. But more than anything - an incredible cast and an amazing script. How did anyone get all the top-notch actors who could play in such an exciting movie? And how did this film get the writers to write the perfect lines? Nobody talks about this movie and even does not hear it, but it's beautiful and I strongly recommend it. Sometimes I'm throwing it on the houseclea and sitting on the board, watching, laughing, and enjoying all the good things. Many congratulate everyone who does this.
