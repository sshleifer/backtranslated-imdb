The dead are about a Police Officer named Jack Slate, who is about the Right, after finding his killed father and the man he thought he was killing. Jack was shot dead for the murder of a man suspected of murdering his father. <br /> <br /> A few months later, Jack was escaping from prison and looking for a man who was framed for murder. Jack's search was followed by a beep * trail, and everyone died. <br /> <br /> In the game, Jack sends his weapons to the shadow of the M4 Carbines to kill the infinite flow of 15 levels. The game is basically up to the level of "kill 30 people, find the door to 50, find the door open." There are some fun mini-games like Night Club's opponents to attract competitors, since Jack may be in another club, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The blood shot down by a guy with a blame will splatter into walls, ceilings, and floors. The walls will be painted in blood because there are only a few children in each area. <br /> <br /> For everyone.
