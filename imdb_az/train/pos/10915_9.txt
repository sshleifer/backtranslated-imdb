RKO studios decided to borrow William Pauell from Columbia, MGM and Jean Arthur, one of the larger budgetary efforts to make the Thames Man's popularity popular. <br /> <br /> Many nations have added to Nick Charles and forgot to forget about it, while Bill Powell also starred in several Philo Vance films. So this time he was satisfied with his role. Dr. Bradford, Nick Charles, is not like a lot of liquid foods, but there's still a Nick in the main block. One difference, Nick Charles is marveling at a marvel, Dr. Bradford works as a physician. It helps the detective's ambulance and actually gets into this movie. <br /> <br /> There are two crimes to solve it. A jockey, a horse who comes to the homestreter of a big race, dies without any cause. The trainer is skeptical of something, but pushes it with a more sophisticated bullet method. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy had a stronger impact than Jan Arthur for Bill Powell. Arthur plays it as a funny dame than Loy. <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> If Pauell and Arthur were signed into this studio, we would have seen part of Bradford movies, where Asta and probably Eric Blore needed.
