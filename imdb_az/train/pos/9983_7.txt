This film is mainly about human relations and their relationships. An elderly woman, whose main character begins traveling to the past in her life, analyzing her life. This trip crashes due to the economic crisis of his sons and his intention to place it in the nursing home. There are so many honest things that we ask ourselves at some point in some of our lives, and this film has many common ideas for discussing as a family structure, true love, marriage, or destiny. Although melodramas of this kind are not new, this idea may be useful to watch with family members to discuss some ideas. The actors have a good performance and the characters are very convincing, but for some time, some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie on a quiet Saturday afternoon.
