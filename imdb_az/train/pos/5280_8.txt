Reda, a young Frenchman with a root of Moroccan. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is a Frenchman in relationships and values. From the blue sea, his father, Reda, announced that he would take him to Mecca on a pilgrimage - that Reda did not have any interest, but only satisfied his commitment. As a result, Reda is angry at first, but it is difficult to speak and discuss her father, as she is a traditional Muslim man. It's ridiculous when both your father and your son are too harsh and inexperienced to say that his father is not so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the essay, it grew up and recognized each other. But I really do not think I'm doing it and this is an interesting and sad part of the movie. There was no doubt that there were moments of understanding, but often hostility and pressures were frequent. I really liked it and understood that it understood it because it would look like smoky stuff. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is well-functioning and interesting - giving westerners an unusual idea of ​​Islam and pilgrimage. It also provides an interesting approach to traditional Islam and secular younger generation. The lack of clarity and slow clarity about the relationships within the film may cause some to worry, but I think that the film's tremendous realism is and that it looks like a movie about people - it's not a formula. A beautiful and unusual movie.
