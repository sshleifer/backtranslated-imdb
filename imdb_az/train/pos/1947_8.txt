SPOILERS. As with other banners, I felt that I was a little bit upset. When I returned, I saw a crew to make life on the earth. I guess the writer waits for this issue with the sequence "Voyager" in the beginning of the episode. (Of course, the line was eliminated at that time, so there were all these). How I loved Admiral Janeway Voyager's crew. Like our fanfare, Janeway also has our torture, with the ultimate sacrifice and survival. I believe that Janeway and her old-fashioned scenes can go strangely and easily into the camp. Fortunately Mulgrew (s) drew it.
