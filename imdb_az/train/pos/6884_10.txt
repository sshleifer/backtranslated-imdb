This miracle of a movie is one of those films that have long-term effects. When I look at the angry people I think are both republicans and child shooters, I read about two of them and their extremist interpretations talk about the power to meet movies with their dark secrets. Such a work of art did not unite me with laughter and tears, and this is a miracle of the film. The film's reality and the performance Bret Carr should not miss. The almost interactive effect of its nature will cause people to be released from the theater or question their identity. Bravo at the next level.
