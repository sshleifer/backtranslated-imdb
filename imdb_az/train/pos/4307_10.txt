Maybe just before the reign of Rodney King, but just a few months ago was enough time. My parents said that they saw this and the next thing you know about the police being justified and that LA was burnt down. It only goes to show the state of racial relations in America. Simon Mack lives in black ghetto with his plotting friends with White Mack (Kevin Kline) and African-American Simon (Danny Glover). At the same time, film producer Davis (Steve Martin plays a crucial role) thinks that without violence, it's really cool ... until it's shot. There are some existentialism in the film: Mack and his family realize they can not live as they really want. <br /> <br /> As you can see, "Crash" has renewed its interest in racial ties, but it has long ago. Perhaps it is impossible for us to have fixed-line relations in this country. But both ways "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. Kevin Klin confirms my favorite actor. Mariam McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard also play a leading role.
