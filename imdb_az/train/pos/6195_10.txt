<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> After seeing this movie months ago, I keep going back to my mind and continues to come back and at least 3 Looking at times, I fell in love with Hal Hartley's leadership a long time ago - these movies laugh somewhere in a rarity. It's a strange feeling and I think many people really can not just get there or feel confused and a little worried - I actually really got it - as if these films were prepared for me <br /> If I'm really laughing in the movie, I do not remember it, though it's one of the most funny films I've ever seen. If you do not see the humor of your grocery bag, Fay takes you from a street to a church, his brother's publishing office, his son's office, and can not be very upset about it. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies, as though his mother was drifting like a symbol, silent Parker Posey should act in front of the international intrigue of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I think Henry Fool is the least loved of my Hartley films, honestly I do not remember it very well - I think that the character itself is so bad that I find it tiring. "Hartley's appearance looks like a feminine character. <br /> <br /> In addition to Posey's glow, it was nice to see Elina Louensohn, one of my favorite actresses, and her extravagant naivet√© ideal for Hartley's direction. <br /> <br /> This film describes the political situation in Afghanistan, is a very appropriate international story of intrigue.This is never doubting at the beginning, the complexity of the development of this film is unique. <br /> <br /> This "stand alone" is a sequel to the subsequent, as you know less about Henry Fool, more mystery, less wait for her appearance toward the end of the film - like an alcoholic chain complainer, "It's really a 12-year-old school yard to find Santa Claus" despite the fact that I'm interested in Hartley's "Monday Daughter" and "No Such" movies, and I'm glad to hear them. Grim "goes beyond what is expected, with Oscar winner no sense of humor and originality.
