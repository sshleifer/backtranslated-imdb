I remember when I saw this short, I was very laughing, and as I saw many other films, no sound! It's really good at this "singing" opera, she was really good, and I was surprised that she did not think of her career as a professional singer! <br /> <br /> If you've mentioned that this is when she was shot in a Stooge movie near the end of Curly's career, we can say that she has changed, because she has lost weight and was thin, her voice deepened, she was decorated with wrinkles, he was fifty years old at the age of forty. The reason was that he faced smaller strokes in front of a great dealer who finished his career. He has the ability to make the last one again! <br /> <br /> If you do not admit that the bass is actually really ill at this point, it's actually one of their most comic shorts. I know that Curly really does not care for me because I thought it was still great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
