<br /> <br /> Economist alert! <br /> <br /> I just watched the version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. <br /> <br /> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> </ font> </ font> It was too long and dragged along the film. Although the dance is good, it would have been better on the DVD, like the Deleted Scene. <br /> <br /> All this is a great movie. I liked my 5 year old. It's a wonderful thing that my favorite films like a child have passed on to the next generation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />
