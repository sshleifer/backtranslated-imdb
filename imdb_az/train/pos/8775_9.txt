An excellent Warner Bros. effort by Errol Flynn in one of the best screenshots. It is often referred to as its best and I can not really judge it until I see its "Dawn Patrol". However, there are some beatings in his work entitled "They're Dead on Their Shoulders." I'm a great fan of Flynn (he is my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps Austria), and I think he's just a great, great screen creature and a great actor. He is the main goal of "Gentleman Jim", a legendary boxer with fantastic legs, but he is also supported by a literate, hot and funny script and is in the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've seen actually loses that pace and is actually a born film maker. Walsh perfectly guides ring scenes as he does with the cross-cutting moments and great, extremely endless scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to this great production value ("Gey Nineties" has never been better!) Add and add your favorite supporter and pretty great entertainment. Alan Hale has usually played Flynn's sidekick, but here's his father, and still works all the time. Alexis Smith is interested in Flynn's love. The couple is made up of lovers to fight each other.
