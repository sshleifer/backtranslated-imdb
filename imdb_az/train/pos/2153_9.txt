This movie was charming. An accountant wants more life than the approved traditional success. What works best and differs from the standard dance movie, not really being "Great" but simply a way to express yourself. In the end, the great victory is not the winning of a competition, but the discovery of a new lifestyle, but the simple joy that fulfills what you want to accomplish in other parts of your life. No one knows their passion, they find their quiet spirits. <br /> <br /> Japanese backgrounds are dictated by both small and dazzling dreams, as well as personal weaknesses and "secret life." We all see ourselves according to each one of us.
