Bottom line - the best romantic comedy. What a great deal this movie has to do for all major films: we want a world and time to rebuild, and it makes us happy to be part of the human race. When I'm blue, this movie raises my soul and makes me laugh (and after a lot of reviews - it's always fresh). <br /> <br /> All actors are in the best shape. The characteristic is so dead and the symbol mesh comes together that you forget the actor (Matthau, Robbins and Ryan are hard to be together). Fey ("aga", "general pygmy pack"), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (three theoretical physicist "Greek Chorus" - "but not time"), Durning (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a missed treasure Do not give.
