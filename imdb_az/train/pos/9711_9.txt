Yes, there's just one more shocking and shocking show than Little Britain, and I love it! "Brain League" is a British comedy about a terrible, terrible and disgusting small town in the UK. This place is Dibley and the island of Craggy ("The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") looks quite normal! The show format, like LITTLE UK, is all around the city's population of the city of hell. Both shows featured the "Little Britain" (especially the job seeker class sketch) that repeats the same sketches again and each episode and is clearly inspired. However, the show differs, because it is like "Little Britain" (though not a show for kids), the show has a patient and sadistic quality that differs from all these shows. <br /> <br /> Now, if you guessed, it's not a show for kids, it's easily insulted or normal people, and maybe I liked it. However, you really need to use the very thick skin and most of the terrible love. A spectacular and incredibly unbelieving belief - you have to believe it.
