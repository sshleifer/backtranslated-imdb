The Great Vincent Price made many fantastic Horror films, and some of them are among the greatest genres of all time. The biggest achievements of the film are undoubtedly the films of the 1960s, Roger Corman's brilliant Poe era (the greatest Horror epoch of all time), Michael Reeves's "Witchfinder General" (1968) or "Ubaldo Ragona's" Last Man (1964) celebrates the last moments of this brilliant man's career, making films that featured the man and made him immortal Horror, but began with the "Meram House" (1953) until the 50's. Mad Magician "is a very similar plot with his successful predecessor, but it does not say that this film is a full-fledged macabre and a beautiful ship ... According to the lines above, Vincent Price is my favorite actor and personally, I did not let it pass, but none of these my friends will miss this small ship. <br /> <br /> Precious stars D on Galico (aka Galico the Great), as if a master magician and inventor of magic devices, a boss, an unemployed businessman, stole her husband (Eva Gabor). When the hero takes one of Galico's inventions and gives his opponent a Big Rinaldi (John Emery), the Galico shouts and bloody confusion begins with revenge ... <br /> <br /> Do you love Vance's Price when it revenges? Some of his greatest films, such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "Blood Law Theater" (1973), were associated with an absurd and delusional assassination, and in this sad career, no one, such as Vincent Price does not take revenge. This movie, as always, provides a beautiful eccentrically leading role for the Price, providing brilliant performance and providing 70 minutes for every Horror fan, with a very amusing, entertaining and charming entertaining experience. For my friend, we need to see something else for the fans.
