* Wonderland SPOILERS * July 1, 1981: Five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Billy Deverell), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo), 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA, when they are lying in their homes and terrifyingly attacked with their own pumping tubes. Only Susan survives. <br /> <br /> The main suspect is Hollywood (Val Kilmer), an old pornographer, a freak of 30 cm long and now a hopeless step. <br /> <br /> Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine) are investigating the case and try to crack at least with the help of a witness who claims to have known the demons. David Lind (Dylan McDermott) Barbara's wife and Holmes's 19-year-old girlfriend, Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth) and Susan, unfortunately, do not remember much about shadows over the night when her husband was buried and himself fallen into the same fate and Barbie (Paris Hilton ) as Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), the main drug kings around women, as a suspicious planner. <br /> <br /> What happened this night? Is John's wife, Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), knows something about it? "Wonderland" is a trained, intense tension, a story of hopeless love and a story of every angry enemy in one of the guys; The Rashoman technique has a clever use of it (we have a strange day and night, David, John, Dawn, Susan (though very short) and Sharon's eyes, beautiful direction and great script, Kudrow's powerful Sharon and Bosworth's innocent Dawn, Launius's strange, hopeless, challenging, sometimes childish Holmes, is a must for Kilmer's performances, leading to the central stage with Lucas <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
