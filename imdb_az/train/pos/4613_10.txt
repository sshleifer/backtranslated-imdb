This movie has one of the most cheesiest I've ever seen. It's so awesome for me! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis come from the original Munsters series very well. While still less rifles, they were still "funny" together. I wish Yvonne De Carlo, like Lilli, to have more evidence. She has shown that she can make a comedy in her original series, but it's getting worse in the movie. This movie also loves great Sid Cesar, but unfortunately, it has nothing to do with Gwynne and Lewis. I think that would have been a better job than this.
