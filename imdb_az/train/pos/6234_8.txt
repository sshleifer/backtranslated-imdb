This is my favorite movie, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between the two parties is so sweet and funny and very clever. Some of the best songs recorded by both of these films are not recorded in this movie; It's like putting my egg in a basket and facing music and dance. If I remember correctly, it was a movie that introduced me to Fred Astraire, so it always took a special place in my heart (I apologize for the charming lady) in this movie gets me 8/10. Choreography was perfect, and the fact that Lucille Ball was in was even more awesome.
