This is one of the rare films, it is a beautiful and attractive, dignified and strange, real gift. I do not consider it a fact for Italy on any trip or vacation, because it reminds you to open yourself to a wider experience (yup, magic). I particularly liked Josie Lawrence as Lotie Wilkins, but every leading and supporting actor is flawless in this movie. Of course, if you attract fashion and costume, she does pretty well. I only want DVDs to be released, because I was wearing the tape version! <br /> <br /> You value your time very well, just sit down to watch, no breaks.
