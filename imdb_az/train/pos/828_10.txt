I felt that NEW HOPE and the opposite of the worker were in Top 10, but this is not in Top 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation due to Ewoks, but there are many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - when it comes to character, completes Han Solo's debt sub-plot. <br /> <br /> The Emperor was finally revised: it is good that this work can not be started now, but we have seen the emperor as a child, even though the preceding exercise was carried out. <br /> <br /> - Speeder Bike Chase: Okay, that's why it was a special moment of action. But it was one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all films! Part 3 Climax: 1) Endor fight (controlled by Han and Leia) 2) Luke opposes his father Emperor's fall 3) Destroying the Second Death (Lando Momenti) <br /> < Last Action With Our Heroes: I said that this film is Ewoks <br /> <br /> Here, while celebrating the whole galaxy of EMPIRE, our heroes live in a private party in the forest with each other. <br /> <br /> All this is a great final match of our heroes and STAR WARS story.
