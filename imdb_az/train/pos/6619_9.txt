<br /> <br /> Lost Children's City (with increasing emotions or whatever used, abused, and mostly good, just giving us less imagination), Blade Runner (Deckard Replicant!), <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> br> </ strong> Miyazaki's things to me. <br /> <br /> Hmm, this is the "cartoon" part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My film has a close love-hatred relationship, and if it is, <br /> <br /> This film has many fantastic and nudious themes that describe only one miracle. <br /> These people did an incredible job!
