Cheerful, evocative, mixed, bright film. Reminds of Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain - looking for and looking for many strange characters ..... In the theater, the spectators who surrounded me almost laughed at almost all of them while keeping peripheral eyes in their surprising and sometimes terrifying reactions. If it had been an end, he would have walked through all the ways that had been poisoned before and after, inside and out. I just want to remember everything. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this movie has the most positive memories. As long as I can not get home and watch it, I have to wait several years before going back to Crispin Glover Big Slide Show (and what's next?) ... I saw this movie in Atlanta almost a crash After being exposed to a car crash, I saw a very good state, perhaps because of the prophetic conversations, the high heroic suit and the Gulaissian queue, strangely covered the twist of DADAist breathing imagination. <br /> <br /> Is this the statement of life? Of course, everyone is EXPECTS for the art of being alone. I think that the truth is clearer and worse. What we are not told is something that we are saying, but it is true that other people are consuming day and night. Instead, "WHAT?" <br /> <br /> Mr. Glover is a fun guy to watch on the screen or at the Big Slide Show, "Titanic" or "Seattle Sleepless" (more than 5,000 movies) - smart, funny, excitement transmitter and strange hot). More movies, more books, fears.
