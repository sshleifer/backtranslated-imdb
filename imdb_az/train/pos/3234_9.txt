I thought it was a very clever movie. I was very pleased and could not really ask for more. Actually, I have a movie because someone did not give it back ... What I need to do, but I want to keep it for my love. Moreover, I do not have many foreign movies, and this is the first. Now I personally love fin cups, and I add that I really like it. But in general, it's worth watching its value. <br /> <br /> If you try to figure out Finland or read Subtitles, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
