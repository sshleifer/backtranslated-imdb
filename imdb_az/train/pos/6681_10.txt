This movie is more worthy. It has a very entertaining, beautiful joke and vision gogs, there are some materials for Geeks (and we know who we are) and the effects are really effective. Watching the Paul Reubens fart, deserving the Academy Award, is worth the admission price only. I have never read the novels before seeing the film, but since then. They are good as they are, yet they come from MM movie. Greg Kinnear is a good thing ... (Captain is incredible and can be NO ONE ELSE) What is the favorite line in the Row movie except William H. Macy? "We have a blind date with Destiny, and she was ordered to lobster." Watch this movie. Buy this movie! Local Wal-Mart has only $ 5 and some changes. Thank you. Indeed, you will be. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo. EVERYWHERE it deserves to watch
