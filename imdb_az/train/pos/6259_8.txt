I am very surprised by the fact that this film is "boring" and that the beautiful scenery is exposed to black and white charm. It was in 1925! I think it's incredible for the time! <br /> <br /> Traveling through these people is remarkable. They took only one week to cross the river. Women climb their backs on the backside of heavy wooden cradles, sometimes in the snow. I would like everyone to see it now! <br /> <br /> I really thought it was a beautiful movie with amazing pictures and an incredible story.
