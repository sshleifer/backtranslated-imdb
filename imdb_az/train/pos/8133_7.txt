Yes, I'm not a rap personally, but I still find that the fear of the black hero is cheerful. I did not get some of the jokes, but some knew it and was funny enough to make me laugh after stopping laughing. I am a big fan of the Spinal Tap, of course I have to check it out. This was sometimes a manifestation of the Spinal Tap, but it was still a peculiar, intelligent and funny satire. I personally love: "There was no hats to protect them from the sun during the slavery, and at the end of the day they were very tired to rebel, and now we have hats."
