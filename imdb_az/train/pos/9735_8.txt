Romantic comedy is the right way to describe "Do not lose friends and make people easier". The main romance in the field is transferred from the fairy tale to the much more interesting "jewelry". As the story line flies a bit, there are some screen-shaped feelings; the key relationships that make up "office politics" and that the "nitri is flawless" that goes beyond the path of use, which uses almost no non-related scenes used for funny effects. However, this works well with Pegg, especially on the front seat. The film is ultimately very clever, sharing the stars with Pegg's shareholder in Trans-Atlantic relationships, and is well-integrated between the high and low society, and the story is a pretty strange thing to do. Different characters in the film are well illustrated and the shooting is an absolute addition to the film. Relationships between Pegg and Huston, and "love, hatred" between Pegg and Dunst, work in a charming way, both in a good job and in a better way. Even Fox, the main asset, is, of course, sexually appealing, shocks are pretty dark, and the "bimbo" role is good. One of the smallest details is a great deal of work. From transgender robbers to an incredible soundtrack, all this can only be described as intelligent comedy.
