Although this movie is filled with up to eighty cheese, there's a place for me on DVD rack and I do not know why. I believe that I love it because the moral aspect of the story is that "television is garbage, so turn it off and get a life". Those who decide to warn you should try to read a book, but you should not view the movie as nothing. At the end of the story, deadly wounded Richards crashed into a network building and killed himself, leaving everyone inside and closing the network. I read it many years ago, but today it is difficult to compare with 9/11.
