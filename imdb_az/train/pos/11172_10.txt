Personally I love this movie and my novel (I read his first book and decided to see the movie). Initially, the plot is really original and a kind. Acting is great and I love it here. Judd Crandall (Fred Gwynne plays) fulfills his role perfectly and really sells you. There are several spider lines thrown there (Idk, if they're corny), but they really mitigate the mood and provide a good laugh. The Maine's atmosphere is really a great place to shoot this movie, and this kind of movie attracts you. You just love it, but if you still want to see it, I'd like to invite 100% to any horrible fan!
