I'm really excited to go to the Milanese movie shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who declares Roman philosophy correctly and happily. <br /> <br /> The movie, starting with "birth", "Milan" death. The birthday is typical of any original scheme and covers all wedding guests in a returning story of how couples come to each other and feel love. Mila's "heart" makes life more difficult, and the desserts are finally product after the old days are tougher and tougher: it's getting weaker than just a few couples, because the "metropolis" is personality. With all the "creativity" in the stress environment, the ad environment helps to approach the field well. We lose the values ​​of life and it is well and deeply reflected in this beautiful and sharp film of Senza Pelle director. <br /> <br /> Players are well chosen, Stefania Rocca is beautiful and well-characterized and is a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br />
