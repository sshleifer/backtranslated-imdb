This film is a shame that will be avoided by those who hate football because of the title. Bending like Beckham is much more than a cheeky sport snicker. Unless you touch the story line and do nothing elegant, jokes loudly laugh and symbols move well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley give juvenile jacks like Jess and Jules, both great in spots and offs. Anupam Kher is as beautiful as Jess's anxious father and 'Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who is so strange at Satan and Ride, is a beautiful man once utilizing a beautiful Irish accent! If you do not love football, watch this movie. If you have something, you will smile.
