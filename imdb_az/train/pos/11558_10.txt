The film "Odd Couple" is one of the most prestigious films. People know everything, sing songs, complain of those who live with Oscar or sensitive "Felix" ... But they sell the movie without knowing it. It's not just a good man living with a clean man; the portrait of two friends who helped each other after the divorce. This is a curse from beginning to end, but it is a kind of comedy that is realistic, stressful and simply terrible. Some viewers have really been a little worried about the movie, but I think that verisimilitude is its strength. In addition, the face of Matthau's bulldog creates me! My favorite comedy, by a country mile.
