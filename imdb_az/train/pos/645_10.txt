I hate French movies for a long time, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most warm French movie ever. In the mid-1970s I saw twice and then disappeared. But finally, in 1999, I was forced to see it again and again fell in love. The most remarkable thing is that it's a little fresh every day, just 25 years ago. Do not miss your chance if you do not see it!
