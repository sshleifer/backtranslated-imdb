I saw it on the big screen and was covered with it. <br /> <br /> The age of Queen Victoria is a mystery and this is a perfect illustration of how a young girl is affected by one of the highest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The focus on history and detail comes from this world. Perfect as Emily Blunt Victoria. Prince Albert played with his mother Elizabeth 1 and William IV! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of English and United Nations history is a great part.
