The novel novels were forcing me to study in the course. I did not think I would like a kid's novel; moreover, the other two books forced to read for the class were really bad. But I was surprised that I really liked the holes. This is one of the best-selling novels I've really read. I think she has a rare quality that appeal to pre-teenagers, adolescents and adults. Anyone who reads this will think of a better person. I can not say that there is a lot of movie, though I took it very seriously. I do not think the film's audience will go as it is enriched, but, of course, they will have fun without the side effects of being stupid when they sit down. It was a clever story and was told in a very good way. I think this is very fast. It takes more time to develop Roman characters. And flashbacks do not have much time to sign up and sign up soon. In the past, interethnic romance feels more strange and strange than the novel. And the ending, which combines all the soft threads, is very ridiculous. This novel is exactly the same, but there is an absurd feeling in the film. It works very well. I also do not like many pop songs. I do not think Disney did not feel the need to sell these films. Casting is as good as the younger children to the old ones. Jon Voight is particularly great. Why is not we very confident, though, that we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10.
