I've seen Blob a few times and is one of the less expensive budgetary foreign occupation films since the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteorite territory outside of a small town and an old man are going to investigate it. A strange jelly, like a substance, gives himself to one of the weapons and sees the meteoric soil over time and seizes a few young people who are taking him to a local doctor. The physician and his nurse are further increasing their victims and masses. When these events are reported to the police, the young couple do not believe and accuse them of doing all that. Finally, they believe that the masses are now turned into a movie theater of the big city, and everybody shouting in the street. Then he sits in the dining room with a young couple and some others. Blob is freezing firefighters and freezes them with weakness. Later, the plane is delivered to the Arctic frozen waste and removed from there. <br /> <br /> This film has a typical structure in its time: teenagers and a small town. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> The Blob Following in 1972, and in 1988 came a remake, but this is the best of The Blob movies. The cast is run by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and plays him a star and Aneta Corsaut his girlfriend. I do not know any other stars <br /> <br /> Blob is for all scientists. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Price: 5 to 4 stars.
