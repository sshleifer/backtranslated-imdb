Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese mafia wars can not be distributed outside Western film festivals. Why? Do you see your sneering insulting video of a police officer, male and female suspects (and bringing joy to the victim) or an elderly woman tearing her head out of the skull? This is one of the few shocks in the store for those watching the story of ultraviolet policemen and bandits. <br /> <br /> The Clockwork Orange, which has been seen in the UK for many years as a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see this movie? YES is a fantastic and groundbreaking review for fans of the Asian cinema. There are shocking moments that these symbols have what they have in the world. If you like, make sure to keep Dead or Alive closer (of course, the last of DOAs). There is a talent like Miike, who works simultaneously with Takeshi Kitano in Japan. A retrospective film at a movie festival is the best chance DVD to watch this movie outside Takashi Miike. If I have not tried to hunt the Hong Kong version on the Internet, I'm sure it will be in this country.
