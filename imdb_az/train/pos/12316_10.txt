Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, besides one of the biggest wuxia pian films ever filmed in any film, is a beautiful and romantic love story that should be attributed to each girl's collection, as well as an impressive choreographed martial art film. The kidnapped Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a travel tax collector who spent the night in a delayed temple. Staying at the temple, he is the sword of Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Tree Devil and the beautiful betrayal, Lit Sin Seen, by his beloved Joey Wong. <br /> <br /> He needs to rebuild his body to get rid of the devil's traces in Satan's hands you must travel to the underworld to defeat a stronger devil. <br /> <br /> It's impossible to say good enough things. this movie. Pacing is perfect with a perfect combination of romance, movement, fantasy and humor, and will not give less chance to breathe the furious throw. Chemistry between the outstanding tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career has been ended very soon) allows the audience to really feel for both. Indeed, all of these are moody and full of life, and I can say that is one of the fun experiences I've had so far. Most of the loan went to Wu Ma in the description of the mysterious Sword Yin. Losing an accidental sword of the body is an entertaining personality to break the evil, leading to some spectacular moments and traditional HK drama. A beautiful honey, light cinema and red movements with the glory of Cing Siu Tung, rounded up this beautiful film. You can find any copy. 10/10
