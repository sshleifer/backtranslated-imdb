It's one of the best kung fu movies, but I'm not perfect, as I've been hoping for. The film has been launched in a very entertaining way so that they translate the language barrier (less than you think) and create sequences of non-combat dialogue (a great compliment for a kung fu film). Pedicab Driver looks at us from the contemporary village of China, in contrast to the time series numbers or the other Chinese action movies that followed police traps (Jackie Chan Police Story I). Unfortunately, at 1/3 of the film, he focuses on the dark melodrama disaster. I did not think it was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The move is absolutely fine, with only Sammo's 2 stars of 1/2 Shaw Brothers, Kar-Leung Lau and then the tall man who always plays Jet Li's bad guy. There's only a 20 minute battle here, it's a standard, but what's bothering me is the explicit acceleration of camera frames. I have to shoot half a dozen films to avoid damaging each other, but there are always adjustments, and then this is it. <br /> <br /> If you like Kung Fu movies, my idea here will not be upset you, and if you do not know it, I've read your life for 2 minutes.
