Gentleman Jim writes legend. Errol Flynn plays a rude but charismatic social mountaineer in a fun entertaining game that is hardly breathtaking for legendary boxers. Like Flynn's Light Brigade Charge, here's the historic accuracy looking for it - looking at all the stops, strikingly large, and giving the true energy energy of Raoul Walsh's lively direction. Flynn is still at the height of his power (you will never postpone a mild heart attack during production), Alexis Smith takes on sidekick tasks this time with Jack Lincoln as his father's fiancee, along with a nice romantic freelance partner and permanent sidekick Alan Hale. Indeed, even pirate galleon from Flynn's previous film has come out somewhere in a dockside bout! 103 minutes only by the breeze.
