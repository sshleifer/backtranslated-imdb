This is the funniest shortage prepared by two comic geniuses. When they go, Hardy just goes out of the roof, which hysterically laughs me. I'm sorry that every single Laurel and Hardy fans should look short. I also recommend the Ghost Series. If you're laughing, watch this movie and you'll be happy.
