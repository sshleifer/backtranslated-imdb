Prof. Janos Spirit (Boris Karloff) Radium X is a powerful force to use for atomic energy. Unfortunately, Rukh is polluted by Radium and begins to shine in the darkness - its tangle results in sudden death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but the Spirit starts to crack due to the RADID and its antidote and define it to kill everything that hurt itself. Carloff's "effects" luminous in the dark laughs, but it's still a little funny. It's fast moving, it has some nice atmosphere (Ruhun's "home" warning and the movie may be a dark and rainy night) and Carloff and Lugosi (as usual) give great speeches. Franic Drake (as the spouse of the soul) and Violet Kemble Cooper (like mother) also work well. So, okay, just another notion of Karloff / Lugosi movies. Swallowing is too far from me. I still love it. I'll give it 7.
