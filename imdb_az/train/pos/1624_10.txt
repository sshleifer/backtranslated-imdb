The Old Mill Pond is more than just a 30-year-old African American entertainment, despite all the races (despite the Stephen Fetchit cartoon). I've just mentioned, there are Cab Cowellow, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong's frog or fish versions. Designed by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising, this Happy Harmony is a fun game with the perfect character surrounding the cartoon. All this sounds like the real thing that half may be thought to be. If not, of course, they are unique. Even when a lazy, fast, Fetchit character is traced by a tiger like "Hold That Tiger", he gets an exciting training here. '30s is highly recommended for fans of animation and jazz music.
