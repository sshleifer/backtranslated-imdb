This was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I know that Miss Piggy is the cause of babyhood Muppet Babies fantasy. Songs will remain forever in my head. I just say that Nicky Rodo's Hey Dude is still in my head. Sorry, there are some issues. But if anything likes me, "Bye Bye! Bye Bye!" Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bebe Luego! That made me laugh too much. At the end of my game I absolutely love it. Susa I was surprised that the cartoon characters were thrown at the wedding. I love this movie very entertaining. I took it from the library and got it right now, because I can not keep a copy of the library forever. Ultimately, this is the best movie I've ever announced! In my case, it is better than my favorite movie in Goldmember, Austin Powers!
