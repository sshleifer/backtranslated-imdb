For years, I'm looking for the name of this movie. I believe it was broadcast on television in 1983, when I was 14 years old. I only remember that it was only a teenage girl who survived a plane crash and escaped from Amazon. I was reminded that people were looking for themselves (family) and knew how to handle it. He narrates the story and I remember that the insects are in his skin. I do not remember more about this movie and want to see it again - if this is the one - and if you have any copy, can you send me a letter at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? In fact, I'm wondering if you want to get a copy to see if there's a movie I remember. It was released on Thanksgiving Day in 1983 in the United States and I was having my own problems and this movie really affected me. Thank you in advance!
