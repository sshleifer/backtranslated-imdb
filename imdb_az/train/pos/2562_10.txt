This is one of the biggest love movie ever seen. Yes, I can admit that some parts are dated, but this should not be overlooked. From time to time, we should try to follow, criticize and enjoy any form of art. Obviously, the "Sex of the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was creepy, boring. But when he was judged on the American perspective in 1925, he was fantastic. At the same time, Sayonara's mixed race is a breakthrough film in the eyes of love affair, an American's "obvious fate" of arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures. Gentleman's Agreement is a natural step toward movies. <br/> <br /> <br /> Therefore, even when it is regarded as just a love story, it's not just social commentary, it's fun and awesome, terrible. Although it is an attack on Brando's attack, it is the best in the nuance and characteristic. Buttons and Umekis (both won Oscars) and all the supporting players will be added to the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> The real star Taka is doing an incredible job to feel his passion for Brando, tired of his commitment and loyalty. When she first met and interviewed Brando, her speech was classic and rarely adapted to the movies. The dialogue between Toka and Brando in the locker room in Tokyo at the end of the movie is equally as good. Of course, in today's films, suckling, spitting, and even worse is an example of love, but it's better. It describes true love and passion, not just "heat". If this movie does not touch you, then it's too young, too keen or dead.
