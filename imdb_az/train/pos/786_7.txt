Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are great in this movie. When you're 40 years old and characterized for a while (or your entire life), you may feel that you are frustrated. The film is a reminder of your love for your antenna whilst your favorite antenna is loved anywhere. I liked the fast-paced sexually explicit school teacher (MacDowell) that should not be out of character. Her old student is pretty sweet, and she still suffers from her teacher for a long time. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I thought were very unrealistic or relentless. For example, when a scene from other women's jealousy was missed, and an Andie MacDowell young boy had been created, would an adult police officer (MacDowell's other friend) allow her to behave so badly? Is it so easy for everyone not to stand in front of a car? Of course, accidents take place all the time, but I hope to see a happy marriage with the first man you agree with the hero (I believe that the most difficult part!). <br /> <br /> Maybe the filmmakers have an old man and a young man they are aware that there is no romantic relationship, and they are aware that some of the miracles that will still happen happens to women who are over 40, especially jealousy, the sad ending of the sad woman who lost her true love, but would the last if she continued to live? Until no one knows, though, after a while .... maybe one year later I want to watch.
