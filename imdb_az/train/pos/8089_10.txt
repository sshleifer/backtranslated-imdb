With the release of Peter Jackson's famous "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, Ralph Bakshi's 1978 film, Lord of the Rings, is at a low level. I agree with the majority that Jackson's trilogy is Tolkien's adaptation to the film, but that prevents me from enjoying Baker's ambitious endeavor. <br /> <br /> According to US President Barack Obama, he has at least been inspired to see the movie of Bakhtiar. <br /> <br /> Colorful backgrounds of the film are very good and the score is unforgettable. I'm very pleased with the drawings of the characters. Pippin and Merry, and Eowyn and Galadriel, do not differ from each other, Balrog and Treebeard were unimpressive, but that did not bother me. However, Nazgul is drawn directly and is quite heartfelt. The only thing that disturbed me was Sam's representation; <br /> <br /> This is a novel for their animation techniques. In addition to handmade characters, live actors are included in the animation via a rotoscope. Which of the characters are missed and the rotoscopic is quite clear, but the film's style is not a novelty. <br /> <br /> It was a good decision to use live dancers for martial arts, and it helped make the scenes better. John Hurt, who gave an influential voice to Aragorn, was particularly good. Aragorn is not my favorite character in stories, but in this adaptation, my favorite character was supported by John Hurt's voice. My other darling, the voice was William Squire, which suits Gandalf. The only actor, Michael Scholes, who seemed to be the worst, was Sam, unkind, irritating, and irritating. Another disturbing part of the voice is the wrong phrase of the character and place names. <br /> <br /> While preparing this film, Ralph Bakshi is expected to feature two films. So, in this film, Helm's Deep "The Two Towers" from the start of The Ring of Fellowship, contains half the story. The main reason for this is the highly condensed version of the story in the film's story. I am delighted with original stories and thorough reconciliations, but the freedoms to compress the story have not bothered me, even the choice of leaving Arwen. The main elements of the story were enough to keep me busy in this movie and there was a novelty to greet half the half of the Rings' wisdom in 132 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi's version of the Lord of the Rings is not perfect, and undoubtedly, some Lord. At the depth of the solution, it had a great impact on orch anthem and war. The readers of the rings cries the slices of this story. However, for me, the lack of this film parallels the excitement of seeing an effective adaptation of half of the great trilogy. My only powerful cry is that I am not able to see the second part of this "first great fairy tale" of the Lord of the Rings, as it is given to the budget to build the continuation of Baker.
