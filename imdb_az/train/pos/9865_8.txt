I saw the movie with two adult children. It was not as smart as Shrek, though it was very good. There was no sound in a movie theater surrounded by children at the Spring Festival, so all the kids liked it. There were also parents. Death and the apparent deaths of the characters have brought the appropriate extortion and interpretations. People hope this movie is for kids. Yes, I liked it, though it was successful. Personally, I liked Scrat!
