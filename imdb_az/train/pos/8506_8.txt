. . but it was on an UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy. I really would like to be the owner of the movie, because first of all I look at this bus driver, and when I saw this movie I managed the model bus. It was only during the murder (after 15 years) that OJ was one of those stars. Just remember, he was a driver and a bus hit and managed in a bare way. I have not seen any benefit from this movie since the mid 80's. I really liked the movie, but I do not usually watch alarms, but after reading the summary in the TV guide and watching the start (no fuzzy), I stayed for all the things.
