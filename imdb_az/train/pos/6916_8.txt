Winchester '73 Mann was a film for a big league from the UK, which left James Stewart as a prosperous warrior, leaving his post warfare career (although he took over the Fritz Lang project, possibly Lang deserves). Both men would go to darker places - Mann, with a strange devil raised by the MQM, the Broken Arrow with the Door Gate until it was pleased to release them? a movie about a man who falls his head as a rifle's rifle is given to people throughout the lane before ending in one of the favorite mountain hits of the director, yet still more powerful than the one expected from the studio. Great dialogue, effective support casting? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson? The magnificent visual part of Mann boosts the bar in this way.
