I thought it was a deep comedy. Brosnan genius; Now, as everyone will testify, he must not be a pigeon in the role of bond. Kinnear was charismatic and funny because everyone was playing a role. I do not know when I'm laughing at any movie. What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line feels like a Bangkok whore on Sunday after the left-handed city of 'equipped'. Brosnan left this much bond with this unexpected comedy delicacy. I was impressed with Hope Davis's performance. In this film, everyone has come to such a degree that he has already made the comedy. If you love the dark and sad "Air Man" you will definitely love it. <br /> <br /> I gave 10 votes.
