Giovanna is one of the best works of Calamai's success in Italian cinema. The final sequence of the film shows Mrs Calamai the most ironic twist that serves as the moral substitute for the horrible crime. <br /> One of the best actors, Massimo Girotti, is a hunter man who has been obsessed with Giovanni's generations of his generation, who seemed to be Gino. Gino Giovanna is a perfect person, so Mr. Girotti works with such comfort and sophistication that is not even on the screen. Mr. Girotti puts a person alive with this easy-to-do performance, but could not be seen with another actor. Juan DeLanda looks like Giuseppe, the old man who is in love with Giovanna. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot in a beautiful way by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti.
