What a nice hate? The lack of many romantic comedies is a very mature movie, which is a very attractive and emotional factor. Einstein is acting perfectly by Walter Matthau, and is Meg Ryan's Catherine unforgettable? Is Tom Hanks better than I have seen in these movies? <br /> <br /> You do not need a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and immediately feel her sympathy, and as a young man, she has come to realize the true love of Ed (Tim Robbins). These feelings have a universal challenge, even if I.Q. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not hard, but there are a number of subtexts you are looking at. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, even a great spiritualist; "If it is not possible, then why?" He said. it shows that he is a believer in fulfilling external goals without any direct perception. In this film, there are questions about what the accident really is? Albert and his flaming sidekicks's Catherine are not strangely uplifted, unloved James (Stephen Fry, who feels that he can not help the other cartoon to feel the sense of his life). <br /> <br /> Will not we see how much interference happens in our lives? <br /> <br /> Of course, we often want to think in real life, even though we observe people. We know Edwards is going to get Catherines and learn how Jameses will fix ice water in his veins. As far as I know it is possible to work with the innocent (and, of course, only Caucasian) Eisenhower era.
