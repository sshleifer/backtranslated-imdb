I do not have much to add before, but this is often a movie, and the studio movie is the first (and perhaps only) time dependent on Dead End Kids. Warner supported the guys from assistant helper Ray Enright and a 'A' budget. In each case, we get one of the real processes from those gem shows. They have a large number of lists, but Warner's (Sans's biggest stars) are like everyone who goes on the picture. (Can you see John Ridgely?) <br /> <br /> Just like a mob boss with a messianistic complex, always reliable Eduardo Cianelli from top-level performance. He plays this character almost as a Thuggie leader, "Gunga Din". It's something to watch! And Marjorie Main is good and takes the best role after "Dead End". <br /> <br /> This is a second feature of a double project with something like "City for Conquest". <br /> <br /> Hooray for the warning!
