This movie is great! This stone touched the cold heart. Antwone could not relate to my alien discrimination because of my living in my country. <br /> <br /> We watched this film at the University of New Era in a sociology class and I knew this was a real story, I just thought it was created by an intelligent who wanted to bring fresh air in the industry. <br /> <br /> Nadinin was a shocking person when she was sexually abused Antwone (only six). If I were in his shoes, I could skip a ten-story building. <br /> <br /> Because I'm greeting him because he is very strong. <br /> <br /> Antwion is the scene that touches me when she finally comes face to face with her mother Eva. He did not end up with him or everything, but instead he informed him about the achievements he had been making for many years. (I think I'll be able to watch my roots).
