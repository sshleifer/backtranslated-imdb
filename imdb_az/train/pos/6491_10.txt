The World War is perhaps the largest documentary series of all time. Historical investigations are actually flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive document on WW2. An invaluable historical work that interviewed the most important and interesting figures in the war. I recommend it as a learning experience.
