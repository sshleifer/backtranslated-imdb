My first interest in Whale Music was in 1993 when I was called Reautatics. I read the liner notes, and the band's book, by Paul Quarrington, the Canadian writer Paul Quarrington, is the highlight of my collection. <br /> <br /> After a few months I took my book and burned it! A nice reading! I've read it repeatedly, and I have always read again the desire to complete Whale Music when I find a new item in the drawings. <br /> <br /> I found the video in 1996. I did not have a good experience with the Canadian movie, but it worked for me. Claire's role might have been different, but I think that Paul Quarrington's vision was transferred from the book to the screen beautifully. <br /> <br /> Maury Chaykin is a genius genius who performs moving. Film deals with finding family relationships, love, and understanding. I recommend "Whale Music" not only to musicians, but also to anyone who has lost anything or has come back to the world.
