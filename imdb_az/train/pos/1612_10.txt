The film is head and shoulders above the majority of kinematic romantic comedies. Really impeccable! Writing, moving, production designs, humor, and patchwork are all beautiful! Music from Dean Martin to La Boheme - unlimited and delightful! <br /> <br /> Each character, from the potential of Cher and Nicolas Cage, plays a lot of supportive roles - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even with his dog pack! Each of these performers, as well as Norman Johnson, is the director of this ensemble, superior to his normal qualities. For many actors, this film was an early exposure, with the exception of casting - and in this movie there are many acting acting electric power, which has a good career. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times in all ways - sometimes it can dramatically reduce the effect of a movie. I would like to say more and more that when I went through this channel a few years ago - when I went to any stage, the scene was logical and beautiful. There are many striking and memorable scenes from the original meeting between Cher and Nicolas Cage, who say that the age has become woe; Vincent Gardenia, in the middle of the magnificence created by the gold miner's plumbing, has discovered with the opera paramour; Olympia Dukakis accused John Mahoney of giving his classmate a blessing on his colleagues: "Do not go to bed!"; Danny Aiello, in the bed of the dead mother; Taking Nicolas Cage "like a beard shake in the background"! <br /> <br /> Sabrina (both versions, especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden's original) have great romantic comedies; When I met Harry Sally; <br /> <br /> Ayse Moonstruck is equal!
