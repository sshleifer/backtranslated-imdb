The King's Solomon Giant brings us to Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain), who spends a lot of time in Africa, but it is time to return to England and become a father to his son. She finds that her husband's son is in control of his son and has little chance of earning more money by law. His father, Alison Deedy (played by Elizabeth) in Africa, was captured by the African tribe for his ransom on his map drawn by his father Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth tries to return Quatermain to Africa to find his father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Patrick plays one more strange honorable man. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who easily describes passion, loss and despair, a firm silent good man, anger and power; In King Solomon's Mind, his character really smiles a few times. I would like to see Patrick Swayzeni in a more exciting, lively live story that does not have to jeopardize his jaws and be very powerful. Maybe you will help a little dance. But this is a great movie for the whole family and it's time to watch it.
