Dominick and Eugene's emotional powers and symbols are what Hollywood does not do anymore. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and heartfelt movies I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and actress Jamie Lee Curtis present Oscar Winning caliber performances! There are not enough words to indicate how great this movie is. Of course, people who are not in syndicated movies can not pay attention to the rest of Dominic and Eugene, but for the rest, this is about the heart and compassion and humanity. <br /> <br /> You will never forget this movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> A simple yet eloquent story is skillfully explained. Eugene is a med-intern internship for a long time and at a hospital-required workload. My brother, Dominick (born 12 minutes ago) is in a slightly slow and difficult situation due to brain damage due to his father's misuse. (In this film, a mistake that will remain in tears!) Eugene (aka Geno) faces a painful dilemma. Do not finish the experimental school and ask for a living in another city and leave Dominick ("Nicky") or the rest of her education to care for her. <br /> <br /> <strong> Nicky helps her brother pay school education as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Ethics, morality and responsibility are very useful in this spectacular film. When Gino thinks Nicky can achieve progress in the direction of independence, Dominick turns around to do something like helping a drug dealer, or trying to use a defective cord he finds on an electrical appliance. <Larry is a supporter of The Character and Nicky's trash route. It's all about Dominick's head, Geno and Jennifer, a girl who teaches in clinical pharmacology, going to the Atlantic City and playing gambling. But you can see that Larry is deeply concerned for her. During their time, Nicky also faces a small boy, and we know that his father was also beaten. <br /> <br /> Finally, we'll talk about the events that took place after a few days. <br /> <br /> Indeed, what Nicky wants to do is to be loved and accepted anyway. (he goes to the church, Hulk loves Hogan) Geno likes Nicky more than anything in the world. But can his brother be independent if Geno can pursue his desire to become a doctor? A shining film that gained more recognition than was needed but, unfortunately, came out with Rain Man, who was dealing with similar issues. However, I have a very strong emotional component because I like Dominick and Eugene well. Be aware that this movie is directed to the tear ducts, as Kleenex is affordable! What a movie !!!!
