Welcome to Collinwood, one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. A perfect ensemble, intense arrangements and beautiful direction. <br /> <br /> You can not say much about this movie. Label line tells all this - 5 children. 1 Safe. No brains. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an incredible game. <br /> <br /> You need to congratulate George Clone for the production of this paradise. <br /> <br />
