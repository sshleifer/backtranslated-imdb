I like this TV show because a sixteen year old girl is a witch and lives with her aunties living in her house, and they both have a witch and a girl. Well, it has started to flush out for several weeks. It was so funny when he used his power for the first time, because he turned his enemy into a paradise. He had to return his time and repeat it one day. This series is really nice and a typical teenager, but when she left her home and went to a flat with college college friends, she was gently wearing and then drilling. and the other was really ditzy. I liked Valerie and hated Sabrina's enemy Libby, it was ugly.
