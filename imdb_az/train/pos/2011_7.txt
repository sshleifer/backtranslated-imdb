If you've never seen this movie and like old-time veteran actors, this is a movie for you. Frank Sinatrani was very young, when he saw a very young man with a beautiful sound that sank and sank next to them. Michele Morgan (Millie Pico) made a perfect speech with lots of dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake), a classic pianist and a great supportive role, along with Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor), who played no comic comedy as in his career. It's not a great music, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
