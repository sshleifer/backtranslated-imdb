<br /> <br /> I was prepared to prepare for this episode, this "Master" really does not have a horror movie under his belt ... but this is the best episode of the season. well !! I do not know how she did it, but there are some real talents in this episode! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If you see things away from a mile, at least it was fun and it took me about 56 minutes, something that did not reach this point . <strong> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > As I said in other commentaries - these are not real masters who fulfill many episodes, but one day they can become masters in the future.
