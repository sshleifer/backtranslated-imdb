I approached the film with low expectations, but it was a great surprise. This is very good, and in recent years, especially in the ballroom "Rough Ballroom", she has danced her dance. Although music is beautiful and dance colorful, it's not about film dance for me. This applies to many Japanese employees who work for a long time and have free time after work for non-family entertainment. There is a full family, a great mortgage, and a person who takes on life. She is attracted to the attractive appearance of a young woman in a dance studio during a walk, which results in her ballroom dance tests. The Japanese motif as a result of the beginning of the new passion is the ultimate in making the family and the audience, but in the same way. The attitude towards the ballroom dance transmitted in the film is definitely non-Western, although discipline and music are imported into Japan openly. Cultural contradictions are thus interesting. Even without cultural insights, the enthusiasm of color, dance and gamers makes it an entertaining film to watch all of them.
