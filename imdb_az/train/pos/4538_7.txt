I did not want to watch this movie after reading Maltese's look and 1/2 star rating. I always looked at my son's advice and found it to be better than expected. I would give 2 1/2 stars from a 4 star system. You have to watch a few times to understand the entire movie. If you do not know a lot about religion, you will miss most of them. I graduated from high school for a whole year, perhaps even better. Yes, there are some claims in the film and it's a bit strange, but it was in the 1970s, so what are you waiting for? People can not see why they do not like the movie; But I do not understand people who say that rich. The film is a dull thing. You either hate it or you like it. If you find him digging it, maybe the brain has died.
