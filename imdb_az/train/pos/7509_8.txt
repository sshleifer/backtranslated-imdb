Written by Mary Harron, written by Mariam Harron and Guinevere Turner <br /> <br /> How do you define a person who is always between the two worlds, one of the possible sins and the probable payment? In particular, he has begun to violate personality disorder in his later years as a person shows his ending point. If you are the director Mary Harronsans, do not hesitate to show the seductive / attractive nature of the NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE. You allow this character to go back and forth between the dominant illusion of control and domination, which grants the power of God and of the church and the pinup model in the community. By doing so, the spectators are offered a complex character with a tough wish in the curse of others and a desire to fight for the reconciliation of his image in God's sight. <br /> <br /> With the most black and white (with some unnecessary bursts colors), NOTORIOUS BETTIE is sometimes a fun, enjoyable experience, and even a fun, comic comedy that makes entertaining entertainment fun as to how pornography is believed to be corrupt. But the sensitive hands of the director are more striking when desperation takes place. Harron is a sensitive, thought-provoking filmmaker who does not miss a large number of devastating blows in front of his audience. Instead, Gretchen Molla, who is strikingly effective, plays a major role in frustrating the chances of suffering the trauma of the traitor, as well as the embarrassment of his tiredness and tiredness. Many directors, perhaps most men's directors, considered important to show heroism in vital positions to make contact between thrilling species, where Harron took her life where Harron acted as a character, actress, and her audience. Due to fragility, the man learns to rely on people again and love more of the photographer's image, and he is in love with his admiration and control over his gaze. <br /> <br /> Because Mary went through S & M's territory, she combined her need to respect the objectivity she was accustomed to her whole life. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron Bettie Page is a woman who wants to control her life and death, but it is said to be where to stop, how to smile, and what to wear. Finally, when he realizes that none of the elections is his own, he chooses to accept God and to preach to his hearers. The real sadness behind this most important decision is that it is still someone else's blind orientation; there is more confidence that his spirit will be better in this direction.
