This is called "good feelings", but it saddened me somehow. Why? But I had the talent, but my parents did not allow me to study at the sports academy, and I decided to leave football at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> And football is a red line in this movie. Parents have expectations together with young people. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, on the other hand are an English family, dresses like a boy and playing soccer ... merging with her mother! This film also shows the lives of ordinary people in Indian society. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (beautiful women) plays a girl, Yasminda, not interested in boys, new clothes, makeup and typical 17 year old girl staff. In contrast to her sister Pinky, complete the contrast of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> A young man is able to see how a beautiful girl struggles with her parents' traditions and eventually succeeds. <br /> <br /> With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C and Indian songs. <br /> <br /> It's nice to watch, but if you, like me, have never played football, and never again, this movie will make you melomonic.
