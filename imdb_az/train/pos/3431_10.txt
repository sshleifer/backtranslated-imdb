Though the Finnish director Ilkka J채rvi-Laturi has been prepared, it is the best Estonian film I've ever seen. Tallinn Pimedus A national treasure from the Estonian Republic is a fun tension about a band of robbers trying to steal a large amount of gold. At the same time, it is a summary of many Eastern European countries. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union was split, and many other countries such as Estonia became independent. Now, in most of these countries, conditions may be better. But in the early 1990s, many of these new nations fought against corruption and organized crime that they inherited during the Soviet era. (And many of them are still at least at one level ...) The Tallinn Pimedo is a very topical film with incredible characters of that era and a well-written scenario. Actors are also very good, especially Jury J채rvet (perhaps the best-known Estonian actor, Snaut in Tarkovski's Solaris), an old gangster who plays and slowly tired of his lifestyle. But one of the most striking performance Monika Mager, a kid in the early teenage teenager, playing the role of kid player Terje, which area is quite important. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But Tallinn does this to Pimedusa. Unfortenately J채rvi-Laturi other films are far from such a success. First, Kotia p채in was very artificial and his last, just a strange mess made the Night of the Night.
