This little film is a stroke and a chill for retreat. It withdraws from some clichés of the genre and adopts a weak approach. About the woman looking for her missing lover; a psychiatrist who suddenly disappeared for no apparent reason. His search leads to a villa filled by a group of excentric persons. <br /> <br /> The murder of genuine giallo is never too far away. <br /> <br /> The belt is really good. Aldofo Chile, Thalasso, Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat O 'Nine Tails) and very young Sybil Danning (80's cries of queen). The main role player Rosemary Dexter and I do not know him, he does a good job to take pictures. <br /> <br /> One of the features of the Eye in the Labyrinth is its music. It is a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack for a cialis shot. Built by Roberto Nicolosi, Miles Davis remembers his work, especially on Silent Road. It's a beautiful soundtrack and really gives you a different idea of ​​this movie's most gialli. <br /> <br /> This is a cherry that we really should talk about murder kits. That's a bit of a movie. This, of course, does not separate from them, but is less and far between them. The opening ghost is probably the best and memorable burning car sequence offered. But this is not really a particularly fierce movie. Still, I do not think it's too much of a ghost dream to be loved by fans of the genre. Sirr kifayət qədər məcburedici və kifayət qədər ekssentrik simvollara malikdir (əxlaq oğlu Saro və bu unsettlingly uyğunsuz dublyaj vurğu?) Və qəribə təmin etmək üçün qəribə anlar; <br /> <br /> The Maze eye Giallo version of Agatha Christie play as a secret, because the villa has a number of non-sympathetic characters. Under suspicion of murder; There are mandatory flashbacks that extend their connection with the deadly (not extremely competent) deadline. This is an example of the genre, though, many of the sub-genre cəkinməyincə other films, it's certainly an attractive different. I give this one finger for Giallo enthusiasts, and I hope one day is a nice DVD transfer. Of course, he deserves treatment.
