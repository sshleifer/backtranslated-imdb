The sweet little episode was mostly for laughter, but with a smart doll. In any way, a Martian shouted a bus on the way to a road, but only with a passenger (talk about illegal immigrants!). In addition to the frenzied faces of John Hoyt (the most obvious suspects), wild eyes Jack Elam (unpleasantly pulling him), hot dogs Jean Willes (he said Marsli, I said open the borders), John Archer and Barney Phillips (and Bill Kendis as a bus driver). The action is limited to a bunch, but it takes half an hour to entertain.
