O my brother ... just breathe in a minute. This movie takes you to an awesome ride and can not go on the last blow on your face. This is a movie for Stormriders fans. The legend of Zu was beautifully created, though I did not like a few things, they used the stands more often. I really wanted to see a man's battle, but a good thing ... caused a few small losses, and I did not like it until I watched more. I encourage everyone who wants to see this movie in order to see this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings. When I go out in America I see him!
