I had no idea of ​​how to describe this movie, and I would like to give the same opportunity I have seen beforehand without telling others what to expect. I'm very glad, but in the first place, I did not understand what happens if something happens to understand. The admirer of David Lynch (Tangentially) or Guy Maddin especially likes it, and everyone on the EQBBLOL comic book will probably be happy and surprised (this is close to any movie I've seen for myself) <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ... hmm, good ... yes. These are strange wild things.
