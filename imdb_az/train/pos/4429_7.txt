Personally, I thought that the film was pretty good, from the very good of Taji Taniobu Asano, with Ichi's Killer fame. Indeed, I can not say a lot about the story, but there was a bit of mixing up parts, and in general, I thought the film was too long. In addition, the film has a great deal of great fighting and many of the places are beautifully shot, great effects, and many swords. In my opinion, Tadanobu Asana's other efforts. Yes, I can not really say no more about the movie, but if you only look to Asian cinema, if it's not Tiger's Hidden Dragon or Flying Dagger's House, I can say that Asian cinema fan should have a very good Japanese movie in this collection.
