The 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade Gold Diggers had to continue with the same show theme in the Broadway Theater world. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films featured the Californian choreography of Busby Berkeley, showing tune-up melodies and many supporting actors. <br /> <br /> These are classics of the genre, but it's the best choice for me. The foot was power-driven energy and led by James Cagney.

Unfortunately, thirty and sometimes they would never have seen such a rich music track. again. Confidence and morality from him.
