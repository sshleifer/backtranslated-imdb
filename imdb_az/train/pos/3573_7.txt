this movie was almost a great creative film. A mixture of sarspir, pop, jazz and stunning fairy tales. This movie was a creative twist on Cinderella theme. With a powerful castle led by the perfect cast Kathleen Turner, this movie had everything to do with it. Everything except production values. I do not think a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but it has the same quality as anyone who has been prepared for a movie on top production. Along with better cinematography, this movie was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
