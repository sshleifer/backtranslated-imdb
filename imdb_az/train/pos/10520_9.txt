I've seen this movie with Jane Austen, a filmmaker who combines the complexity of novels, and that's always a suspicious movie: well, this transposition is just perfect, accurate, clever, gentle, attentive, sensitive, sensitive, dense! <br /> <br /> Emma is one of Austen's most enjoyable and funny novels. The film respected this delicate irony, despite the funny thing (although not all of Miss Bates was above it). What attracts me in the novel, and the film clearly shows it, is a contemporary look of the human life of the English writer and is related to the relationships of women, men and their relationships, and it is striking that the romantic writer of the 18th century was almost an arrogant living, could understand the depth and the truth about his life: most and still loves me. In the film we can feel this modernity: it simply has to replace suits and use a more current language, but the situations, feelings, ideas are extremely modern. I have a negative impact on the lives of my friends, or I think that women's relationships have come to power and that they even have difficulty expressing some of their feelings, especially when it comes to love: every situation is universal and comes out of the way. Tony is really talented and offers very good and extremely striking demonstrations: young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (today he is likely to be very competent), Tony Colette is just great. How did I hurt them for the beautiful clothes they wear? And then, in every aspect of a breathtaking English village with a dimension such as magic and imagination ... a really nice and worthy movie.
