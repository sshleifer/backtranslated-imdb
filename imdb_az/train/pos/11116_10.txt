"The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" No one above the "The Sopranos" complex glow. Each character is totally and completely three-dimensional, definitely has a layer of data.

See "Sopranos" as you openly challenge your feelings and change your emotions. I apologize to anyone who does not want to watch the first episode of the 1st episode of the season and continue with the series. Every season is absolutely brilliant. DVDs are important for everyone to gather
