Diego Armando was Maradona and still offered the game as the best player ever. Not just an athlete but an artist. The 1986 World Cup will last forever in the memory of every football fan. Thanks to his great and incredible goal of hitting his own country (English). There is no point in reducing this star. I'm not Spanish right now, though I appreciate the Argentinean author. She really cries for happiness and can only express her feel ..... Everything I write is meaningless and hard to understand, but the readers ..... you have to watch it to know what I mean.
