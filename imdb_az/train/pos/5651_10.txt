It was a little strange and bad, and I liked it so much that the characters in the show were great and mimic each other in a good way. I'm sorry to see your past. You love to see what I'm running away. You have gone to Lucas Buck, who is looking for more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was scary and charming. When I looked at him more and looked like his character. It was nice to have something different on TV, just getting to get the show. And Caleb's cousin Paige Turrco, it was a great mystery about where and what she meant for Lucas. His shame is still not around ... or it's not over, I'd like to see what happens.
