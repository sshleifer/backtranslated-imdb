This movie definitely gets a finger from me. False jokes about the Oriental nations, and sometimes even erroneous and provocative views, slamed me throughout the film. This area is smart and 100% original and you can guess along the entire movie. The most affected person in this film was Hilary Duff. It's simple and straightforward to see that an argument outside the genre used by the genre is thrown. His emphasis is perfect, and its operation is strikingly crisp and well-realized. I've seen Hilary's best performance and most of his films. His character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "Britney Spears in Eastern Europe", and in some of her behavior and song, "I want to hit you ..." ... is above. Yonica is a very complex and mixed character. Joan Cusack, laughing along with me all the time, sometimes with wrapped humor, but also his facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's virtuous dialogue will likely force you to scream. I strongly recommend this movie.
