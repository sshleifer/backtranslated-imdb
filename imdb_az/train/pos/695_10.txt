This movie draws you and keeps your eyes on the screen. The writer / director will capture all of these with you, using bright, creative and exciting camera angles and perspectives with storytelling. Insomniac's Nightmare is an original and refreshing difference from any movie you see. Is it a dream or reality? This indie will discuss the curves and pass the conscious and subconscious. It feels like the dark interpretations of these illusions. Dominic Monaghan was really insomniac. He is a great actor who is not heavy in his eyes! He really poured all his existence into this role. This indie becomes a favorite until I get to this story. I highly appreciate this proposal and expect more from this innovative, creative writer / director / cinematographer!
