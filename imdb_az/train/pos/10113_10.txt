I liked this movie. Divorced Ed Wood Jr is not a fan, but I appreciate his "exuberant enthusiasm" and accepts his shortcomings. Her films are entertaining, but her personal story is poured with pain. I hoped, and it would have been easier to understand the harder life of this movie than to compliment it. <br /> <br /> This movie is transforming into a mythology from a documentary, so unexpectedly joining each other and Ed Wood Jr and releasing a viewer. <br /> <br /> What we do is talking about Ed Wood's all perspectives, positive and disadvantages, and showing us the character of Ed. <br /> <br /> We give Ed's personal and professional lives: his romance, drinking, sex, friends, enemies, and even filming. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is the most naturally-used filmmaker's technology since 1996 would be disrespectful (such as wearing a more beautiful suit than the president). <br /> <br /> The changing designer uses a range of ideas, along with the sense of humor, to suit each player sequentially. The names are excited to hear personal reports about Ed Wood controversy and the newcomers are surprised that this person is real. It is impossible to find DVD movies ("Lorado and Crossroads" and photo galleries), but the true treasure of this film is a striking and connected story. <br /> <br /> When it came to the point that Ed Wood had come up with a certain habit as a "Pool Owner", he and his friends (or better or worse) communicated with him to allow him to baptize in the pool. The ability to identify a person's legacy is universal because the film's most beautiful effect is not that Ed Wood Jr's not giving a good circle of views, but it's also created. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify; even the title is instructed in the genre of horror in the B-list, but it has ended even if it is a kindness.Starting as random stories by random people, an unexpected way that can lead to a horrifying combination of all the stones forever with Wood's legend but with Ed Wood Jr's focus on many aspects, it's closest to knowing what we can do. <br /> <br /> Combining herself with a topic, at one point it is respectful, provocative, thoughtful, flaming, entertaining, sad, kind and fulfilling.
