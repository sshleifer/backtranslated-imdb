It presents consistently small and gritty movies. This Frankenheimer is one of the best and most underrated movies and is easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation ever to date (and despite having to think of it, I love to get to others). In my opinion, no one sees "feel" for the characters of "Leonard" and then John Glover at 52 PICK-UP. Moving the story from Detroit to Hollywood (movie) raises the sleaze factor of the story to incredible altitudes. Be a man, have some beers and watch this movie. My favorite Leonard books for reference purposes: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Ups. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and MANCHURIAN REPRESENTATIVES. DEAD BANG and BLACK For the cold market, I have a special place in my heart.
