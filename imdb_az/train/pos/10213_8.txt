This strange movie was also unhappy with the release of the famous Amelie, but also with the beautiful Audrey Tautou playing a central role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie, The French name, the chaos that the Butterfly wings blow on the Atlantic and the hurricane in the Pacific, looking at these colored insects are just what you should not believe. From the start of the film, the CEO combines all the characters you see in the movie and each other's relationships, which are hard to imagine, but there's a good job in the context of the film. <br /> <br /> A chance meeting at the Metro gives you tons for the movie. To work, Irene is asked by a woman sitting in front of her to tell her what the Zodiac sign is and continues to read from her paper. Irene will be able to pass these paths and on the same day her spirit will find her husband. After leaving Irene, a quiet man sitting next to a woman says that she had the same birthday history as Irene. Naturally, they started each other, but, unfortunately, they will not reunite until the last frame of the film. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is as beautiful as Irene. Faudel, playing Younes, does not do much to the end, but he shows his presence and plays a good part. <br /> <br /> For the success of the movie, a talented young cast film plays a vital role as a butterfly wing. <br /> <br /> For Laurent Firod's future films, he is a heartwarming filmmaker, looking forward to talking to people in the right place and on the ears.
