The book that was the basis of this film was perfect; It's been a while to meet Hou√©lbecq's unusual style, but once I realized that the writer, writing behind the article, was completely drawn into the world of imagination. In fact, no book had really touched me. It is not necessarily a good thing - it has clarified our own struggle and it was more difficult to accept the benefits of our struggle. Houellebecq's concepts are carefully crafted by Harel and describe the hero's apathy and indifference to a world that rejects it. This is a film that reveals the present-day society for all these fears. Hopefully in the future everything will change, but today we need to adopt rat-race as shown in this film. Harel or Houellebeck does not create such a great work. Sufficient for each person.
