I saw this movie while traveling in Brazil. Brazilian culture and society was hard to understand because there are many regional and class differences. It was a revelation to see the film itself in Sao Paulo. It shows something of many Brazilians' daily lives. On the other hand, sometimes it is a bit dramatized. And that's a negative idea for me. Sometimes there are too many sex, many killings and many cynicism for a movie. The director can do some things slightly, making the film more effective. Nevertheless, I liked the movie and the story opened itself. Heroes are like complex and very real life people. Not many American actors and actresses with so many cosmetics, but also those who are ugly and beautiful. Even if the story is not convincing, it will make this movie.
