<br /> <br /> There are some commentaries on this film that's a bad and terrible kind and a great player like Pierre Fresnay should not accept it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pierre Fresnel, <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Even a defrocked one? ? It can turn Christ into blood, the scene is perhaps strange. <br /> <br /> The scene of the death of the little priest is a great shock. However, it is very unpleasant for someone who is raised in the Catholic framework, though it is very touching. But it is a very good move. Pierre Fresnay turns Morgan, who has been subjected to a grave criminal act that, in terrible terms, has been subjected to torture in his temporary madness.
