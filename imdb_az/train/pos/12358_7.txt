the film is more complex and intelligent, investigating sexual tension for 9 and a half weeks ... the court scene itself ... the hero is a couple in the cage while defending their orgasm .. incredible ... I have not seen this movie for more than 20 years ... but he created images that were not erased in my mind ... rich in tissue and successful in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activity, and the yawning angst that lives in everything under it .... the area is European, and a bit meanders, but in life ... At age 17 and always stable.
