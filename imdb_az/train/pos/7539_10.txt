I'm really happy to watch this movie. Like most people watching. I was not sure what I was getting. Whoopi Goldberg has made a very comic comedian and many comic movies; <br /> <br /> Well, that's not really a comedy. a drama with comedy moments. <br /> <br /> This film is about a black family going from a beautiful neighborhood to a middle class neighborhood. I would say more, but I think it will spoil the film. this film deals not only with racial connections between the white and the elderly, but also in the black society. I think that's a chance. If you are not really interested in seeing another movie about racial connections, this is not for you
