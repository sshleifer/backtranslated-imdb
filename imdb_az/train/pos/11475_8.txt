Zero day has one purpose, and it's just a fun, but a message about school shootings on a particular topic. Andre and Calin attacked their secondary school by living two friends. <br /> <br /> The film has begun with some unassuming fashion, followed by some homogeneous short stories with a native announcement of future attack in the amateur youth style and boys' families. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ strong> <br /> /> <strong>> What does film mean? Soon it will motivate you to be murdered. It's very difficult to find a really accurate place. They certainly do not come across as cold-blooded psychopaths, yet they are planning a violent act of cruelty. It feels genius in the part of the zero day. Cal and Andre are constantly talking about how different they are, how we are on top of them, and how they're going to put us behind. As with Columbus's killers, they are really superior. As Nietzsche's dreams, Cal and Andrew's value system seemed to be born of rejecting society. Nevertheless, this is just a hate for a famous athlete. So where is the motivation? I felt that Coccio deservedly described a gesture of his power over the superiority of two persons to give a statement that was no longer fitting. Thus, they are mass murderers and will be able to attract more attention to such people. That is precisely why schoolchildren can do deceptive acts despite the well-to-do houses. Murder is part of a fantasy, and Cal and Andre have never lost their fantasies when they see the truth in their activities. <br /> <br /> The second most important feature of this film is the character development and the dependence of Cal and Andrew on each other. Andre, the leader of the two films, appears to be a little more difficult to embrace Cal's attitudes and dresses in an open-air movie. Andre is very intense, Andre is tight and serious. She is totally far from her family, she is precise and accurate in everything, and for a while she appears in the plot as a head coach. But he looks like his own way, does not cover teenage nonsense, and I feel compelled to agree with some of them, but these moments have broken us by Andrey's signs of violence against us, and he sees us both as a confidant and a potential victim. On the other hand, Cal seems more comfortable in Andred, more realistically. But he is in the right path. There are many personal moments of introspection with Cal's video blog, singles and other scenes. Cal fights with his own personal jinn and uses his plans to get out of themselves. Andre goes to the balo with a friend named Cal, who is jealous and wants to take it all away. Cal shook Andre and encouraged him. For the first time in his life, Andre can not lose it when he finds someone who believes in and honors him. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> When joining Cal Balaca Ball there is a great moment. Suddenly, the star of the film is shy, easily embarrassed by peers. However, we had to keep in touch with Cal, and when they were heavy drinking at their limousine, they were fleeing from the slightest confusion. These are a very common episode. We do not want to get in touch with them, and when it's over, they call out with Cal and Andre, and they make their characters one of the latest videos in the world of fantasy, where they feel safe. <br /> <br /> The past scene is extremely perfected. The last video is armed in the car a few minutes after the attack by Andre and Cal. All this is very real and creates a truly anticipated resurrection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it is certainly a perfect choice to describe the massacre if it is not undeniable. Most importantly, we know that Cal and Andrew are turning into a radical change, knowing that they are looking at this guy and that they still do not know what we know. <br /> <br /> The last scene shows a group that burns themselves: "Violent and realistic, our heroes are monsters, and the reality of their dreams is a great tragedy, and Andre and Cal are hated." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> As we met Andre and Cal, we can only feel a lot of things going on forever, and of course we have not been able to win anything. <br /> <br /> Zero day, everybody who is interested in these violent moves For everyone, this is a character worth the effort.
