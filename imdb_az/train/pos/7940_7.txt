The eye of the labyrinth is not Giallo's average ... and I'm not sure if it's really Giallo to be honest; but in spite of Giallo or some problems, this is, of course, a very interesting little movie. I'm hesitant to call the movie Giallo because the movie does not reflect what the movies are doing; but many genre labels break the mold and it seems like one of them. The film, like Giallo, does not look like every kind of brutal crime, but it is made with a realistic environment and structure that creates enough confusion for speedy curiosity. Although the site seems fairly straightforward, it focuses on a physician killed by Julie, who is fond of her because she loves her and her father as her father. <br /> <br /> We have moved to a large house where many people live, but there is really nothing there is a number of secrets covering various events that took place before Julie's arrival ... <br /> <br /> You can say that your mind is like a maze. This really does not go out and I prefer not just to worry about thinking about the point of the movie (if any), but just go back and love what's happening. The eye of the labyrinth is ruled by Mario Caiano, a few years back, behind the great night of Doomed. He does not create the atmosphere as it used to be in this movie; but the story's surface aspects are good, and the film stays in trouble, always maintained. Rosemary Dexter stars in the film, providing candy around the eyes and providing good performance. Most of the others are, in fact, those who want to have a good tongue, like Adolfo Cell, and Alida Valli. At the end of the movie explains himself; I'm lucky, but I'm sure I'm not the only audience after that, more than a little confusion! In general, this can not be a classic material; but good enough and worth seeing.
