Moonchild is a very difficult movie for categorization. It's easy to think of a few moments of the life of two central characters. These characters are part of a street gang located in a multicultural city in the near future, and one of them does not prevent them from experiencing moments like any other human being, and this is one of the places where the film is so different from what I have never heard before. The fact that one of the main characters is a vampire is essentially irresistible but something else that needs to be addressed. The manner in which characters interact is surprisingly realistic - there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are designed to appear cool, non-functioning, cool, and often neglected by the film itself. <Br /> <br /> Of course, other areas that are different to me are languages. The town of Mallepa covers various cultural groups and speaks the language that is intended for the symbols. Japanese network members talk to each other in Japanese, but they speak Chinese at Chinese conversations with Chinese characters. The most respectable exchange covers the Australian and English language. Among the actors of the four main controversial main characters, there are three different mother tongues and they speak at different levels of each other's languages, so the film is completely prepared. I guess it brings me to leading actors. <br /> <br /> Film is one of the biggest rockstars of Japan, Gackt and Hyde, as well as the Taiwanese superstar Lee-hom Wang, to define or criticize their activities or simply fangirl them. In my opinion, Lee-Hom is the best in playing a straight and real character. However, the lack of functionality in Gacktin's part is mainly due to his tendency to be dramatic in his character. <br /> <br /> Hyde's character is as if it were not as terrible as it is, but it does not give way to this movie. <br /> <br /> More melodrama is a turn-around that makes it hard for me to make emotionally impressive (although it does not seem to stop many of them). I found the best I liked for the movie and I did not get it seriously - it's perfect for a group of friends to go out and watch. It has a shortage, but in general, it was very pleasant and I would recommend it to anyone who does not look at some subtitles.
