I saw this movie after seeing a really boring day on Thursday night. I had no expectations, and I was in a negative situation. The only movie I watch Jimmy is the taxi version of America with Queen Latifah (?) ... why not ask! But seriously ... this movie is very sweet! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I'm in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet such a cute nerd? :) Such films are very good. Simple, sweet and handy. Thursday is Sunday. I'm not even a sportsman, but it's something about American baseball. Probably not here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (still my first comment.) Haha
