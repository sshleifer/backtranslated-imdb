This was my favorite band when I was a kid. The Swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast several times before graduating from the first semester of the medical school. I was surprised to see the depth of the organs explained. Certainly, some things have been simplified, but most of them were correct (even though they were prepared 22 years ago) and quite understandable. We need to follow all the experienced students. For example, it's a great way to learn some basic medical words. Now I think I'm in the 7th semester, and as soon as I got the DVD box, I'll watch the series soon :-)
