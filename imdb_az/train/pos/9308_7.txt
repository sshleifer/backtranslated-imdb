If you use Gabriel Byrne to see a serious role like Tom or Keaton in the Millers Passage on Ordinary Suspects, I recommend that you take a look at this movie. Especially if you are not an admirer of Gabriel Byrn, all actors of this film really give a great impression. If you're nineteen dollars (nineteen penny), order it or rent your favorite movie rental. Guaranteed to make laugh whether it's as normal as gangster-type movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy - One of these unforgettable films is to find yourself looking at each other. You will talk much about it, your friends will beg you to borrow.
