"Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once upon a time ... Life" Once upon a time ... Adam "(English)," Es war einmal der Mensch "(German) /" Valentine's Day " series (our parents have seen it as a child) and even exceeded their expectations! The series is very well prepared, does not show its age, and actually watches our children at different ages, and they learn what parents do not know, blood, infections, antibodies, and many more episodes in the animated 20-25 minute episodes, some people may be "sensitive" to digestion and regeneration, although sometimes they are typically informative and entertaining but in a pleasant, discreet and childish way (loudspeaker episode, especially the baby begins to grow). <br /> <br /> How children use their own organs they are interested in what's happening and understand it through the episodes in the context of the environment.The episodes form changes from the outside world (a family of 2 children) and within the body. For example, an episode involving infections, the boy accidentally breaks himself and is injured and the episode covers how the body reacts. Similarly, episodes on senses, e.g. hearing, sight, body, and the context of oxygen-related breathing and circulatory episodes cover the entire life cycle of the oxygen (plants) where the oxygen (plants) is located. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best children's programs - I can say that we have to be with children of every family!
