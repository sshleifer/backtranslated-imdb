When I first saw this movie, I was very young to remember. But it was the second time I saw it 7 years ago. My brother said I should see it. Now my whole family remembered it. We quote at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. After all this, I laugh. Of course, an irresponsible one is indeed a drunken millionaire. All the same, there is still humanity lost in other people we see in the film. And he is ready to give all to love. It is highly recommended to everyone who wants to laugh. Many laughs. Its hallarious, sweet and a movie buff, this will really change the "Funny" idea. Follow with a group of friends or family and promise that you will never have anything to say with some Authur lines in your head. <br /> <br /> In my family, it's hard to find a movie that everyone loves. But this movie, I feel, has drawn us closer. And I know that will be the same for you!
