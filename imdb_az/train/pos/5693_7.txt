A true story of a bunch of drugs, jewelry, weapons, and a very honest businessman fighting a rifle. Some say that America's tragic tale is over the eighty-one years when drug and AIDS have crashed, where the sixty-six peace and free love is high. I'm honest, it's a regular person who does not have a purpose in life who decides to rob a high-level and brutal person. What's the second part of the master plan? They have their products ... they will sit around and be again high again. Great plan. Even though you do not know the story, there are no regrets and surprises in this movie. Many of these characters are vulnerable and offensive to trying to mount some sort of folk heroes, party scenes and trophies. The story was even better with a straight forward approach. It's a small betrayal of drug dealers who are killed by drug dealers a lot of time. A great story, in more detail, is John Holmes. Anyway, this is the center of the story. This movie was about her, her life. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although not officially, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes's life. This is not entirely real, but even more enjoyable.
