My family began to stumble because Arthur Bach's first appearance. We have the most line of reminders. I was watching two weeks ago and still looked at the simple humor and appearance described by Dudley Moore. Liza Minelli did a great job like a side-by-side shot - although I'm not the biggest admirer. This film is for me not only watching movies. My favorite scene is when visiting the house of Arthur's fiancee. The conversation between the child and Susan's father is shed side by side. The mass of the mass, "Would you like to wait in the library?" After watching Arthur's answer, "Yes, there's no question of the bathroom", NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny stuff "!
