After the first release, this work was criticized by Meysels' brothers and was even considered as a talk. Fortunately, nowadays documentary cinema has been welcomed as a masterpiece, especially when it has been exposed to real exploitation by the public on television and most of the direct cinema's bad development. <br /> <br /> Of course, first of all, it's really kinda movie, not cinema directly. The difference between the two is very small, but in fact, this documentary is that we feel the presence of the Meyssel brothers and that we are interacting with the characters in the movie. It is clear that it is not exploited. The mosque is allowed at home and they are included in the very eccentric state of a very eccentric home. Edith and Edie both love the idea of ​​filming. <br /> <br /> Only a story of God and a delicate dialogue were heard very, very disappointing. Here's a complete portrait of the house's madness, a delusional sight with Edie and her mother, Edith. Homes are everywhere a mess, garbage and animals, pale colors all over the house, and constantly resistant battles of furniture and reality. These two people live their lives with each other and do not fight in front of the camera because they want to draw attention, but they can not help one another to talk about it. They know each other very well to hide their inner feelings, there is no need. Finally, they love each other deeply, even though they blame each other for their lives. <br /> <br /> Edie does not want her mother to die because she likes it and Edith says she does not want Edie to leave her because she does not want to stay alone. <br /> <br /> But the most interesting aspect of the film, despite the old age, can not help the two women become girls. They can not help becoming a singer, the other dancer. Demonstrates all his artistic skills in front of the camera. Edie Daveysel Meyselsa rhetorically asked, "Where have all my life been?" He asked. she is very happy that she finally gets to show the world itself and her beautiful showgirls skills. A stylistic portrait and a charm that is likely to be repeated can only be made by Meysels and a few people.
