This is a really nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. There are two dogs and a cat, but for a while they are taken to live with someone else, but the animals understand and run and go to find the family with them. The cat is called Sassy and lives up to its name. Chance is a young dog who knows a lot about life in the pound. Shadow is an old and clever dog that feels something. Put these three on an adventure and create a happy and entertaining time. The movement of the mouths does not have any special effect, and therefore does not like cheese. The best talking animal movie I've ever seen. A really good movie for families.
