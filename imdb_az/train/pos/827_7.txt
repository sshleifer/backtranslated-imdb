Perspective is a good thing. Since the series "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", allegations and repetitions of the episode II and III have been removed from the original "Star Wars" films, transforming them into a whole, and separating old and new films into separate trilogies. is not. New films give new perspectives to new films. This new look, in fact, allows more appreciation for what is regarded as the "poor return of the original" trilogy. Often his praise for his very "cute" factor, ROTJ is original and just a little less impressive than the almost perfect "The Empire Hits the Back". Indeed, ROTJ's "cute" element, the Ewoks, is a weak link in its entire series. Is George Lucas just furry miracles in the film just for merchandising opportunities? It can only answer these questions. <br /> <br /> This lovely factor, on the one hand, is a bright full circle of films and is the evolution of Saga. After the "Empire Strikes Back", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), along with Rebel Alliance's friends, set off to Tatooine to get rid of Han Planet (Harrison Ford). For debts that delay Jabba Hutt. <br /> <br /> Skywalker is a changed man after leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire. Now, with all the black colors, Luca's roots have made him mixed and torn. His psychological appearance is not as strong as his appearance. Although he is always going to help Rebelli's friends, he will again destroy it or at least finally turn to the Black and want to have a chance to meet the evil Darth Vader, despite his concern about joining the Wader to the Emperor. <br /> <br /> The early scenes in Tatooin affect Jabba's bed, floating palace, and an intestine that lives in the sand - the mighty Sullina. Lucas's CGI's developments in 1997 actually worsened Sarlac's overall influence and made it look fake and overwhelming. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Tatooine is a striking and most memorable saga. Luke says that Jabba and his cronies, almost justified by the evidence of Jedi, have almost endured nowadays. <br /> <br /> When Luka returns to the Degobah system to visit Yoda's disease again, Yoda's defective . ROTJ is actually a film of Luka, perhaps even more because the "Empire returns" star, Yoda, is erased from the story, as the story of Luka's fate. original When he comes closer to Darth Vader and his fate, his visit is a film. Other accusers, of course, work in his shadow. Romanticism between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is different from the "Empire". <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> all the new Death Star is over. This time the Emperor himself controls the final stages of construction. The Emperor himself intends to crush once and for all the rebellion of the Darth Vader Empire (or, instead), in order to bring the powerful Skywalker to him. The Emperor is far different from what is worse than this film, which is less psychologically dark than "Star Wars" by Peter Cushing. <br /> <strong> Believing is just one of the lovers you have hated the Emperor, played brilliantly by McDiarmid. <br /> <br /> All other actors have been well-established in their roles. Hamill is surprised by the fact that Luke is more beneficial, and makes the progress of his character one of the few realistic characters of the series, from the young, impatient pupil to the clarified ones. The role of Ford, as all of its charm and charisma are spent in the first two films, is a subtle thing - the real star of the first film. After the end of the film, Fisher Leia has dropped the end of the movie, learning that at least about nothing about it ... Add favorites like Kenobi, Yoda, and favorite Chewbacca, C-3PO and Alec Guiness R2D2 and a family like a castle looks like. <br /> <br /> Despite the mixed forest fight of Ewoks and the empire, it ends and includes three consecutive strokes: Endorda, Death Star, with each one of the most impressive special effects. Music is as bright as ever, and perfectly captures the mood in every scene. As Blue Tuna works perfectly for "Space Odyssey" in 2001, John Williams' account is part of Star Wars folklore and it's part of Lightweight Swords and Force. <br /> <br /> Lucas is the last open to interpretation, which means more episodes can be made. Indeed, fantastic fans have created their own versions of the episodes VII, VIII and IX all at once. <br /> <br /> ROTJ works when it is given a chance and brings together treasure-lovers. <br /> <br /> If all six episodes look at each other, this saga may well be prepared. Already? When adding an episode, I changed the look of the series. Therefore, the "Jedi Return" can now be seen in a different light, and a new evaluation can be given about 20 years after its release.
