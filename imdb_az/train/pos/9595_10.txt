One of the commentators at the beginning of this film said that there were two strikes against him: black and white. In addition, there is a third strike: he's gay. "You need to be stronger than imagination," he says. <br /> <br /> Documentary boat "Paris burns" and a documentary about transvestites or transsexuals to Spanish men. The miracle of the Paris Burning, directed by Jennie Livingston, demonstrates a very strange show and gives people the opportunity to humanity. We learn about homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, dreams, desires. Some of these dreams are very inaccessible, which is tragic. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are shots in this movie of naked transsexuals. If you have problems with homosexuals, this movie is not for you. But if you see this movie, if you say "Paris burns", it's not really men dressed in women's clothes, but by a group of people who are regularly marginalized and released by the community <br /> <br /> I've been filming this movie since 1991 followed by four times because it says so much: a comment about materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about rich and poor people, about the media and what he celebrated, fame and adulation. "Paris burns" is one of the most outstanding people and one of the worst films I've ever seen.
