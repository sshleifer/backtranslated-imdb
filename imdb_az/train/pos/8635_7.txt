"California" is a good Hollywood odyssey speaking from two couples in California to share gas price: Lewis and Pitt and two wannabee artists, photographer and writer (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt is "murmuring" the character he is in the center of this tricky trilogy. Psycho-killer is a good hour for those who have a flick.
