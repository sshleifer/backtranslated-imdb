Wait With Me, Vern and Teddy Who Tougher, Discuss the Superman or Mighty Mouse. I often discuss who is going to fight with my friends. Sometimes we are absurd and compare MacGyver and Terminator, Rambo and Matrix. But now we discuss children like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. A trivial comparison of Lee's death, but that's fun. If you go to Jet Li on Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you say at least you will face Chan. <br /> <br /> The black mask is a man created with many men, high combat vehicles. Their only purpose is to win wars that other people have lost. They are invincible in some ways. Now it is basically for the movie, but it builds scenes of all strange choreographic struggles. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is surprised. No one can do things that he can not do and his body. <br /> <br /> In addition to the martial arts in the film, Black Mask is strongly humorous and belongs to the police because of Jet's co-star. officer Together they are very big. But be honest. If everyone reviews this, they want to know that they are filmed in the action section. And its answer is YES! Lots and lots of angry motionless moves. You'll love this movie.
