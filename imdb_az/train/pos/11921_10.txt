this movie was one of the best disney films I've ever seen. Great thing to watch the whole family. thoughts can go away a bit, but this is a good comedy and fun is great. I love the little boy, j.p. and the adrien brody part of the Academy Award-winning can be very short but very memorable. highly recommended.
