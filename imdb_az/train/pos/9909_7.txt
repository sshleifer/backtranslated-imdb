It's a serious comedy. Ross Hunter's "Les Joies de la famille" (later a movie version of the French game as a "very rich woman") is luxurious, good shots, sometimes funny ... and, unfortunately, untimely. A wealthy California widow, apparently seen as rubbing money, is being ironed by two great, daunting daughters, both of whom are afraid of inheriting Mama Rozi's inheritance. A vital, yet old-fashioned woman question is sent to a rest home opposed to her will and then a touch pad for a comedy that is forced to prove himself at a hearing (and its credit director David Lowell Rich does not download pictures with gags or clear sensitivity) . Some of the ghosts are a little widespread and do not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the attractiveness of this scenario and never mistakes it. Sandra Dee is as good as Rosalind's grandson, and James Farentino is very attractive as a young lawyer. The severity of the subject matter of the "Rosie" about the importance of the elderly and the ways to spend the rest of the time remains a haste to reach a happy ending. The picture smiles - and is also curious about the fact that many older women are not quite lucky. From ****
