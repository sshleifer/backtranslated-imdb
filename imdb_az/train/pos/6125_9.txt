Okay, I think about Jack Frost here. I looked at the morph box on the VHS cassette and thought myself, it looks interesting. I rent it and take it home. The boy was right, it is interesting. The conspiracies of the serial killer are depicted in dreams, bodies and everyday in the machine. But this should be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. A snowman on his body. I saw the landscape, the bucket owner, the snow wind, and so on. I liked the pictures of all my friends who were out there. I love the actor who played Jack, and there was a killer who really could not see it since Freddy Kruger. True, I said. FREDDY KRUGGER. This is a "cool" level. I would like some puppet effects to be better, mouth movements have improved. But I shake it up to a small budget. Casting sees a great deal, there are some great liners and scary to make any hardcore fright fan jump. All and all, a great story, good effects, great dialogue and a great cast. JACK FROST ... I give 9 STAR
