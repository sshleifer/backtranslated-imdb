"Hollywood Hotel" is a fun, exciting, entertaining, comedy comedy from the Warners, which flies in an angry fashion. We just have to remember that Tinseltown's official theme song - "Hooray for Hollywood". Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer have a number of other stones, including "I Like Fish Like Suyadayam" and "Silhouette in Moonlight". Dick Powell and the company's "eighth ball" are the best music tracks for the people they find, the best music tracks, the best music tracks, as if it were just a fate that Edgar Kennedy faced. last The Hollywood celebrates glamor and breaks all of it at once because it receives many comic milias from numerous and ego-manicured actors and recurring studio leaders. Altyn Joslyn, intelligence agent Ted Healy, Fredz Feld as Dick Powell's manager, Glena Farrell as an exciting restaurant boss, Mona Marshall's Sarcastic Gal on Friday, like Mabel Todd and Edward Hugh Herbert as Edgar Kennedy Mona's ill-fated sister . The "racist" element in another study here is the twelfth bit that appears in Herber's "Gone in the Wind" series in black. This is a suspicious father, but in this movie, which I believe is the only imagery in this incredible jazz combo, especially Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton), does not prevent you from seeing other joys in this film. The series "Dark Eyes" is a little farther away and it's too late, but Hollywood Hotel is worth your time and, of course, is a movie for DVD freedom.
