While watching a movie, how many tears do I have in my eyes? And I really cried and once I saw this movie once. This movie has a few clicks, but it really does not care about me. I'm crying when I write it and it's been a while since I've seen it. Perfect motion and all production values ​​are good, but the issue that is really important is simple and beautiful. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all forms. When we just love it, we'll be right. I know how your emotions sound, and I promise that I usually do not. I'm pretty crazy. This film has revealed more sadness and happiness than any movie, and maybe it's always the first movie I've ever seen.
