I'm starting to say I am very pleased with this peak of the Bourne trilogy. Please do not postpone this next year or after a prequalification. Just leave alone. True. Matt Damon is talented and versatile ... seems to have been only meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> If you are an admirer of the first two Bourne movie, you will not be disappointed with the third installment. What works and adds a little more. To get the full picture of Jason Bourne's challenging past, I was delighted with all the information we received on all the 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' holes in 'Ultimatum'. Movement sequence is fast paced and keeps the edge of your seat. Fights between Bourne and the conspirators are always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> I'm an admirer of films around the CIA agents and how the CIA is gathering Intel, and this movie has come to this street and becomes even more interesting to me. <br /> <br /> If you're watching Bourne's previous 2 installments, Ultimatum ... still enjoy a thoroughbred, but it's still recommended to watch them first. This will allow Jason Bourne to fully understand and add the character and become part of his world. This makes the film even more appreciable and enjoyable. I'm not convinced that the first 2 is better, but I personally think that it can be "Ultimatum," just as it compares the triple.
