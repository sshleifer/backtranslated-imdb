A few years ago, the satellite channel Ãœ.K. Gold repeated the evolution of "benevolent men": "Here's the original flat sharing sitcom!". That was not a fact. <br /> <br /> One of the creators of the famous sitcom, Father Babe, was Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke. After the end, they decided that they wanted to do something in time. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, when Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) found a man in their bath, they burned Myaddleton Terrace plain, which is their direct support. Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan) is a Southampton chef student at any fixed home. When his clothes dry, he prepares women's clothes and prepares them for food. They are very sorry for his culinary abilities that they invite him to stay. But it must be a nasty job. So Robin should behave as a gay ... <br /> <br /> Julie Burchill, shown in BP-2's "I Love 1973," in 2000, showed her the way she did to House. He was not alone. Sally Thomsett, one of the most iconic (one of my favorites) pictures on the British television of the 70s, carried a shovel of the London lake, and the latter passed through the old stairs of a "curtain" man. <br /> <br /> A man who lives with two girls was a risky subject for the time, but Mrs. Marie Whitehouse did not need a warm under the coat, she was innocent and kind. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts approached him in the distance. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan used to play Bingham at the Medical Department of IT VV before starting this job. In fact, the second run in 'Resistance' coincided with 'House' for the first time. She was born to play sex-mad Robin. More than just Paula Wilcox's "Chrissy", "Beryl," Sally Thomsett's 'Jo' lover was a headache. <br /> <br /> Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole as Ropers, a warlike demonstration for many viewers. George lost his sexual contact, but Mildred did not. They called their show - the author of "George & Mildred". The late Doug Fisher has won Robin's biggest friend, Larry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < for a long time. <br /> <br /> This format has been sold to the United States. <br /> <br /> Forms, the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers, starring 'The Three Sisters' <br /> <br /> Somers was much more thoughtful than many English-language dresses in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> At the end of the sixth season, "House" married Robin's elder Normanla (Norman Eshley) and ended up with Chrissy. Fans did not see Robin's favorite daughter, but she was comforted by her show, Robin Nest.
