Always I welcome this movie from video coverage. Finally there is a round to buy a movie for a guy and boy on a sale. The whole situation is simply stunning performance and beautifully drawn. Even from a distance, you can instantly hear what a dialogue is, just as if you were away from a remote tune. It's really moving, often entertaining and very beautiful. It is not a dialogue, so you feel like you are filming. I'm 9/10. A must see.
