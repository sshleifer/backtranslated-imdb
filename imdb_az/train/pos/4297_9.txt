Now and then, a film artist brings together a unique group of people and allows us to see things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden repeated it. I've always been an anthem of BG Cill's age, and then I could do it at Grand Canyon. Each of us often gets narrower and often squeezes ourselves out of life. This is a film about people who choose life and find the courage to live. The comparison of small and big events allows us to see how much of what is disturbing us in reality is actually insignificant. I have watched this movie a few times and was amazed at how emotions derived from this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline admit their role with great sensitivity, and Steve Martins makes the exec image of a movie priceless. Thank you again, Mr. Kasden
