I've seen it on a flight to the United States, and I was a little hesitant to say that several people were the only characters that you did not know. Nevertheless, I never found it. The film is fast, but it's about the character of the director and the star. The sad scenes are excellent and yes, they may be predictable, but most of the movies are not true. A bit lower than the main villain, Christopher Eccelston said he was not as convincing as he could, but that he was still a good film.
