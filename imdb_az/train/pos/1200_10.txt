There is no illusion, it is the wisdom of wisdom. Granger once again returned to the plain by an angry old Taylor. Granger feels deeply in the end, and in general feels the value of the animals, the Indians and the land. On the other hand, Taylor equates the "angry angels" or Indians to "live with a woman". Although the role of Granger's torture hunter is quite good, it's a crashing Taylor, a staggering, immoral "fastman" for the fastest cash and good cycle. There are many bang-bang here, but the story is moving fast and we are treated with a nice character performance by Nolan. The subject of this story is as bad as today as in the 1800s, as it relates to land relations and racism. Given the time to do so, Senzuraers should have been stuck in their home theater scene, in their relationship with Taylor's funeral and in most of the dialogue. Though extreme, it's really a great western shape.
