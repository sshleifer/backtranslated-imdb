Those who love Jane Eyre as my book (love all my time and at least once) love this version. Timothy Dalton is a little surprised to be Mr. Rochester, but he does a fine job of describing Thornfield's heroine. Zelah Clarke may have been a little old to play 18-year-old Janni, but I do not think about the age of the characters while watching this movie. The dialogue from the film tells a very clever book. Of course, this movie may look a little too long, but this is the only version I've ever seen. This is part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> This film is a new Zeferelli <br /> <br /> I saw Judy Cornwell playing "Aunt Nothing" as I watched this video! He does not know me, he is versatile. <br /> <br /> UPDATED: DVDs were shot this week and it was nice to see the original version. <br /> <br /> <strong> Invites Daisy to keep the look and in 1995 Persuasion (another beautiful adaptation) There's more to begin with (Young Gains, Gateshead, and Lowood). In the end, they have recovered a lot. (I always have St John's Jane - because of his painted tune with the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver inside ... completely cut off from VHS. As I said, they made one of the parts of Timothy Dalton, so there was nothing new, but after all these years of VHS it's good to see all the miniseries. Thanks, the BBC (PS ... I would give more money for a dedicated DVD ... perhaps interviewing some stars ... or making a show)
