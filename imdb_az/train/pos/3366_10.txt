Ettore Scola, one of the most delicate and lucrative managers of our secular citizens, is not yet available on the DVD ... (this is the 2001 edition.) Mysteries are smart goggles. <br /> <br /> This great classic Sophia returns to the theaters in my home-city thanks to Loren-Summer-Retrospective, and after all these years, it's a great video tape ... a true gift. <br /> <br /> Try to prove a point though to avoid a criticism: I took my younger brother who did not want me to see this movie. He had never seen the movie before, and he did not like "the old men of Italy ..." Like all other people in the theater, he was interested in this miracle. Even in the last chapters, the theater was completely silent. <br /> <br /> This special day is really special. The miracle of grace. And if you do not see (yet) a great loss ...
