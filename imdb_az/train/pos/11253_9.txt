<br /> <br /> This is a very long movie, so it can be very boring before you're interesting, but it lets you find a permanent addition to your happiness for the length of your characters. <br /> <br /> If you find innocence, especially a heartbeat, because it is a story that finds its heroes bad and weak. <br /> <br /> If you love a monster, you will cry for Magnus Pym, a spy who has betrayed everyone, especially his country, friends and family, is manipulated and molded from the same people since his childhood. <br /> <br /> The whole story is a really unpleasant character, but sincere in a faithful "moral personality". <br /> <br /> I would also like to point out that for a few years, the base is worth it for people who love movies that are angry over human nature.
