I'm gonna be honest. I bought this movie, so I enjoyed it. So, come, "the Living Hope of the Living Dead"? What else can I do? No doubt, the film (and its creators) decided that this would not be fun. Instead, we will do our best to become a good film. <br /> <br /> And what do you know? He approached. Random music is a little less cheese, photography is a little more professional, moving, coincidences (like props - love Best Buy bag) ... well, this is not a classic genre of zombie genre, but still a pretty neat movie. And the actor, the writing and the pacing are surprisingly better than expected. <br /> <br /> If both of us can decide whether or not a dead zombie is really dead, we both have a good humor. <br /> <br /> If you have a low budget (fingerprints can be almost always permanently absurd, it can be a pretty fun time in the film, no, that's not great, yes, it would be better, but manufacturers, actors, crew , they all tried to shoot a good movie (instead of a classic class camp) and a lot more The line of campaign zombie films is a mile long and I thank children. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Quiros brothers, I would like to see what they are doing next. And hey, somebody give them a budget!
