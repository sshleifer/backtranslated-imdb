My name is Heather and I'm a daughter of this movie. Thank you for seeing this movie and being very pleased with it. like some of the things described in this film, it is not as close as it is to describe how bad things really are, as hard and tough. Do not say that my mother and younger sister have an impact on everything. <br /> <br /> Let's greet everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heatherin's mother. It's hard to believe that this film has been so long since its inception. People are still watching it a year ago. For those of you who are in the same or similar situation, ask people in cyberspace to understand exactly how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
