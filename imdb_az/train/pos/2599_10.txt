Talking about Joyce's comic book, I was very surprised to find the scenario of Joseph Strickin and Fred Haines as I was preparing to be amazed, taking into consideration the gigantic complexity of the original text. However, the film was very good and showed the tone, misinterpretation of the book, and a fine translation of the book. <br /> <br /> Helps read the original text before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It's great to see how this movie is "disgraceful", because, of course, the Irish film censorship was only lastly 2000, taking into account the many strange episodes staged together in Dublin in 1967, was illegally followed by the Irish general auditorium (in a special movie theater, Irish Film Theater in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism offers many episodes rather than nature and humility. Do not think that many of these chapters are unacceptable after the book was published in 1922, when it was filmed in 1967, it was still full. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is amazing and hearty. <br /> <br /> The Irish actor profession of the 1960s, all of the dear players, courageous, Joyce's sensitive transgressive text sang such a magnificent style. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
