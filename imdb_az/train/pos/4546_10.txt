This film will fall down in history, like Citizen Kane, Casablanca and The Waterfront, as one of the elderly. Let anyone be happy with Leno's continuation! Leno and Morita comedy dance, Abbott and Costello have not seen since. Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will shake you. The character of the lap pushing back to Shakespeare's comedy days as buffoonish oaf. And the peak. My kindness, my peak. I will not destroy you, but it compares the Explosion of Death Star mud. If you can find these hard-to-find stones, give yourself and your family a blessing and buy it right away. I still hope for a DVD that is one of the DVDs on a special day.
