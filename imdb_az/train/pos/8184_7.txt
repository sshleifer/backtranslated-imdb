<br /> <br /> After witnessing his wife, Linda Hoffman, many unstable dentist who had sex with a child in the pool. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) is completely ill. <br /> <br /> This delightful semi-director, Brian Yuzna, was a dramatic change from the usual horrors of the late 90s. Although "Dentist" is a cheerful, entertaining little movie, Yuzna provides the shock and excitement that the film is trying to spread more serious films. Despite the fact that, despite the fact that there is no background on central symbols, the events that will happen within a few days, the film is interesting, it's usually a good scripted and well-paced, even more horrible moments that allow the viewer's interests to succeed. The dentist is sometimes afraid of drifting, but unlike the 1998 results, there are only unusual moments and in general, the film is well-behaved. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen was very convincing, sadistic, shady and excellently Dr. Alan Feinston's role. Bernstein is able to read his lines of doubt in particular in relation to sexually abusive and immorality (especially, fellatio). Many actors may face a cautious psychological depression without being surprised or ridiculous, although Bernstein feels the identity of the person he is trying to describe, and likes the film even more. "Dentist" did not mean to have fun, funny, horrible movie, Bernsen's performance would be much stronger. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> </ span> <br /> </ span> </ div> <div style = "text-align : justify; ">" Dentist "is not a frightening film intended to be taken seriously, but is also unpleasant, especially for those who love evil. Those who are concerned with the Scream (1996) clones since the late 1990s can find a refreshing change for me. Rarely, dull and generally well-prepared scripts, as well as some of the cutting-edge trends, help make the Dentist one of the most enjoyable cheerful horrors of the 1990s. At the same time, we offer a particularly compassionate and (generally) dentist in torture. Perfect, but not too bad, "dentist" is a flick that you need to watch at least once. My rating? Dentist '?? 6.5 / 10.
