When I see the advertisement for it, "WHY NICE SHOULD BE NIK!" because the "new princess" took their nests. Well, I still love fresh princess. but george lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how non-stereotypical is benny. Carmen is a pretty good character, and sometimes it's really funny to see how stupid and overwhelming it seems. I feel bad for the guy playing the maximum, he looks really young too! but the max is an entertaining character and moves well. Yes, the angie is a little stereotypic, but its funny moments. ha ha george has a great head! But it can also be very good. funny show! you should definitely improve your home later.
