I was watching it in July, and even with Christmas theme, I found touching and sensitive. Sometimes it is not for someone who has a sense of reality full of fantasy and joy. William Russ Hank did a great job. When I just saw him restored in a long and hot summer, he played a weak character. But from this point of view, Hank had a good idea when he was thinking about what had happened to him. Valerie Bertinelli was great and beloved and very convincing in this role. And when Peter Falk came out on a very important stage, Max was as beautiful and always a smile. Hank's Maxin had a very special scene, including one that he really understood in his life. Not for everyone ..... Especially not included in the "feeling-good" movie, and this is definitely! If you want to feel perfect and meaningful, avoid it. But I think it's being revised, so I resemble it. (Yes, some are still VCR :)
