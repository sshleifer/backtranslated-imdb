It is very striking in terms of vision and music. A cure for eye and ear. The quintessential Victorian element of the opening sequence was absolutely magnificent and Dickens helped to create a Christmas scene where he was justly proud of himself. Technically, the production is visually stimulating and special effects are randomly generated and creatively defined at the traditional stage. Many breathing dance of the leading artist. Photography and lighting are first-class and sound recordings complement the overall level of technical skills used in admiringly. A great movie for the whole family at Christmas time and the most enjoyable discovery that will resemble more than one look.
