The flat is an entertaining western, undoubtedly today a real classic. Wild Bill Hickok is the ideal actor for Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and James Stewart, who was the best actors in the western heroes in their offspring. Jan Arthur Calamity is as big as Jane, and I know no one has played better than that. Although not historically accurate, the film is able to capture the most important thing about Hickok and its timing. Sometimes you have to sacrifice your history, and DeMille does what. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles by a great producer to compensate for the loss of civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the Buffalo Bill's wife's worry, a man who killed a man with Hickok, and Hickok, - A religious woman with love affair is 'The Plainsman' a usual and exciting movie. Anthony Quinn has a very short look, and now she shows why she will be a great actor. I was very concerned about showing the original weapons of that time.
