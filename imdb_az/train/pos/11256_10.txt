Without a doubt, John Le Carre's novels have turned into a subtle classic film. Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, his real name, Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence Supervisor), Ray McAnally (Magnus' Concert Father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, controller), along with other symbols, is perfect and natural, and the person responsible for knocking them should be rewarded. Small portions such as the Great Membury are so perfectly executed. Depending on the power of these performances and the strength of the characters in the novel, Magnus's doubles can not feel closer to Jack Brotherhood and Magnus and Axel, but sensitive to US intelligence, Grant Lederer. I have read my book at least ten times and watched the movie several times, and I am always amazed by both. If I have a book to buy an island in the desert, Perfect Spy is the choice above all others.
