Care Bears and their cousins ​​roots. There is a difference if you see the original movie. Cousins ​​are then removed by Care Bearings instead of meeting. However, I do not have a problem with choosing to treat movies separately. Babies are very enjoyable and enjoy them, and look at them and develop. My favorite Swift Heart Rabbit. It's a terrible dangerous guitarist. I can be sure of my three children because I'm not good at sports. Cree Writing is excellent as Christy. The cheers are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, do not miss toys, love toys or enjoy the original. 9/10
