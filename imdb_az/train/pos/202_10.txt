Give this movie 10/10 as A 10/10 is worthy. Two of the best actors of the time - Walter Matthau and George Burns, Neil Simon and all other actors participating in this film + collaborate with director Herbert Ross and adapt at all stages.

I love the humor type in this movie, which makes me very difficult. <br /> I bought this movie 3 days ago at VHS (yes, VHS, because it's cheaper, just $ 3). When I returned home, I was watching him, but I had to look again for the first time missing a few parts. When I looked for a second time, I felt better and laughed more. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> Two people work together as people / actors / performers.

Matthau & Burns was terrific in this movie. They're dead. George Burns was named Oscar. He gave a powerful comic performance. This film was 78 years old. So far, he is the oldest actor who has won an old Academy Award. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. However, Richard Benjamin was also proud. Golden Globe won for the best supporting actor. He deserves the Gold Globe. While many people may agree with what I say, everyone in this film has shown a strong performance. This comedy is classic immediately. I highly recommend this. Something else: It's a "Putz" that hates this movie,
