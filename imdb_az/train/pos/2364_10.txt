To avoid reading the magnificent MR James story, I have read many of his supernatural stories. And I've seen most of the previous BBC Christmas Ghost stories and, in my opinion, overwhelming the majority of them, only equates the Signalist. <br /> <br /> Indeed - direction and "mood" are perfect, actor, lighting and, of course, story and writing. I would like to ask this question, and I can only hope for more quality than the same director and production team. <br /> <br /> I understand that the BBC's plan to make several plans (not necessarily based on MR James stories) is hopeful. <br /> <br /> 10/10
