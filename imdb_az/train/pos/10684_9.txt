While watching this early DeMille work, I was reinforced that Early DeMille was far superior to de DeMille. Draws attention to the use of light within the scenes. Its pacing is very good, allowing you to explain in an hour or more. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie i've seen in Cleo Ridgely. This is not intuitive about the style of the next sound movies, as seen in its silent films. <br /> <br /> It was a very weak and sensitive feeling.
