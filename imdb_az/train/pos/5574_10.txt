Peter M. Cohen twisted and tripped in the winning match. In the mainstream press, the critique of the movie, such as "offensive" and "darkness," serves to emphasize that intensity is an imagination that revives and integrates people's sexuality and passion. Following the traces of "My Company," "Amy-i Kovalamaq," "Your Friends and Neighbors," and "Two Girls and One Man" is a tradition called "reality-based" satir. Cohen's dialogue was very unpleasant and I was always interested in how perfect the pace of today's conversations is. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Hairdresser and Jonathan Abrahams are three different, replaced by their terms by a female predator (Amanda), together with their recent folkloric folkloric folklore (played very well by Jewish Domke), Peet. A romantic comedy under the satirical surface is more satisfying than most sugar-covered studio products.
