This is my favorite classic. In 1957, Philadelphia, PA, slightly westward, and was released next year. Then in 1970, I found myself in the same district as a Cheyenne PA state soldier. I always checked different scenes. I knew Downingtown Diner's owner well, and as all passengers said, it was a "blob's house." The theater scene was located in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park, and is still showing films today!
