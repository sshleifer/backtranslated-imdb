This is a fantastic movie, a man who is concerned with a western (Jimmy Stewart) Klondike goes for gold. On the way, in Alyaska (John McIntire, giving a bad performance), he was hassled by a local sheriff, whom he retreated. Unless McIntire returns to any city, he is, unfortunately, the only way to go back to the United States, threatening to be a mortal. The most important thing in the story is that Dawson's quiet town, Klondike, is being drowned by McIntire's new residents. With Stewart and his two companions (Stewart's best friend, Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen), Ruth Roman builds a lounge (a cunning Hollywood front) and tries to manage the city's restaurant and hang in the workplace. It also leads to McIntire and his goons. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre "The Naked Spur". Different countries are only a small bit, and it's 99.9% of the movie's speciality, of course it feels cheap. Like The Naked Spur, Far Country possesses beautiful, in-place cinematography. The landscape is brilliant. Stewart gives one of its best performances (in 1954 it's the biggest achievement in the Rear Window). I suppose it can be considered a cliche, because she has begun an egoist comrade and learns how life is ending. Stewart still works so well, this character is very human. And the supporting performances are universal. As I said, the favorite French actor Corinne Calvet is very good. And I have to separate Walter Brennen. He looks like the best friend is playing. The relationship with Stewart is very important, because it is the only characteristic of any kind that human beings can give primarily to sex. The scenario is very well written and Mann's direction is flawless. A work. 10/10.
