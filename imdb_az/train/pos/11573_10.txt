I took this movie from a cousin in Norway and had to convert from Norway to American format with a copied video. Comparing this film (1948) to Telemark Heroes (1965), Kampen om Tungtvannet (Heavy Water Struggle) plays the role of sabotage actors, but actors play the role of existing sabotage actors in the Norwegian liberation struggle. The site is in four languages: Norwegian, French, German and English (completed with Norwegian subtitles). <br /> <br /> What led to the struggle that was effective during this period of history. French scientists wanted to return to France to conduct laboratory research on its effectiveness by acquiring approximately two hundred kilograms of heavy water from Norsk Hydro in Vermork. At the same time, the Nazis were interested in getting heavy water to build a weapon. The French were thoroughly worried that the Nazis could attack early in Norway and were secretly using the secret codes to deceive the Nazi spies when they went to Oslo where heavy water was coming and returned without interfering. He was watched by two spies on an aircraft carrier, but they did not see him thrown over another plane to another side. However, the Nazi occupied by Norway on the morning of April 9, 1940 was up to Norsk Hydro and Norwegian Underground and British intelligence to operate in London. Professor Leif Trondstad volunteered for ten young Norwegians; The Rain and Gunnerside teams will successfully post heavy water production in Vemork. <br /> <br /> Includes ferry flooding after allowing railroad freight wagons leaving Norsk Hydro to load heavily loaded cargoes into Berlin. <br /> <br /> If there were many parts in the film, it was fair. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the history of the Second World War.
