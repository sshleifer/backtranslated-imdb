Office, Skins, Entourage and E! I do not watch many television, except soup. <br /> <br /> I think this show will be held in a good company. <br /> <br /> I love the stunning look of the pop culture that this show has to offer. <br /> <br /> Soup also helps me stay focused on what people in the office say when talking about Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best part is that the soup is usually the most funniest or most controversial moments (shows that most people join the American Idol because of strange demonstrations by the audience), so people most people want to watch. And I must not suffer with a conspicuous show or "reality" show with another 98% of this mind, a "cheerful" or "shock" nugget. The only reason the soup does not get 10 in my opinion is that sometimes the sketches are not funny, and even more commonly, the comment is not always the same. <br /> <br /> Joelin is quickly preparing for a great show of Wise and Soup's writing group (including McHale). I enjoy the smiles and comments of the crew inside the camera. Even if they seem to be casually lukewarm, it is compulsory, because it is compulsory. Surely, they are mocking. And this is part of the show that makes fun.
