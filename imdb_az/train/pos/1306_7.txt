However, an unusual rectangular player was played by a player and the film was shot by the director who seriously took the material. Taking into consideration that the movie was shot on a hard budget, but it attracts drama - one of the movies gets Cinemax 2 or more Max breathing, or 40 minutes when you're ready to get started you watch. "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault" are the real features of the Wynorski genre film, when they are actually interested in the material (ie, after the title of one of the Shannon Tweed flips under Chapter 3 or 4 Do not worry! Actually, little-known actors (for Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy Flowers) really put all of them in their best roles in a few years - as for Grieco, It is clear that his character is usually self-destructive film, but Grieco does not deliver it too much. I check the IMDB and see that the writer wrote "SORORITY House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" for director - both small classics have their own rights, but obviously the "foolish" Roger Cormon movie theater is more than 70 very good Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B - some of the images - giving the element of use, but also a drama involving a step forward. It is not "Citizen Kane" and the funny final moments are a bit disturbing, but with a well-written, character-oriented, above-average movement. Such little accomplishments are rarely enough (although I remembered Albert Pyunin's "Heatseeker" night night - it's not like the late ones) It's as easy as it seems - but another story!)
