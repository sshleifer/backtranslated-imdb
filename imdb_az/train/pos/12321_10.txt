I saw this movie in my childhood. After 10 years, we did not remember anything about this movie, but I do not know how to read this movie. This is my life. Always my favorite movie. My words do not mean the true meaning of those in the film. I watched this movie. Fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, terrible, and brilliant blend of martial arts. The love story is quite touching and warm. <br /> <br /> Sinnui Yauman is one of the best ghost stories on the film. There is a Chinese Ghost Story story written by Songling Pu and run by Siu-Tung Ching. Ling Choi Sin, played by Leslie Cheung, is a young man who is looking for a monastery to settled down deep in the tree, a place where villagers are afraid of approaching. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin meets a beautiful and mysterious young girl Tsing, who lives in an abandoned temple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is an unhappy fool, While performing ritual taoist sword forms, there is even a front-fought battle for a drunken song. <br /> <br /> The film draws on many of the traditional old-fashioned martial arts of acrobatics, flying in the tree, spinning from tree to tree, with elegant long dresses and scarves, but the movie really runs and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tsing is to marry a bad tree monster who can not do a good thing, and we feel his condition in his home where he is acquainted with his happiest sister and stepmother. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> [ <br /> <br /> Someone touched many ways in this film, laugh, cry and only have great martial arts and cinematography Have fun with. In the end, when Yin and Ling Choi Sin went to the sunshine under a magic rainbow, we never know that Tsing belongs to a reincarnation, but we know him.
