In the Netherlands, a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. She remains in the night with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and maintains her relationship with her (thinking that she is a boy). She plans to leave the next day, but she looks at Christine's ovky boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay in touch with her. <br /> <br /> In 1983, a large X-rated art house was shot down in the United States. Let's ... There's a scene in a society with drowning, full frontal men and women's nakedness, castration, disability, simulation sex, a shocking scene, a sex gay sex scene ... and all this is a comedy !!! !! Paul Verhoeven did this after Spetters. Spetters were attacked by critics over excessive sexual persistence and condemned as garbage. Thus, Verhoeven criticizes this movie as it is a work of art and is full of very clear symbolism, which thinks it will praise him. He was right! Critics loved the film, Verhoeven, who did not know them playing a big joke. Still, it's a big movie. <br /> <br /> This is beautifully drawn by Jan de Bont (now a filmmaker himself) and there are many symbolic and clear "secret" lines in the dialogue that you are never bored. It's all great - Krabbe is a thoroughly treacherous character, but in some way it is rooted; Soutendijk plays his part to just look and show - gives Gerard a little laugh that he is pleased with staying with him; <br /> <br /> Hoffman is extremely handsome with a big body - he deserves a credit that goes with the church sequence and goes with the krabbe. <br /> <br /> This is for you people who are extremely eager for you to suffer from challenging yourself (such as me) for those who are easily sad and heartless. A 10 whole way.
