During the war, Hollywood had a lot of films prepared by the public to support the soldiers. As can be seen today, it is possible to dismiss some of them or to view them as technical propaganda, but it is a positive kind and involves the unification of the nation. This film is a very effective and entertaining example of the genre - a very realistic script and good production value. Pat O'Brien has the same character as he has played in many other films (you know, challenging conversations, challenging, but "bubble man"). Randolph Scott, as always, is competent and entertaining and adds the perfect add-ons (look at one of the bombing trainees for Robert Ryan). The story recalls a number of other films about our pilots and crew, but the film is interesting and not too far, very well prepared. This is perhaps the place where the film is somewhat concurrent and at the same time very satisfying - with the exception of the latter. Only serious negative, and for some of these nitpickers, some of the stock cartoons are integrated into the film in a slightly fun way, and the "hazelnuts" like me, both history teachers and aircraft lovers, probably will not distinguish it.
