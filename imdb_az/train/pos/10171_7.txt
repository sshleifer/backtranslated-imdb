When I was at college and at an international exhibition, in the Russian section, "What a Boltay!" There were placards saying, "Do not come!". I do not want "Gladys Kravitz!" For "generation" TV viewers! <br /> <br /> You see the outcome of what you say in the Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you see, is not a very funny issue. In this case, he heard something about an infinite bombardment and immediately admitted that Axis Powers attacked the United States. Thus, he tells someone who speaks and speaks to others. As the Russians come, Russians are coming, the story is blasted more often than proportionally, so when you return to Snafu, I say good, I want to say! Yes, more is the WWII propaganda - it has been completed for a humiliating time in Japan - but Pvt. Snafu shorts were really funny. Of course, Dr. Seuss wrote and Mel Blanc sounded it, it's no surprise that it's pretty cool. It's worth seeing.
