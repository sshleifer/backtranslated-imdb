I like this movie, it's cute and funny. I found this movie as a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this film was referring to New York Yankees. You must be in the Red Sox nation to understand that Yankees is a dirty word. To Yankee's fans, I have trouble saying this. I would recommend the whole family to this picture. Of course, with your typical love / comedy movie, the moment of the movie, with my love and what to do, is the movie with all the slapstick moments. The film's demonstration has a few moments in the Red Sox nation (Fenway Park). the supporter always felt the 86th year of Sokhun, and the love of Sohun and the love of another man were hand in hand.
