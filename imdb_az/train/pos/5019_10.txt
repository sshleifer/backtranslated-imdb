Hi <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I am Italian! <br /> <br /> Some time ago I saw this movie: for the first time with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Micheal and Mary Margaret. <br /> <br /> This movie has not been programmed for many years and I do not know how to find a song. Many thanks for helping me! I love this movie! Very romantic! Soundtrack is wonderful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
