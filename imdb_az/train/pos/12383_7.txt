Christina Raines is looking for a new apartment in New York and begins to meet with strange neighbors, revealing the secret of the building itself and slowly pulling up a great summit until the end of the film. This film is owned by a well-known actor and actress who has flooded the movie, from the Roman Catholic Church to Satan, to all sorts of neat elements, to hell, to strange rituals, increasing assassinations. We like John Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Valkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum and John Forget about Carradine. Many of these actors, especially Burgess Meredith, make it a beautiful comic / demented performance, as one of their neighbors with a small bird and a cat. Meredith Balsam and Chris Sarandon are memorable. Some performers play a root cause, though nothing but Jose Ferrer's boldness. Sentinel is a wonderful fear film with many psychological elements and some really terrifying scenes. The last scene is hearty and still cold. In the film, especially DeAngelo and Miles, I find some faults with sex and violence in all the scenes. Was it really necessary? I do not think so. Also, the father / daughter had a bit of things, but in general the film works and won. Director Michael Winner acts like a worker and is effective in creating tension and scary moments. The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
