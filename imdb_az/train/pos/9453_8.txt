Protection is a fascinating, angry, and sometimes even troubling tale, transformed by James Dickey into a shining movie by John Boorman. A high-level canoe on the mountains is about four business men and men who are dealing with mafia behavior at the weekend. There, they are facing the worst form of every human being and the worst form of all human sessions ... poverty, sorrow, and even physical aggression! These four men were intending to go down the river for adventure and excitement, but their visits often turn into odyssey through the violent and secretive mountainous areas that are completely displaced from all civilization. All these elements actually get one of the most pigeon films I've ever seen. You are praying that you can not find yourself in the same situation about everything that happens to these men. Pure speaking film, Salvation is a very important film. The best of John Boorman (closely followed by Zardose and Excalibur) is still a very impressive movie and contains many unforgettable scenes and sounds in many other films. Imagine the magnificent "Dueling Banjos" music scene and, of course, an unforgettable homosexual "pig". All actors present perfectly performing performances (haha). Especially John Voight. You need to see a motion picture!
