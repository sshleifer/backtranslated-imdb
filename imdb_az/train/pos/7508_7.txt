A great move by Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopics to go on screen for a while. Although covering the majority of Bettie's young lives, he can stay in the center of attention that seems to be the absence of the most biographical films. There are a number of nice and exciting subtext for dialogue and action. This is a wonderful break from the movie Dirty. I think "American Psycho" and I will show you the best work ever. Oh, and like cinematography buff, I give this movie a 100% classroom in this movie. Modern film shares were as beautiful as they looked at the 50's. Compatible with D.P. It is very pleasant around you. I advise anyone interested in this: 8/10.
