Kureishi is not blessed with films that justify the quality of the writing. Recently adapted travesty has destroyed a great article like "Sincerity". But the Mom is superior to all previous incarnations, even taking My Beautiful Laundrettimi. An average-aged woman surpasses the widow's head to have sex with her lover of the emotional weaker daughter. If you believe in all this, you will be given a quality credit that works as the last line of writing. And in Daniel Craig there is a creepy, mixed, mixed hero who denies viewers to ask if a young boy is thinking of adjusting the ladder beds. Well drawn, the film happens only in the poor image of peripheral characters, but it's a win-win situation, such as an ignorant lust.
