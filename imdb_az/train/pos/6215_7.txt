I'm not a big fan of music, I like the movies of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they are very entertaining. Of course, they may be slightly shaped, but if you know what to expect, it is still nice to watch. Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed with this visit. Part of this is as you can see in TOP HAT in this movie, or WE ARE DEFICIENCY. Edvard Everett seems to be a bit lacking in the "entertaining" section of the movie without Horton or Eric Blore. The horrifying antics of these supporting actors gave you more charm from other films than FILT FOLLOW. In addition, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this is a bit of a jerk - his head of oil is concerned about Rogers again and again. As a result, it is more difficult to love it or to get to the end of the movie. Moreover, music is not only memorable but Irving is Berlin. In fact, none of the songs were special, and although I only saw the movie, I could not get any of them. While this is still a pretty and valuable movie, some of the other films have no sparkle and magic. Well, it's great.
