I watched the McCoys combination and were glad to look at Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez! It was great to see them now, because the TV always said that it would be a television merged because I watched the upcoming show! It was very exciting! Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (small Luke) are something I can not understand. I know Walter Brennan's dead. So, I returned to my computer and tried to learn about it and found that there was something that could be said to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke would be grateful)! I searched for everything and succeeded .Micel Winkelman is something that I thought would be born in 1946. This show had value and morality, each show gave a lesson. The castle was incredible. Something good was good to avoid them. That's why it is impossible for anyone who can help! Thanks Glenda
