I remember taking a few minutes to film, and I'm very glad to mention that director Steve Gordon's director was about to die before he died of heart failure. Basically Arthur Bach (Golden Globe Winner and Oscar nominee Dudley Moore) is a happy drunk millionaire with everything he wants, a palace, Hobson (Oscar and Gold Globe winner and BAFTA nominee Sir John Gielgud) and many others. She married millions of Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott), the daughter of Susan (Jill Eikenberry), who she and her family had chosen to take over $ 750,000,000. Instead, Arthur himself, the royal patronage Linda Marolla (Gold Liza Minnelli) and her 3/4 family, Stanford (Thomas Barbour) and Aunt Martha (Geraldine Fitzgerald), threatening heritage. After Hobson's death, Arthur does not obey the family's wishes on the day of the wedding, but Martha's legacy still gives true legacy of true love to Linda. Barry Martin, Ralph Marolla, Gloria - Hooker as Anne De Salvo, American Peter Bach, Maurice Copeland, Justine Johnston Aunt Pearl Bach, Ms. Nesbitt as Florence Tarlow, Harriet - Martha Lowery - Martha's Maid, Preston Langley - John Bentley, as Perry and Peter Evans as Party Envoy. Moore is a pretty funny and almost always a bit like a drunken millionaire, Minnelli liked him as his favorite, and Gielgud certainly makes Moore's humorous modest sarcastic maid, a great Oscar winning experience as a terrific screwball comedy. He was awarded the Oscar Prize for the title of "Artur's Top 100 (79 years, 100 songs for 100 years)" and the best screenplay for screenwriter Screen for the BAFTA Anthony Asquith Burt Bacharach for Film Music for Award and won the Golden Currant for Best Comedy / Music. Sir John Gielgud, about 50 UK actresses, was number 35 and laughs at the film, 100 Year 100. Very Good!
