This is the most beloved film of all time. The main thing is that other mainstream films are not afraid to look at many heartwarming political misconceptions (such as spanking and women's obedience). In this film, the director seems to be invisible because he develops the story without any worry for insulting the audience. But for the sake of shock, I do not think anything is done here or it will not hurt anyone. Sean Young turns into a perfect and brave performance. The key actors most likely did not accept this role or wanted some basic script changes before accepting it. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <strong> Why did you wonder? Obviously, it does not fit into today's political atmosphere. It's amazing to me that some of the premium channels are already gentle porn (heavier porn and closer), but it's not the main movie like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, this film will not be available today even though it is only 11 years old. <br /> <br />
