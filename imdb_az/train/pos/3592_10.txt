Another strong chick is a flutter. This time around, it always happens around Diana Qusman, who fights in school. Rather than being expelled from the place, he is taking his rage to the boxing ring somewhere else. He is preparing to become a boxer and he meets with hairy Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a strong message if your dreams come true and someone does not believe in you (in this case, his father does not believe in him). Only the film appraises the price. Enjoy
