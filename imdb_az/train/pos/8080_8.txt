Well, that does not reflect my experience, so I use it a bit later to read a comment on this movie. Amitabh was a lot worse than the best movies for me. He was an immortal soul, an innocent victim. <br /> <br /> That's why it's a fresh breath for me. Because there is no kind of betrayal. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the child who plays Aryan may have done better. However, to be honest, the best part of this film was Shernaz Patel. He is a strange hero, the true savior who is superior to each proposed role. However, as Virendra Shahin's wife plays, I must say that I appreciate her contribution. He can do very little, but everything is condemned. But I'm sure he's going to the top of the audience. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in a habit to settle in the middle of Bollywood, you will not get much of this movie. However, if you look for something more and more, then it can give you some of the things you've lost.
