This is a strong document about internal assassination in Cameroon. In the law "sisters" are female lawyers and judges. In 2004, she was subjected to ill-treatment by her husband and won a divorce with a woman and a Muslim council. It's too long - about two hours - as well as the lawyers who represent successful individuals and defendants and court halls are interested in women's judges. As you have abandoned me, this will give you a number of questions about how the change really took place. How and when did women perform their duties in Cameroon? Has this story effectively influenced the treatment of women in most of their spouses? Was it a case of divorce against the spouses' wishes by the Muslim court? I do not think filmmakers can answer these questions. The film was prepared two years ago, not yesterday. And their film deserves a wide audience.
