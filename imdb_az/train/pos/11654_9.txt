I agree with the statement above, in which I love realism and in many movies (not movies related to eating disorders) producers forget. Every day they get a problem and create a dramatic scene, and then at the end of the movie everything is perfect again. It does not mean saying everything can not be improved, and it does not mean that things are not in this movie; most of the film does not make those problems, and at the end of the movie everything is perfect. People do not admit it and do not want to be healed when it comes to eating illness, then the life is peachy, time is needed, and I love the way we grow up with characters and face challenges with them. better and worse, because it is a very important part of the film. It is the mindset of people with eating disorders, and shows a very realistic way of experiencing difficulties and pains, and I like it. How I like it When it comes to eating disorders, secret and treacherous people feel especially scared to see how people react when they approve it. I thought this movie was very inviolable and beautiful and well-read and challenged by one of my favorites.
