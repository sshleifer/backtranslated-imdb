Torrent was the first and last to Greta Garbo. The first American movie at MGM was the only studio that said it would not work in the US. Torrent, a popular Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez, said the case was based on Entre Naranjos and was subsequently billed over someone else's loan. The corteze's mother, Martha Mattox, is a seductive, Garbo and Cortez, who are inconsistent with each other because of their torture. <br /> <br /> Mattox is a bad woman with some thoughts on who your son marries. Let's remind, that Spain and such adjusted marriages were quite appropriate at that time. Mattox, son of Mack Swain, is a wealthy man with a lip, as Gertrude Olmstead's father-in-law. Blasko Ibanez was formerly the fourth horse of "Apocalypse's four fathers," "Blood and Sand," and had previously become "bigger" big old roots. Rudolph draws a movie with Valentino. It would be interesting for Valentino to do this with Garbo, but when it was done, it would be out of the box. Anyway, Valentino wannabes one of the men with Ricardo Cortez fills with lead. <br /> <br /> Valentino is therefore not the only reason why simply the lead character Garbo is different from the other two workings previously mentioned. Mattox and his advisor left Spain after dumping by Cortez, who did what Tully Marshall said to him, and went to France where he was a great opera star. And there leads to quite scandalous life. <br /> <br /> Mattox is even angry if he returns to Spain and tries to update everything. There is a noticeable political career for his son. Cortez now works in the Spanish Parliament, who is quite curious about Cortes. <br /> <br /> Horses, floods and rivers are a ferry that causes all kinds of provocation. Cortez is actually trying to save the torrent from the harmful path. When they come together, they have a clear debate, the cruelty from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here are very considerate for primitive times, even though they appear here. They are very similar to the tables used in the Fox's Rain in the 20th Century, the 1939 Oscar winner for Special Effects. Unfortunately, Oscar's debut for Torrent appeared a year ago. <br /> <br /> I will not end it, because you need to see the movie to come together with Cortez and Garbo. Garbo evaluated his performance in a correct way, and his role was exceptionally sophisticated when the gesture that exaggerated in a period was in the motionless silent screen. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > It's great for America's big screen and for today's audience.
