Does anyone know which repressor John T is driving? At the end of the 1970s, I resemble the middle of Ford. This movie is next to my beloved wife. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. The pickup truck is just as close to the first luggage I was driving and soon found something like this. I would like to restore the collection I need to resemble. And the music was awesome and the player was very good. What is the place and location of the lady who praises John's speech? Perhaps there was a stunt for the stage at the tower where John falls? In what year of the Mustang, Debra W was the driver of this show. It looked like 60 models. Thanks,
