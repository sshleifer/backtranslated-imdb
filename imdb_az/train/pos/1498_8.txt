This is a very entertaining and sometimes very creepy anthology that is a bit short in the scenario division, making it flawed with acting, groundwork, and generally admiration. The best episodes of this were played by a scary writer with a novel by Denholm Elliot (a perfect example that he just pulled out of the pedestrian); The third episode with the late John Pertwee, a horrific horror film starring Christopher Lee with her daughter and a horror horror movie starring more than just a new role in the latter project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is confusing and inspirational, both of which obviously have the potential to smooth out! Cushing is at least in the weakest part of course, of course, the wax figure of a woman like the woman in the local wax museum does not help her because she is said to be "beautiful"! There was a shocking beauty and a woman who had a turtle jaw instead. This is one of the smallest quibbles on the edge of the film and it's time to take the time to get home in this beautiful country.
