I gave this movie a few stars, but here's a "Life Lifetime" presentation, really, in the story scene - here in New York. <br /> <br /> Get the most out of this channel, Ayova, Oregon, Virginia, LA and so on. Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto, or some other Canadian territory. <br /> <br /> This is one of the 10 best rated videos on this site. Of course, not for originality, but many times for this story, many changes are very similar to that particular one. Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and al-Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan and many more, are on the big screen, which is past and present with mega-stars. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> In my opinion, this is one of the best I've ever seen.

But for a clean, simple taste, this was a prominent one. With a bare part of your budgets, you were equal to the results of "You've got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle". Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan did not do much better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan; where co-stars and auxiliary staff were equal to those in mega-films.
