It was a powerful Poirot / Suchet, a television mystery choice. The heroes were brilliant and well-behaved. The area and the main venue - a student dormitory - were excellent. Japp was not something special, he did not miss the story for me. One important point is that many Poirot guards do not have to act well or behave well. And I think that the secrets of Poirot are quite harsh in some of their judgments. Finally, I have read several Christie novels - in recent years no one - and many viewers are worried about the changes from the novel. Please watch, imagine what you are in the movie, do not think what you think. That is, the secrets of Poirot change dramatically, but you believe in the readers and the riders. With only the exception of Five Little Pants, which is fantastic in character, character and subject, Poirot films are no longer good or bad. For the record, I already saw Poirot / Suchet movies. Finally, movies without Limon, Hastings and / or Japp are neither good nor bad because they are not. The presence of this, or obstruzif (almost always with Japp) or has nothing to do with Hastings. The lemon is in the middle.
