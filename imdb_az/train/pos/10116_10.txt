A perfect and accurate movie ... McGovern has great pains to pay for research and writing. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern brings to Christopher Eccleston, though he can make misleading reviews and comments on those who do not want the stories to be clean, sweet, and brilliant. Plays a high profile role as he plays in Hillsborough. I did this movie accurately and well, and offered it as Hillsborough and applauded McGovern for my unapologetic writing. Yes, the hats belong to the writer, actor, production staff. Great movie!
