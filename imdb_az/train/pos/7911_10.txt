As a child, I loved the computer animation though I was pretty limited and the tools are almost non existent. This movie was in my fears and I was watching incredible pictures and almost hypnotic music, and shaped my desire to create moving things on the computer. This is a full package contract between music and video that really packed one or two blows. If you recognize any child who wants to join the computer animation, this should be absolute. <br /> <br /> I still think about this movie about 20 years later as one of my top three favorites. The peculiarity, I still think, is that, despite the depletion of Hollywood, it's not the same as today's McMovies. Now I want to see if I can do it again; If imitation is the most sincere form of kindness, this movie deserves a tune of imitation =)
