Dawn Youssef's "Coonskin", one by one and only by Ralph Bakshi, is a satirical indictment of blogging and negative black stereotypes of films as well as black confusion in modern America (modern day, say - 1975). <br /> <br /> But this is Bakshi's film, a controversial, thrilling and almost only a glimpse of the film. Another movie that wants to shock for shock is not a casual "shock-joke". By Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows his name knows that if he shoots a movie, there is something big ... <br /> <br /> Although the roots are cheap blaxploitation-based, the "Coonskin" is a basic white movie or any snapping flick extinguished. "Coonsin" wants to be more. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Volunteers" accuse strange people, but in reality they seem to show love, beauty and heart in awe-inspiring places. <br /> <br /> Coonskin explains a story from some convicts waiting for the prison. <br /> <br /> One of the prisoners explains a story about three brothers in Brother Harlem: "Brotherhood" is almost impossible to get out of prison in the world. Bear, Brave Rabbit, Vatican Fox, who wants a part of respect and action and is ready to receive any necessary means. <br /> <br /> The star of black musicians, Barry White and Scatman Crothers, also the first black writer Charles Gordone, to get Pulitzer's home. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < "will never know the meaning of his word. This word seems to have never been heard. But there is a need for extremism in a similar matter. Real sledgehammer satire. <br /> <br /> Some topics can not be solved in a mild way. <br /> <br /> Bakshi, the goddess, is merciless. Here, no member or minority on the Harlem scene does not appear to be wounded. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" as "real" depending on what their mood and situation is. Cartoons and people all share the same truth and need to be taken literally. <br /> <br /> Bakshi does not only show ugly cartoons for shocking value. There is always something to say. The black face is also sincere. Unlike Spike Lee's "Bamboozled" here, I use it to make use of it, and I can really say one thing. <br /> <br /> Like all 99.9% of Baker's movies, there's animation and live action. Usually at the same time. Bakshi is not just a cunning here. <br /> <br /> All this method is intertwined with one another when talking about something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is inevitable. Many of these types of films (including Bakshi) are very important, and the moment is much worse. <br /> <br /> In some cases, music, clothes, cords, and even sometimes resemble each other. the city resembles a picture of a time capsule, regardless of the attitude, the spirit and the heart, but the f-king's ear. <br /> <br /> Of course, I know that I talk about films, state of the states, and everyone in the people. <br /> <br /> Some of the black characters even bunny (junglebunny) are a great bear and a fox. One of the most sinister and unusual racist characters is the harlem Polly, a dirty dirty n ----- s on the trail after being killed by the police. But it's not just a job for him. This is not the case with those who wear shields. <br /> <br /> A consistency with the Caucasus and her spouse is one of the most moving pieces of the whole film. Play as an opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> Promo line: WARNING: "This film respects everyone!" It's not just sweets. <br /> <br /> Dane was warned by Youssef
