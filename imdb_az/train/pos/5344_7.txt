This is a very good Spanish movie, but I am very worried that I lost most of the time because most of them did not know what was happening in the Spanish Civil War or during the war. I had a great prestige as a teacher of history, but we can easily see how the film can be mixed up in order to break the whole film. <br /> <br /> In Spain, there will be great concerns about filmmaking, but may be a little bit complicated by the other audience. <br /> <br /> The 12-year-old Carol mother returned to her mother's home. Years passed and they come from New York to Spain. Although strange, Carol speaks Spanish very well, and most of the film shows how it is adapted. Why, even though she and her mother were alone, now I will now pour out those who fought in the war on the Republican side of Carol's father (for those who can not afford this bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The film takes exceptional footprint for your favorite camera work and music. It's pretty slow when you're the one who gets the movies in this way and the speed of sliding is not bad. I have seen a few other Spanish films about this war, and this is not good or bad - it's just a good part of the movie about the survivors, as well as the pleasure of life. /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which party is, the Republicans were mostly Socialists and supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico and volunteers from many countries (including the United States). The nationalists were led by Franco and supported by Portuguese, German and Italian fascist states.
