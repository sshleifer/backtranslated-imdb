Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (credible Kurt Russell's convincing and credible performance) is thrown into an empty space after he is considered obsolete by the brutal and arrogant Colonel Mekum (adorable by Jason Isaacs). Todd and his fellow soldiers were replaced by new genetically engineered warriors. Todd needs to defend this society when it comes to peaceful self-confident peaceful demonstrators and when it comes to field work of new soldiers. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, a clever and provocative workman by David Webb Peoples, reflects a cold, cold and harsh horizontal appearance in the near future, while maintaining a fast, rapidly growing and strange, noisy tone. Moreover, Anderson manages the moments of human movements (Todd is really brazen in the struggle to interact with his earlier emotional emotions) and moves through stunning gusto with mixed action scenes. Russell describes a powerful and effective Todd pantomime; giving lots of emotions without saying too much and instead reflects the role of a player through body exercises and facial expressions. Such as the merciless rival warrior Caine 607, Connie Nielson, Sean Pertwee as Compassionate Sandra, a quiet little boy Nathan like Jason and Taylor Thorne, an amazingly experienced veteran Captain of the Gary Busey, Chiklis, magnificent Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle by Jason Scott Lee as wise Mayor Hawkins. Better yet, this film is a profound and important commentary on the importance of intellectual power over moral values ​​and physical strength to be a merciless soldier. David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely's orchestral score and first-degree special effects enhance the overall quality of this outstanding science fiction / motion hybrid.
