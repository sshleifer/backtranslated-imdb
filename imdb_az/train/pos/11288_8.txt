When I see that Johnny Weissmuller is the best of all Tarzan films by almost all critics, I think some people are entertaining but there is no argument with that. One thing: this 105 minutes I saw that the series is the longest. <br /> <br /> That's why it's very important for me. <br /> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify" is a good blend of action, blend, and romance, and the only thing missing is color and stereo sounds. The film draws a lot of attention to something: leather! "Jane has never had anything to do with this movie, but has set Hays Kod while preparing the next Tarzan film, showing how much Maureen O'Sullivan's figure is. <br /> <br /> The underwater scene is not for a long time. <br /> <br /> A woman under water did not give a good figure to anyone. <br /> <br /> Here's a lot of activities. <br /> <br /> Even though this movie offers everything except the "boy" (their son), I want to see a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan shouts about Tarzan many times No one with his "lung" pair there was no problem.
