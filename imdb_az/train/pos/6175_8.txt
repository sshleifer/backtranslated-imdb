When I was first shown, I saw this pilot and I am sure that countless "soul" fans hate him, like the Batman, Green Hornet, and so on. Some, like the "camp", took the character. But I did not get enough of Batman, because I thought it was fun, so it's the same in some shows. There are two parts that are with me. First, Dennee's supporter was fatal wounded and he is dramatically involved with the fact that he always abides by law and obeys his exact letter. Then he says something, "Boy, I was a fool!" Its way to tell Denny that he is a vigilante instead (though the TV is Batman type). Then she looks like a place to let her kiss her, but she is not deceived, because she is honest to kiss convincingly! This is a fine example of a "camp" that is "grounded" by both the actor and the actress.
