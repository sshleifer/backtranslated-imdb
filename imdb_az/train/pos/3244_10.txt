The Nomad 7 and the HVR interpretation could not agree more. Perfectly retarded Sunday morning movie. <br /> <br /> But often, I often see how often I want to return to this movie that surprises me. I initially transferred this movie to the VHS, 12 years ago she had a free weekend previews (HBO maybe?). I have never heard of it before. I do not know why it did not sell well. ?? When the DVD is released the most, I'm one of the first films I've released. Great combination of casting and writing. <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > If Adam Sandler is your alley, it's probably not your cup of tea. You need to pay full attention to this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the next review will be at my age of 12. But still, as I know, when the police cars head on the stairs, I'm going to lose it (Ed O'Neill's face PRICELESS!). Recommended 110%.
