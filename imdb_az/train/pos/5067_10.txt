Here, at IMDb.com, I read an idea that Gray Owl is Pierce Brosnan's best performance. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that the director is an effective hand. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> After the movie, there was something else in my view - this is the closest movie to the film: original books and the atmosphere inside it. <br /> <br /> And a little more, I pay my respect for the original Gray Owl.
