A movie I decided to go and see because I'm a great fan of adult animation. I often do not develop a film around a famous actor or actress, but on the contrary, a movie or story style allows the film to be regarded as an art work rather than an act of actor talent to distinguish its style. <br /> <br /> This movie is more about the style than the story. When I found an interesting story (Blade Runner and a series of animated films), sometimes it was a little difficult to watch, and it did not feel as if all of them had come together. Certainly there was a mix of French animation and Japanese Anime. Whether it's a good thing to watch or not. It is a cure for the eyes and this is a work of art in this sense. <br /> <br /> If you love adult animation or want to see a movie different from most of the movies right now. I recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoy the film's experience, but it would have been better, because it was a bit disappointing
