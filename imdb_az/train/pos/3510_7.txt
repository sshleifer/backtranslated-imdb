<br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls who say that this film is a star and is not real. I do not have a background or come from the heroes' environment, but I've been working in low-income and working class neighborhood for many years and have felt that the players are very realistic and what the behavior of young people is. I do not know what the explanation of others is because the film's happening is "unreal." The dialogue is great. <br /> <br /> Low budget production cost did not bother me a bit. I felt that the natural lightening enhanced the character of the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, not the storyline or character development, but true Hollywood is not a product or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I was completely involved in the character's motivation and reaction. The player was convincing and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> Good movie, if you like Transformers or Fast & Furious in your opinion, go from it. <br /> <br /> (In the case of negative commentators with Trolls: click on their names, and most of them will not see other reviews or only negative comments).
