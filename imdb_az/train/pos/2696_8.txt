Police, investigation, crime, suspicion: we all got acquainted with many films. Most of the film deals with today's involvement in the murder, intended to attract spectators and provide an exciting environment. However, most of the excitement lovers will pay attention to such latest films without forgetting the old ones. But it can be easily deceived by these people. <br /> <br /> <strong> Gorde Vue, a unique film by Claude Miller, can be a film based on suspicion, although it is over 20 years old. <br /> Do you have a lot of movement? The events presented in the film do not really happen as soon as it happens. But the way they are executed is a large part of the film. Jerome Charles Martinaud (Michel Serrault) is inspected by inspector Gallien (Lino Ventura) and Insector Belmont (Guy Marchand). New Year's Eve, a rainy evening, and not so right for such a meeting. However, after the two boys' aggression and murder, the end of the door, which is doubtful in the affection of the old year, should be open. In other words, (who quoted more than a movie), who really should be found in a bad monster. To achieve this, there are a lot of effort and a lot of emotions on both sides ... <br /> <br /> Some people are criticizing the word in script. However, I was asking them: if the investigation had a lot of questions, it would have to be said much. This word touches many roots of the genre. In no way it is boring, but as an observer in the whole film, as an observer. In addition, the film has good preparations as described in the stories. It's too small and too small - enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting. Martinod's wife Chantal (Romy Schneider) is the most memorable flashbacks for me when talking about a lovely Christmas ... But this includes flashbacks and street views, including street lounges. All this helped keep them at a good pace. GARDE saw a VUE, always mentioned this movie as one of the "defenders" of French cinema against mess and chaos accusations. <br /> <br /> But these aspects, though not addressed to many viewers, do not love such films and can not find content and performance satisfactory. But the GARDE A VUE is also valuable to such people. Why? For the sake of performances. But here I do not expect to praise Romy Schneider before me. GARDE A VUE is not a Romy Schneider tool. She is doing a terrible job as a mom who suffers from despair for the lost child. He describes a quiet, concrete person who does not give up the proposed tea river but does not want to play with words. Part of a deep discussion of life and position is brilliant and more reliable in the LA PASSANTE DE SANS SOUCI with the extreme melancholy role of Elsa. Still working. But Romy Schneider does not have much time on the screen. In fact, it appears for the first time after 45 minutes on credits; She is a woman and, in a different way, comes symbolically at midnight with the New Year. Its role is completely supportive. Who really rocks Lino Ventura. Antoine Gallien, a middle-aged inspector who wants to learn the truth, knows that his questions are a "missile" against any other dispute, but he does not hesitate. She is a woman teacher who has been married three times and is absolutely satisfied with women's minds. He does not consider his job as a game to play, but it is a real service. Finally, he is a person who can not find it abnormal to sit there on New Year's Eve. Michel Serrault also performs a wonderful job of expressing fear in the final scenes of the film. But I got up to Mr Ventura. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> The memorable moments are that this aspect is not a movie that can easily be analyzed. The entire movie is memorable, it will be repeated several times and feel it with its atmosphere, and I have never said good music. For me, Chantal and Inspector Gallien's speech is the brilliant perfect moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> GARDE A VUE is a very interesting film, performances. It's a new year ... and is it easy to open the door now? When you decide to look at the memorable director by Claude Miller you will find it. 8/10
