Although I do not hear the name repeatedly, I'm not worried about seeing this movie in theaters. Finally, this week and what a delight followed. For some reason, I did not expect it to be very good, so when I sat down and got bored with it, I was completely surprised and then completely pulled myself up. I read a lot of other user comments, and it has caused me a lot of people to talk about his battle in the ring, but how good about Diana is that he is a true warrior in life. Everything she needs to do is find her where she is, and the rings help her get there. It is a very clever story and I am surprised that this is the first time Michelle Rodriguez did - what a wonderful job he did. Adrian and his coach were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit rough, but not important around the edges. Stories, wills and performances are superior to absolutely any defects (usually with indie cinematography). A description of a girl who finds herself and has won her condition, and K.O. For Michelle Rodriguez!
