A perfect favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon for Halloween. I know that it's not too upset, but with the window of "Jerry Tom" is a "trick" like "Trick or Treat" as a cleanser with a hanging to make it as a blind and dust-shirt; but still want to put on my Halloween cartoons list. In a short time, Tom listened to a ghost story program on the Radio Wad, and was afraid of the fear story. A drama inside the story (end-of-the-line hair, a thrust into the throat, dragging on the shoulder) occurs in the Tom. . . just <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And you know, this short Mammy Two The first of four cartoon attacking shoes; others The Lonesome Mouse, Mouse at Home, and Nit-Witty Kitty. Also, this short Tom is the first of his twenty-five animated films. The Lonesome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Trouble, The Mouse Dinner, Quiet !, Trap Happy, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleanup, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and The Cat Over and Chuck Jones-led Mouse.
