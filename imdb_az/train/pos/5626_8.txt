Marjorie, a woman working in a museum and living with two female roommate, Pat and Terry. One night goes into his car and a masked man is attacked with a knife. His plan is to rape, but it helps to escape When Marjorie's roommates come to work, one day, his attacker comes there. His name begins with a long battle in Joe.A. The man has his purse. The police can not help her. But then he can compress his eyes and mouths with insect bites and kill them soon enough. She closes her and suffers the same physical and psychological attacks as Joe. (1986) directed by Robert M. Young. Based on a non-Broadway game debated by William Mastrosimone since 1982. Fraar Fawcett, who lost control of cancer last year, is convincing, as James Russo, Joe Alfre Woodard and Dia, who play the role of an aggressor in the Marjorie Game, is as great as Scarwid Pat and Terry.James Avery. It looks like a Security Guard. It has a Gold Globe nomination. This is not a movie that is intended to entertain you. One question asks for revenge. This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.
