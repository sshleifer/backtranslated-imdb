Before watching, I did not know anything about the movie, and I think that I'm at first tolerant and then expect it to be "no waiting", much more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting, strange, but interesting. This story was about the gaps I had thrown out of the audience. There is no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating a "romantic" air. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply subtle. There were some unusual strange chemicals that could not stand the opposition; I'm in love with him, and here I am writing this review. The subtle love images by two actors were perfect and I believe that this is the foundation of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a romantic comedy on a daily basis; In fact, all of us will not appreciate it. Sitting for a while, and then slowly I did not first catch up with the small things. I can not guarantee that everyone can enjoy, but I hope.
