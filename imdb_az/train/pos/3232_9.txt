I went to see this movie and can say that this is one of the better films I've seen this year. The intruder consists of 5-6 different stories, all of which occur in a small town on the same day. Recalling a portion of Tarantino's films, perhaps, comes at the end of stories very well. The majority of actors have acted very well and are very important in the real drama of this type. Especially I am glad to be acting chief roles by Sanna Hietala and Juha Kukkonen. I saw IMDB receiving misinformation about Sanna. His name is, as you have looked at me;), Heikkila, not Hietala.
