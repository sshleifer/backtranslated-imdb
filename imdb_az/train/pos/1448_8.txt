People who have political aspirations across the country, and especially in the political scene, should take the time to see this film. The film is called "City Square" and with its small imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It will only open in New York. There is a story of a prominent politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino), with little effort to manage a large metropolitan city with great diligence. His right hand, in contrast to the Deputy Mayor Kevin Calxoun (John Kusack), is a brilliant individual who is dependent on true guidance and designates both higher positions. Everything is working in this direction until police fire is used, fires an investigation by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes that the charge is against the municipal building and mayor. The death of a six-year-old boy and a police officer is responsible for a career-offense that has resulted in a political criminal offense that has led to suspicious release and Walter Stern, united with professional leaders such as Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. (Martin Landau) and Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) are deeply involved in mafia bosses. At the same time, there are officials like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) working in the New York probation office. However, this is between the mayor and his deputy, who was accidentally taken over by fire. A great tool to become a classic for Cusack and sure bet contender. ****
