There are problems with the presentation of this film, even though it may be insulting to people looking for temporary and cultural fidelity, but the watcher is challenged to think over a variety of issues. One of them is the nature and nature of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Some are historical features of the Bible and the faith. Third, Jesus is humanity. The tension between Christ's betrayal is evolved and carried out through the film. Jewish passion is presented in parallel to Christ's work. Following the death of Judas, the observer may feel this. Peter's denial and guilt, however, does not portray any of the strongest portions of the Jewish drama. Chris Sarandon offers incredible or not, novel and provocative Christ. I would like to read this movie on DVD and even on VHS or use in discussion groups.
