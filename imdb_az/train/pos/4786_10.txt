Straight Story is an old man who has decided to visit his sick brother in the state line. He decides to go on a trip and wants to burn himself, unless he can go on a picnic. The film portrays the beautiful journey path and the way it touches along the way. <br /> <br /> The rest of her daughter, Richard Farnsworth, turns into a staggering performance, especially as Sissy Spacek's daughter, and is a beautiful, yet finer, role-playing role as Harry Dean Stanton. <br /> <br /> At first, I felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country would be boring, but soon, we found that Lynch would recommend this movie to everyone with all his insights on human life.
