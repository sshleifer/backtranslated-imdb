Really cool flick. Needed for any music snob. You do not really need to know about groups to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I only heard two songs from the Dandy Warhol. One thing is required, it is an open mind. <br /> <br /> Films shot around Brian Jonestown's massacre. Dandy Warhols plays the role of "rival group" in the film, but they are the second to BJM. Dandy Warhols plays a role as the first actor in the film, but later BJM's excitement and unpredictability. You can not help, but you are amazed by the group. and his very charismatic front, Anton Newcombe. It is also a deep film and research in this music industry. Just watch and enjoy this movie.
