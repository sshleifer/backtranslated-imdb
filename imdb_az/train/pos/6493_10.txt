I remember this as a child in the UK, and the story and the story of Laurence Olivier surprised me. The next day, we talked about something else at school. Imagine that the prices for the first show were great. It's pretty simply the best documentary series. Nevertheless, the story dropped onto the bone they were able to handle very well. It is interesting that the battles of England and North Africa are important, but not yet known by the Americans. Serial battles between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of the German soldiers on the Eastern Front, and the Japanese soldiers' ill-treatment by American troops. The portrayal of the genocide felt guilty of treating me as a non-Jewish European, Jewish nation. I do not know why this is not the first IMDb rating. Perhaps they demonstrate their prejudices against documentary films. Spoiler - we won.
