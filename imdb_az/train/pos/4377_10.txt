Until the mid-90s, in my opinion, it was a high point for historical drama. Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - reflected a different passion and intensity in subsequent periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was rarely a unique and exciting taste of the time and place of the film. There is really everything - an exciting story, excellent acting, remarkable dialogue and a breathtaking scenery. I really was really affected by the dialogue. I can imagine that people were talking and acting at the beginning of the eighteenth century. <br /> <br /> Another thing that surprises me is the expression of characters. I found it to be more obedient and shocking than movies built in modern times. <br /> <br /> It was a very brave and sexually-minded event that's a very realistic one in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> Behavior was very difficult, a difficult moment. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there were many intrigue and political sublime complexes that complicated many things, but still did not deprive the main story. <br /> <br /> The move was also very good and caught. Something I'll find forever, in fact, there is no soundtrack during the highlighted action in the movie. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always be on my favorite movies list. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always be on the list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to anyone.
