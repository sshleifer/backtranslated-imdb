Both of these parter were excellent - the best of the series's turns. The exact bits of the story run from previous films, but what TV shows are not available these days. What we came here was a good story. A great (really intimidating) wolf in a deep hole-based prison, some super aliens in the case - the best "new" aliens of the updated series, mostly sympathetic and convincing human symbols. <strong> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Loved every minute of this.
