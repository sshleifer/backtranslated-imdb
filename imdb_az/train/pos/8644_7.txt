The hopeless, but harmless "white bucket" was regarded as a lonely conscious, exciting alcoholic drink that began as a husband. It was difficult to watch him at one of the next stages in the film - it was unexpected and scary. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is full of strange, scenic scenes that have forced me to keep my breath several times, and I do not mean the action scenes. I almost made the scenes of dialogue so beautiful that I did what I saw and ran to my heart. It was like watching a cage and watching a lion watch and killing each other. Again, I was impressed by the scenario; <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. This talented young actress is very rare to create an appearance these days, which is the joy of that time. Some moments in this movie brought me to tears. I want to say. <br /> <br /> This girl is awkward to wake you up, and I clearly remember seeing fuzzy eyes several times. <br /> <br /> It feels like to deceive the quality art of movie artists. rating only "KALIFORNIA" ***. But dark feelings are very powerful and surprising to strengthen it. I believe everyone should see this movie. I really do it.
