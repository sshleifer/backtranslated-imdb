True, Ally McBeal's idea for this television series, which has made a great success in the world and even in Germany. However, Edel & Starck said it was different from Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work together well. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), a romantic replay and a constant spy, played by prominent German actor Christophe M. Ohrt and Sandra Strong, performed by Honorary Rebecca Immanuel (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, getin!), Murdered as a sitcom in and around Berlin they are interconnected when dealing with their work. Additionally, it is supported by a magnificent stone of co-stars, performed by Isabel Tuengerthal, a rare tale with a great comic potential, especially with their secretary. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Both shady driving dealers, Otto and Gilbert, Frankin's noble children Sandra's best friend and room-friendly Patricia , does not forget to perform by beautiful Barbara Demmer. More than anything else to watch Monday: The series and the stars have received several awards. <br /> <br /> Will Flames come to Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we have to wait for more episodes ......
