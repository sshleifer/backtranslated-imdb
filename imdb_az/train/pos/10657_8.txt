Jeopardy, studios, big budgets / boxes are inbetween one of the pumped films - a feeling of being a stock movie. It's just 70 minutes and not many sets, and only star Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a difficult lady in the Mexican desert when she runs to a runaway convoy trying to help her husband. Most of the film focuses on how he deals with the captain who wants to respond to his assistant. There are some psychological battles. <br /> <br /> This is a surprisingly effective little movie - its shortest pace and Stanwyck's promise is great (but still praise).
