At first glance, it is natural to compare the places where Laura and Sidar ended. Both of them have good features, as well as Otto Preminger, both directed by Dana Andrews and Gen Tierney. But most of the comparisons have come to an end. Laura talked to luxury, sophisticated people, just about the means to find confusion in a murder. Where the Sidewalk Ends are in completely different layers. These are people who are accustomed to seeing the unhappiness of society more than betraying clothes parties. The sidewalk is an angry movie full of desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or another weapon. The small hoods were beaten by dime and the police beat the confessions of the bribe-takers. It was as if he was breathing after being caught in a criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> While I'm seeing everything I do, Dana Andrews gives one of her best performances. beaten police, Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon. It is the type of police used to shed domestic parrots if it informs or confesses to it. One night, it's too far away and kills a person by accident. He does his best to cover it. However, the fate of the deceased's wife, Morgan Taylor (Tierney), is complicated, and his father is the number one suspect in the criminal case. <br /> <br /> Morgan's father had told the world that Dixon should do his best to clear older people without showing himself. <br /> <br /> Technically, where Sidewalk Ends is rare. Along with the great performance of Andrews, the movie has always been wonderful Tierney. He has a quality that can make the most painful of those moments, and it seems brighter. The rest of the shedding is as solid as the true mystery of Tom Tully and the wrong suspect. The direction, sets, lighting and cinematography on the edge of the actor are all the tops. Generally, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> If I have a complaint (and, of course, there's a very small one) Tierney is almost perfect for the role and the environment. It is a bit difficult to believe that such a woman could interfere with these extraordinary characters. This is really his fault, not the way Tierney is encountered. It looks a bit nicely polished and exquisite for its part. However, his soft, sincere and confident nature adds a sense of realism to his image.
