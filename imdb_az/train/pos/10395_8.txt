A fantastic Arab adventure. The former King Ahmed and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Black Narcissus Sabu) is interested in the love of Ahmed, who was kidnapped by King Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There's a tough moment here. Always creates new adventures for heroes. Personally, I missed Ahmed and his prince somewhat (John Justin, played by Ahmed, does not need to ask what is listed in the fourth line of credits). Conrad Veidt is always a fun guy, a great villain and Sabi is a lot of fun as the thieves princess who finds a gin at one point. Miles Malleson really liked the Sultan of the Sultan of Basra. Collects beautiful toys in the world. Jaffar's daughter bribes a mechanical flying jumper in his hand. It was probably one of the biggest children's films of all time, but special effects are today's giant days. Children will, of course, cook the overlapping images when Abu and jinn are on the screen. And the scene with a giant spider looks particularly awful. The majority of the younger generation is probably better than a puppet on a puppet who does not look as distant as a spider, although animation by Willis O'Brien, although most of King Kong appears to be bad at this point. 8/10.
