This is a porn movie of nature. With porn, I do not mean sex. I mean almost a thousand birds, or hundreds of angels, or an immense image of an extreme waterfall or icebergs. Some of the shootings in the film are available only for the trailer to enter cinemas to see it for ten seconds before disappearing, which can never be seen for the rest of the movie. <BR / <br /> There is almost no space in this movie. The film does not just deliver a story from three animal families saying that "Penguins are better than Mart". Sin is related to three main areas: (1) James Earl Jones writers who wrote one of the worst lines in the history of nature film, (2) a dramatic dramaticizing group that tells you everything you feel is not motivated by the movie and finally, but most importantly, ) The story is a film about life, no endurance, no movement, no life, no writers jumping from place to place or without cause. Having hoped for hope that half of the movie was more than half the hinges, hoping for my heart, I would go back to my place and be able to survive with the animals for a long-term test. <br /> <br /> There was almost no science in the film. It is hot and cold (not just season), just ignore that, ignore that there are more extreme on the ground than because the pillars are never hot because they did not have any tilt. It would be worse if there was no rotation like Mercury because half of the planet would cook and the other half would freeze. In the end, they used the expression "people and animals", which means that humans are not animals, except the laws of nature. So much for science. <br /> <br /> I have to fill the camera business with a loan, and that's why I call it nature porn. Everything that looks like photographic photography in a mechanically controlled way, from a super-slow motion, has been used to provide stunning moments for a few (and some "some" cautious) raises the bar of other nature movies. So, I'm not convinced that everything on the screen is nature. Some of the shots that show the huge irrigation hole in Africa have changed from season to season, as CGI. <br /> <br /> A director has shown that he expects such a suspicion and has been built in other shots, of course, but it did not do that. <br /> <br /> For a movie about the place, it should be shown. What we saw was pristine. We need to take the words of the speaker that some species are in danger because of climate change. They did not prove it to us. They did not show Alberta's poisonous tail ponds out of space. They did not show us how to spit on the Pacific. They do not show nightly illumination of people around the planet. These are like the Earth. Why is it covered to feel good? <br /> <br /> The latest criticisms of the content are predatory. At any time, when a predator on the screen really shows the hunt, the music has almost turned into Ming Doom scene Rings by the predator with Sauron's last-evil character. But the predators are not bad. The best ingredients of the type of food are essential to ensure survival. We are hurt ourselves. Immediately after the predator is captured, it is just another thing to claim that death and eating are not really happening. The last insult "dad" was abandoned to die after the courage to eat the polar bear. <br /> <br /> "Wrong bear, old!" You will almost hear what they say. <br /> My theater is partly due to this, but maybe not. I was planning to see something more clearly at home than I did on my HDTV LCD. But the picture was blurred and was presented at the same 16: 9 rate I could get at home. And in a motion-packed scene near the end of the movie (I can not imagine what happens in this diagram), it was damaged and we lost a few colors and ultimately totally darkened. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> But how do I know?
