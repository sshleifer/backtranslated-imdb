Kurosawa looks fresh in the Tokyo sediment, despite the fact that the truth is the subject of truth and the loss of perception of reality. Kurosawa, in my opinion, stretches for a style that is antithesis - I think Kurosawa wants to make a picture of Ozu. This is a rare flavor in this handwriting structure, which is poorly engineered, poorly thought out. Despite being both secular and troublesome, it was still interesting and well-paced, and Stray Dog, describing Japan's slums and social poverty without being too heavy or embarrassed, desu ka, br>> <strong> None of the Kiraosawa backdrop features were available. <br /> <br /> Please be advised that this is not a film that Kurosawa has ruled.
