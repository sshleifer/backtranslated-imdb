"Addictive" is an adjective I've heard many times when talking about certain TV shows. Finally, dramas like Lost, Heroes, and Prison Break have won this description. However, as they are as attractive as (and they are really), I can expect some episodes from some series, even a few days before even seeing some of the greedy "new 24" of the Prison Break. With all respect, such a thing can not be and for good reason: another silver screen tension is based on a real-time structure. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> So from any other show, it's 24 and therefore almost all seasonal (DVD) on seven days and I have to watch less: the episode that took place during the day of Frickin's time was NYPD Blue trademark (and recently Deadwood); The most striking idea of ​​the main TV channel is the fact that the episode of the episode lasted for the last 24 hours was 1 per ep (actual time of operation is 41 minutes, while the other 19 television shows were occupied by ads). Blues presented non-linear storytelling (today a necessary element). <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < Br>) probably offers a cheerful atmosphere at first glance at the hero: Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is a chess game with his daughter Kimberly (Elisha Cuthbert) and a few minutes later, with Leslie Hope, tender to your spouse. Like Sopranos, something unexpected and shocking is behind the corner: When Jack just leaves his room, Jack calls for immediate work. Half a night? I'm afraid: Bauer CTU (Anti-Terrorism Agency) agent and his director, David-Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), African-American presidential candidate who will be in Los Angeles, have gained a credible intelligence on the possible impact of his life. For the whole day in Barcelona (oh, right, almost forgot: events happen on the day of the California President). No time to breathe: Jack should work within the next 24 hours. Unfortunately, he has a tendency to ignore the protocol and does not sit well with George Mason (Xander Berkeley), a vulnerable person from any department that wants to intervene. <br /> <br /> It is very intense, it is very difficult to recommend those who want to pay attention, but everyone who wants to look at will be immediately rewarded: the article is sharp and accurate, the details are not paying attention and the tension is constantly maintained at the sky high, mostly adrenaline thanks to the real-time trickery that significantly increases the level. <br /> <br /> This pilot's other qualities are characterized by the fact that most genre shows (fiction and trilogy) simply identify key players later (manual, character development is minimal, but later CSI, serial debut, offering a full range of rounded-ups. (Sutherland's best roles - no!) And Palmer (the real show of the show) was perfectly illustrated only after one episode (an indivisible, but unassuming, old, honored and great integrity between the old job and the family). Several supportive parts are limited to stereotypes (especially Mason and Tony Almeida), but two factors must be considered: a) this is the first episode; b) will not make such a "defect" or two complaints to many viewers. <br /> <br /> Some networking programs manage the start of a conspiracy, a missing young man and a huge explosion - and is there still an equally welcoming material for the rest of the season? <br /> <br /> Tick, tock, tick, tock ...
