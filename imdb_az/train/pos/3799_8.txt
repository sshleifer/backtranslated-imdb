When you start watching this animation, you notice that it is a European production. The Europeans simply (simply) merge part of the clichés found in this type of American production, but most are missing. One of them is that we have a great evil that only our (very little and very difficult) losers can lose. Another thing is that one of the groups is just a matter of money, greedy, but when it is warm, it only gets better in nature. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a TV-Series four years ago. Unlike the film, the TV Series is an animated film, not a computer animation. First, I thought it would kill the computer's attraction and character, but it was exciting: anyone who animated knew his stuff! Although the characters are clearly explicit (no realistic in style), they look alive and as spectators as they look. Generating a deformable symbol (which will not allow the giant body to jump) on the "normal" standards is so much more enjoyable and "just one note"! Creation of the world is another work. Not just your appearance, it's a reason for inventiveness. Our heroes around the world are not as rigid as our travel, but are prepared from many lands that change in shape and dimensions that float in the middle. When a person touches a small part of the ground, it trembles like a weight. In some cases, the up and down can be applied now, but our heroes still stand together. Although the world of changing islands is totally unusual, this is completely convincing in this film and does not seem to be as strange as it flies to a car in New York in a short time. <br /> The world view is not as fascinate as thought. In my opinion, it is very easy to pay attention to world quality, symbols and details. Although the faces of the characters have relatively few features, emotions are readily read as Sean Connery or Dustin Hofman's face. The world around the cartoon is beautifully colorful and no two options are the same. The background is always on the move, and the world is always alive. <br /> <br /> If you look at the background and look at the background, you'll be surprised at how much you can find. <br /> <br /> Hector's existence actually puts the cherries on top. Hector is a totally cute and extremely funny little furry "thing" (possibly a dog in our world). It is not really important for the main area, though Skrat would be in the Ice Age. <br /> <br /> It's a really nice thing about the hacker to talk to Gibberish. <br /> <br /> If the movie is so big, why did not I give it 10 stars? Well, he himself was very subtle. Two hunters are sent out to get rid of a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world, and it's not really genuine. It would not be a problem too. The information I left was background information. What was this dragon, and why did it look like this? I love mythical stories, but if they are very subtle, they will be written after the film ends with a weak attempt to give it a depth. <br /> <br /> Another thing that did not like me was Zoé. Although a little girl like her was considered loved, it was a bit of a pain in the movie. All types seemed quite durable to learn the reality that kept a hero's dream from a storybook and slowed down basically the others. He had developed a little earlier and less in the film - or if there was a girly less to start, that would be good. <br /> <br /> For me, this girl's idea has come back to the writers a little. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a really good movie for all ages.
