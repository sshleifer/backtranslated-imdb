Meek is small, almost negligible. Polanski finds its invisible characters and brings out something bigger than it. Behind and behind the camera creates one of the most hateful masterpieces I've ever seen and I'm very happy to see and see. Never let me down. People, even people who know me very well, think / think / there is something in me, based on my attraction, or I want to say, loyalty to "Le Locataire" They can be right, I do not know, but there is a surprisingly surprising thing in Polanski's darkness and I'm not even talking about humor. The mystery surrounding the apartments and the previous tenant, the mystery that took him and, of course, us. The oldest Oscar winner is Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is a compelling image. One, two, three, many, many reviews.
