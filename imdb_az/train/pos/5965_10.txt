I gave it 10 out of 10. I love so much. I'm a child of the 80's and I've been in heavy metals for many years. These are the reasons I like this movie very much. It is my job by Megadeth in the boy's bedroom (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (dumping of glaciers, the rise of mutants by the shock metal master Impaler and Killing). Also the soundtrack by FASTWAY is incredibly incredible and very well suited for the plot. If you are a metal, TRICK or TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS, because they are in the movie for a few seconds, because the sound of the sound and the story of the 80's. You will not be the same person after that.
