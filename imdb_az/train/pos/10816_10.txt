No, this is not the high budget glow, but it's also brilliant. for what you are looking for, a masterpiece of a budget embraces a 12-inch love stick that continues to whip inside a zombie attacker. those who came to a lesser look at this movie, probably, were looking for the next cult classic or hidden "gem" and did not just go there quite often. I like how everyone looks at obvious observations, like hahaha, like everyone else's "5-point baby fish pole". I do not think that a budget with a budget might have "good" actors or effects that they have worked with. the intestines and the inside were really convincing. The film goes straight ahead, but in general, this is one of the better films I have seen lately, and this is in line with any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.
