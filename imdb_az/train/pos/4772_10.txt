This movie is perhaps the most effective and sensitive thing I've ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes this film, like most of the art, can give me a rare religious experience. <br /> <br /> When I first hear about this movie, I must admit it with doubt. I thought the device was played and I was afraid that the story would be a bane. But I decided to become a David Lynch admirer. I took about 30 minutes to complete the film, but then I completely lost it. This film has a lot of wisdom and warmth! <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch movie and, in some ways, it's a surprise that after creating this movie, it's a movie. The darkness of human nature has been for many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he has directed his deep emotions and deep human thought. Because I thought I was very good at Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented executives around and I think Straight Story is the best. 9.5 / 10
