For the first time in 1945, I was hitting the boots, while watching the video, there was a lot of nostalgia for me. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to be the first to go for MGM Technicolor music. Now, I'm probably interested in thinking about the future career of the leading players. Sinatra, though shortly after Dorsey's appearance as a solo singer, made some minor films, this was the first big movie appearance. According to another observer, this is almost the city's warming. Sinatra had to work hard, but dancing with Kelly would be good and would be better in her next combination. However, it is difficult to observe the body, why it is a cartoon like a stringed bean. Imagine that for ten years, an actor will win and play a great role as a challenging detective or leader in the battle. Despite the fact that Kelly's personality and dance dominated this film, his strange performance would be an iconic figure, a great creative force for MGM music tracks, which developed a dance style that reflects the use of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to look at the fresh-faced Dean Stokwelle and recalled that after the 1920s he would play the "excitement" on the compulsion, based on the murder of Leopold-Loeb. An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betat Garrettin Sinatra's love. Then he played against him in the city, but Pamela Britton sang in this movie.
