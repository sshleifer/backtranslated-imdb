This is one of Dev Anand's films, which has been featured in the Indian film industry as a Jewel thief and guide. The story is short (what you ask me) is simple - the brother works for his brother. Brother, the smoke in the hive, and Hare Rama joined the hippie sang the dance Krishna. But the film reflects part of the world's 70s. Hippie culture, the drugs, freedom, dismissal, family affiliation, and the adoption of something new to the East (new to the white). They are perfectly designed. Zeenat did his best and drew attention as usual. Songs are best used in this movie (abused to take their songs). They are not like each other. A perfect example is' Dekho o deewano ... 'Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Every word of the song is very philosophical and meaningful. Last but not least. Believing in creating different films, Devji has succeeded in showing what he wants to show here. You need to see the hippie culture and the fine Nepal experience of the 70s.
