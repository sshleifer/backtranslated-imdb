I also wanted to remember this movie and want to see it again, but I did not know the name of the movie. Fortunately, I was reading and commenting on the comments here to search and find the title on this site. Then I made a search and found the movie, and after 40 years I was very excited to watch the movie. Thanks to these sites and comments you have helped me and I thank you all for that. I also want to share what we find in this movie for those looking for a copy. In the VHS version of Disney's Wonderful World of Wonderful World, two films called "Call for Courage" and the second "Legend of Boy and Eagle". As it has been 40 years ago, it has already touched me, and now I have my own image. I think it's only available in the VHS. I found him on Ebay and I saw several copies there. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful story about a child's love and care eagle. When it came time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy was released because he did not allow his murder. After the boy was forced to jeopardize the tribe after the release of the eagle, the eagle saved the boy's life and saved more than that. The guy and the eagle shared in the desert are so moving and filmmaking really amazing. It was a wonderful time. I have not seen anything close to this movie!
