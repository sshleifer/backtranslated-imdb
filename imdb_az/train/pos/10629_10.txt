Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster and a roast pie. . . If you do not mind the psycho-thriller or horror film genre, and if you have a special place in your heart for being wrapped, this is a movie for you. One strangely well-developed first featured all major hits, such as Minat's Hate, Lamb's Silence, and Religious Classics. The editing and effects are better than many movies in the genre. Callio prepares a complicated tale of the pain both in the Bible and in Poe's works. The huge budget, big movies, and the most unpopular, have been resurrected by the independent film. If you love Michigan, check out a good story or a decent tension "Minute Hate".
