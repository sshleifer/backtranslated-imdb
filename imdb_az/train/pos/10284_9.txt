<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse, Margaret Ford, the best-selling psychiatrist, decides to face a gambler who runs one of his patients to think suicide. Short-lived writer Mike (perfectly played by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be safe and comfortable with a little bit of ordinary life and become "somewhat" sharp and exaggerated. He offers a contract to Crouse's character, if he wants to sit with him in a game, if he has a big money game on the back door, he will cancel his debts. The emergence of a card game and the soon becoming acquainted with a psychiatrist and gambler (getting the trust of others) and interesting relationships begin. What is important about the game's home and what makes a movie admirer a constant estimate of the detainees, a psychiatrist or a similar man, or a great bluff David Mamet's famous man. The Game in the Games House is boring and often flat and thirsty, but not every David Mamet movie, but in the center of all the procedures. In the House of the Games, this is brilliant thanks to the beautiful demonstrations (ambitious and entertaining), but mostly, like most of Mamet's, this is a dialogue that captures you and slowly takes you to the film. In the game house nobody means the battlefields and the war of words. Everyone's bluff and double bluffs reminiscent of a poker game naturally. This is an issue that runs throughout the film and has a great impact on the right moments to create tension in large quantities. The game House can also be viewed as a 'class-war' section movie. In contrast to Lindsay Crouse, middle-class, well educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna, America's working class gains a life of 'conscientious offense.' <br /> <br /> The film's final result, as Crouse, characterized by Mantegna, is ultimately a delightful part of American cinema. <br /> <br /> The last one is something for everyone to watch and watch, which is striking. <br /> <br /> An enjoyable movie experience that evaluates recurring views. 9/10
