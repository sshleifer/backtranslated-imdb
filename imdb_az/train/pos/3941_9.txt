Young Mr Lincoln, John Ford and Henry Foundation celebrated the first film of the director / star collaboration. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Fonda says, as a young player, Abraham plays with Lincoln and was afraid of scaring. <br /> <br /> Before flying, John Ford said that Big Emancipator would not be playing, but only a jack-leg prairie lawyer. The cast was directed by John Ford, a castle that he directed to a classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not a biographical film by Lincol. Raymond Massey, who came along with Walter Huston during the season, and a year after Mr Young Lincoln, won the Pulitzer Prize by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey is still the final Lincoln. However, as Ford said, Fonda did not play a big city lawyer in the city of Big Emancipator in Illinois. The film covers nearly 10 years of Lincol's early life. We remember him in a general store, and then we got some legal books from an immigrant pioneer family on the road. Ann Rutledge's romanticism is Lincoln's most cruel death. <br /> <br /> For 10 years, a fast advocate and a lawyer who started to warn Lincoln. <br /> <br /> <strong> Head of the Caucasian Muslims Office: He proposes to defend them. And it's not a criminal offense, a deputy from a sheriff. <br /> <br /> The Court itself is a work of art, but the role of two boys, Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quilla, has been defended by Lincoln, based on the real situation. I will not say more. <br /> <br /> Apart from the performance, Young Ford's celebrity John Ford's mood and atmosphere and the fourth July celebration of a small Illinois town. Please be aware that it is aware of it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In the background and Pauline Moore, during the romantic intervention during the background, the music is the same theme used by Valance for Vera Miles. In a dance, Lovely Susan Brown, a musician playing on Mary Todd, Fonda and Marjorie Weaver's music, was in the same style as My Darling Clementine in dance for a church in Tony, as well as Cathy Downs. <br /> <br /> For two reasons, Lincoln will probably be a favorite topic for biographies and dramatists. First, it is a live manifestation of our own mythology about those who are rising up to the peak of power from the bottom to their own efforts. In fact, Mr. Lincoln points out the sequence of Lincol's sequence. Secondly, he is the only President of the United States during the biggest crisis of the history and the only good and moral decision to free his slaves during the civil war is some of the political reasons. His conspiracy ensured his place in the history of history. <br /> <br /> After reading praise from the Foundation and others, Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, two cities, Kohler's murder victim and Chief Suspect Bond. The story of Cromwell and Quillan's advanced mother, as well as the prosecutor's office and Alice Brady, also includes Donald Meek. <br /> <br /> A very nice performance by Spencer Charters, specializing in rustic characters such as Judge. </ Div> <div style = "color: red;"> Lincoln.
