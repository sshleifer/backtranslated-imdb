Japan is in serious trouble. Demons are against the Edo, bent over the forms of the world and bowed to their holy will. Furthermore, the revival of the Devil's queen Ashura is near. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Isumo, After killing an innocent child accidentally, Demon Slaying instead of a theater (from a Dusk to Dawn in a battle that strangely resembles the scene). One night with a chance encounter, he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman called Tsubaki. <br /> <br /> If you sound like this typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay epic, you would be wrong. In fact there is nothing related to Ashura. The film is hodge-podge in many different genres. As we have just mentioned, comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) honors this genre (although the comedy seems to have been forced into some scenes), and the final result is a ridiculous, but really magnificent popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the defects in the film. Some humor appear on the spot and outside. And the player is not the biggest. But seriously, are you watching Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy movies for great actors? No, we are watching for the movements and attractive CG visuals, all of them Ashura's Spades. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; movies have errors and martial arts are not epic, but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Fun mystic movie.
