When I was offered the "Fobidden Planet" in 1956, I fled to see it as it was for others in this forum. This story is an interesting phenomenon I suggest because young people, elder men, women, scientists and people who find such a way can very well watch and use the story and plot lines of this movie. Leslie Nielsen was a bit weaker, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman, and Warren Stevens were very well-off, and there are many visual stereotypes that are hard to choose from. Altair-4, the starship itself, landed on the outer surface of the planet with extensor stairs, the first sight of the landscape, the approach of the rocket, escaping from the condemned planet without the house of Morbius, the underground complex and the miracles, the construction of weapons, the monster, the last unprecedented destruction. - all these scenes were brought to the audience because we know them together with the participants. Written script by veteran Cyril Hume has long been featured intelligently with clarity and imagination by director Fred McLeod Wilcox. is a shock to understand that there is no music; film, words, actors and story of mystery. Again, it can be enjoyed again and again - for about fifty years, I am doing it. Until the creation of this popular and popular movie, no film tried to imagine a world outside; and then decades later, the ships were abducted to the planet - as though the writers' imaginations failed and caused the crash. Still the best, many say. It's a negative thing about the minds of the nation's intellectual leaders - something very positive, I think they've created this boat.
