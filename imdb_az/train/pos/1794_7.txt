When Lajos asked Koltay's "Evening" night, when he asked for a figure visible in the excitement of a woman in her death: "Where was my life?" You can ask. <br /> <br /> Seksan Minot's romantic skirts are a film shot once and for all, a film shot. feelings and dedication, striking, striking speeches, and romance as some new films. With only six months of the year, there are two memorable, significant, valuable movies in theaters, and second, of course, Sara Polle is "far from him." Hollywood turned the two daughters into the evenings with a pair of mother and daughter - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. <br /> <br /> Redgrave's younger appearance Claire Danes is the daughter of Redgrave in the film (with a sister playing by Tony Collette) and plays the little essence of Gummer Streep. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson, and a great cast - may have turned into a multi-star platform. On the contrary, the vivid Hungarian ensemble of "Mephisto", the brightest Hungarian cinematographer and "Fateless" director, Koltai, has created a sublime ensemble with a "Continental Feel" story. <br /> <br /> Missing relationships, wrong choices, and social and family pressure are enough, but the quality of the writing, the direction of the Koltek and the selfless activity. <br /> <br /> Therefore, and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle, all clear, incomprehensible, attractive is encountered. <br /> <br /> With all of the above-mentioned emphasis on the warehouse and self-sacrificing, "The Evening" stars are still Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking at her as a mother, but a very different actress) Denmark - Streep seems to be in the last moments and, of course, stealing the show. Dancing and Wilson are worth the admission price. <br /> <br /> "Far away from it," as in "The Evening", it stays with you for a long time, offers a thought-provoking story and characters, experiencing these feelings. Two hours later, the film stretches a bit, but after that, the way you stay with is greeted by many films that are cold before your popcorn.
