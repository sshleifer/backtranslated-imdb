Released in 1956, and directed by Douglas Circus, The Middle 50's films are like pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> Film shooting, movies, movies, movies, movies, and more. four central symbols and credits, still being rolled up. The circus uses an intelligent flashback structure to drive us into the world ... <br /> <br /> Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are both Hadley's "children", such as Kyle and Marylee. She drinks and sleeps with women. She drinks and sleeps with men. Thanks to Hadley Oil, both of them deserve millions. Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) Kyle's wife and Marylee's dream lover. Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), a sophisticated and attractive young woman falling into the cord's charm, is in a mixed confusion. Mitch likes her, but Kyle is winning her. They quickly get married, and Kyle stops drinking. But the tales appear to be written in the wind, and this comes as a magnificent Marylee ("Mitch," marry or marries), mysteriously shaken Mitch, mixed Lucy and sad drunken Kyle. ... Malone deserves a beautiful, best supporting actress Oscar for Marylee Hadley. He steals every scene he is in. Stack is just as good and stronger as melodrama. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall are more restrictive than the two but agree with the characters in the game. <br /> So what exactly is this melodrama? Well, a lot of things. Stack is for men with insecure and frightening strong portraits. The circus covers the stack with phallic characters throughout the film - its smaller small arms, oil derricks and the latest phallic symbol, Kyle seems to be apparent to be able to kidnap children. Stack is a bigger man who is skeptical of his father's desire for Hudson, his sister's desire for Hudson and his wife, Hudson. <br /> <br /> With all this wealth, Kyle Hadley still ends up in the wrong end of the city, buying cheap biscuits as a "bum". <br /> <br /> This is about dreams that are impossible, and they have to leave them. Kyle, Marylee and Mitch, the river he used to play when he was a child, was constantly referring to Kyle and Marylee's (especially Marylee's) dream of innocence and the simplicity of youth. On a magnetistic melodrama scene, perfectly shot by Malone, Marylee stands beside the river and says Mitch is always a girl, telling her she will be a girl. The circus makes a great emotional acordia with the observer. Who does not want to return to a special place in childhood? Who has not lived in a precious memory at one point? Who does not want to do something that he can not own? And Hudson's last line (yes, he does not see any dialogue in the last 10 minutes, only close people), "we came deep into the river" and remembers Marylee. Amazing.
