When a small hobbit named Frodo Baqgins takes over a magic call from his uncle, the magician Gandalf is investigating and the ring is the creation of a cruel lord. If it is rich, it will restore its power and destroy the Middle East. Frodo and his loyal colleagues set out to look for the destruction of the ring with a group of fighters. This is the groundless adaptation of classical novels covering only the first half of the story. But this is an epic and beautiful animated movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is made in a beautiful way with the rotoscope that follows the live footage. Ralph Bakshi worked well with a low budget. The film also has a great music track by Leonard Rosenman, who is suitable for every scene. There are several scenarios with the scenario, but the original agreement was primarily focused on turning the trilogy of the book into two films. My biggest consciousness is some character design, Samwise was a little bit gop, and the other hobbits are completely normal. Other symbols are really written for the screen and sound actors are doing a great job, and I'm glad that Legolas is actually more useful than one another. <br /> <br /> The dancers are more funny than scared, while ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that, thanks to the writers, the evil sorcerer Saruman Aruman. In general, a little more money and better writers would do most of this justice, but there is something attractive about it. Ralph Bakshi showed a courageous effort to adapt the classic stories to the screen. The film is a big hit by animated movies, but it is still a great movie for animated fans of all ages.
