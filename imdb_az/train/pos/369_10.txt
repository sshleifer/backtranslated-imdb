One of the most favorite films of all time. I have seen it at least a hundred times and can not pass it without crying. I prevent everyone from watching Celie and Nettie, or Shug and Dad, and not feeling the confusion of your eyes. Whoopie Goldbergin should be an award for an incredible description. And it's wrong for someone who says that you will not love the movie even though you love it! This is a proof of that.
