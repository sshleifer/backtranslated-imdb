This was pretty good for a little movie about a promotional film and about a few people. It's these modern English crime movies ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.) but not as wild but "Snatch" and they have some rough symbols. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it also has a dark and somewhat anticipated end but is not early in the show - not too late - for the first time it is very interesting to the audience. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Generally, this is a low-locked English man sending about a Russian "mail order bride" sender, two Russian <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Looks like: This is a different kind of movie and it works well. Kidman proves more than just a beautiful face.
