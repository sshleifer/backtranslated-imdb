John Waters gave us a really nice movie. This, of course, is not without Waters-esque moments that shocked her, but more frustrating than outdated materials like "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" recalls the same kind of humor viewer as he returns to John's early master stage, as seen in the "Polyester". Generally a really fun comedy with some great moments!
