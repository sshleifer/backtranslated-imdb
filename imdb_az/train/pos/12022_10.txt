<br /> <br /> Because I was a big fan of the original movie eight years ago, I took this movie as an accident, but I watched this movie and found it to be a really happy surprise. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an original retread, you want a great disappointment, but if you are looking for something completely different, it's a bit strange and political, then this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now a 37-year-old and works as a teacher in his old school, where a teacher is being followed by a teacher and his sexual dreams come about on one of his students. If a student insists on meeting with Gregory, there are some unusual things that include torture, frustration and inclusion, and unexpected curves and species that leave me and move. <br /> <br /> For a genuine thing, I strongly recommend this movie. I just wish that more people were going to see it when it was released, and what really happened.
