The Red Eye is a good little tension to watch on a Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Some films are 85,000 films and 88% are on board and simply speak because they do not want to see this movie. The PG-13 movie appears to be a new foundation for director Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> These films are the strongest point of his filming. This film requires good actors who have dialogue and excitement. When these actors were absent, they lost the movie and were bored. We got Rachel McAdams from Megan Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman begins and after 28 days. <br /> <br /> The pacing in this movie was very good. When you think that your thoughts have been won, they are bent on you. Fortunately this is not a long movie and it's not like this. <br /> <br /> My Flight Plan Commentary: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
