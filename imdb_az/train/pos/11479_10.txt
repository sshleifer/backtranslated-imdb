This movie was great, a bit scary, but it's great. For those who have heard Columbus and who know the story, these guys give an idea of ​​what they do and why they are doing. Behind your mind you know that people are thinking of these things, but you do not realize how bad they are, and this movie realizes you. Seriously good. And I am sure that you think twice before having fun. I read a book about the Columbian massacre, and I think that this film is bothering me and frightening me. How to kill someone instructions for serial killings in the attack. I recently got a threat and left it without thinking, but after this movie I have to take everything seriously. Some people are naked and did not know what they really are, so take it seriously and evaluate someone.
