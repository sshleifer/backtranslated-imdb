Really one of my favorite films. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger, Edward '' Ned '', is terrifying as Kelly. This story is good, it works very well, all technical (especially cinematography) is sharp, and the script is smart. He writes as a legendary fugitive and is backed by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts, and Orlando Bloom. All the movement schemes are at the point <br /> <br /> The film consists of things to sit on until the last. <br /> <br /> One of the most popular films from Heath Ledger, the late legend, which is the aim of every movie in the film, at all stages of the movie.
