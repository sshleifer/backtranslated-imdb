Paperhouse is the most moving and surprising movie I've ever seen. It is often classified as a "movie movie", and I believe it's a big mistake. Some magazines once called the "thinker" the Nightmare on Science Street, and I will not be able to help with the logic of his outcome, but I think it is a just and misleading label. Those who are horrified are really missing here and serve to show that they are not really thinking. <br /> <br /> In fact, trying to describe this beautiful thing is probably a bad idea. Unfortunately, Paperhouse is exquisite in every detail and will always have a special place in my heart. Since someone is more intelligent than I am, "the movie is hitting you at the emotionally high level" may be a way to explain how quickly my comments are flaring up. I do not apologize for it to be honest, so if you feel that my words are a lot worse than your taste, stop reading now, because there is more. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find a movie to overcome the pain and heart failure of childhood and to overcome the terrible feelings of insulation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us in this delicate time of our lives. In fact, it is even more unusual to find child actors who can play their role as intelligence and intelligence to play their entire role. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke və Elliott Spiers-də ilhamlanmış bir parça döküm və Paperhouse'ın uzun müddətli təsirləri uşaqlıq dövrünü (tez-tez görməmiş) mürəkkəb və yalanaşma qabiliyyətsiz və inandırıcı bir şəkildə təsvir etmək qabiliyyətinə malikdir. <br /> <br /> All this is accompanied by unusual talented director (Bernard Rose), along with imaginative cinematography and artistic cinematography <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;
