A story about four teenage girls in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the top-class head of the gang - but she wants to go home with her mother, Sally Kellerman. Annie (Cherie Currie) depends on drugs, alcohol and bad guys and is beaten by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has many defective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks he is more mature than the rest of them. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new than what we have seen many times - it's a big difference - it's right. In 1980, I finished high school (when I first saw the film) and I was surprised to see how real it was. Dialogue, dress, and behavior have completely dropped. Even the main song of the movie (by Donna Summer "On Radio") was a great hit. This movie became more difficult for me than any other teenage movie because I could understand and be related to the characters. I knew only girls in school! The film is, of course, historic, but it still takes some time to never see it. <br /> <br /> Foster's best performers are all good. His relationship with Gerlerman (good) was realistic and good. <br /> <br /> Even Scott Baio (played a small role as a friend of the girls) played a bit more realistic. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - the film has a decent R rating (a lot of drug use and blasphemy), but it will be done by all teenagers. I'll give it 8.
