I gave this movie for a A + campaign! Dietrich's daughter, Maria Riva, wrote in her book on her mother, "If she sees God's Paradise in the context of camp, she can be very entertaining." And how! I laughed with a sense of joy, with an insane, ridiculous, fantastic melodrama dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Instead, they are dreaming at a distance, probably with their best and you can take pictures in the most advantageous light (if you play in a turkey, it may look good). Dietrichin suits are out of this world. <br /> <br /> According to Riva's book, Dietrich managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and designed him the most divine clothing, such as chiffon beige dresses and pope. <br /> <br /> Rave about Technicolor. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that the film was made in 1936. Color is fantastic. <br /> In short, if you can easily watch and enjoy God's Paradise, help, but enjoy.
