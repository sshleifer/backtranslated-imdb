<br /> <br /> I saw this movie in 1959 with my family at a family theater when I was 11 years old. <br /> <br /> I thought it was funny since then. . . even if I'm too young to understand this wonderful movie 90% of such a delight! I saw it again at Turner South this morning. As I look, it's completely scary with laughter! "The Matching Game" is a unique classic from past ages. If you are too young to survive the magical epoch of history, I'm very sorry for you. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to watch such films and see how the "old timers" like me can provide a pleasant slice of paradise. <br /> <br /> I said that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here's what these films talk about a different language than any one of you. <br /> <br /> In other words, if you do not understand what the film has to say, do not embarrass yourself by suggesting the comments you have requested. clearly ?? it does not matter.
