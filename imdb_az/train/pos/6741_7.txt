The title of the headline shows that the loans written on a rainy pavement are the people who throw it on it; The music is given by someone whom Alfred Newman's "Street Scene" accuses. Then we meet with Det. Sgt. Mark Dickson (Dana Andrews) was not always an old man: a man on the right side. But it's pretty bad for a good guy. After several complaints over his fragile people, his director, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) breaks it down. Foley says he is a good person, but he needs to get his head straight and become a Detective. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, a beautiful bony performance) has an illegal dice game and is a rich Ted brought by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gen Tierney) Morrison (Harry von Zell). She is cursed too late, uses her husband as a rotten thing, and Paine hits her if she refuses to play with her. Famous Morrison interferes, but Paine throws her in a cold state. This may seem worse, but later the boy is dead; <br /> <br /> But Paini's story will not be. She soon fell in love with Dixon Morgan, but not before the terrible thing she did not lose and imagine. Morgan's father, a fairy-tale taxi driver (Tom Tully) can take rap for that. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger directs a three-man script from the "Night Cry" by Ben Hecht and William L. Stuart. This is a great movie with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography we are expecting from this genre. He stays in the studio until the bright burning ends like something shot to shake censorship. Of course, the classic nouveau "Laura", run by the Preminger and played by Andrews and Tierney. You will enjoy it, but do not miss it.
