"Citizen X" explains the story of the "Rostov Butcher", the nickname of the murderer of a serious and tough Russian serie, which claims 52 lifetimes in 1978-92. The film focuses on a novice detective (Rea), who has been convicted in the face of bureaucracy, who is self-motivating and unconcerned. T.v. a HBO product, a film, a solid cast, a good performance, a great deal of strange details for the audience, but only as a docudrama in the style of a Dutch ride. A more dramatic single and straight forward dramatization of a serious and relatively inexplicable story "Jack the Ripper". (B)
