Was this based on a comic book? Video game? A 3-year-old painting? <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie will be taken seriously; The characters are not the dialogue, but the area, not the movement. There is nothing. She loves children at school, Stallone is a stable, high-level dialogue, a dialogue that is sometimes cheerful, and so on. We have such high-tech international terrorists / criminals. Even the badge of the bad guys is dumb ("tango-tango"). It is a film that lends itself to some lag, well-behaved sequences and a beautiful snowy mountainous setting. <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; Then the sweat fails - the rescue part comes, and then we have a worse dialogue and then a bigger move, which is the rhythm of the movie. <br /> <br /> The melodramatic exchange with Turner, which Stallon faces after a long time, is so effective that the klichel, it is so fake and bad that it giggles from any self-respecting audience, and often after this horrific dialogue, we witness the spectacular and perfectly trained escape of an airplane, the whole thing is a great absurd, but that's the best thing. Although the rest of the tour is exciting and entertaining, airplane scenes are really the scene of the movie. After the flight, master criminals are looking for a way and Stallone and Rooker reach the end. Stallonu sent first to earn money, but in a way it difficult for him to do everything possible to achieve; they will take most of their clothes (for freezing) and will not give them the necessary equipment (so it can fall). IS THERE USE OF YOUNG PEOPLE OR MONUMENTS? It's stupid. It seems they do not rely on Stallonea, but they do know that they can always send Rooker using a blackmail as a hostage. Nevertheless, our robbers make Stallo's climb difficult, and for no reason, at least no matter how bad our situation is, there is no doubt. Perhaps, for those who doubt the wickedness of bad guys, I was really upset, fortified and exaggerated. Everyone convinced? Well, good. You will be better. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the writers will go public to the twenty-school children, and they will only clarify the evil of bad guys. <br /> <br /> An old man flying in the chopper ... How did hell fall into the trap? First, he had to be warned about MTV's criminals, and secondly, he should have heard his voice in Stallone and Rooker's noisy conversations. Lithgow's most unfortunate line-ups are all the verbal exchanges that have been honored. "Leave behind me!" Lithgow: "I did not even start upstairs." Or, from Lithgow to Stallone: ​​"We came to an agreement, but now we have one another!" As for Lithgow's murderers, these guys do not want to kill them immediately. These are very creative; they do philosophy, play football with your body, and look like that. <br /> <br /> Stallone wrote this thing. When I did that, I did not know what the drugs were. I hate to think that this is bad due to the low scenario.
