Mahatma Gandhi, in his search for India's struggle for freedom, the nation's father, ignoring his own family and his son, is about the son of Hulalal, who neglected the genius Gandhi for serving the community. The film has begun in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi acts as a barrister and struggles with the Hindu freedom of expression in India. Hirarala has come to help her father, who is a barrister to South Africa, because Gandhi has joined the struggle for freedom, and has asked her husband and children to participate as a community service, and ultimately did not give a challenging chance. he completes his education and does not miss his exams, and marries his love for his father's desires (bhoomika Chawla). Hiralal has the ambition to travel to England and become a barrister of his father, but his father refuses the scholarship offered to a family's family and gives it to another person who says that the scholarship should not be limited to him should be open to the most deserving students in the family and the colony. As the hives grow hiralal and the burden between the father and the boy, he hates his father's neglected attitude and accuses him of being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to assemble and assemble in the streets thanks to unsuccessful business ventures and huge debt, losing his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna exhibits a perfect performance like Hiralal Gandhi .. For every kudos, direction and script fantastic for her, the picturization is excellent. generally a beautiful movie and a sci-fi. I give it 10/10
