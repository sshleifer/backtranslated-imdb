The purpose of the story is simple: the only living person in the trees is accidentally killing a small child and trying to confirm that the murder was happening. Although little information was provided throughout the film, the visual narrative, which was described by the camera, attracted quite a lot. Gray woods give a sense of loneliness that completes the tranquility of the characters. <br /> <br /> The fact that the elderly man does not agree with the killing, who says he will not warn him about the killing, may also be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> True fear is a feeling of hopelessness, weakness and irrationality. <br /> <br /> This movie is replicated with visuals that these elements are successfully unsuccessful in low-noise effects or blood, and that other bad movies are used when the statement is weak. <br /> <br /> With intelligence, the story is slowly opening up tensions for a few scary and surprising moments. The latter is also unpredictable and convincing. English scary movies, such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water" or "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents", reminiscent of Japanese movies, provide the audience with the true atmosphere of fear. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone who is in good surprise to the fear of bone to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the films mentioned above, it is an attempt.
