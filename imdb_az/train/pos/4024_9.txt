I love this movie. He did not predict what would happen. One of the better films about the section I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is also very nice. This is one of the most personal and low-cost movies I've ever seen in this section. This is a bit less basic than Gadar, and it's actually an emotional roller coaster that starts with an idea of ​​what's going on and about. This is not typical bollywood prices, but rather an art house type. The best part of this film is that while focusing on another's story, one side of the division conflict is not dehumanized. It does not blame or intimidate, but rather, it allows you to bring everything to your own conclusions.
