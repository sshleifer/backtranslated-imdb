A powerful pilot finds an excellent job of creating a symbol and background for the original Star Trek series for this two-hour episode "Enterprise", "prequel". Several times, like the "Trek" convention, clich√© - colored space strippers do not seem to go out of style, and I can now see T'pol with snickering references like "Vulcan Seven" - but the ensemble looks strong, heroes are well designed and Unlike the (next) series, we can see that this group is more capable. Scott Bakula, like Kirk's strange and energetic, but his captain as a stranger and stranger, and like the players who support the array's engineer, weapon master and communications officer (not just a loyal phone operator)! The writers were selected on a big mistake called Star Trek: New Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager: instead of starting with a large ensemble and giving short characters to the characters, more and more characters might be added later. a small core - hopefully about half an hour later, episodes will need more diversity.
