Only this movie is a great comedian, but also politically interesting. He came to the end of the Soviet Union, but enjoyed the Soviet mentality. The story was set in the early days of the Soviet Union, and this is behind the revolution both questioning both cultural and practical. Of course, at the end of the 80's and early 90's, the strange strikes of the Soviet society were comfortable, but ideology and mentality are still alive and well-prepared and ready for decent decentralization. Fortunately, all this deep philosophical commentary is packed in a comic and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
