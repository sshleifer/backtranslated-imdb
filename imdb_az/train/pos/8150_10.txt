My Muscle Lemmings is, of course, a fair woman. This film is a missing satirical reminder of the 90s on the Hip-Hop scene, when MC Hammer begins to fall into a good night. We will follow NWH's three members that they will gain wealth and glory. And like Nickolas Nickleby, at the end, they finish their departure from where they started, but at least some of them are clever and very naive. One of the best movies ever heard by anyone is the type of movie that you love or hate in this regard. I would rate this movie as one of the 1000 New York's best-known mysteries.
