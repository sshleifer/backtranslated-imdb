I attended the Tribeca Film Festival "People" world premiere at NYC yesterday. I had a great time. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red; "> starts at the college with the Maya (Rosario Dawson). You mean natural college environment with wild parties and ongoing flirtations. The photography in this movie was excellent. He meets with Jared (Chad Faust) and they become lovers. It looks like any other contact at startup. The man is looking for the woman's attention and love, and the woman plays much to go. Both played well. A very innocent merger between the two. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very greedy and dark. It ends up in the basement, which is extremely dark and burnt with many candles. This really reminded me of a dungeon. Here, he shows the true colors and aggression. It is a very dark and charming aggression. This scene is young and weak in the heart. <br /> <br /> Maya is starting to put her soul into drugs and sex. He falls into the abyss. She awakens to the party's oldest party and does not remember how to stay in the room one morning. He went to see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is the one who saves anyone in need of savings. He is a person who applies Mayan to drugs. The film begins with a dependency affair that will play later. At this point of the film the scenes of the club were shot with extreme expertise. <br /> <br /> Maya returned to college as a TK and she's in the same person. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; its class - Jared is an aggressor! You can see the misery and emotions of the Maya! What should I do? What should I do? <Br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is interested in Jared, he wants to revitalize and become a lover again, and I was sitting there that could actually happen. It was not. <br /> <br /> He invites me to my home and, of course, shows that his apartment is dark and strange, and he's going to be "lucky." He thinks it's a " Everyone loves it and is excited about it Everyone who wants to see this movie is full of frontal nudity - it may not be right for a young audience. <br /> <br /> Then it turns into a state of mind turns and continues to rape Him, once again, the scene is dark, flawless and very cob ud happens. <br /> <br /> If I will see the movie and skip what to do next, skip this paragraph and go to the last one. Paragraph. <br /> <br /> This is where Adriana's picture is donated. Maya rescues Adrian by performing extremely rude men with Jared. He thinks this is the last revenge. Adrian continues to take on Jared's personality and ignores his dignity. Marcus, like Adrian, believes that this scene is as convincing as everyone else. He is a strong player who plays a powerful player and the power goes out on the whole screen. At the Q & A session after the movie, Marcus explained that this scene requires a great deal of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save him, but I do not think so. One of the last scenes comes to Mays' face and you see his cheek down. It was an incredible proximity scene, and this is a constant controversy for anyone going to see the movie. Did he want to take revenge? Was she satisfied as she was expected? I do not think it does. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, I will advise anyone who will play a good role and think of it. I would hesitate a little over the age of 17. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be praised for doing good. Director and photography should also be emphasized. It was a night.
