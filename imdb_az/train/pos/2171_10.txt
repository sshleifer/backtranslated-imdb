The real classic, her from her! Every actor is perfect, scenario suspenseous scenes in a haunting sequence. The scenes from cars and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. If this movie is already on the DVD, it's curious to see it in the Widescreen version. I have seen this movie in recent years, perhaps three or four times, and I will never forget it. I remember that it was one of the first Warner to take on features like cinema, a process called Warnerscope that gave a very clean cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance have won the Oscars for their performances. One thing I can criticize is that Nieto Ray is not directed to one's leadership to increase the rhythm and tension.
