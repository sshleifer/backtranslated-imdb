This is the true 80's: After them, perhaps, they have shot 100 times more film than today, and that's a lot of them ... It's a cultural phenomenon that's no longer existed. The same kind of people who create cheap "corrective" videos in the eighties are making cheap porno today. It seems like pervert. In any case, this is above the average garbage film level: there is a good story, and I think this is very good. On a scene you can even see the microphone sliding in the upper part of the picture. Of course, there are little income generated by Ã–zzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not give "success" to the film, though they are good in their small roles. The monster, the heavy singer "Sammi Curr", especially when he plays, looks really terrible. One of the horror monsters I have seen in horror. The next night I may have nightmares with him. Intellectual film is not recommended for lovers.
