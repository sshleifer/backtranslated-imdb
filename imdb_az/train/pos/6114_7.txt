In 2001, "My Sassy Girl" is a really cute movie with many similarities, but it can often be a miracle. The greatest apple should pass to two potentials. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and interesting, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. <br /> <br /> Kyeong-hyeong Kim, director Kyeong-hyeong Kim, presents scenes of effective fighting that Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked it so much more than the overrated "Volcano High". And that boy has a future - it's images, combat techniques and a romantic lead. Not good. <br /> <br /> Good, I did it short: Beautiful movie. My Rating: 7/10
