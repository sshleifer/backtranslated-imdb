<br /> <br /> <strong> We did not love the love of the Caucasian hero as we created a brain? <br /> <br /> Something happened to people, lost their ability to enjoy, story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and realistic. I laughed at least five times, and I'm not ashamed to say that I was tearing several times in my eyes. The cast, the player and the script are very good, I'm watching a lot of movies and I have not seen one of the most successful genres. Let me know that I find a place for those who do not agree with me! I am sure that the book is very good, but I think it should be evaluated with its substance.
