At first I saw this movie, it was VHS-Video for a long time. I liked this movie because it was funny and interesting. A few years ago I saw another movie: * Andy Colby's incredible adventure * In this film, parts of the wizards * of the lost kingdom were used. They called this movie "Fighting Corps". I started looking for "KOR" -Movie, because I did not want to see a full movie because there were only parts that were used in Andy Colby * -Movie. At no store, this Kor Movie was rented and no store recognized this movie. I've been watching old VHS tapes that I've been living for a long time at home, and what a miracle ... I've been living in this house many times, but there's a different address in the movie because there are 3 or 4 titles in Germany. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had more time to watch KOR Fatiha. The music is great throughout the hole, but the best part of the shooting with music is the moment when the KOR is going drunk through the green forrest. Background music was a magical kind. I love Bo Swenson, a guy playing Simon in the movie. Both made their work very good. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thank you all for reading my comments.
