68 million people between 2000 and 2020 will die early as a result of AIDS. Expected costs are high in Sub-Saxara Africa, where additional deaths are estimated at 55 million. Because of the severe exceptions, it is rarely personal stories we hear. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving "Leo close", a film prepared for French television, as part of a series of challenges facing young people. <br /> <br /> Twenty-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) says, unfortunately, they are dealing with a very widespread situation - the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a close family. parents and two teenage siblings, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann), whose family is damaged. Because of their concern for their youth, 12-year-old Marcelin (Yannis Lespert) just makes the decision to retain his younger brother's information, but he starts to make mistakes. As Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he and Marcel come along with him, but the young man faces Leo and wants to know the truth. Leo says he is ill and Marcel is sad but only accepted. Although Marcel has come to meet with some gay friends, the tension between them makes the scene flammable to the surface. <br /> <br /> Despite worries about the scene of the physical contact with the brothers, I feel more sensitive to the sincerity of Leo and the scrupulous performance of Lespert and Mignard in his favor. The film, which sees the events of the young boy's perspective, gives the impression that the Quebecce movie reminds Leolo and Truffaut of The 400 Blows. Unlike some American films that benefit from AIDS's suffering, getting closer to Leo is a tough truth, but it is tender and beautiful.
