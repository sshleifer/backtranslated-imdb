I love Seriya! Most of the stereotypes that Southerrners describe as hicks are very clear, but such people are very often present. The images of the southern government are also true, but sympathetic characters are one of the very good things about South. Some things never change and we see "good old boys" every day! In every southern city there is Lucas Buck, there is just one phone call to do, and the storybook is very familiar to "po white trash". Apart from supernatural elements, everything else can be very good in the modern South! I think of some kind, Trinity, SC has been in Barnwell County!
