Behind this movie there is a certain genius. I was laughing. The scene at the sex office of the phone was a great attempt at genius / humor, discussing how doppelgia improved. Execution is weak, but you see the writer's letter and have some talents. Finally, doppelganger was like a split ... "Okay, I did not expect too much, but let's see what the movie is about." Surely, it is a ridiculous but sweet idea, and the truth and story are strangely adapted. <br /> <br /> Is the purpose of a movie a logical or entertaining or emotional level communication? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there may be some auto biography roots, but this is just an estimate. Too bad, but good. I'm looking for this person (with more experience) to watch other films.
