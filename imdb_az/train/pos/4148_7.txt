Let's just plain: this movie does not want to reset the genre, it's Strangelove not Young Frankenstein. Three great women's potentials (I remember other comedies similar to similarities), Rachel Dracht and SNL, and now Amy Poehler from Queen Parker Poseid, is an awesome terrifying whip. The story is essentially a "loser" in three gallus colleges, and it still holds them. Poehler is a dog trainer (even one can not get a date with a blind boy), Posey is a helper for a senator ("A man has not been touched since Clinton's office" ... I've catched it a few minutes ... a little slow, ok !) and Dracht has a gay fianc√©e (Seth Meyers of SNL, comic). They have to prevent the summer actor's "uncool" daughter (always from the sweet Amber Tamblyn's "Joan of Arcadia" series). Of course, they have to go for it, some of them live well. All of this, light, simple comedy, is pretty short and pretty good
