<br /> <br /> <strong> Zero Day is a movie with a few people's vision, and that's a shame. <br /> <br /> When I saw that the last two gigantic characters fell into the room and brutally murdered people, I committed suicide and grabbed me. <br /> <br /> How powerful is this film? It's very unbelievable not to get to the perfect ten. Very few people understand the true beauty of this film. <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ em> </ strong> <strong> <br /> <br /> I also like this movie I have not attended. <br /> <br /> I met with me enough to watch this. I feel I'm 14 years old, and it's nice to put it in words. It feels like you're watching something actually happening.
