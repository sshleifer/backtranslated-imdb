For the first time, I was watching for the fourth time in Showtime, California, for the first time in July 2001. I think that with the wave of "Serial Killer", California has recently been worthy of the previous films, but not. Perhaps, if this movie was released sometime between 1996 and 1999, perhaps it would be more successful. In my opinion, "California" differs from most of the series released in the late 1990s. Most of today's serial killer films like "Seven" or "Bone Collector" have almost totally different atmosphere. Many killer killer films have shown a killer, but this person is always behind a mask or actually did not see enough to learn about them. "California" is actually a film to overcome this obstacle and really understand the crime genius. "Why do they do what they do?" Is trying to answer their questions, something that happened in the past? Do they feel superior or strong? Or do they love the excitement of killing? "These are some things California is trying to answer, and it also places space for us to try and understand something. Brad Pitt creates an endless impression like Early Grace. When we first meet at the beginning of the film for the first time, we see that he is clearly anxious. It is late at night when you see it for the first time. Maybe early drunk. Then we collect a rock, throw a bridge, and then we see its place in the front windows of a passing car. Pitt is strange in this movie. It's always good to see him play psychic or really bad guys. Then, like the 12 Monkeys, it is funny that David Fincher would play a real loon as in the other part of the Seven Spectrum.
