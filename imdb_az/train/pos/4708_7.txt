Yes, Keaton seems to be really happy about this movie. If you skip her step by her special pin-striped suits, she'll remind Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is just a young head who wants to pay for her mother's high-value medical costs and send her younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to a law school. Nobody will even know Johnny Kellyi. Johnny is in a dangerous way until the movie. Joe Piscopo does not like Vermin and Johnny's a bit (and I do not like Vermin). Marilyn Henner sings a beautiful song, while dance is met with sympathy. I feel they are a constantly changing escape machine! Skipper, who is on the island of Gilligan, is the police who "call all the cars"! Look at the 1930 gangster laughs! In this movie, the gags are cheerful, but you have to capture them or miss them! See the background of each scene.
