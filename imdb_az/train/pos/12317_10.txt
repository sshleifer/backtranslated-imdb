If it's a negative thing about a Chinese Ghost Story, a comedy can be a masterpiece, a horrific masterpiece, a romantic masterpiece, that special effects can be compared to contemporary technology. The film has a simple foundation: a poor debt collector should stay in a lonely area while trying to borrow. <br /> <br /> I did not expect this movie to be one of the most influential love stories ever seen; that without losing any of the slapstick comedy you have on the seams. Unlike some Asian cinema films, a Chinese Ghost Story is not difficult to absorb in the Chinese culture. Indeed, it is played on paranormal and romantic, timeless, non-cultural subjects. <br /> <br /> Think of Evil Dead 2 if they have thrown a wonderful love story to the mixture. This movie is true, though many are ignored. This is one of the best I've ever seen. It's not a fantastic thing to combine the best aspects of many genres and to combine cultural boundaries to appeal to humanity everywhere. Highly recommended, 10/10.
