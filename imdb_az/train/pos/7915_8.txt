It is "odysessy over time" with computer animation, which is the work of more than 300 artists. Made in the late 80s and released in 1990, this is the best of the day. <br /> <br /> Many of the smaller scenes were also fun to watch along with being turned into other sources. It's all about the story, not about a story. There were a number of strange-looking sequences that would dance when the birds of the strange men heard it. All this is a computer animated film. Even the term "computer animation" was not recognized. <br /> <br /> This is just a chance to show this new technology in short bits of events like beautiful colors and cartoons with creative scenes. No words, just pictures with electronic music. <br /> <br /> This is nice, interesting as 40-minute "eye candy" and "candy candy". With the effect of today's CG it may have lost its effect, but you still want to entertain it.
