I must be honest. I watched and loved this show because it was general, offensive, cheerful and terrible. Yes, there are many humor for all the tastes. <br /> <br /> If you're into the humor type that's involved in fun of skateboards, it's going to be a great deal of time. <br /> Or if you are doing extreme stunt actions, you will have a great time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am delighted by the three types of humor offered by Dirty Sacchez. I want to make a laugh with the show situations. "Jackass" is like a park in comparison to this park. So if you're tired of Jackass's typical American discomfort, try to make the show frank in English. With all respect. <br /> <br /> This is a demonstration with less taste or class. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys have to see a psychologist. Special Paco character.
