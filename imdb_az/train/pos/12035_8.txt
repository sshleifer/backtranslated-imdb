I first went to this movie five minutes at TNT, while vacationing in Florida ... (Hey there was some time in the hotel, right?) I was surprised to see Melissa Joan Harty at any length TNT movie. <br /> <br /> Because of this, I say, "I'm astonished", it's not old, but <br /> <br /> But I'm crammed with it and I was thoroughly surprised and enjoyed. Melissa plays a perfect role as psychic Jennifer. Support (Nick, former spouse, Karen, best friends and parents who control life) all added a great deal of credibility. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < >
