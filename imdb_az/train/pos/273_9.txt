It is difficult for me to criticize everything Mitzi Kapture has done. He is just a phenomenal actress who spreads beauty and grace on the screen. Nevertheless, the plot was predictable. I think that if Jill was sleeping with HAD Richard, he could have made it a bit smaller for a while. It would be great to have a little problem with Jill and his wife, Richard's ex-wife, and maybe a bit more back story. I'm a little disappointed with the end of the movie. I saw Zack's death and probably more to close her husband. I do not want to say that I will never be able to look at a weapon and never take a picture of it. It was a very appropriate end to Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I will wait for his future projects.
