I must admit that this film was tearful to me. </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: It starts and continues as a slow-moving movie that does not try to face the actual scenes. Undoubtedly, this movie, unlike the WORLD WORLD TRADE CENTER, is not the attack itself, but it is difficult and erratic in an eruption like a nuclear explosion, but it is dangerous and destructive. The psychological effect, the biggest rebellion of 9/11, and the anger that the American people made is almost felt in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Binder, , these Americans always want to take their emotions. " Now I do not want to reduce their losses, but I would like to compare them. From September 11th, the whole world is faced with the mementos, memories and memories of 9/11. The Hollywood industry and writers, as well as Safran Foer, are examples for the 9/11. Nowadays, 11/11, this huge cultural product turns 3000 people into the greatest tragedy of this young age. <br /> <br /> The number of books on the subject and the number of films directed on this issue and all that I say with respect is a little bit more intense of the significance of this violent crime. Fact: People are dying each day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply missing people. There is a war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and many other countries. On a daily basis, we forget the poverty that the African people suffer, and we're less able to deal with them regardless of the fact that they are darker than the American victims at 9/11 and most of their lives. The West is our partner. No money in Africa, nor America has the potential to remember its national tragedies. Almost what I said is that the reason why 3000 people and their families feel more often at 9/11 is that we are always reminded at 9/11. One day the newspaper article, one movie or one day without a book discussing 11/11. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm a team with Charlie Fineman, but I have a feeling for a Hutu that has lost his family in Ruanda Civil War. <br /> <br /> Do you keep my opinion?
