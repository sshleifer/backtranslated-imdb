This was humility that we did not know! Hinted and summarized in the comic strip for syndicates to sell newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were fans of "Tawawat Blaise", the release of Dream Job - tell the fans the story of humility they had not seen before. In their audio commentary, they acknowledged that they were trying to make the story smoother as they changed. The "Parrots" should also mention that what Miklos said is true, we really do not know because he "stood up for time." I did not give it to the DVD or I got it as another "look", I bought it! And I do not want it back! I was watching three times and I did not sleep with him! As well as in dance and comic strips, I have a good dialogue and good-looking characters that I care for (even a bad boy Miklos)! And I will not wait for the next "Modesty" (and Willie), especially this is the future of "prequel"!
