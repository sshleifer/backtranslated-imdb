The film opens a story about how to set up the best friend - Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are packed with a small New York apartment, with little secret space and a very small bathroom. Jimin's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), likes to advertise for some of the ad (or falls!) If she wants to renew her apartment. <br /> <br /> <strong> This is one of the three collaborations between Grant and Loy, as everything that's going wrong with Jim's 'sleeping house' is wrong, and when you buy a home, invoice and disappointment suddenly accumulate . The charming little comedy - is not perfect, it's a great way to spend one or two hours, not a real big message. The laughter starts from the start, when the alarm clock goes out and Jim just tries to close it by Muriel for every turn. Comedy lines and situations can be delivered only by a few experienced adventurers, and Grant and Loy just give us what we can do: bright spots, simple chemistry, and lots of fun. Myrna Loy is a very authoritative role (Grant is known to have received Jim's lines and moving lion's share, and Grant is always producing with a remarkable aplomb), but Muriela gives a character, a life and a bite, just like Myrna Loy. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes should be absolute when Bill is locked in the "store room", and after the departure of Jim, "Melvyn Douglas" invites you to the excellence. only to "get rid of inside" to save it! Every small problem for the Blandings update project - an ad campaign for jealousy and "Wham" - brings together everything that might be wrong with building a new home, but an incredible and enjoyable hour. 8/10
