technically, this is not the biggest television show I know, but I'm telling you that I was shot in the video and that her restrictions were both audio and visual. When I was first released in 1988, I was afraid of paradise. Of course, I would be 5 years old. Recently, I bought the DVD with the first 3 episodes. Warner also announced that he was not planning to release again due to the bad sale of the first DVD. I thought the TV show did not feel the same as the movies, but in fact it was even worse. the color palette is similar to the nightmares on Science Street 4 (the same film and television show in the same period of the same year), which is more voiced and jockey. clown intelligent cracker.but like freddy I think this television show is strong, freddy is not popping up every thousand up and then breaks a joke before and after killing someone, in fact it brings more benefit to a fortified fact with a delicate flavor. Undoubtedly, in the filmmaking section of the creator or on the restrictions only. I love this show and I do not have to go to movies, I can be very happy. It's better than anything else on television today.
