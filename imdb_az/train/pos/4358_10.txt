Okay, this movie is likely to be 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to get the wrong rating of a few bad guys who scanned this movie for zero or 1 star reviews. Each of the segments of this anthology promises great potential and talented filmmakers ... three of them have come to great lengths to achieve great success in Hollywood production. Performances which are completely effective from performances are outstanding performances by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a great melodrama like a psychic hypnosis with the bizarro strobe-lamp and Lance seems intentionally dimwitted as a victim of a lab lab in August. But in general there are some great laughs and some really scary moments. It is absolutely worth seeing, so be yourself!
