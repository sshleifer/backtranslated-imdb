This is a great movie for all Generation Xs. In 1972 a different world of America was compared to the 21st century psychology. In 1972, you can feel as if watching America's film. My clothes and car styles have brought me back to the country's favorite memories. Just imagine ... there were only 4 or 5 television stations to choose from. VIDEO, Muslim terrorists, Traffic Accident, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Snipers, etc. There was a. The Vietnam War is over. It will remain for seven years to get out of Star Wars. Individual computers and the internet would still be 29 years away. <br /> <br /> For the first time this film did not want the producers to buy another movie company, they put the movies on the market themselves. Hence, the small Protestant Churches around the country, which was demonstrated in film projectors, were, of course, prior to VCRS. A pastor of a church who wanted to show the Thief in a Jewish Jewish community would take a copy of the film. Then he set up the evening to show the church in the meeting room or in the lunch-room. Community members would invite "unfit" friends and family members, and this would be a social event this week. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the limited production costs of the movie and just watch for the nostalgic value, I think the movie will be more popular. Of course, I'm speaking gene-xer. <br /> <br /> I will be back in 1972 and will be back in the 21st Century Cesspool.
