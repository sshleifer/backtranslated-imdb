Some may just feel that the rating I have just been a little generous, but I think the film's directors have done a good job of giving them a movie, which is a taste of the film! <br /> <br /> Immediately, I think the classic religious film "The Thing," a direct link between parasitic aliens from outside. You can see that this film respects such a film and other horror / gore genre, but it keeps its own peculiarity, good things fight each other, and then continues to eat the opponent! Kill and choose only one person when you need a new host! Another fight with another infected host! This film even pushes into a love story, but I'll say more, but rather a lot away. <br /> <br /> BIG! But as I said as a taste, you can not be surprised if you do not like the movie. This is a budget budget and, despite this, the creatures / aliens / legs are turned into direct weapons to destroy the apparently visible weapons, namely the saws, the drills, the knives and even the opponent. <br /> <br /> So I was begging for what I did, but we were curious about the next thing! <br /> So, if you want, you love foreigners, maybe after a little love, I come to see this movie. I just wished they came across this first!
