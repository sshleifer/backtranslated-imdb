This documentary has done so if it is possible to surf the heart and spirit of the sport - no, pure lifestyle - perfect form. This documentary shows that life is not just waves, but the greatness of the people, the pioneers, and the greatest of sunshine pushes the larger wave of envelopes ahead of time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - When his heart and soul are in the subject - and it is clear that he is full of genius, glamor, hype or a purely insightful view of the topic. It respects the surfers and the surf / beach lifestyle but does not cry. <br /> <br /> There is much that can be said about this documentary, the surfers, the early history of the sport and its great wave surfers. . Greg Noll is the first big wave identity that's primarily sporting; Jeff Carter, an incredible man set off alone for 15 years on the great surf of Northern California's Maverick; <br /> <br /> The key feature of the documentary is Laird Hamliton, the present-day charm of the great wave surfing. <br /> <br /> All these guys have a great heart and heat - a few girls appearing on the camera come in every word for surfing and the ocean, a deep and strong love. <br /> <br /> How Hamilton's encounter with her father and Hamilton, as a small 4-5 year old boy, forced her to make her father's heart (and again a deprivation of passionate sentimentality). Even if you are surfing - this is a beautiful document that you should watch if you're just a pupil or simply an incredible person.
