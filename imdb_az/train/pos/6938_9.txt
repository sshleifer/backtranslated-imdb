There's something common with Casablanca after Winchester 73. While watching this, you get the feeling that you are looking at a cliche that is often encountered in this genre; you know that these clichés have become clichés only after being copied from this movie, and that this movie is too big to copy. In other words, this is a seminal job. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73 is a joy to watch. The broad lines of the site can be predicted somewhat, but most of them would later see that they are copied in movies, but there are still many twists that still surprise you. Dialogue, pacing, and Mann direction are very good. Stewart is particularly bright and, if you are an admirer, it's not "visionary", it's not alone to deliver a good performance. Carefully, most of the most thoughtful and / or sensitive lines go into smaller characters. Because of the fact that these heroes (more) made more than cardboard fragments, the film provided additional reality. <br /> <br /> This is a very noteworthy movie and worthy of the eye. The DVD also has an interview with Stewart.
