So to a certain extent, I liked this movie better than the original VAMPIRES. I saw that the film was very durable. Like a woman and a horror fan, I acknowledge that women in danger are part of the genre. But they just drive away Sheryl Lee. In this film, Natasha Wagner is a more complete character and the main bad guy is a ghost! Arly Jover (playing a sidekick vamp in BLADE) is very good and fatal. Jon Bon Jovi ... okay, yes, not a great actor, but OK. At least it starts to read. If possible, hold onto the cable. This month there is Encore Action.
