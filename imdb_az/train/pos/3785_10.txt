This movie is too small. Very creative, creative and intelligent. It's just fun and, in my opinion, this movie surpasses the first one. But the movie was forgotten when it first came out and it was even more inevitable over the years. Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey was bombed at the box office, the first was a pretty good hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem might have been that this film was delayed a few years ago. In 1991, Bill and Ted seemed to be "80". Although only a few years ago at the beginning of the 80's, the music and style of the children radically changed in gangsta with rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Grunge and Seattle. Bill and Ted, Ã–zzy Osbourne, Van Halen, and Guns N 'Roses, along with the 80s style, were so depressed and' 91 'was too old, and there is one reason for the film to be bombarded. No one except the surfers was saying things that were "excellent" and "fake!" In the early 1990's, Gremlins 2, who succeeded in the 1980's, was in a similar fashion to being a good movie bombed in the box office because it was very related to the 1980s. The transition from the 80s to the 90s changed faster with the 1990s and 00s. There were no such things as 1991, 1988, or 1989, but now in the years 2002 and 2001, it still seemed like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> In 1988, only the "Excellent Adventure" was released and released in 1989, instead of the Bogus Journey in 1989, when it was most likely that it was first nullified would be.
