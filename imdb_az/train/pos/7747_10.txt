I think the movie "Anyway ..." is a kick-ass movie. Indeed. Tom Barman has spent that for years and shows that each scene has a polished meaning ... The tendency of many people to criticize is a "lack" of a story. I'm afraid it's always the result of our "traditional" storytelling. So what you can get with a book can not be achieved with a single movie, and you can not get it by talking to a friend. The issue is that we have access to movies, movies, films, films, movies, movies, and so on. visualization of events - as you watch news - as we expect each movie to have these epic features - a very powerful story with very unusual events. I emphasize the idea of ​​"unusual events": most people see news, movies, TV shows on television ... very unusual things, once in a lifetime. And here, in the "Anyway ..." there are unusual incidents, but it's not the same as "Hollywood Big Bang": when the boy was dismissed, returning to each other, the car was kidnapped ... and, of course, very common things. And that is powerful: it is capable of evaluating all that, universe and art. And in particular, I agree that the atmosphere created by the photography and the things that can be achieved in the film is put into the center. But not in traditional visual cinema (visual block-screens like Matrix); it serves the characters and remains deeply human. That is, at every shot, you notice Tom Barman's love for Antwerp and the city lifestyle. And it has nothing to do with this movie, something like "learning"; There is no great story to talk to incredible scenarios. He shows the people who come up with everyday life, shows a city with all the good and bad sides, and it says: this is our city, this is life, and enjoy it. Basically, "Luck ..." is not just a super movie, but rather a "message" (obvious, perhaps not included) than movies that really want to make a movie. One drawback: now we have to wait five years to see the next Barman Picin, and everyone will expect that ...
