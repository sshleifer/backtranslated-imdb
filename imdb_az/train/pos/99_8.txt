A Meeting together actually came before my time, but I was raised in John Denver, and these special songs were always my Christmas music. Over the years, we have a record of a sprinkler cassette that was made up of Christmas. A few years ago, I finally managed to watch a video on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for 21 years, I saw John and Muppets for myself. If you have no chance, it's a great thing to do - great music, heart-warming and cheese. It is also interesting to see the 70s of Muppets and compare their new versions today. I believe that Denver really took some heat to make a show like this - normally, dancers and singers did not compromise with the singers, but I'm glad. Noise can also be great if you can not watch the video. There are some Muppified traditional favorites, but also some original Denver tunes.
