I know this was a good end, but it was sincerely awesome. I love when a movie ends with a terrible dark nature, but this time I was surprised to see Darth Vader return to the emperor, and I was really amazed. The sequence of failure in the film was when Luca was tortured and beaten by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. Dark Lord of Sith Darth Vader, will eliminate the dark masters. A beautiful sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is effective. I was surprised by all the ships of Rebel warships and all the Empire warships and Super Star Destroyers. I liked new races on Mon Calomari, Ewoks, Sullesteian (Lando's Co-Pilot) and many more on the screen ... Most of his favorite scenes are in this film: 1-Vader emperor destroys and fatal injuries. 2. When Luka saw the souls of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then shows Anakin Skywalker (The Biggest Stage in Star Wars). 3. Leia Jabba Hutt kills his lord and kills him. /> Personally, the Battle of Scandinavian and Endor, space and space combat, as well as Darth Vader Vs Luke Skywalker and Star Wars, is the best duel in the Death Star. Post-Script: Scenes of Lei and Bikini are memorable. 9/10.
