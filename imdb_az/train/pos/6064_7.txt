I have to explain to you how the winter season in Alaska in the 1990's. A friend from Australia stayed with me and my girlfriend in a shoe box. Alaska can be a bit frustrating, and most people are inside, drinking heavily and watching on television. I found this movie outside a storage store set up in a fugitive shop and was just a new treasure. the worst movie ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking as a fish. We actually looked at the video several times, so sometimes we turned the TV down on its side or for a fuller filling effect. the true gem. Laughs will last forever and their memories will last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. You will not regret it!
