Those who say that this film is worthy of something under the grace that it has demonstrated, I do not agree. This is an incredible documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. Please feel free to think about preparing a documentary. The courage to shoot this film is most striking. When this happens, we see two brothers leaving. Without knowing the security of themselves and each other, they continue to document the most brave documents of the brave. Unbelievable firefighters should not respond to adjusting whether this tragedy is a legitimate movie or a lifetime of this magnificent life. I know that over 30 years, a class filled with children will not get to know each other. <br /> <br /> I have given my heart. 10. That's why the art of shooting has been created! To capture the natural emotion offered by true life. You can keep kung-fu junk. Romantic sweet. The activity never reaches this level. This film, 9/11, will be infinite with a lack of self-esteem. It was not sneak-peek. There were not many empty spots in many screens that many movies lit the lion's share. There was a class, a reserve, a substance, and a record of the day that changed America's face and even the world's face. The camera's eyes were inevitable. <br /> <br /> This film, as it has declared itself, is a blending tribute to all who fall for the free and beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How can he give less to a movie, adorns the natural courage of real people acting in real time? I love "The Godfather" but "9/11" is a different type of movie forever, because it is now a different kind of world. <br /> <br /> Art without question and question. <br /> <br /> Jf
