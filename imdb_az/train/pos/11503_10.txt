Kolchak is a fun game. Great stories and a great cast and nothing else to pull it off. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that draws the audience together. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin the kind of support that most actors can imagine. Some excellent guest stars add color to individual episodes - Terror Legacy Erik Estrada, Phil Silvers at Horror at Horror, Antonio Farqas on Zombie.
