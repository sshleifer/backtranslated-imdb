When I heard this, I was not sure. I was thinking how Disney was shaken. I was wrong. I found it very well. I am not the King of the Lion, but it's nice to see one side at a certain point. It was very funny. Also one of these cornice disney sequels was sucks animated, just like the Lion King animation. Since I filmed, I'm all about cinema. I will not give anything, but you know what I'm talking about. I was also fun that was cool to be the most castle to the original to retreat. All was a very good movie.
