The rating is only 5, because it is a movie that can use better motion and direction (or at least music!). However, for Walt Whitman's achievements, it's worth ten. The previous poster calls the favorite of the movie, but I think it's a simple matter for the trees to see the forest. Filmmakers were more interested in getting the story here because Hollywood was not a brilliant feature film. And for this, I welcome them - in fact, this is a non-essential, reflecting Whitman's life. This film is more documentary for actor. It's rarely the most important thing to get to know about such a story, rarely heard from such stories that shape the mental health of the day. I was very pleased with the history.
