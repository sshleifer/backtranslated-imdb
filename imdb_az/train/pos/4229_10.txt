Do not waste time watching my viewing. Check out and see this amazing good episode that can be best written Columbo! Ruth Gordon is perfectly drawn to her as a charming but seductive mystery writer who kills her horse to murder her daughter. Columbo is a mixed, unique and very clever, more visible than himself, and in this special section there is a fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. This is perhaps the most intense, thoroughly original and twist-loaded Columbo plot, not heroically written by the creators of the Levinson or Link. Each branch is fully saturated and filled with fullness and intelligent dialogue and thinking. Indeed, unexpected and inventive moments are all superior. 10/10 ... Find it on Netflix!
