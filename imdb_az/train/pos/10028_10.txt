When I saw this movie I was surprised to see what a great movie it was. This is the only film that I think will not give you any 10 star rating. I'm sure that this movie will always be my first 5th. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are in their hands. I do not think anyone can be a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If you have a rainy day and you can decide what to rent, this is one. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, rent it or buy it now! <br /> <br /> <strong>
