I have to admit, I did not really look at this movie in the Japenese movie class, but this movie really drove me away. The filmmaker is doing a wonderful job of drawing the name of his movie, which really reflects the form of madness. I think this movie is silent that enhances the uniqueness of the madness and helps the viewer to the characters in the world, not just outside the mind of the world. This film has added to my emotions about American foreign-made films that have been working hard to get a glimpse into a soft film and to give you an idea of ​​having a happy ending, with little use of foreign movies and dreams.
