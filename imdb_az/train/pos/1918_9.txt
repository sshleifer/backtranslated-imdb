I'll be honest with Yall, when I was first released at Sitcom ABC, I was in high school at secondary school. But with John Ritter, there was some potential in it, and I felt they were something similar to me. The player's comedy lines are not terrific, terribly big, and John Ritter always brings his play when it comes to comedy. It was a great show to watch and I'll tell you why it is a great show. My father, who is never just watching sitcoms, is watching movies, sports, and laws and orders, he really is with my three brothers, 2 sisters, my mom and me, and watched the show I thought because he was John Ritter. Honestly, if John Ritter rests on God's spirit, I think this show will continue.
