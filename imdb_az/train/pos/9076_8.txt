This should be one of the most funny television sites to get out of these countries after his death, "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always a joy, and it completes the rest of the ensemble perfectly. David Spade continues to twist my comic bum with delivering his lines in a unique way. After disassembling the English series, "Cyprus" can see me as the creators of the "Nishan Rule" have found their original ideas, but this is not meant as "bricks" - a completely brilliant dialogue, and this is defined in a definite set. But in the very difficult comedy field a new set of players gets more than one authorized player to succeed. I appreciate the role of the filmmaker and the crew's feelings and creativity, especially after being part of a professional television comedy writing group for the best part of the 7 years in Australia. One of the few serial complaints is a "canned" laughter. Without a doubt, a live audience could be used for the sequel.
