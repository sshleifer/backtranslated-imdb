It's not easy to shoot movies with 18 different stories. While 18 international directors challenge, all are not good at all, and some are even bored. However, "Paris, je t'aime" is actually breathtaking, as it says, "Love is all around" in the city of love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A man sees a park and sees many farmers who are curious about the fact that he can not find a girl. But suddenly a woman conquered a car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE - three teenage boys looking for a "donkey piece" of a Muslim one by one, go right in front of them with the help of one of the boys' boys . <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - this was a great disappointment! Although a love story between two boys with a beautiful background is greatly interesting by Van Sant. <br /> <br /> In general, everything coming from Ulliel after the monologue is good. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - An entertaining series by the Coen brothers. Buscemi - even without mentioning a word - respectful and all consistency is only fun. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < STRONG> </ STRONG>. On the evening of the afternoon, another suburban baby is a story of a Spanish woman who left her child to care for her. Beautiful. PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment is the most surprising and most strange of all the film. A shampoo merchant comes to Chinatown-lookalike in Paris. <br /> <br /> BASTYLE is a really good sequence. A man welcomes his wife in a restaurant and leaves with his wife to leave. But his wife has some terrible news. Pretty basic, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad series. Juliette Binoche plays a sad mother. One night, he announces his dead son. As to the place, a cowboy tells his child that he can make a lasting habit. One of the best segments! TOIF EIFFEL - two mimes of love could have been great, but although there are some nice kinematic tricks, the story is interesting and funny. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - one of the best films in a truly original and great sequence! The young girl and the old man are discussing the future and fear for a particular person ... Cuaron is a great director and the actors are beautiful! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - An American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with a drug dealer. still a beautiful segment, with a very sad ending THE FUTURE - a woman comes to a homeless man, begins romantic ... because she is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE is a rich sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, looking for a new excitement in their relationship ... much. <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - creates some differences in the film, QdlM is a relief. The young guy (Wood) finds a vampire who kills the victim ... Tourist and vampire ... be in love! <br /> <br /> PIDE-LACHAISE - another reduction segment. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Short film is amazing, surprising and good. A blind person picks up the phone and hears it with his daughter (Portman - really stunning). <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin language - this segment, where the segment operated jointly by Depardieu and has stars such as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu. <br /> <br /> 14th ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is also fun and sad. An American speaks in the French class about his trip to Paris. His French language is really terrible, but at the end of the segment, Paris understands much more than the look. <br /> <br /> In the background, with the Feist, "Paris, je t'aime" ends. In a sweet tone, some of the segments have been torn to me, though the film's structure is great! Real cinematic experience for young people and the elderly. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
