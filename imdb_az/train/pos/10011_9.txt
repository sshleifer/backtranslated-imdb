I enjoyed the night listener very much. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> In fact, the whole goal was very good. All of them have played only the right notes for their characters - not much, much less. Sandra Oh adds a nice comic touch. Toni Collette is great as the mother and never goes upstairs. Everyone is very convincing. <br /> <br /> This is a short film for less than an hour. I realized that the general version was 9 minutes shorter than the Sundance version. <br /> <br /> The leader told a story and made it a straight fashion, a striking change that brought it to the attention of many directors. <br /> <br /> <strong> Hitchcockian is not a tension. Look at the night listener, because you want to tell a good story. <br /> <br /> When you wait for Hitchcock you will be dreaming. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I came to my film has come to an end. The director was a little bit out of the audience's dreams, but this is a tiny word.
