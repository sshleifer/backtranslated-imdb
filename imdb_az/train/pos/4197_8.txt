The Shock Corridor (1963) was my first film shot by Samuel Fuller, but despite the fact that the story itself was pure chocolate, I regretted with the director's B-movie and the clever mix of a great budget aesthetics. "Pickpot at South Street (1953)", published a decade ago in Fuller's career, has evidently led a large studio, Twentieth Century-Fox, to a great budget. Nevertheless, the visuals are still slightly different from Dassin's 'The Night and the City (1950)' and Kazan's 'Panic in the Street (1950), by cinematographer Joe McDonald.' On some occasions, Fuller draws the camera closer to the actors' faces, they are incomprehensible to their senses and their short stories with face-to-face information. Though he is prone to melodrama and only one sign of anti-communist propaganda, "Pick Up in the South Screw" is a powerful film that has won the best outcome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bargained first. Woman, Candy and her unhappy ex-wife, Joey (Richard Kiley), smuggled confidential information to the communists, and McKay unexpectedly received an important version of microfilm. Can MacGuffin apply to the relevant authorities or sell it to the highest bidder? If there is a defect in the "Pick Up in the South Saki", this story is intended only to strengthen the anti-communist agenda, II. It is the propaganda reaction of nothing after World War I (Dwight Taylor, especially The Thin Man Goes Home (1944), the only propagandistic film of the array.) For any apparent reason, every definite feature, even self-serving Skip McCoy is a self-sacrificing patriotic and predictable transformation.In the traditional film noir, unapologetic offense is always her income, she is punished for her sins, but as they appear to serve their country <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Better than chewing. The best movie scene in Qatar , McCoy remembers Bresson's "Pickpocket (1959)" as a silent fish in a purse and a victim's handbag, Thelma Ritter, as a tired street woman who will inform everyone who wants to pay for it (though, of course, he draws lines on the Commies) Jean Peters plays a role that is completely deprived of glamor, giving it a bare father who informs the other party; Fuller said the actress was observing that a whore was a light-eyed hook. Nevertheless, Peters, with Widmark, should draw a charming love affair, which really destroys the film's attempts. Interestingly, after being released, "Pickup in the South Siege" was immediately condemned by the FBI as communist propaganda, and the Communist Party condemned it on the contrary. Go to the number.
