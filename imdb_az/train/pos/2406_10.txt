This is really the best indicator of what I think of Jesus. most movies show Jesus as loyalty, lobotomy, or torture. this Jesus laughed, played and severely needed. <br /> <br /> The film took some liberties and tried to "fill the gaps." but the fillers seemed impossible, even incredible. <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> Looks like the film is being investigated well. an example was a disclosure to a teenager called "engagement". The brand (or john mark) bag was taken and we ran naked (real 14:51) as a guy referred to in the runaway garden. I feel that they are trying to make the movie accurate (or even spiritually), as much as possible.
