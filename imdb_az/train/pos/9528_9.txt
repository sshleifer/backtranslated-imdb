Obviously, this movie has passed the heads of most detectors. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the salvation (salvation) is the salvation (it is saved) and this film is very little to deal with these two concepts. The film also examines the love and frustration involved with the relationship between father and son. <br /> <br /> The article author Michael Hilson (Tom Hanks) and his murder boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their sons and do everything to protect them. But Connor's son, Rooney's son, is worse than the others. He killed one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover his own robbery from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael is a witness, he accidentally kills the other son of Sullivan (and Sallivan's wife) in an attempt to silence the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan is the price of any price. In a scene on the scene, Connor's cursed Rooney refuses to give his son Connor's aid to Sullivan and hires a contract killer named Maguire to kill Sullivan and his son (Jude Law). So Rooney joined his son, Connor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film along with her surviving son Michael, Sallivan will go to Connor Rooney, and Maguire follows Sullivan. Rooney, "Michael, there are only killers in this room .. and there is only one guarantee we will see Paradise," said Sullivan Rooney, while meeting Rooney in a church cellar and asking Connor to abandon Connor for his family. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but I'm out of character to shake off sensitive Sullivan, because it's a little bit up to the end of the movie, a character gets saved, and a character repents. delicate and laconic performance. Newman pushed his eyes with Connor's mistakes, showing his face and appearance in a good way, like the old Irish gangster Rooney. Jude Law Maguire plays in a creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays natural and ineffective Young Michael. <br /> <br /> Cinematography always shines from darkness, which reflects the subject of fear and salvation. The camera drew her gray and gray palettes. Grays belonged to fathers and Illinois city landscapes of the Depression era. Greens belonged to little boys and the country's plain. Thomas Nyman's noisy, noisy and thrilling music, Irish breath, and played in Copland arrangements. These gangs were the original mid-western city - factories, churches. <br /> <br /> The excellence of the movie is a rare piece of tale from its deepest subjects, different movements and rich music and cinematography. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 10 to 10; The scenario was given a lightweight anti-gunshot message. will be regarded as a great movie on time.
