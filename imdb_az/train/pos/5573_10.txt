A SACRIFICE BIBLE! I saw WHIPPED in a press screen and it was funny. We are constantly talking laughs. SOMETHING ARTICLES ON MARY seem to be a dramatic drama. Amanda Peet shines star quality with its beauty, brain, and ability to win. Director Peter Kohen made a leading film in the world of urban environments seen in men. For all of those comedies, Captured succeeds in its intelligence. For the first time with a romantic comedy, it's rare for the director. He is a great talent. Jewish Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber will be the men of the women of the nails with their deep and very strong performances. You should see these children go to work and keep pace on Peet's web site. Look at the trailer at whipped.com, it's worth a 3-minute download.
