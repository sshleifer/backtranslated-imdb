This is a really interesting movie. Foxx is a mixed action movie comedic in this movie to give comedy spin with comedian Epps. You'll be wondering what happens to Foxx after that. It was a well-shot film, the director used the right colors in this movie (blue colors) to give you a sense of right. Kimberly Elise also played in this movie and it's great to see it on the big screen. He plays his role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. You did not see it as it seems. If you're a fan of a Jamie Foxx, this is definitely worth it. In fact, more loans are provided.
