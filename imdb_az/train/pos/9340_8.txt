** Possible Spoilers *** Adam Sandler is typically typical of comedy, but in Reign, he gives a deep moving performance. If there are courageous people looking at the September 11, 2001, Sandler plays only one widow and has "lost her world .Yohnson (Cheadle) is an experienced dentist facing his old college friend (Sandler) and" Old Times " He wants to catch up .We are Rainman (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < BR> Of course, he has a family. In the same case, he wants his friend not to fall into the public "cracks". I was away from this movie, which is a different look and more sympathetic. Compassion to grieving families.
