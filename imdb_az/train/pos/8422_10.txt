In addition to playing a common game in a movie about the Russian Revolution, an additional sounds. But it is not a usual addition. He is the former command of the Russian army, once forced to re-experience the same scene that was subjected to professional and personal tragedy to convince the humiliated director by Alexander to convince a revolutionary director in Russia. Now this broken man can finally have time to "win" his last fight. This is an important film by Von Sternberg, and it is provided with the greatest mockery in every way possible by Alexander. Jannings deserves the role of Oscari with his mobility and a very moving performance playing in his deep valley. Powell acts as a vengeful actor and Brent is perfectly in the role of his face and his acts of love as Jannings. Around the glitter. Rated, 10.
