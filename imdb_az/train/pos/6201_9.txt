Hal Hartley's Henry Fool is an independent film and, of course, his best work. A great character has a great, emotional ending, with a deep, sophisticated, complex dialogue and attractive. I recall that I stopped my eyesight several times in order to absorb my feelings. <br /> <br /> When I heard about Fay Grim, Henry Fool was a complete movie from start to finish and did not produce any results. Fay was not one of the main characters of the first film, and seemed to be more of anxiety over the plagiarism and ignorance in the real world so his brother Simon was forced to engage in praise. In her film, Fay grows up, although her maturity is a very different way. Simon just went to the genius who had just entered the nearest autistic isolation. The fault responds to ridiculous situations because it is a mature, completely normal, experienced adult who has not grown up a juvenile, has just started as a normal, spoiled child and has no preference. He is dealing with problems in a way that a person is resolved, with a few thoughtful and tired weaknesses. <br /> <br /> Simon seeks to control his mind, Fay seeks to control her. <br /> <br /> The film has many passionate memorabilia, but it is very different for most filmmakers. Henry's foolishness showed a harsh, dull, ignorant world that contradicted Simon's inner passion and creativity. Fay Grim is a vibrant, exciting place in the world, and a wealthy, intelligent woman who has never developed or grown up by a wealthy mother. <br /> <br /> <division is divided into two parts: the first Fight struggle, and the second is Henry's fight to endure as a result of authoritarian hostility and the latter is dealing with his fight to soften it. Henry Fool's fans are primarily interested in the fact that they can even be considered as a continuation of the film, and they think it's a negative idea to play such an intense film with antics and physical comedy. Fay Grim's delicacy is here. Finally, it belongs to Fay's journey, and as I said, it is foolishness in chaos, not creative chaos created. Parker Posey is an excellent actress who captures Hartley's tongue perfectly in cheek. Elina LÃ¶wsensohn makes her role an emotional commitment, allowing both straight and comedian to play a live, scenic comedy around Parker. <br /> <br /> When Henryi falls into the picture, the film begins to run behind the wheel. Hal Hartley's films are all playing and each game should be a full circle. Fay Grim showed Fay's newly developed character and integrity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fay Grim, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The professor of the Qafqaz University, <br /> <br /> Honestly, everyone who shoots this movie, with a mile (and in particular, in the work of Parker Posey), but the film Henry Fool could not have been very interesting.
