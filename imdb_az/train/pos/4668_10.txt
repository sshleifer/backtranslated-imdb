If this movie is now available at least once a month on a digital television, I've seen it twelve times or more, and that makes me happy. If tomorrow I would watch it again. Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians of the actor's profession, did not help in any way by perfectly supporting Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morle. <br /> <br /> This is a small role in not forgetting others. <br /> <br /> This is simply an ex-con, a beloved liar, and then love the process of "new age technology." Although this is fresh (in Cheek), it is incredible, even incredible, not a symbol. There is no violence, no sex, no evil language, and there is no terrible method that is common today. Except for spectacular talent, it is a real lesson to create a beautiful show for contemporary film artists and virtually nothing.
