I only say that I have seen this movie twice and I love it! Acting is great and it's a similar way to "raise your voice", but I do not think there will be no boredom for people who do not like this. There are some great lessons in it, and it shows us that we can do everything we can to try. An incredible movie. I am confident that this will come a long time. Although Britney Spears writes her book, it's really a real plot, perhaps not the enemy of love, but the best part of it, but the best way to do it is for real life. What is the slightest criticism that the main girl in these films is always beautiful? If Holly really was ugly or moderate, would you imagine that your dreams would come up with a perfect man? I do not doubt ..
