A couple (Janet and Richard) enter the camp in the woods near a giant swamp. After enjoying the camp and nature, couples find it hard to imagine that they are an abandoned farmhouse. Soon after, a few escaped prisoners have been abducted and inevitably delayed by Janet and raising Richard as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> In the film SOL, this latest HOUSE has been one of the lowest levels of horror movies. It is one of those who are sick and wounded in shocking early 70s. Moreover, I've seen it as magical and beautiful as you are. I love CAGED TERROR. Music certainly helps to make a sense of identity for the film and many beauties. I found the movie to be pretty scary. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the flaws is the rapid increase of the film, which means that the film is slow and tense. Because of the beauty and shooting of the film, I did not look at the pacing, I think it will be the majority of people. The player is not very good and at least in the early stages is not a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit more patient and is usually not for everyone. <br /> In short, this was a good movie. Not the biggest fear movie I've ever seen, but of course it's funny. This is not the easiest movie to find. If you look strong enough, you will find many shops in the USED section. Not for everyone, but if you're a fan of garbage movies, then it's definitely worth checking.
