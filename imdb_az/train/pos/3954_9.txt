If anyone does not want me to call the most scary movie I ever see, I will always answer "Black Noon" and so far no one has heard of it. <br /> <br /> I was watching alone 30 years ago. When I was 13, my parents were 13 years old when they set out in the evening. <br /> <br /> As we know, it is only shown once in the UK and can not be used in DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> Let me know if someone can watch a copy. <br /> <br /> Now I would have watched it again, it would have been a big disappointment, but it was always a little movie that was particularly worrying about my memory!
