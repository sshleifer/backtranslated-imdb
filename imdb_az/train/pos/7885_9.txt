Above all, I should begin by saying that I'm a big nightmare in Science Street. I think this is the biggest fear series. Freddy for me! Of course, Freddy died, trying to be the last chapter, a strange movie. Previous films do not have the same atmosphere. Freddy has a large screen. Someone is less scared, I think he agrees. And in my opinion, this is the exact point. Freddi knows this movie a little better, because he is one of those who betrayed my dreams. For some people this is a bad thing, and we know it's better to worry about why your evil is not bad. Undoubtedly, these people do not like Rob Zombie's repetition of Halloween. Indeed, for this one thing, you have to see something different. It's not about a strange man hiding in the sleeping mood waiting to scare the ignorant. It was the first and it was awesome. Over the years, Freddie has killed more people, and nobody could save her from good. The nature of this evil now is to learn about the psychological aspects of Freddy's terrorist organization. Besides the story of Freddie, I liked the atmosphere of the movie. More children in Springwood are just barefoot. Horrible scenes are very good. The soundtrack, especially the start song called 'I'm Awake' is played by Goo Goo Dolls is awesome. In my opinion, Final Nightmare is a scary masterpiece and I do not believe it's so underrated. Perhaps I have misunderstood or different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It also has many terrible moments, as well as funny moments and many people! Prepare yourself for something different and do not be disappointed.
