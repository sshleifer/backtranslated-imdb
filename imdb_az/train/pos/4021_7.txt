A complex story in the background of Bharat's division. An honest Muslim kidnapping an Indian Hindu who burns an innocent Hindu girl and a Muslim man's product - you still love both of them. The story is strong, but the script and the stream are hesitant. Backyard music and songs are great. An action dedicated to veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography, time, violence and the village are very good for Punjabi's delight. Other actors did not move well or did not get the chance to act. Direction is really the weakest link. The heroes did not develop well. When a 5-line character leaves a mark, it is not sharply opposed to "Earth." Last but not least. This story may be different - and all of them would be equally good.
