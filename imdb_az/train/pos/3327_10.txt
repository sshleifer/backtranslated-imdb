Farrelly love your brothers and admire them! How do I see this great movie three years after my release? It made me laugh, made me cry, and warmed my heart. Great time. It's hard to describe the ugly English language, but I must try it all the time. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good - from the very beginning, supporting the roles, the player is great, the dialogues are great, the film is perfectly directed and adjusted. I think, Farrelly's brotherly films are often ignored - they are not a bright comedy - they are always! <br /> <br /> In my case this movie has confirmed to me what kind of relationship: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not a sports fan, but I'm not a sports ignorant. Someone you love is: Let them free, and get them - try to share passion and pain, and always respect each other. . But in this movie - vibes takes you. I could smell the baseball atmosphere. Finally, this film tells me what to be a science fiction and what kind of cool fan-families there should be. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Pete & Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you have not seen it - look at KINGPIN!
