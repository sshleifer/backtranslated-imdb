It is a small drama drama that gives many packages for a 65-minute working period. A mysterious body, a former middle-aged police Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and her shepherd sidekick Tobin (John Miles), a botanist Mary (Patricia Wright), who helped to solve a murderous murderous murder on Tobin's gentle and even loving interests. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the great horror that Lt Corrigan called 'Tatooed Tilly' at the start of this film with a deadly woman. Has a period of danger (mixed huh?). And then, when Tobin was killed in the backyard, he suddenly went in the wrong direction, pointing at one point - not surprisingly!
