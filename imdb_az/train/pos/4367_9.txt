I have not seen this movie for many years, as my knowledge is a bit rusty. I think this movie is twice Braveheart movie. It is simply more realistic and more convincing. Ridb Roy, Rob Roy, looks like a ragged hair and beard with simple dresses. Also, Liam Nesson has a Celtic appearance on her, she looks like a Scot, and more importantly looks like Rob Roy. This is a comparison that compares some people, but compares Mel Gibson to William Wallace. Gibson is probably a man who describes the legend as a 7-foot giant, and Gibson is less than a foot. This story is a little romantic, a conspiracy and a well-known story. Something like Braveheart? However, we get a film that says "freedom, love, and justice" instead of a film about freedom and nationalism. This is a more interesting film. More like Gladiator. Casting is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very powerful leader in this business. The story is great when it comes to heroism and humanity. The stage where Mary's aggression comes on stage comes from the house that burns with true Scottish power. This is not a hero at Braveheart. In general, this is a stunning and almost perfect clock. Go and see!
