Timeless music gem with Gene Kelly, Vincente Minnelli in chic and beautiful musical numbers. From the start to the end, a great fun is one of those films that people are watching with a smile and do not do as they use for them! But they never did that. The 25-minute climactic music sequence that leads to any dialogue is one of the most beautiful in film history. The magic of the film, which is clear from the heart and soul of everyone. A must!
