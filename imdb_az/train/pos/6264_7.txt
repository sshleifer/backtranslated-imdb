Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack have documented 50,000 Bakhtiyari people and animals in summer migration for winter grazing. The main value of this film is a time capsule of "forgotten people" today and is known as "proud twins" in what we see in the West. A sharper contrast could not have been imagined. Cracked river and naked mountain passages are cruelly extinguished, and animals that are not under water actually die. A signed certificate of authenticity has come to an end to make sure that the viewers believe that the story is happening. The version I saw was interesting Iranian music, which can be appreciated without a single film and film. Speaking of all this, the film is worthwhile for an anthropologist than an occasional spectator when looking for a good evening entertainment. The crew had enough stock to capture what they wrote, and there was no imaginary camera that resulted from multiple repetitions. The West's headlines are limited to practice, but in fact a part of the record will be appreciated by the audience because they show how Hollywood has shown its impact on the lives of local people. Unofficial entertainment by the desert police is a "police ball". Manufacturers went to make documentary drama Chang (1927) and completely trade King Kong (1933). The topic of migration is reused in the Re-People (1976) and Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who already know what to do - and then highly recommend them.
