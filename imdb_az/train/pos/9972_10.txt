This is definitely an update to the original, only "the left side is right now." In fact, this film goes against a federal government that exceeds its boundaries of personal freedom. This is a warning that our political freedoms were at a very strong and very powerful federal government. Kowalski serves as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government has co-operated with the mainstream media, such as "white supremacist" and "right wing extremists," with the general population's willingness to compromise the rights of citizens, I am surprised that this film can be done - at least by the federal government as IRS developers, Juanita Broderick, Katherine Prudhomme, to the Western Journalist Center and to many people who dared to speak: "Living or Dead," brilliantly portrayed Jason Priestly's "voice" and in a dangerous way <br /> <br /> Many messages from this movie. <br /> <br />
