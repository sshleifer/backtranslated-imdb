I can not say that this movie is better than the original, but that's fine. <br /> <br /> The comedy in this movie is actually good, though I'm laughing too much to think that there are so many scenes. <br /> <br /> The story in this movie is more strange than the original. That is so great. Peter Hewitt is doing a great job of managing this film with a huge cast. The film from the original film turns into heroes in this movie, and all of them play a role. I do not think what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great player! As I did with Alex Winter's Bill, I liked Ted's description of these films as well. George Carlin's return to the role of Rufus was very pleasant. Hal London Jr, who plays Ted Logan's father, is doing a really good job. Ted's body scene and Hal London Jr is a great scene that starts out as Ted, and takes it effectively. I do not remember William Sadler as Death, it made the film absolutely for me. <br /> <br /> If you love Bill and Ted's first payment, you would like this movie. However, I do not expect it to be as good as the original. Hopefully, thank you for reading the movie, <br /> <br /> - Chris
