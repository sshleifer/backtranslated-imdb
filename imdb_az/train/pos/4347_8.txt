<br /> <br /> I will not give much detail about this movie because there are quite a few other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply, I really enjoyed the movie. Only Peter Falk's director is enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> A small-scale "road trip" movie with Falk & Paul Reiser in NY marks the majority of the movie's moves in the fall. <br /> <br /> Writing very well with an adult target audience. <br /> <br /> I really can not say enough about this movie, it's a betrayal of a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> <strong> It's the best thing Falk is facing in the role of a larger leader. His famous friend and writer / director John Casavettes proves that many of the major films of the 60s and 70s are true of Falk casting.
