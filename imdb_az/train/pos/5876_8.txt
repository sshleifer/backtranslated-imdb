<br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar and John Abraham, after watching this movie, have been forced to shoot more films in the future. At the same time, three women entered a little bit of anxiety, but when she left the door she was very funny to watch, the film was really good, and hopefully, John Abraham, who was acting like this great comedy in the future, plays, plays really well, and it's so little that I've done an incredible job, but a really good actor. I just love John, Neha Zupia plays a minor role in this movie and plays well. <br /> <br /> The theater is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
