"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best films I've ever seen. A tragicomedy with profound effects on the fate of the humanity was demonstrated by simple, straightforward people from the Serb province, which had been abandoned before World War II. I saw the film in a small cinema in Russia, the film had a very limited share, and I have not met any chance so far. Unfortunately, this perfect movie is almost forgotten. I searched for VHS or DVD several times and unfortunately did not find anything. I would be grateful for the other lovers of this little gem film for the idea of ​​buying a copy.
