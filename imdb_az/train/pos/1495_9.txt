This is a wonderful Amicus horror anthology with 3 great stories and fantastic performances! It only declares the final story. All the characters are awesome and the film is quite cold and suspenseful, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee simply this is amazing! This is very underrated and my favorite story should be a third one "Sweet for sweets", plus all the characters are very likable. Some were predicted and the final story was extremely disappointing and pretty bland! <br /> <br /> The 1st story (The "Criminal Procedure") is a Awesus horror anthology, with only 3 great stories and fantastic performances, but the last story disappointed. It is a terrific story with a lot of excitement, and the murderer Dominic is really creepy and very well behaved !. This is a great way to start with a story, and most of it is unexpected, plus double twisting ends, shocking, and creepy !. A grade A <br /> <br /> 2nd story. ("Waxworks"). All this is a wonderful performance, but the end is quite predictable but still creepy, and Peter Cushing did an incredible job and I could not believe how old Joss Ackland was. , really love this story! B class <br /> The Third Story ("The Sweet Desserts"). This is the best story here, because it's a very creepy and unexpected time, and it has a nice twist! Christopher Lee did an incredible job and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job like his younger daughter, and the end is completely shocking! I do not want to spoil you for it, but it's one of the best scary stories I've ever seen. Class A +. <br /> <br /> The 4th Story ("Clothes"). It's a terrible story that really bothered me, really weak and unfunny Jon Pertwee, but the end was a little surprising to me, and Ingrid Pitt was always as great as it was, but it was just boring and many times before, plus creativity ??? Lesson D <br /> Direction is great! Peter Duffell keeps the movie very fast, adding a great job here, a beautiful camera work, great angles, some creepy atmosphere! <br /> <br /> The operation is awesome !. John Bryans, here's a great line, just wished he could get on the screen more. John Bennett Det was very good and pretty intense as he was at the end! I liked her very much. Denholm Elliott was great, like Charles, he was sensitive, frightened, very pleasant, and I loved his facial expressions, shaking him! Joanna Dunham is a surprising chance and has done a great job as his wife, with Denholm Elliot, a great chemistry! Tom Adams is incredibly creepy like Dominic, she is looking creepy and has a very good job of working !. Peter Cushing is always as wonderful and incredible here as he is a favorite, focused, seductive and, as always, a ton class! (Cushing Rules !!). Joss Ackland was fantastic and always looked so young here, but I knew him, his emphasis was not too thick and I played him a different role he liked! (Ackland rules). Wolfe Morris was doing here what was creepy and good. Christopher Lee is as beautiful as ever and incredible here, he is very intense, focused on his face and always looked closer to his face as he always was, especially at the end! (Lee rules !!). Chloe Franks gave her one of the best child performance she's been so beautiful, so chilling and beautiful! I loved her. Nyree Dawn Porter was beautiful and beautiful as a babysitter, she liked it very much! John Pertwee was bothering me here and was pretty soft and totally discreet, and there was no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful and his ordinary Vampire thing is doing and it's good! <br /> <br /> The cast is good. Generally a must see !. 5 out of 5
