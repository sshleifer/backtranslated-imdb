Casting was good and I thought Christopher Lloyd, who was previously fond of movies, was a good performer. The film was a great family movie, not something you would bother to show to young children, a good storyline, lots of laughs, light and unpleasant experiences. If you want to entertain children without drowning in tears, this bill is appropriate. It is not difficult for a child to be happy and to follow a parent.
