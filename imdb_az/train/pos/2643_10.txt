I have not said so much about the film area. I have not seen movies for nearly 25 years, and her memory has never left me. I'm looking for him everywhere. I've made net searches in the past, but I'm left empty. Last night I was thinking about the movie again and tried to remember who it was, but when I last saw it, I was only 10 or 12 years old, and if I had put the name of the movie I did not even decide. Another search and finally this vision. I was right. If you knew where to get a copy of this beautiful movie to share with my family, let me at tawnyteel@yahoo.com now. I really appreciate it. And it is worth it to anyone who does not see the film and has the chance.
