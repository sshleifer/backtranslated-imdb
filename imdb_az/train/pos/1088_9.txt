Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly released as middle-class couples who want to build their dream home. <br /> <br /> In general, reasonable plans and expectations begin to emerge because many bigger laughs (even though the story is somewhat thinner), numerous complications and explosion of a bountiful budget. I'm sure to entertain the fans of the Hollywood comedy style at the end of the 1940s. A contractor comes to the auditorium in 1948 after lowering a portion of all the excessive costs. While speaking, Grant may provide a $ 100.00 reduction from the total cost ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but, of course, $ 25.00. You!
