I first saw this movie at the age of 13. It has distanced me and is still in the majority of cases. But I now have to see the exact date as a piece. There is little effort to investigate and interact with racism, and therefore does not realize that the most powerful anti-racist weapon is to grasp the main point in the work of those who work it. Instead, on the one hand, the 3D panoramic rainbow vision is depicted on one side, in beko and in the woods, and on the other hand, two-dimensional characters are unapologetic as evil. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the movie, but I'm concerned that the image of the people is "accurate".
