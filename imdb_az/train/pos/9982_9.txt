I watched this movie yesterday after waiting for the age and age to be released in Canada (still in limited circumstances). Wait and then value a bit. I'm a very read reader of Margaret Laurence and was thrilled to see this novel turned into a movie. I love the movie better than a novel. The character of Bram Slip was a bit tough, and a love story between Hagar and Bram seemed more like it, and liked it, when Bram's life ended, the scenes moved more. The damage seemed to be strong. Hagar would not have liked more movies than the film, but Ellen Burstyn was in this role. He passed through Hagar. Christine Horne was brilliant and I'm sure there are more great things to do. The scenes with Cole Hauser were thrilled. I can usually go from 10 to 9. It's fantastic and I have to wait for it to go out on the DVD, it must be the owner of my collection!
