I wanted to see it for a long time, a great director James Merendino. SLC Punk is one of my favorite films, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that, after a great deal of persistence, it started dragging. The player and the management were awesome. Actually, everything in the movie flowed excluding the script. Sometimes the only thing that kept me in mind was Claire Forlani, one of the most beautiful women in the world. This movie was good, but I was expecting more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Search for a great community by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
