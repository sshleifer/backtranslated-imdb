I found this to be entertaining, very lively and entertaining. Except for a few major mistakes, the shot is wonderful. I have to reflect some earlier comments - Chynna Phillips's heart has become worse as a young man. At the age of 27, he does not have "rye" singing for the very old (and, yes, it shows) and Broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a decent enough singer and is enough for a non-dancer. However, it is not Latina and its character is absolute. <br /> <br /> The girls of the sweet Apple's Conrad Birdie fan club actually scream at Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni with a special kudos. I'm also very pleased with Tyne Daly's performance, although I'm not a supporter of her work. Finally, the dancing Shriners is three-quarters in a collision, especially in the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for the whole family, and I strongly recommend it.
