New York, I Love You, is a collective work of 11 short films composed of short films for 10 minutes each segment. The pants are not exactly the right thing to do, but everyone has a common sense of love. Finding every short love is a combination of a pair or just two edges. The band features a group of ensembles including Shane LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. I was expecting a great movie with such a magnificent cast and such an interesting premise; The problem is in New York Do not add as much as you like. The amount of its shares remains. Some segments are funny, original and interesting but some are meaningless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments). The film is absolutely inadequate and has a very sophisticated tone. Story-wise, several films appear to be something that a student can combine. The film also has many beautiful moments on the 67th wedding anniversary in Brooklyn, one of the best of several elderly couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman. And there are some similarities that have shown me as a viewer, and I want the film to be more consistent, because there is more potential here. However, as it did not satisfy with the end of the story, for me, cinematography and soundtrack saved everything. It was perfect, the filming way was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack could not be more appropriate. In the end, the New Yorker feels like a beloved movie, and it's as high and low as in most of his experiences. It's like a whole movie, or does it make it happy or not. <br /> <br /> It can be valuable to some people and will save time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
