Like Kay Pollak's heart rate in 2004, the Swedish humanity and non-human stereotypes still hold a mass, as in the Soma / Sema. It has evocatively depicts the colors of a small community life, which contains many ammunition for kinty critics, durability, incorrect spotters and sakarin-debunkers. <br /> <br /> The film also gives the gamut of the proverbial messages on the subject of "do not find your own voice" and "do it only if you're afraid." <br /> <br /> A crowded guest comes from two realities. First, smaller films about the edges of the new Christian community in the village provide a large amount of exposure to hypocrisy, while also allowing the repressed characters to lose hair. With the same year and the like Swedish breeze, Sheba's pearls Queen did it and Babette's Day comes to mind. Secondly, any movie about smaller societies that lead to the whole world will gradually hit the human accord in the world of personality and self-directedness. It shows the debtor's debt to the formula of Structural Similarity with the full Monty, Brassed Off, Calendar Girls and Open Day. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this is still an abandoned lifestyle, and it seems to people that they need almost a positive message to produce a sense of society. <br /> <br /> Strangers burned maestro Daniel Dar√©s, intended to rebuild himself. He is unaware of the city he visited or re-visited, the townspeople, and his childhood. He was a sensitive musician with no desire to drive a truck, and he was in a pitiful state by his classmates. Despite the usual doubts of artists and foreigners here, he is a cantor / choreographer. The place, of course, is made up of well-known species that can be characterized by characteristic shades: a fractured, fair-haired girl is so brilliant; calling the local businessman of the mobile phone; a woman who has lost her beauty inside the assassination; formerly Ingmar Bergman to the driver who could survive and to his lesser spouse. Also presented: jealous, uptight spinster (Siv) (check); geratrically reading the soul; older couple with similar desires since kindergarten; Do not laugh at the fat man we call the function and say "greasy" (check); Pollak movie is not all hot fuzzies, but intellectual disabled children. Let's look at the sub-genre, despite "failures and moral opposition." Once violence and creative nirvana have reached, there will be a metaphor for death. The violence of the film is mostly anger and repression, but it is not a deep-rooted cause of violence in a growing school as a spouse. Similarly, a small town pastor focuses on the logic, dark super-Protestant stereotype, his secret requests in Girlie magazines is not difficult. His pressures and hypocrisy are only related to psychological reality. <br /> <br /> Maybe, an uncharted photo of a young boy, probably a lost son, looks at his shoulder once and keeps it secret. <br /> <br /> Maybe these holes are editing functions, and maybe some discrepancies and persistence (twice), such as unrecognizable drowning, have emerged. In fact, none of the hits in the film took a long time, and all were resolved on the stage. <br /> <br /> Apart from some unusual love scenes, the 127-minute film is rarely dragged, but there is an idea that everything is in the cutting room. <br /> <br /> The film is three times higher than the holes in it. It's simply a technology-driven fishermen and a materialist self-seeking world, and any part of human society is profoundly inferior to everyone, even poor.
