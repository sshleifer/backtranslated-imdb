The first film of the accident was Noir Oscar. Some of the analyzes here come in unusual detail and length in relation to the film and its symbolism, and the rate is very high. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to make a more toned approach to a long-lasting film that is practically taken in a budget and paperless way. The pneumonic plague is empty on New Orleans streets and is a military doctor (Widmark) and City Detective (Douglas) to catch the main carrier (Palance). The film is filmed in dark and white, and uses the places very well. Widmark is as beautiful as the usual. Do not forget about symbolism (crime is equal to illness, disease is equal to crime) and just enjoy the pursuit. It's not always easy to watch a movie like this, because it's a very short-lived (at the beginning of the 1950s, after World War II), a random movie watcher, because we're good at this new century. For those who are watching for the first time, sit tightly for the ultimate follow-up. This is something else and I do not know how to draw a clear part. Probably, it took a long time to film in the final because it was the first 90 percent of the movie.
