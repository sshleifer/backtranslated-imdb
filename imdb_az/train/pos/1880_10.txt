Dudley Moore is fantastic in this very unknown classic. This film is a very biased film that categorically casts the talent of actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgood, Liza Minnelli and a few others, this movie could have been a catastrophe. It's not always a good shot, and there are many horned music that sometimes tries to compel a mood (music like "psycho" during weddings), but those who do it eliminate it. The character Arthur is cheerful, with his drunken comments. But he learns to live by his own free will, because he is a mature, well-rounded character. But it is extremely rooted. I do not take it away, but it can be improved. We should see it many times.
