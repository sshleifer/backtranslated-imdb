The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. Money is proud and can eventually lead to destruction. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Two brothers Andy and Hank, money love will earn how much money will earn and will love to discover . Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) will be different. Andy enjoys the success of New York's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife Gina (Marisa Tomei), the idea of ​​an old cube. However, Hank is a divorce seeking for his former spouse's mercy, his daughter's expensive school debt, and infinite amount of child support. <br /> <br /> Let's note that from today, Hank is the only problem that hides itself among his brother and hides them better. He was fraudulent against his company and was busy using drugs to escape his fears. Lying to protect her from the pressure and life of her life has now led her to think about fleeing the country with Qina to rebuild her. Like Hank, of course, she needs money to do this and believes how to get it. How? Stealing the jewelry store owned by her parents and escaped. These acts of betrayal, Hanson's brothers, their families, and many other things will be destroyed because of envy, dignity and fear. <br /> <br /> The only thing that precedes the Devil is that he is dead. After robbery, and after the death of Andy and Hank's mother, Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris), this event was explained differently from various attempts at robbery before and after different days. Along with Andy and Hank's motivations, their father Charles (Albert Finney) also learns more about his wife's death. In particular, relationships between Andy and Charles and his two sons are also explored and other possible motives of the species are revealed after they appear to be very little love among these two men. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman today shows Andy, one of Hollywood's most influential actors, as showing only one picture. a murderer seeking for immorality, at the same time, a contradictory, like a person who is inherent in us. Ethan Hawke is alive as a hopeless person to hang Hanky, not just a missing one, but really little to leave. Thus, Andy and Hank are carried out in such a real way that they are not just symbols, but very realistic images of lost and mixed people who now face the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> It is not a moral fairy tale that has led to the consequences we can not otherwise experience before we know that Satan is dead. Additionally, our choices can affect those around us in unexpected ways. What should be the best picture of the year, the love of money can easily be detrimental to life when it is the last to make it easier for our troubled lives. In other words, our problems are not easily corrected or answered, and trying to find them can only worsen things. <br /> <br /> 10/10
