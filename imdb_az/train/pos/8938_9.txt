The best-selling book and the movie's Smash Broadway movie is about the life of two African-American sisters, Sadie and Bessie Delany, who lived in their 100s and witnessed a century-long history of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll perform well as Bessie and Sadie respectively. Amy Madigan is also as good as Amy Hill's Hearth, a white New York Times reporter writing articles about writers, and so on. Most Flashback scenes, and even today's most powerful ones, are not as exciting as they are in the book. This is a fact that certain aspects of the story are not clear, because the sisters' mother's race sequence and why her fathers are so tough. But besides, it's a very good work, a perfectly sounded, powerful film.
