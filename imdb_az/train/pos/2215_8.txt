I bought the "All Saints Feast" and this is not really a sad movie, but much better. It has many historical value performed by a very talented actress / actor, and it is a daily event that actors can play such a role and be so convincing. There were some parts that were a bit mediocre and mixed, but I can not say that the entire film is terrible. After thinking about it, it is difficult and difficult to get actors capable of showing these parts strongly, since they captured and out of New Orleans in the 1800s. But the biggest problem with the film is that many actors who play the role of colored freelancers are not very universal to beat others who are not slightly subtle, but African Africans with light skin; one of the oldest Creole stereotypes that still exists. Despite its extensive painting, it could have been a vast choice of cast, though it had not been painted extensively. Actors who are looking at actors looking closer to a network could be more thought-provoking. The actors did a great job, could be a good post, and generally believed very much.
