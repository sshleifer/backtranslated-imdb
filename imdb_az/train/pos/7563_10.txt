An independent feature can now be regarded as a film art product and a continuation of a video. Include Broken and aggressively encourage, passionately passionate about 20 minutes short of style and passion. But is it as good as a movie or just works as a demo piece? <br /> <br /> According to some of the films, he is Bonnie Clayton's story, kidnapped after he fabricated a "loyal stranger and his colorful support" (night and night). ). Like the captives, the kidnappers also know what they do not know about themselves. When he asked her, a dark-skinned soldier set out to rescue her. Mayhem comes. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, director Alex Ferrari knows what he's doing, or at least it's good to keep him. Broken does not suffer from insufficient visual acuity, especially in view of its overall and non-partisan experience. Victims are vulnerable and write derivative texts. Consider Long Kiss The Goodnight Meet Matrix, ten minutes after reading Fight Club. A good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the story elements are not easily considered for the eyes of the eye sweater. Is it really important that a short summary of twenty minutes to show the technical skills of the creators of the site? No, not really. <br /> <br /> It would be unfair for me to look at the negative aspects of the film's budget and length. Broken is not a genre classic. The biggest challenge would be to work as a full-length feature. The recent "twist" does not have enough time to cause shock. If the Ferrari is allowed to turn on features as allowed, the area elements may look less casual and the film is more packed. <br /> <br /> Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is no longer the second in the world. I have never heard such aggressive coverage from such a small feature. The matrix inspirational soundtrack is very rich and deep, the guns are punching, and even the surrounding environment is affected. From everything that is presented on this disc, it is a noisy sound for the modern independent DVD production. <br /> <br /> Attachments There are some features that will be found on this disk. While waiting for my readers to read, it is unreal to show and describe each of them here, in fact there are many additions. Whatever the shortcuts in fact, the DVD is unprecedented in information sources. People who love film can learn all the information they need to know about its production, including the product from conceptual art to any promotion campaign. <br /> <br /> Now those who intend to film a movie can learn everything they need to know about these functions. <br /> <br /> Extras are divided into negative menus. These include: pre-production, production, post-production, short and after casting and crew bios. From critical point of view I saw that some parts were pretty short. When editing a feature in each menu option, it would be less frustrating to navigate because the curser was preferred by going back to the main menu menus. Of course, it's only nitpicking, but maybe my advice for filmmakers in future DVDs will be in my heart. <br /> <br /> There are six audio commentary and hourly interview footage and talented people <br /> <br /> This is a generous one, ready to share the movie's secrets with anyone who chooses this DVD. From the extras, I learned what the most effective and effective software is, even the brand of the brand creates the most professional look at the lowest price to get cheap air soft weapons. Moreover, if I could not find any product used in this product, several alternative options were given to me. <BR> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ I have not had the potential and effort because I earned 8 or 9 points in these areas. I come to DVD as a perfect example of what you can do with your features and just about eight thousand dollars. Buyers on DVD will focus more on buying the length version, buying these guys as more imagination, as they imagine themselves as imaginary manufacturers for a great project.
