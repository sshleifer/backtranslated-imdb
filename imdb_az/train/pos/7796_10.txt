It was Ashley Judd and the first movie I watched the first movie of Victor Nunez, and I'm glad of my son. His' silent voice, his' relaxed tempo ', the' realistic imagery 'of a young woman, starting in life, is a beautiful image of the struggles that he needs to accomplish in order to show himself in life, things that are familiar to him - there is nothing wrong in this film. This is close to the movie magic I've seen outside of Star Wars movies, and this is really a good rating, considering what these films are. Ashley Judds's performance, written by Mr Nunez, and his 'great simple' story makes this a wonderful future story and a beautiful movie.
