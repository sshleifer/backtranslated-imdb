For the first time in this movie, I was caught in the last minute. Very interesting and original camera angles and glossy patterns. The area covers a deaf woman chosen by both friends and colleagues. He employs a helper to find the true purpose of love. He is an old person and uses him to avenge the harmdoers. Instead, she should help her with a heist needed to apply her lip-reading skills. The film gets into a dark film noir with a couple really great scene and a better finish. In this film, the real beauty comes from the way the director uses the disability of the leading character. The use of sound keeps the sequence of tension, and dramatic changes from silence to noise save blood pump, and it is convinced. When you throw a little black comedy and erotic sexual repression, you have a big movie shoot. The film is a movie that Hollywood really wants to do, but can not be simply.
