Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter traveling with the crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) for Solvang (California) to cover the Danish festival. The problem is that their dwelling places have fallen and all the rooms in the city are full. So they go away from the city and use the friendly friend Ernest Keller (phenomenal Sydney Lassik). Ernest and meek partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) have a great mystery in their basements: Junior, defective, deformed, childhood dresses, Stephen Furst, who eventually humiliated the girls. <br /> <br /> Lassik, who is his wife, plays the role of a real monster in this horrifying little horror movie. Slowly builds, but it is undoubtedly up to the dense clashes / peaks, delivering horror in a small dose of about half an hour. The hotel and the front royal cellar - the biggest defects of Psycho here are great parameters. Most importantly, the incorrect plot includes an insect and patricide that allows the film to have really dark qualities. This is accelerating, even though we are aware that a teenager is a victim of nothing but a bad bogeyman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
