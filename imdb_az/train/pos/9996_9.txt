I did not read other comments in the film, but on average I judge that I can see that they are not very complementary. <br /> <br /> I looked at my children for the second time. They absolutely loved it. True, adolescents did not roll around the earth, but it seemed like the children's voices. <br /> <br /> This is really the legend of Mel-Brooks, a lot of moral content - to be loved for our money, but not to whom, our friends and friends are embarrassed. There are many films on a similar subject, of course, many of them will have more fun or emotional effects for adults. <br /> <br /> However, for me, children 9/10.
