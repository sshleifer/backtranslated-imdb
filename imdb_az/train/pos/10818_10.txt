Why such a low rating? I really can not get it ... Is that because of your bad behavior? Bad dialogue? Yes, who cares for these things in these unique low budget horror films? Significantly, moving in these cinemas and dialogue is not essential. People who hate movies due to bad play and bad dialogue should not be allowed to evaluate low-budget films. These movies should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's time to talk about the movie, right? Yes, I liked it! I was expecting an expectation because I bought it, but it's not gorefest and it's pretty bad (most of it is just strange and nude to the body of actors), but I really did not care about the movie! The heroes are cheerful, acting hilarious (bad thing in bad budget legitimate horror movies), dialogue is funny (bad dialogue is a good thing in terrible movies), zombie aggressive big dick, hilarious, flying devil baby baby, and I can go there , but I do not want to talk too much ... but I have to mention that it is a scene where a girl is sexually abused Live puppy like a lol! <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> * Do you commit immorality?
