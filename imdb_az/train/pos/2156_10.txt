This movie is one of my favorite foreign films, some of them being a dog like Amile and My Dog. Similarity with movies, such as very large foreign films, draws a language of life and creates a deep heartbeat. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man revived through the roots of secular life and married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking at a dance studio window. She is surprised by her train when she goes through her train. But does it have a connection that will only reveal its beauty, vision or sharing? <br /> <br /> Dance is memorable beautiful characters who deal with bitter realities by overcoming them through the dance world. They break the traditional patterns and stereo types of Japanese society and endanger all of them from happiness and risk. This is one of the few films that have been left out of the world by showing the true magic and miracle that is attractive and meaningful and can be life.
