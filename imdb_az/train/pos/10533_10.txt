I absolutely agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I've been laughing at watching movies for centuries! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are unique! they really work together! This movie can not appeal to some people (I really do not know why you do it), but to each one! I liked it and I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The director is great, and some shots are very clever. In the filming, many people seem to have been exposed to fun! <br /> <br /> In fact, there are only 2 main characters in the film, on the contrary, it's not a lot of space, it's a pleasure for actors to take it and watch the movie.
