It was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I think about bulimia and how dieting is, not quite a clear idea, it's a deep pain, finding a way to deal with them and thinking about choosing this. Beth was a very distinctive character and she saw the pain in her mother's face when she was having a disruption and heard her voice and knew that her pain was deep. One of the best lines in the film is Beth's words: "It's not about you." to his mother. These words were very accurate, and many things were added in the film. In my opinion, the scene was the most important scene in this film.
