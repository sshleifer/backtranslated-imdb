Riff Randell is a fearsome, discreet admirer of the rock band; Ramones and so are most students in school. But the director's new tyranny, Toarq, thinks the role of rock 'n' is bad for students, especially Ramones. So when Riff arrives in the city, he goes to class for a few days to buy tickets for himself and his friends. However, Toqar confiscates his tickets when he finds out why he really took them. It looks like Tom Roberts shot on Riff, but with Riff's friend Kate Rambu Tom feels the same way. But Riff is set up just on the eyes of the singer Joe Ramone and hopes to play their songs to go to the concert. <br /> <br /> Fun! Have fun! Have fun! Yep, the right rock n Roll High School is not the main focus? a boiling, daggy romp! There was nothing I expected, I'm sure. Everyone who takes part in this elegant project is like a great time and its relaxing nature shows on the screen that the energy that gives this glowing spirit is a priceless experience. It does not mean that his art and its structure are so meaningless. But while watching this passionately, the naked sliding dragged into some good harmless loud voices, I have never been silenced, despite my face. Very modest, very modest, intense chaotic, but damn it is a terrible thing! <br /> <br /> This low budget, by producer Roger Corman and co-writer John Dante (and directing some scenes when film director Allan Arkush puts his hospital in the last day shooting). Clinging to effective clich√©s, the youth rebellion tag has been overwhelmed by the generation gap between adults and adults (always the best), and there is a glorious respect in the shaking of the 1950s. These features may not be particularly surprising, but they cause some applications due to dynamic, gusto treatment. There is something in the movie, to get out of a bang! And they manage it. With the permission of 'Ramones' playing themselves. Indeed, because it is linked to Ramone, can you say it's a great fashion video clip? well, anyway. I am speeding up Ramones' movement. These are not musicians, not actors, that is, not about players here, but music that we think to dig. They are here to fulfill! Which, in the face of them, imagine that they create a vibe that pampers the film. Especially their spectacular concerts. The sound noise also had some killer tunes from Davo, Velvet Underground, MC5, Fleetwood Mack, Eddie and some other artists such as Hot Rods and Alice Cooper. However, these jump paths are well-equipped with a careless feeling, and even the score has worked very well. Especially in the scenes involving Moghana Togar, it is considered as touching the right spirit of mind. The entertaining mood of the movie is that the roller coaster moves at such speeds between melodies and funny segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to delicate, linguistic-to-cheek dialogue. <br /> <br /> <strong> It is disrespectful and disrespectful to people living in the Caucasus. <br /> <br /> The PJ Soles (better known for Halloween performance), similar to compassionate Riff Randell. Other exemplary speeches were Dey Young, very fond of Kate Rambeau, Vincent Van Patten, weird Tom Roberts and Clint Howard, as the man went to Eaglebauer. Also some of the top compelling Corman regularly sends a perfect student like Tuarar, a prominent female student of Mary Woronov, a popular popular popular popular, who pushes students to the end of Paul Bartel's little support from Mr McGree and Dick Miles. <br /> <br /> Dear player, it's pretty communist, but it's getting better with that material and there's a certain liquidity that comes from these symbols, but we're totally taking care of Toyun Toar and his salon supervisors. <br /> <br /> It's been a defeat for here, saying 'Rock' n 'Roll High School!'
