After reviewing other comments here, I have a basic complaint about this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are attracted by their own ways - a beautiful "sacrifice" and a beautiful, obviously "blue-colored head" protagonist ("absolutely miserable" <br /> , of course, "turn-on tables", as a rule, as the Caucasian Kabuki scenario, but the complaint referred to me was intended to demonstrate the well-known and obvious physical characteristics of the filmmaker Farrag. <br /> </ div <br / His roommates give speeches as I write and directed - but with their suspicion and sensitivity of confusion and hiccup, Farrah is based on past experience with this guy, but not the truth. <br /> <br /> But this is a more attractive movie and story, despite the events taking place in the film and in the movie.
