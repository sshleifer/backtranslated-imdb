Vivah is no classic. However, hardcore movements, special effects and complex areas (never Bollywood yet undefeated) have been extremely refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. As we all know, the story is a journey to a wedding after a few moments of the first meeting and after a few moments of test. There is nothing, nothing. Music is not in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but it does not empty your emotions. There were two songs for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. Despite the Milan abhi aadha & Hamaari poet hummable. Shahid speaks sincerely and shows many potentials. It is good to see her, it's a normal thing, but she says "fellow". Amrita plays a very sweet and perfect little urban girl. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are spectacular, and the rest of the castle is doing a good job. The direction of the surveillance is simple but effective. The film's shortcoming is a slow pace that many young people will be able to practice patiently. But all good, clean, decent family movie.
