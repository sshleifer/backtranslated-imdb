It was a nice piece for the puppet series, because this film showed all series of suddenly up to seven. And this was a woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would never know that puppets would be in pain. I have not seen the puppet maker series, and secondly, I'll see how bad it is. She showed the look of the Torch, which could turn cool things and people, and showed that the puppet master had returned from one piece. And fewer than 4 foreigners also showed that it was cool, and other people showed them good episodes and did it. This will be a great hit thanks to the Puppet Master.
