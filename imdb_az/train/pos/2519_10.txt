This movie is really special. This is a very nice movie. What three orphans start with Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, They are poor children living on the street, but one day they succeeded in stealing a bag full of them, and then a home and their life seemed better. They make new friends, spouses. <br /> <br /> I'm telling you this is not a good idea, because singers (Gackt-Solo, old singer), along with killing each other, are Malice Mizer, Hyde-Solo, ~ Ciel is also very popular in Japan and Taiwanese singer Wang Lee-Hom), who is trying to become an actor, but this is not the current actors of other singers -movies. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite films. <br /> <br /> <strong> Cinemas are doing a great deal of no earlier experience (except for the two previous films, Lee-Hom). <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is a little bit because I'm a big fan of Hyde, but this movie has discovered me. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (part of the main characters - Orphan Shoe) was part of the band writing and insisted Hyde should play with Sho's friend, vampire Kei. At that time they did not know each other, at least they did not like friends. But after the movie, they were really good friends and showed us that they really worked hard in this movie and had a good partnership. <br /> <br /> The film has many different feelings filled with stories, love, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, very nice. After that, people die, Kei breaks apart, and all this changes. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie, you really should. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; because it's fine, but sad.
