Like many people on this site, I saw this movie once in 1971 when it was first broadcasted on television. Separate scenes remain in my memory, and I often remember how the feeling of anxiety is remembered. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spokes: 1960 English movie, at the beginning, the "City of the Dead", the Horror Hotel for American Freedom? There is some similarity in the next British film The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie, one detail remains with me. A small but important moment at the start of the film. As I recall, a minister and his wife stopped in 1870 for some people on the roadside to help the West. Friendly looking Ray Milland introduces himself and her (daughter?), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young silent woman. The Governor Ray Milland is assisted by a carriage, although Yvette Mimieux is an incredible, striking look and spiral of any character. He was not afraid, but with silent concentration until snake. <br /> <br /> With this strange moment, we understand that this is a pretty unusual thing for normal people, although the threat to the minister and his spouse is indefinite and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> After all these years, I stay alive with many others. It is not surprising that the film does not go bad, and that people can remember it alive. One has to do this for home videos!
