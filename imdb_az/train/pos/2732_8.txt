Herbet Clutter, his wife, Bonnie and their teens, Kenyon and Nancy, were very fond of and respected in Holcomb, Little Town, but on the 14th of November, 1959, the fourth was poisoned. On the contrary, an unexpectedly criminal offense impressed the writer Truman Capote. He fled to the scene and began to follow the course of the work. The result was a book in the FOLLOWING WATER. <br /> <br /> The version of Capito's 1967 film is almost as remarkable as a book. herself In many parts of the real life, he has drawn a black and white film, with a little documentary quality, frozen and independent - and total casting is exceptional. Robert Blake is recognized as an actor and this film is worthy of being. Like Perry Smith, the killer, Blake will trap you into the horror of the horrors and unexpected sympathy of the shock; a masterful performance from start to finish. Richard Hickock is less beneficial than Scott Wilson. <br /> <br /> Like the Capote book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock, traveling with Kansas and bringing Smith to her home - just a crime to the details of an investigation that has eventually resulted in arrest and conviction. The main purpose of the film, the last one, was the moment we saw what happened at Clutter House; <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks directs the film with a very strong sense of debate, only in that sense, allowing the film to survive. However, taking into account the overall strength of the movie, it is becoming an unreasonable concern. Strong things - Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
