According to my humble opinion, this movie has not been properly recognized. Robert Redford lives here in Sundance, near Provo, Utah. I love most of his work and it was my favorite. I apologize for the fact that more people did not appreciate it. My grandmother was a reader reader and read the book before leaving the big screen. After seeing the film together, they gave me a read. The film and the book hit my senses in my heart and cried for a few days after seeing the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to make sure that our loved ones hurt themselves. We see it in our own family relationships, but our love, our families, and their stories go down over time.

There are words under the pages, some of them are: "These words, written by Norman Maclean, from the book and ending at the end of the movie by Robert Redford, are mostly written in my opinion. Any drawback that the film may have is preserved by the beauty and grace of the story and cinematography. It was beautiful!
