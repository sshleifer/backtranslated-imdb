Let's see this: Last season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I did not like (mostly we did not find magic all season). But if you judge this show last season, of course, it can be seen from below. This is an entirely unfair assessment. Because "Show in the 70s" was a bright and exciting sitcom in the daytime, and people living there were no different from what we were in modern times. <br /> <br /> They missed the 8th season. Topher Grace stars Donna (Laura Prepon) next to the feminist girl. Friends of Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) deliver fantastic performances in every episode. The best thing is that they are probably Fez, a foreign currency student, who is mentally different. From which country? Try to figure this out! Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are extraordinary as Ericin's parents for another fun space. Rupp, like Kitty, is both strangely and sweet, gets acquainted with Mrs. Brady Marie Barone, Smith's Reds, mainly to scare away the pogees outside of everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play with each other, like Donna's parents, chauvinist, but like Bob Bob and Anger Midge. <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong has a casual look like Leo, a father figure for Hyde. <br /> <br /> Besides anarchic errors, frequent and sometimes overlapping lessons (and this miserable final season), '70s' beautiful post, spot-on direction and a sensual vibe pulse through each episode with a terrific show. Everything is good.
