David Lynch typically incorrectly puzzles movies. They are interested in looking and thinking, but they really do not come to your mind. <br /> <br /> Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch movie. Perhaps there is nothing typical about them. There is an odyssey through Red America. His real spouse, Alvin Straight, took the grass mower to go to the brothers' home. It is 300 km from Laurens, Iowa, Mt. Zion will adjust his brother's illness for past crimes. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth sounds sweet in the center of this film. Alvin Straight brings us in a simple and honest way. The slow progression of the film is that Alvie is slowly going to get out. <br /> <br /> On the way, Alvin faces a mixed and frightening young girl. Pregnant and the situation decided to escape. Alvin speaks about the family after listening. <br /> <br /> Then, Alvin witnesses a violent killing with a carousel woman's car. He complains of killing and killing several people. Alvin feels bad, but at night it's smart enough to cook some sweet meat. <br /> <br /> Then, Alvin loses the lawn grass and is about to kill her. A beautiful person and his spouse allow him to stay in the yard while stabilizing it. They even say good, sweet but slow girl, played by Sissy Spacek, who has been staged by a terrible tragedy in her past. Alvin requires payment for the call. He even invites Alvin to enjoy his brothers. Alvin escapes gratitude. <br /> <br /> Alvin looks at a bar with a good old man when he discusses the hardness of the war and the prices she gives them. <br /> <br /> Alvin acknowledges a fatal mistake such as an already angered sniper. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets with two brothers who repair the grass. They call them richly with high wages and repairs. <br /> <br /> Alvin takes his hat off the night before leaving the house. The man says that he is an honor to raise him, and he asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> It continues this way and we can not help but do more. We want Alvi to reach his brothers. We want him to change it. <br /> <br /> This was Richard Farnsworth's best. His last film was his performance. You can not help to understand his dignity, listen to his wisdom, and eventually feel the pain. <br /> <br /> If you later have justice, then Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth sit together at the bar. You can discuss their lives, their desires, hopes, and joys. Alvin says in the film, "My brother and I stared at the stars." I know that all of them are the best in the house.
