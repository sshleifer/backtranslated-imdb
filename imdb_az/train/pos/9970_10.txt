The brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimization limits of today's Christmas rituals. During the scenes, the voyeuristic element (Santa and Pedro interpret the behavior of a society through a telescope) are unique (and, apparently, Jean-Luc Godard plays this theme in "Pierrot le-fou"). Recommend!
