First, the film was maintained by the original lyricism and then I was completely proud of the story story and engaged in brilliant leadership. The heroes were completely developed, not bigger than life, but just as people in the world, Sweden, Turkey, or America were people who were absolutely certain of the horizons and nobility. Hollywood could learn a lot from this wonderful movie. It shows that it does not need to go into every detail behind each step to put the whole theme in an open and brilliant fashion, and the director shines! Keen Pollak and hearfelt thanks to the amazing cast for this superb treat!
