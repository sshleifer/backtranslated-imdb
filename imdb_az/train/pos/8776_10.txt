Just to point out something about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that have been made for the great visits between Errol Flynn's big trips. I thought this role was played by boxer Jim Corbett, his real identity, as he writes as a writer. Flynn seemed like a party of heroes, and her real life was more exciting than the screen life. What I want to point out is the large assemblies, transitions, and still more annoying movies. Although Raul Walsh, with frequent worker Flynn, has been with cinematographer Sid Hickox, the assemblies were designed by Don Siegel, a little up and coming editor. I never knew Siegel was so far away, but he dropped it on credit. He would continue his career as director of the movement.
