I've seen this movie twice or more, and I found it very well! The Second World War ended and the so-called "Cold War" started. This film can therefore be one of the best "propaganda", one of the patriotic films prepared by the Americans, and the second one, prepared for the creation of the "Western NATO bloc" of countries that will face future challenges. The film marks the might of the US for centuries. Beautiful and funny way of describing the discovery of America's continent by Columbus and New Amsterdam's "spisode" and the purchase of a drunken Indian Indian Manhattan .. (At least once, propaganda for interest in fashion :))
