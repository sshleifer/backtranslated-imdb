But the film has many assets: dazzling scenery, gorgeously pictures, stunning special and visual effects (giving the first five minutes and giving the film a tone), excellent musical score, unpleasant attempts to overcome some tension, solid castle: two heroes (Stallone, star and cowriter, there is a lion share of images, but excellent Michael Rooker is one of the most cruel villains), one of the most cruel villains (John Lithgow and cheating woman Caroline Goodall, and Rex Linn - more than a usual part) too, and Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Well, there is no credibility after a solid fun. Another movie by Roger Ebert) "This is a movie that you can go back and enjoy while you are not mistaken." <br /> <br />
