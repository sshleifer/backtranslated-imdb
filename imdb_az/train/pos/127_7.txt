Zentropa is in touch with the Third Man, which is then among Europe's destructive wars. Like TTM, there are many inventive camera work. Therefore, there is an innocent American who is emotionally involved with a woman he really does not understand, and his loneliness is brighter than the local population. <br /> The Third Man has a better prepared story. Zentropa differs slightly from this point of view. Perhaps it is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare and will corrupt this effect as it is very adaptive. <br /> <br /> This film is unusually frightening - in a sense more "noir"; He never sees the sunshine. Strange, but exciting and scary.
