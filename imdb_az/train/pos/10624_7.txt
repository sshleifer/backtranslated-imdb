After reading the other reviews, I decided to follow my position. The movie is not great, but it has many great elements. Along with the camera work, lighting and scenes are great. The story is slow and weak, but fun. Acting is bad, but not worse than you found on the SyFy Channel. The music is pretty good and your eyes are good. The film has a great Leather Facade and is made by Bruce Campbell. While watching the full movie and predicting more, it was still pleasant. Women are attractive enough and the leading actor does a good job to be poor and frustrating. The film was a modern movie and was fairly clean for violent violence for 13 and more children. No sex scenes. I've given out from 10 to 7 and this is fair. If there was nothing better I would have watched it again. The gay singer was the most animated side of the film, and the devil is terrifying.
