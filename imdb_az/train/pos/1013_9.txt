Stargate SG-1 follows and extends the Egyptian mythology presented at Stargate. In the Stargate universe, people have been transported to the slave and displaced planets by Goa'uld, like Ra and Apophis. For millennia, Goa'uld has made a product of humanity, which affects and spreads human civilization. As a result, the Earth's cultures, such as Aztecs, Yeast, Britons, Norse, Mongols, Greeks, and Romans, are found in planets that are well-known in the galaxy. Many well-known mythical places such as Avalon, Camelot and Atlantis were found or existed once. <br /> <br /> Currently, the earth's stargate (found in the drill near Giza in 1928) is home to many hidden US military bases known as the SGC (Stargate Command) under the Cheyenne Mountain. Col. Samantha Carter (Tapping) and Teal'c (Hakim) created the original SG-1 team (combine several characters and / or exit the team). Jack O'Neill (Anderson), Dr. Daniel Jackson (Shanks) in the following seasons). <br /> <br /> Along with 24 other SG teams, they explore galaxies from Goa'uld and search for alliances with remote planets and technology and friendship. <br /> <br /> Parasitic Goa'uld uses advanced technology to climb as the god of Egypt and to conquer the galactic and eternal worship. Goa'uld is the main competitor for the first eight seasons. They are parasites that are not alien, such as highly intelligent, merciless snakes, who can occupy and direct the corpses of other species, including humans.
