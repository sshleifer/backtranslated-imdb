"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most entertaining science fiction films of the 70s and is still very convincing in today's standards. Despite its defective and somewhat dated, apocalyptic touch and environment (typical of that era) still feel very uncomfortable and thoughtful. The quality of this movie surpasses the majority of modern SF flips for a strong pen and some of the strongest sequences I sometimes find classic. New York in 2022 is a place where many people, unemployment, unhealthy climate, and a general lack of vital nutritional value. The only available food is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (a great form) plays with the police, investigating the murder of one of the most prominent leaders of the SÃ¶llentin, and pushes scandals and dark secrets ... The scenario is sometimes a little sensitive and probably does not really come as a big surprise, the atmosphere is still very tense and unmanageable. The sequence of this resurrection is really terrible and easily one of the most striking moments in the 70's. Edwin G. Robinson is extremely impressive in his last role and has a great (but very modest) supporting role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is my science fiction in my book: a nightmare for humanity and inevitable fade! There are no fancy space ships with flying monsters that attack our planet.
