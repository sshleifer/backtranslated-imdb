What a good movie! Made Men is a great action movie with many twists and turns. James Belushi is as good as an old hijacked robber who stole 12 million pirates and hilbililerini stolen by his wife and local Sheriff (Timothy Dalton) .You will not be disappointed, you can take a ride and ride. 10 to 8
