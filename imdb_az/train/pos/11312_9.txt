Ossessione is in a very poor condition, but is now fully restored to Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. Starting from the second generation of the "Master positive" of Visco, Visconti was able to hide from the Nazis. The spirit is researched on 4K (like 2K RGB data) and was developed by DaVinci Revival recovery software. After that we have the remaining hand labor and we will not finish before the early spring. Next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully released on HD DVD. This movie is beautiful and we hope that many generations will benefit from the restoration work.
