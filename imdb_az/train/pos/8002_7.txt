I've seen Maslin Beach several times in Brisbane giving free television. <br /> <br /> I also say that there is such an Australia. Only in Australia, the day of the birthday of a birthday, there is a film about people's relationships and can be seen on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> A friend from the United States is always amazed at what we put on television for free compared to our country. <br /> <br /> Although our government has tried to turn into a 51st US state, at least one thing is really Aussie
