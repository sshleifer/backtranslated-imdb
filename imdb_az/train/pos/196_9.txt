This was a wonderful introduction to Marion Davies's talent and beauty. This film is not only beautiful, but fun. (Lucille Ball believes in Davies's style later that he called his career "pretty beauty"). Vidor's direction is light but hand-held, the story is of course a chestnut, but the toy is very beautiful, and it is added to the entertainment together with many people for the silent fans. Adult drama and good old-time romanticism combined slapstick elements. To watch silent films, all movie fans who react to the knee sit can sit down and change your attitude. <br /> <br />
