Although the story is fabricated, it is drawn from the history of all three worlds, not just the history of Latin American countries. This briefly summarized the true, clean and raw history of those countries, in this novel / film. These extraordinary supranatural things make the intensity of historical events presented in this film. All the supranational products are part of the third world culture. Even though it has not been announced in a surprising way (probably because of the supranatural squad), this is a perfect story and a great movie with a great activity.
