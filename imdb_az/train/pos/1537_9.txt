The film is a city in Sweden, everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parents on her father's birthday, and sometimes there is always some sort of tragedy, the question will only be this year, and you will be surprised ... This is a very good composition, a rare case of a humor and seriousness, with a perfect balance. If you're happy, you're gonna hurt and basically everything you do. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Enjoy
