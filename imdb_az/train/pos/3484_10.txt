The best movie of all time! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 1970s as it was seen on Bulgaria TV and I immediately liked it (I was 14 years old). I got a video tape after 25 years, and a few months ago, finally, a DVD in Bulgaria. I live in this movie for 35 years, and I'm all my friends and family. When my son saw her for the first time, she was a teenager and loved her instantly (and, in practice, just watching the Hollywood movie, grew and grew up, I speak Russian or do not understand!). How does Danelia make this masterpiece unique? It is hard to tell what is beauty, because it's hard to say ... But in fact, as you can for the first time, you can watch this movie with taste with it the same time. I can not remember any movie, how much money it makes or how big it is ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
