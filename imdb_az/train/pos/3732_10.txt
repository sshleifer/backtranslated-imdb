Producer Joel Schumacher, heading for "Phone Booth", "02", and many other great movies, is actually facing a person's killing machine and entering a COMBAT person by destroying their identity! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), Intermission, 03, gave one of his best performances and actually took that picture back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "02 Blue Blitz", "02", played a major role and played Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), "All True Girls", 03, as a true player. There were two short scenes in which the soldiers had to find a romantic hot vacation on a short vacation in the local town and pay for love and sexual desires. A Vietnamese Army Veteran trainer told a soldier how a person's body would use electric wires in all the wrong places to actually torture the enemy. See a nice and entertaining movie.
