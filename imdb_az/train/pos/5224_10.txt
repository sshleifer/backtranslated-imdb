Ayone, who said that this film was a pretext or that it had no space, was looking for "Jean de Florrette." SALAM! This movie has been accepted as a random comedy act, and has in no way included any form within or form. I would like to remind those works that they should go beyond this film to lose that point. This film is clear to me for those who do not welcome the name "american humor" for me. But everyone has ideas and should be a bit more grateful to some people that they can not suit yourself before making a sense of humor. <br /> Thank you
