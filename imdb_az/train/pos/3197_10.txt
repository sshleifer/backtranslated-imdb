If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, you should see it. If you are looking for a Sean Penn, you should see it. If you have a movie fan in general, you should see it. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is, and if you have no idea that anyone knows who Sean Penn is, this movie will probably have a lot of value, but what you've been doing before by Crispin or Sean is better. <br /> <br /> This film is very funny, but it's a genius. I do not know, it looks like this movie. This is their genre. I doubt that something like that would happen again. I can not say more about what has been partly violated, and some other analyzes here have done a good job. <br /> <br /> Please be kindly requested to review the film in response to any of the worst-looking reviewers here. In fact, there is no point in which this film can be just "boring". It was perhaps the most entertaining, fun and least boring movie. And it only gets better with age and recurrence. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is a brilliant work by Crispin Glover, director Trent Harris, also responsible for Rubin and Ed. <br /> <br /> The copies of this film are rare and hard to find. Although a bit hardworking, I've been able to find the VHS version and there are several ways to find what I know. But I really want someone to put on a DVD.
