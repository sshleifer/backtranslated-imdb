As a horse's lover I can only judge this movie. There are a few films showing this kind of horseback. I would like to know what Brian is driving in the movie. He loves horses but he knows. Brian has been featured in many films. What has learned to ride? The only thing that is difficult for me is always the full bend of horse-drawn scenes, and the horse can run for steam forever. The camera work is the first degree, and it horses in a way that shows how dangerous things are on a horse. It would be great to know how they went to shoot this movie to find all the horses that are very good.
