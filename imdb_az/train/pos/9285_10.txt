Finally! An Iranian film by Majidi, Kiarostami or Makhmalbafs. This non-documentary, entertaining black comedy regulates the 'mouth with' donkey, with the devastating young girls. All this is fun and funny that it's funny and funny. The director says: "The places are real, the event is real, and there are symbols and additions, so I chose not to choose professional participants because their presence would offer fraud." Non-actors are a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. Perfect scripted, film patriarchal powers make it difficult with almost absurd freshness. It won the Grand Prix of the Jury, Berlin, in 2006. Dear reader, this is perfect. Where can I save it wherever you are?
