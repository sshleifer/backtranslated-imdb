I've seen this movie lately. Two hours later, my head was still laughing. The hell was very scary, the jokes were very bad, but I did not take into account: then 2 scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and your copy came with a player who said you did not like the movie. Send a certificate to HBO. I think that it was January 1991, when it was necessary to send it (which also led to defeat).
