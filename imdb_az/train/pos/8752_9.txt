It's been a while since I've been waiting for this original picture. Brokedown Palace has a 'hard to believe' theme, but with this masterly guide and screenwriter, Palace scores are great. <br /> <br /> I really did not look at Claire Danes in any movie, but I'll tell you, she really changed that idea. Kate Beckinsale traveled to Denmark on a holiday in Denmark and met with them a young man who trusted them to visit Hong Kong. However, he was indifferent to declare that they would be the only drugs available for them. Finally, they are arrested and resided in Thai prisons. I know, I know how do you know you're 18 kilograms of drugs? Yes, if you can get it with a small firefighter, you will find a very well written and thrilling story. Recently, I've seen the stories of films I watch and that I have developed a personal feeling for the following characters. This movie is different. At the end of the film, I looked at myself more than the other characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a resident of Thailand who specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman provides a perfect performance and connects the movie in a beautiful way. <br /> <br /> There are several twists and turns tearing up to the end of the movie. This is one of the movies you most watch when watching the movie at home. In my opinion, the video store will not go any further this time.
