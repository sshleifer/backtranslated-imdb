"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of these beautiful old movies about pets. Along with other animal films such as "Old Yale", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud", it deserves a place among the genre films of the genre and generally the world of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is more than a film about pets. <br /> <br /> Can this be just a "repeat"? It's good to be "repeating"! <br /> <br /> <em> Emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a great view of the mountains, the history of the thought, the delightful characters, the excellent and relaxing instrumental noise, the shimmering shores / landscapes of the bright Sierra Mountains (Oregon) ... When talking about roads, it is not all the mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunset ... wonderful miracles of nature - a full panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human heroes are beautiful, well-developed and well-described by actors Robert Hays is as awesome as a kind father Bob Seaver Who Greist is as good as Laura Burnford. eronica Lauren equals Hope as Kevin Chevalia is most respected as his youngest and beloved brother, Jamie (his appearance is actually reminiscent of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Age"). Benj Thall is as big as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> As for our fourth palsy, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is loyal, wise, old, beautiful, caring, and old Gold Retriever (sounds great by Don Ameche). Chance, American Bulldog, is opposite Shadow. She is carefree, foolish, impatient, uncomfortable, calm, joyful and playful (sounded by talented Michael J. Fox). Luck can not stand alone. Sassy is the epitome of the image of cats: elegant, independent, very trustworthy and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude, but with a particular cat appeal. Sassy is the Seal Point Himalaya cats, one of the most beautiful cats. Sassy was voiced by Sally Field, a good worker. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends, like themselves, are "actors" in nature: Sassy, ​​like Ben Shadow, Rattler Chance and Tiki. <br /> <br /> This is a groundless movie, but it is classic with itself. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be Top 250.
