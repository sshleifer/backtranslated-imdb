Perhaps I'm fond of this movie partially because I feel down in pits and so is a lovely little fairytale. Whatever the case, I have considered this square perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent performance (especially the beautiful Neyro). <br /> <br /> This movie was more than happy to have been for some time. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny and clever movie. Some of them were surprised by the history of the king's brutality and the subsequent jokes of the Prince, the magic charm and charm. This is a very good thing; <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;
