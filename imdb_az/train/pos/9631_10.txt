A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. Boys come to sweep the skills at Professor Noodle House, a mad scientist who corrects her cavalry serum. Stan & Company, with its DIRTY WORK, is being destroyed in the house and roof. Then the professor wants to try a new potion ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The final end is slightly sharper, but most of the slacking is so intense. Particularly good is the competition of Consumers on the opposite side of Stan and Bosch. Lucien Littlefield is a professor.
