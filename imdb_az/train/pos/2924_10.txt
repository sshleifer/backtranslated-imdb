Rated NR (R For Rugged Intensive Language and Raw Sexual Humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (Must be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A Eddie Murphy Delirious is the stand of Eddie's first comedy rhythm. It came out in 1983. Then 48 hrs in the movie and Shopping places and two live comedy films on Saturday night Live.Eddie. I've just found it to be more humorous than just the theme, because it's precious and Raw.I Raw. Edirie is a very funny childhood talk about him and makes spectacular entertainments like singers like Mr. T. and Michael Jackson. Everyone on the stand-up comedy should see Eddie Murphy's Delirium.
