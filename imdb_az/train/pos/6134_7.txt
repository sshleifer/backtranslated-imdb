Some DVDs are owned by me and do not need to be bought. It was one of those films. Like many here, I remember seeing her as a child and loving her. I never knew there were scenes and musical pieces cut off, so I was interested in what they could do. The Portabellow Road ("Portabellow Road") has long been a success (as football game), and I have not found any fidelity with other scenes that have been put on their dignified sites. Perhaps when Disney read the revised version on one hand, the original version (once revised version), people could choose what they wanted to look like. All this is still a fun movie to capture some of my childhood memories.
