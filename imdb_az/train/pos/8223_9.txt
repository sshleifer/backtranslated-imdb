When I saw this movie for the first time in London in 1958, I was born. I have never seen such a movie before. <br /> <br /> I think Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters if they are not twins. Of course, it is strong enough to affect the interaction. <br /> If this DVD has been converted to Region 2 format and I would like to hear about it in the original French language. can be purchased.
