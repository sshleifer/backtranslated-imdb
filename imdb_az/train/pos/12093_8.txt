In the 1960s, Italy produced very big and original fright films - this is of course one of them! The first thing you'll see about Danse Macabre is the style of the movie. Beautiful black and white, directed by Antonio Margherita, uses lighting; it is said that the film might be a German expressionist fear film. It was coupled with a terrifying fraudulent line that Danse Macabre is really a horror film. Of course, Barbara Steele, as seen in the film, does not hurt the issues - a good story begins to bend over the muscles that are more functional than those of its famous actors. The site is aware of the time it was released and united the great Edgar Allen Poe. We follow the writer Alan Foster, Poe himself and Lord Blackwood, watching the latter spend the whole night in a creepy old castle. Everyone who used to be there ago has died ... and our hero wants to meet with the previous players! <br /> <br /> At present, horror films are not at the center of attention in every shot, and ultimately there is no beauty in the genre. Therefore, watching this movie is updated. Many of the shootings here are incredibly beautiful - on the one hand, it's just a woman wearing a single-skirt skirt, a personal favorite - a smoke under a door. This is my first Antonio Margheriti movie and even after seeing this one; It is clear that one of the prime ministers of Italy. It is also interesting that the script was written jointly by other Italian dignitaries; Django creator Sergio Corbucci. The field is sometimes somewhat similar to each other, but there is always a sufficient atmosphere to make sure the film is enriched - and when it slows down, it is always the same thing. Danse Macabre's 'haunted home' theme is both good and original and helps keep the story as smooth as possible. Generally, Italian and / or religious cinema fans do not want to miss this small ship!
