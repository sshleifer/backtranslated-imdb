I liked the fact that this film recognizes the explorer's intelligence and explains that the layers do not lose the impact on each of the heroes by interacting with each other. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is beautiful and I believe that she is a very talented filmmaker with competence and artistic ideas that she does not believe in the failure of others. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this success. <br /> <br /> I see a bright future with the ability to focus on the purpose of this writer / producer / director.
