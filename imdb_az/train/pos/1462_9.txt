In this documentary, we are facing Roger, a rich Chinese factory manager, who sells and sells the Mardi Gras of New Orleans and other peppers. Roger claims the factory loves her daughters and is grateful for the opportunities she has given, but interviews with the fourth tell a completely different story. The lifeless lives of girls are different from that of Mardi Gras. Filmmaker David Redmon is honored to start a meeting with the camera manager at a Chinese factory, winning the excellent and rare looks of everyday life and heading the US manufacturer and selling beads. The film is compulsory and clearly serves as a window behind the Chinese production.
