Often a film can literally make the audience laugh and fills their eyes with tears after five minutes. Many movies are trying to do this, but a few films can act with this emotional effect. Adam Sandler drives you with hot and often fierce explosions, and the shadow of his past makes you laugh when you do not pull him down. I will not destroy anything, but there is a scene in which your eyes should irrigate and lip tremble. While watching this movie, most cave men should be whispered whispered so as not to feel something. Don Cheadle exhibits another great performance but is illuminated by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith are giving speeches, but there is nothing in the line of two leading roles. Sandler's works still exist and in fact did not protect the film from the border line. <br /> <br /> There are many laughs, but do not think you will stay there for a long time. Because it remains serious again without warning. <br /> <br /> I'm just doing this movie on the human body, but I cut it down. You do not need to say more. Give yourself a blessing and take time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait until you leave it on DVD, this is 100% worth of. A deep-moving movie for putting tears on your eyes and putting a smile on your face ... of course ... you are a soulless spirit.
