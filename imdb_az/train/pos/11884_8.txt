I found this movie as an interesting work of the family in the crisis. <br /> <br /> Being the oldest HIV, Leo not only responds to family responses alone and touches one another and is still strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family like this physically; they resemble one another. I did not understand that the smallest of the family did not understand with the news, but I found this tough movie since the past. <br /> <br />
