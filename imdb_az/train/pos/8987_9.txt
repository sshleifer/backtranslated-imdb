I recently rented a DDK, so she remembers hearing about IMDb.com and interested in the premises. I knew very little about both of these bands, but I remember hearing Dandy Warhols live and enjoyed it, "If you have not been the last casual person in the world." <br /> <br /> Because I found something incredible about this movie, there is no need for any of these bands to know. The director (Ondi Timoner) did not take time to attract viewers and introduce them to people in this movie. I quickly collapsed in the lives of Anton and Courtney, as well as their compositions, the massacre of Brian Jonestown and The Dandy Warhol. <br /> <br /> Ondn Timoner writes such a documentary. <br /> <br /> I also like how the "story" of these bands is explained. The majority of what you see is tour groups. Both bands are struggling to do so in small places and recording industry. Throughout the film, each group tries to remain unique and unobtrusive for the norm. However, this is a bright prospect that the two bands look like each other, and therefore, how the two belts can go in different directions <br /> <br /> Generally, I will give this idea to everyone who loves the film. You do not need special love for documentary films or compositions. Thank you for the music, but the music itself is back to the love / hatred relationship between Brian Jonestown's massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
