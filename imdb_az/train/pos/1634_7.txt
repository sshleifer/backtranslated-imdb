For the first time in 1981, I filmed the first film at HBO and when I was 15 I thought the movie was exciting. I do not see the images of Alfred E. Neuman in the theater trailers. When MAD Magazine sold the movie and suddenly apologized for the "usual gang" to stop herself, I just had fun, but I was convinced, but I made sure that (and Ron Liebman) They were ashamed, and I was very surprised. There is no doubt that there are worse films for association. Now watching the movie (32 years old) watch the movie with MAD references, I still get a hit. I am a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Poppa County), I think, the crown author of this play (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
