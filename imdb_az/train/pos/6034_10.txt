Last November, I had the chance to see this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it is very entertaining. Several technological errors are burning, which was a great experience. I liked writing and especially the act of the boy playing the lead role. This film has many hearts, many minds. After this film, I had the chance to talk to several filmmakers and they looked nice. All of the film was just a positive experience, and I'm definitely coming to one. The story was entertaining and cool, as with a woman, I had the same problems with the management of many people and that's why we can really understand her problems. The film does a great job of giving people that we can give. Friends in the movie are really well written, they are realistic. I know people like this, I only wish my friends Imy and I can be as cool as these people when talking. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
