Ira Levin's Deaththrap is one of those mystery films in the Sleuth tradition, which will be very easy to spoil whenever any realistic scene of the film is presented. That's why for a game, a famous mystery playwright, another person with a promising writer, a younger and more sexy wife than the playwright's role and a German psychology ride. Director Sidney Lumet, no stranger to cinema, is very good at creating tension in the film's engine. Dialogue is quick, fresh and intelligent. Michael Caine enjoys the same roles as these. Christopher Reeve can serve and actually does more for you. Irene Worth is funny psychologically. How about Dian Cannon? Lumet likes to pack up his posterior in a really tight pants and maybe wear the most powerful peaks in the surroundings, but it's getting worse in that role - an old actress and, of course, a less attractive role. But now, if something does not change, should not he show himself open to a bribe to his followers? Deaththrap is funny, sophisticated, virtuous and highly esteemed. There are some defects in this mystery, and I was not completely satisfied until the end, but under the direction of Linne, I was interested in watching the whole length of the film and interested me with the high code of Caine and Rivi Levin.
