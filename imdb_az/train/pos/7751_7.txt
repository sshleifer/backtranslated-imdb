I liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. Just come on you and use it for the duration of it and do not expect anything. It's like sitting in a cafe-terrace with a beer in the summer and watching people's walk. This is definitely not going to think later, it's true, but there's no condition for a good movie. <br /> <br /> Some days later he was buried several days ago. <br /> <br /> I liked the style or the poverty of this movie. Slick, but fresh and soundtrack is a beauty. <br /> <br /> Every music lover will get out of AWTWB, <br /> <br /> I'll give it to 8. <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10)
