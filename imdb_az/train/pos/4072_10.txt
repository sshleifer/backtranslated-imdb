Hayao Miyazaki's name was prominent with Spitied Away, but the director's first film's efforts are often ignored. Recalls Spielberg headed by Duel or led by George Lucas THX 1138? I remember seeing the fragments of this movie - almost the last 45 minutes of the late 80s and the clash of design and animation that caught me. So when I found a copy in a good store for 9 AZN, I could not resist, but could not buy it. <br /> <br /> The last 45 minutes of the film have been memorably remembered (memory is so funny). <br /> <br /> How to see this movie now with the acquired knowledge of this artistic portfolio. Jean 'Moebius' is a work of art such as Giraud. <br /> <br /> His adventure is really going to happen when the girl falling behind (Sheeta) - Research for Laputa - Jonathan Swiftin refers to the section of Gulliver's Travels ignored. Jules Verne is a bad and sad movie with the final part of these heroes ending with Laputa, giving sound references. <br /> <br /> The most powerful part of my memory - the "pastoral" Laputan's ecological nature has been returned to nature - robots on the slope below the giant tree. This, in my opinion, is the focus of the film - the landscape of Laputa's surface, against the mechanized underground system. <br /> <br /> Even though this film is bi-directional, it is impossible to avoid even the nature of technology - the mockery of the latest robot that glorifies the garden and the animals. <br /> <br /> The silent running movie is almost identical. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Myazaki, Take this movie and save it to your treasure.
