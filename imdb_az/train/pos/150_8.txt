The Spanish film director Agusti Villaronga's latest film explores how children from violence and isolation in remote communities are developing into adolescents who are in need of psychological means to deal with hidden vulnerabilities. Villaron has been successfully exploring how these drugs will affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco, who are fraught with a fanatic level, caring for others, or simply putting on a ma√ßo picture where a woman is involved in prostitution. <br /> <br /> The three witnesses feel that they feel the weaknesses of their peers as long as the two deaths of anxiety or their friends do not meet again in the hospital for those with tuberculosis before and after teens. The kinematic style of the text, as you would expect from the Spanish auteur, is usually visually impressive and is highly reminiscent of heterosexual and homosexual topics with Spanish sexuality issues of Pedro Almodovar. Villaronga, a distinctive element between the two directors, has supernatural guarantees that combine Almodovar with claustrophobic, strange realism against the use of Syurrealism. <br /> <br /> Both styles are similar. There are violence and scenes that are troublesome in young mentality and sexual nature. I have long been advised to watch this movie because there are elements that will remain for a while after watching with the audience.
