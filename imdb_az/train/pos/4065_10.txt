I saw the original English version on the video. The choice of Disney's voice actors seems very encouraging. I do not believe it. The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history of herself. Both are thrown into one of the most entertaining and exciting stories in the animated film. The quality of the animation is excellent! If you see Disney Kiki's delivery service, you'll see the quality of their production. This is almost the same as Kimba has stolen a white lion's story. (but not so much!) Finally Miyazaki movies are released properly! I can not wait to see Nausicaa's unpacked English version!
