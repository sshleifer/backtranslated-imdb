Before watching English films, I always did not trust it because I usually found them from unusual and boring scenarios (for example, Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with a magnificent design, European landscapes and artistic value bold English vectors that capture movies to show that they do not have it. Fortunately, the "Young Victorian" is not the perfect film, and is an enthusiastic recommendation for an exciting story with its fascinating story, Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and suits and places that make for the film look very unexpected. I also say "unexpectedly" because I usually do not pay great attention to these details. <br /> The "Victorian period" (in my humble thought) was one of the key aspects of contemporary civilization and was not only social, but also scientific, artistic and cultural. I honestly did not know very well about the roots of that era, and perhaps I was very pleased with the simplification of the political and economic events that made up the modern era. Queen Victoria's portraits are not always good and depicted as a young and intelligent monarch, but at least inspired by good intentions. Romantic images of Victoria and Prince Albert were also very interesting, as it is similar to intellects, as well as those sensations that are equally interested in mergers. The only disadvantage I have seen in this film is that the screenwriter Julian Fellowes uses some of the clichÃ©s of romantic cinema in his love movie, which takes some space in his scenario. /> <br /> Young Victoria liked it very much and really was a great surprise. I hope you watch the movie more often by watching this movie: dresses and landscapes are not like supporting an interesting story and it's worth it.
