I first saw this movie five years ago in cables and could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie, story character, characters, setting. As for the meaning of the film, I say this movie is a great movie, but because it should be fantastic. But that does not mean that. Casting is probably best in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Guy, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are cheerful. For those who do not see this I will give you a brief explanation: Four criminals will meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend's friends bank. But when their friend, New Jersey, was arrested by two police officers who were pushing him, they tried to find out what had happened, and all hell remained empty. The film is really a great bank gatekeeper comedy and just like the poorest version of Oceans Eleven, four criminals who can not stand alone and Montana, not Las Vegas. All I want to laugh is that I'm forced to see this movie.
