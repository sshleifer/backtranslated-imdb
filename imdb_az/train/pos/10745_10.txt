At first grossly miserable, James Hanlon tries to fulfill the description of the day's work and events. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible movie that I can not watch without my tears in my eyes. I am an Englishman from London, but I love New York and visited many times before and after Sept. 11. This is the second home for me, and I can not help destroying my life, but also part of a beautiful city. This is a real deal, everything around has been destroyed along with firefighters. I am delighted with the images to show people what the day is like. It is a shame that people who jump to these buildings are not used to it because their friends are so much of their memory that the future generations must be included to show how terribly it is. <br /> <br /> Constitutional theories can go to Hell in this way.
