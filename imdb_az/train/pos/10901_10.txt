This is probably the best document I've ever seen. It was Jonny Kennedy and is still a tragic amazing inspiration. He survived the death of one of the most painful diseases in the world, and he used the beauty to show the world how to reach people and not to give up their love. His heart was stuck in his long waiting time. Listening to his clever donkey and seeing his beautiful gestures were heartbreaking. And her smile could not be seen. I feel blessed for being able to be touched by this little giant. If you have a chance to watch this movie, think of your lucky chance to meet Johnny Kennedy.
