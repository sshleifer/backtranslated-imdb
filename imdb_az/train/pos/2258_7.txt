I think Sarafina is a great effort by Whoopi Goldberg. In addition, there are no other stars in the film and its role is smaller than the name of Sarafina. I think this is an important film to show South Africa's apartheid history since I was working at a school with urban children. Sarafina is a film about Sarafina's relationship with education and teacher. I took the video for nothing on our video. I was watching it and transferring it with fast music. But I come violently to understand this film for educators and students. Now, I do not know other actresses and actresses in the film, I think they are very popular in South Africa and I love playing a small role with a South African player and crew except Goldberg. People would have seen this movie, Whoopi had reached world-class protests.
