Generally, the plot was better than I expected. The laughing path was sometimes a bit annoying and inclined to be on the road; At the same time, there were quite real realities in this episode. My biggest surprise was finding one of the best lines and the circumstances did not fit in. Especially Spade was not presented at the best light on previous promotions, but his character looks pretty good on the pilot. Almost everyone has enough eyesight to enjoy, and all the regular characters come to work before them. Now, if writers live up to the start.
