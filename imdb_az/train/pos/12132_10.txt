Leslie Howard's performance is very pleasant. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a straight, uninteresting character. One would apologize for this person; But I welcome Bette Davis' Mildred. Female Davis gives her best performances (she was awarded the Academy Award). Thanks to his performance, he brings this lyrical film to life. ** Do not miss out when Mildred tells Philip exactly how he feels.
