This is one of the best Bugs cartoons, in addition to the "Hare Tonic", is one of the Best Bugs. In these animated films, Bugs has a "basic" meaning, and there are some explanations that still mean that they are not fully developed. In fact, I prefer this "basic" version of the mid-40s (Chuck Jones' best version). It's actually more fun than the rabbit size and the long legged version that flew through Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The last days bugs were so suave and complicated for my love. Also check out the "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones samples.
