When I was a little girl (and my dad had a video shop), this was one of my favorite films. Since then, I have not heard a lot and did not remember anything about it, it was forgotten by Don Blut, probably after the better films. A few weeks ago, I was able to watch it and still enjoyed it. The animation created in New Orleans in the 1930s is gratifying and the songs are unforgettable. If you look tough enough, there are a few goofs in durability, but in general, they are not limited to the story line that leaves you smiling (and even a bit of a glamorous, animal lovers). The heroes are convincing (perhaps even for some younger observers). For those who do not have two paws and for some time, you should definitely look again.
