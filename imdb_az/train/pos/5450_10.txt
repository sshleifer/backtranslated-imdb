Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She's a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a somewhat fragile mountainous city. He sells to men. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Just starting from the 71-minute version, but it is quite extreme. Nowadays it is very nice. The film is moving very fast and there are tons of sexual innuendo tones - some of them come today very nice (but fun). In 1933, there was no such thing as you can move so quickly. There is nothing classic or monumental about it - this is a very funny surprise movie. It just ends with a bit of "moral" ending the scenario. It is incredible and stupid (I saw in a theater and the audience laughed at it - a man totally "in no way") I'm just a different, somewhat tragic and much better than 75. This version was missing until 2004 when it was discovered incorrectly! I think that only those released - but be aware. <br /> <br /> A good player is Stanwyck, and he plays WAY on top. He believes he is a tyrant and enjoys sleeping around. There is also a supportive performance from the beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent. Look at John Wayne, a humble-like, humble and soft office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I'll give it a 9.
