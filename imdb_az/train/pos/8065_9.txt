Maybe because I was looking at the history of Irish troubles in the 1920s and then looking into the sad Civil War entering the Free State after signing the contract before watching this movie. Anyway, when I turned around, my eyes were tearing. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen is not as popular as it is today and must be remembered better. In this film, I think, he plays himself without his native talents and brains. For example, the scenes that a friend in the congregation challenged to fight him may well be reminiscent of McLaglen as a world-class bare knife, as in previous years. John Ford is partly responsible for this; The IMDb trivia section shows how to deceive McLaglen to get a really bad scratch for the scene. This director could have brought too much of his actors without such tricks. Basically, though, McLaglen plays almost entirely blotto (an actor is hard to believe), and plays with strong and emotional power Gypo Nolan, he is not surprised to be the only one. Then McLaglen He saw "Silent Man". In particular, I distinguish between this role and the clearer control that IRA man and the IRA man Denis Hogan gave in the "Cinderella's House". <br /> <br /> Of course, the "Quiet Man" is McLaglen's country that is controversial with the IRA. Victor McLaglen, in the old sense of the word, was great and strange, but he was a good actor and has a wide and wonderful nuance that we can not expect from such a person today. <br /> <br /> Ford, as usual, spends a lot on a movie. All the characters are very good (although the majority of the team is overwhelmed by America's lack) - Note: there are pre-spoilers! - Gypo once shot a short straw and was ordered to kill a man, but knowing that he was allowed to go out, we must really empathize with a short straw to execute Gypso. especially when they go to Gypo in the Mary's room. <br /> <br /> John Ford really showed his genius here, and could have been a terrible and unpredictable result for the whole story, and instead of using Gypo and other symbols to utter unexpected, but very satisfying end to us , when tortured in poor Ireland.
