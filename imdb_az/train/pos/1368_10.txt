Okay It's something I love since I was 14 years old. It seems to me that I have not been watching for over a year now, but ... It's not a movie for an older generation who wants a deeper meaning or a striking message. This movie is FUN. This is pretty dated, almost passse, but Parker Posey is very bright, which is incredible. If you want to be attractive with Tiffany's 90th-star breakfast, Parker, who takes part in the 90s or likes it, is for you. Otherwise, do not worry.
