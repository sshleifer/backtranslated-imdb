Another hip witness, Antonioni, was more likely to "blow up" this time on the other side of the Atlantic. Young people, like critics and youths, did not succeed. Why? Perhaps because Europe is not a US business and has a full picture of stereotypes that it is not old. (Revolutionary students are primarily embarrassed). <br /> <br /> Maybe when the big blockbuster films were released, and especially those targeted at the youth market, it's history. The hills in the deserts would look fresh if they were released a year ago ... A very interesting film, shot in a very beautiful scene with many scenes and Antonionian scenes, the love structure in the desert, the tranquility of the desert settlements and the explosion ... Two amateur armies did not help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is relatively better than Daria Halp. It would be better with the right actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a youngster Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is really pretty ridiculous and strange, and you know the lines will be delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very intersting document in the late 1960s, photography and sound It looks like an eye for hair.
