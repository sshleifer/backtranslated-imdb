All the talents showed Mr Sooraj Barjata in the first 3 films, and I thought it was all an accident because it was as bad as its fourth prem.kiwani hoon. But I have to say that there is no accident. This man is talented and his way to Vivah is just brilliant. At the first stage it affects you. The sequence of martyrs and amethysts is intense. The chemistry between these two actors gives the impression of the kajol. A good and loving father is also fantastic as the usual Alok Nath, Anupam Kher. But the Shahid-Amrita movie. The martyr does not look for a young man to marry, but he is a shy, but morally strong groom's good work, but he looks good on the stage. this film will be loved by those passing through such beautiful moments in their lives. All in a brilliant movie. Mr Sooraj hits Barjatya ...
