It was a fascinating comic comedy with a huge castle. John Ritter and Katey Sagal sounded perfectly as parents and the children were also very large. Kaley Cuoco, Bridget, a toned-down version of Kelly Bundy, is a good choice to play. Writing and performances were both first-rate. Unfortunately, John Ritter died in a series and put a damper on everything. They had to climb to show the show and bring more cast members, and of course it was an uncomfortable situation, but they managed well. James Garner was a good addition. <br /> <br /> <strong> Ritter could have lived longer. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the guest when they brought Ed Edwards. That was great. <br /> <br /> ***
