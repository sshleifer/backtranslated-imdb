While revealing that Hacettin's wife is pregnant at the restaurant next to the lake, there are those who realize that James Earl Jones is a waitress. I watched this movie in a video I was filming on television. When I watched this scene, I thought of Jones's voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. When the camcorder was pulled back and the waiter showed up, I pulled the tape back. When Hagarty appears, the waiter says she laughs or has a baby, then looks closer, or slows down the scene when the camera's waiter appears quickly.
