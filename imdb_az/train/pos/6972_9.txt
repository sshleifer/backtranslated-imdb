Caprica Episode (S01E01) works well as a pilot. Indeed, this episode is the same content as the DVD pilot. Episode 01 provides a very important background from the very popular Battlestar Galactica series (both original and re-created in 2007). It attaches great importance to the 2007 series. As in previous fantastic philosophy areas, this series explores the "virtual" life or environment. Moreover, we are dealing with Adam's family line because they have no connection with Cylons' creator in the Battlestar Galactica series. For the most part, this first episode is about the subject of "virtual" life and about the famous topic of the birth of colonies (Cylons) (as expected). <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, I am very pleased with this episode. Although this is not the newest version of the Caprica pilot's version of DVD, it seems to me that the series looks very encouraging. As with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with the sequence of a crowd, so that one audience (the philosophy of science) is pursued. I will continue to advancement with determination as well as development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
