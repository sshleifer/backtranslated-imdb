The structure of the film, its magnificent performance, the script, the melancholy, the bittersweet atmosphere, the superior direction - what can I add? See if it is not just one of the most heartwarming, beautiful, boring scenes. This Christmas man and Frank Morgan character (shop owner - Mr. Matuschek) ends his marriage and attempted suicide. He invites them to the Christmas dinner, as each of his employees leaves. Everyone and everyone politely turned him down. Everyone has plans for their Christmas home. At this stage there is deep sorrow for this moving scene. Frank Morgan performs his career and this scene makes me tears easily. Fortunately, we are delighted with this very special area. The new employee, the errand boy, is the last to go to the store with a beautiful snowy street scene. Unfortunately, Mr. Matuschek approaches this guy and asks him to spend the evening with him, he will treat all this wonderful Christmas dinner, because this guy never saw! Like Mr Matuschek alone and somewhere they could have a wonderful Christmas meal. Whenever I see this scene, it moves me every time. Want to look at the great trailer with Frank Morgan, whom you know as Mr Matuschek, and to take the look of the film's talented Ernst Lubitschin. This movie is full of joy.
