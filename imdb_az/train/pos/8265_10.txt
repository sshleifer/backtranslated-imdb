Only the name of this movie wanted to see what I liked, so I was composed early in the AM movie. If you see how miners pass through in the early days, and you see the mines cut off in men, you see a dramatic scene. The film wants to show that Germany and France can and should be together after WW I, and the Germans have come to the aid of many French miners in the lack of French culture. The actors, along with the horse, were unusual scenes within the mine and a young young man working on the mine. There is an old old retired miner who banned from the merdivan down the mine when the elevator was broken. In fact, if there's a movie shot, this is a movie that you do not want to miss.
