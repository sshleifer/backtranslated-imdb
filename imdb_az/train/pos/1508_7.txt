This film is good and unpretentious; I do not want to watch it twice: I'm the companion of Peter Cushing and so I watched him. The best asset of this film is BREVITY and EVENT. Compared to other similar films, each of the four (plus one) segments takes 30 minutes, but does not run away from the foot even though it passes through the last 10. In the first segment, the writer, who was terrified of the "writer's block," evolved to evolve into an old home. When he starts seeing one of his so-called charges, he finds a lot. Similar tiles like PREMATURE BURIAL. The good use of the point of view is that the writer's mental illness ... or (in the end) his cupmate wants to play with her husband's phobia to grieve her and grieve her property. <br /> <br /> Two long lost friends in the second segment come together in this lonely old house, but can help to visit a strange horror. Once in the museum there was a statue with a statue of lost youth for a long time for their youths. <br /> <br /> <strong> I learned from the Gothic museum goalkeeper that a female murderer who died was a murder killer who died ... or he? <br /> The third segment was less interesting to me. <br /> <br /> Fourthly, a horrific film actress shows that she thinks the best of the lowest-cost C movies is deep. When she looks for a suit for her fictional vampire, she comes to a real deal. In this segment, the first two are not reliable. <br /> <br /> The actor is fair, the two main segments, the majority of it. A good film, made with salt grains. The best Cushing, nor Lee ... but you have to watch.
