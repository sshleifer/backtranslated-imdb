It would work better if it was done in Malta, Mitchell. At least, we could guard Joe Don Baker, who fled around the Mediterranean Sea, another scene covered with this attractive cowboy outfit, to keep telling us that he would not function as an old Western weapon. If Mitchell was to be Mitchell, the film would not be afraid of free police brutality. He is excellent. At least the funny comments of Mike and Bots made this favorable price as an episode of MST. But I can not follow it with it.
