Beautiful Albanian Ronald Clement is featured here as well as in several films. He is in the real sense of the word on every stage, and this comic movie is fresh, though. Played perfectly by Anna Lee - her browsing, her favorite wife is a step ahead of her, she is beautiful, witty and very clever. Based on the French movie, this farce brings all the good qualities. Most supportive actor, at least if it is not a name ... and it's perfect for a very funny movie. Fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable when it's a step ahead of other characters. Its multi-storey talents can be evaluated in the classic "Lost Horizon", where each film is to be seen.
