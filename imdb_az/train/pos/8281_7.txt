At the first stage, I was excited. "I can tell you this could be wonderful!" I thought. I imagined that it was so good that I did not fall into the lives of these peoples. The music was very gloomy. The area has started with a sudden event and then progressed towards a fate (which may be part of it). <br /> <br /> In some cases, in many cases, it has become one of many countries. <br /> <br /> So, then fireworks begin and when you know, the loans are rolled off. "YES?!!!" My wife and I were all night and night. If you understand the director's intentions, the end of the corner becomes logical (see for a long time what's happening in the movie, see Larry Fessenden with a very interesting and exciting interview), but I can not say that. Less than 10 minutes could be solved with less material. Anyway, it's too bad. It could do all the difference in the world for ten minutes. (But for those who do not write or have not filmed, you should know that there is a great deal of pain on the pen by preparing a story story at one time and I do not give any criticism from any king!) <br /> <br /> Wendigo me as a masterpiece it feels. However, straw, I would like to have a blunted masterpiece on a piece of shark that has already been filled with numerous digital effects (like most horror movies in many days). <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some of the scenes of the monster were afraid of me or did not make me laugh. I can not explain it, but Monty Python felt like a monster with a monster. Though it may sound like a terrible criticism for a fright film - I do not know yet worked in some crooked way for me. Never again will I look at the purple bellies! :)
