Lars Von Triers Europa is a very good film. What is? Von Trier had a very stylized way of explaining a story, at least with Europa. Even though I was on a small television screen, the whole movie was an experience for me. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the vast majority of films in the top 250 films. I think it is perhaps the most scary, most gothic and full movie around. Everybody has good things, but this is the most favorite thing for me. The final scene is one of the most popular scenes.
