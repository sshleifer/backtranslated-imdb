Who would have thought that such a dark film would be unhappy and invulnerable? I'm sorry. More and more people are shameless. As always, I liked Hans Zimmer's account. And Bernard Rose's directorial debut! Nevertheless, can I say this is a fright film? It can be argued that it is easily a fantasy or a drama. Well, no matter, regardless of the potential of my thinking. Everything that Anna (performed by Charlotte Burke) and everybody's life is a real confrontation in life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lantern, and so on. Many details that make the film so good is for re-viewing. Hopefully, soon enough, I'm facing another emotionally-charged and psychological film.
