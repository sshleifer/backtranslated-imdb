This is my favorite movie, and I've been in the stage for several times, so I'm always in my favorite music and I doubt that everyone will be able to re-create Oliver Twist's story on the screen. <br /> <br /> For all my time the most beloved '' bad guy '', Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. She was scared when I looked at the age of six, but now as a woman, I can empathize with the character of Nancys, she is a bar girl / prostitute who helps Olivera win her life. <Strong> Jack Wilde was fantastic as an art dodger and I do not think anyone can ever go out - cell phone picker and Fagin's best friend. The music is fantastic, especially Fagin's numbers, and I am very grateful to Bill Sikes for not giving them a musical number, so we did not have that bad character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did a great job of Nancy's sticky end, and she took a G movie by hiding her beat, but she was far enough away to show Bill's violence. <br /> <br /> This film is both charming and charismatic, and also plays music, and plays a role as a moving drama that encourages a young boy to find a place to live.
