I do not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why are they so bad and so on? Think? There is nothing worse than anything else. Personally, I think the Soldier is a great movie, and it's better than most other films in the same genre. <br /> <br /> Why are I looking at Soldier as: Kurt Russell, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects and leadership (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> Even I think it's the best thing I've ever seen before with Paul Anderson, a fun directing director. "Mortal Kombat" and very entertaining "Event Horizon".
