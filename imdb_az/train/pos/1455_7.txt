Mardi Gras: It's a beautiful movie that shows how many of the two cultures in China are so common, but not aware of the impact of each society on each other. David Redmon opens your eyes and allows Chinese workers to see how the beads sold in America cost about $ 20 dollars. When Redmon asked the Americans where these beads were, they seemed to have no clue and that thirst was visible. When they told them that they were doing little in China with terrible reparation and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed to be sad, damaged and a bit stubborn, but did not seem to stop buying beads after finding the truth. When asked by Redmon workers, Americans did not know that they were wearing their necks and that they were paid too much for these beads. The workers laughed and did not believe their purpose behind the ladder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, which allows us to think about ourselves in other countries as well. <br /> <br /> M.
