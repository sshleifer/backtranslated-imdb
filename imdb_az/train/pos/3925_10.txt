Undoubtedly, Mr. Young Lincoln, one of the masterpieces of John Ford, was practically ignored when he was first released, because in 1939 most of the greatest films in all cinema history, West in the mythical genre, John Ford's turn stage Stagecoach and many others The Wizard of the Wanderer, Mr. Smith, Oscar's young Mr Lincoln, is the original scenario. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Ford's masterpieces would be quenched gradually, but in the late 1950's, critics and historians from America and Europe captured a note written by the legendary Russian director Sergey Eisenstein about Mr. Lincoln, if only he would direct any American movie that he had prepared so far, he would definitely be John Ford's younger Mr. Lincoln. Critics, influenced by such an undeniable choice of Eisenstein, have begun to see the film again, but with a little different eyes and the film's reputation. <br /> <br /> The life of one of the most legendary American presidents in the United States has never been shown. In the early 1930's, Griffith Ibrahim left MGM in the same year as Lincoln and Ford movie, named Abe Lincoln, a John Cromwell Illinois. Reverend was based on many successful Broadway Stage Plays released in 1938 and written by Robert Sherwood. <br /> <br /> As John Ford's films are disturbing, we can find many references to the life and deeds of the mythical Lincoln model, including the 1924 The Iron Horse or 1936 Theaters. The Shark Island Prison, the second, is also used as the favorite Lincoln song Dixie, the main theme of which is Mr. Young Lincoln. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lamar Trotti, written by myths and legends, written by Lamar Trotti. Lincoln's life and legal experience, the highest point of the film and the ultimate laughter and tear-off generator, ended in an exciting, but largely heartwarming experiment, when Lincoln and his mother were brought to trial as a witness to two defendants accused of murder. and the prosecutor's office lawyer, Donald Meekin, demanded that his son prevent his son from being de facto impossible <br /> <br /> According to Mr. Ibrahim Shahbazov, this condemns one another to the death penalty and allows another to live . <br /> <br /> Generally, Henry Fonda is a very subtle, heart-warming, and even funny movie with a great performance in the highly characteristic of Ibrahim Lincol. The richness of other characters, as well as the smaller or larger the beautiful and smart scenarios, are best done by John Ford's genius capabilities in one of the best deliveries. Must be definite for everyone. 10/10
