Stable, strong gangster high Frankie Diomede (always incredibly firmly in the form of always awesome Lee Van Cleef) sent himself to jail, and thus denied the detention of a treacherous character. Fawning's goofball is busted at the little time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (a portrait of Tony Lo Bianco). Frank and Tony are creating a tough friendship behind bars. Helps Tony Frank to come out and helps his quest for revenge on a rival band of mobsters, led by the merciless Louis Annunziata (played by Jean Rochefort). Written by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, director Michele Lupo describes the tidy story at a steady pace, keeps it completely flawless, but sometimes lightened, and significantly reduces the mobility of the moving set pieces (a horrible and long lasting mondo deck of a jailed jail certain degree of excitement as the degree of follow-up). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco demonstrate beautiful, empty and attractive screen chemistry; The relationship between their characters is funny and inviolable in turn. Crazy Edwige Fenech is given lots to do like Tony's sad girlfriend Orchidea, but at least a very highly appreciated free nude shower scene becomes naked in his insanely beautiful and delightful body. Riz Ortolani's groove, drum, slang funk / jazz score, of course, is replaced by soulfully swing. It is similar to polished cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti. Very stylish and entertaining little victory.
