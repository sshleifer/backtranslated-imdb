This is one of those unique scary movies that require more understanding of the word "horror". The main thing is that people do not realize that this story is from a small child perspective and that they are easily frightened as with the youngest children. Basically, he just does not understand things, so why his father is in a difficult situation. While watching the movie, you can easily understand her husband's wife and his wife's family life, but not a little boy. As it was built at the start of the movie, a boy who thinks that the family is from the city can imagine the fear of the tree. Also, initially, when a family goes home after a deer smoke, then dispute with the local people, and the little boy, of course, does not seem to welcome the tree. <br /> <br /> Wendigo is the result of a young, innocent mind ready to explain all this. There is an American Hindu legend, but when you hear the story of a young boy, you can tell it openly and simply to the scene. It's not just what Wendigo really is, but because he does not understand it. In this regard, when you look at the movie, you really can begin to evaluate it. Obviously, it was low budget and cheap, but hopeless assemblies, light use and eeriness are generally more. And he asks the last question of the film: Is it all in your head, or is it there? 8/10 <br /> R: Rufat, swearing, violence and sex scene
