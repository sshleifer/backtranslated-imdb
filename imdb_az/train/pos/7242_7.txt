1933 seemed to be a great year for rows (eg, "duck soup"), and although it is cautious with the bridge, it is a good fit. The sound, like a jokeous piece from The New Yorker, begins with the movie "Goings on the City" of that magazine, respectively. The only thing is casting. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would be perfect. But after 1934, you did not engage in such sophisticated fashion, elegance, youthful and beautiful Loretta Young's listening to some crazy and neat attire or a bridal suit. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you still want to check out a rare example of the Hollywood line.
