Brockedown Palace is a story of two good friends, Alice and Darlene, who went on a spontaneous journey to Thailand and taken to prison after being caught with drugs planted in their luggage. Thus, the film had the potential to become a serious and moving film like "Return to Paradise," but instead chose to focus on the girls' status and more friendships. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both make excellent performances, and the film is more than just a mutual relationship between them - asking and testing questions of doubt, jealousy, friendship, and ultimately sacrificing the name of friendship. <br /> <br /> This film chooses to be too deep into politics and even turn into a bit of jealousy in prison life, and it pays more attention to friendship issues. <br /> <br /> There were several space holes in here, and some parts just incredible or invisible. We have not felt the fear or hopelessness of their condition. We take very little of life outside the walls of the prison, Bill Pullman plays a so-called lawyer who really has a golden heart. In short, it should be a darker film than all rights. <br /> <br /> But in general, I loved it. The act was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the story turned out to be fairly twisted and interesting. It's worth seeing.
