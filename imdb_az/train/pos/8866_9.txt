"COSBY", in my opinion, hit a spectacular CBS! I have never seen any episode, but I am not sure, but still I am very pleased. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. I also liked the theme song very much. If you ask me, I like everyone, though it would be nice if Madeline Kahn was not killed in the show run. That's because I always wondered how the show would be. Everyone has always exhibited a good performance, the design of the design was spectacular, the suits were well-prepared, and the writing was always strong. As a result, it can be seen in TBS, although it is advisable to catch it for good weather.
