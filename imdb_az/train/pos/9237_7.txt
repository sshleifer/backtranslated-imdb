This movie is very good. Half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original film. I've seen the series and it's a good movie, but here's a Living Legend, part1 and 2, and "Fire in Space." They were the same as the first movie, but with other episodes. But still a very nice movie. The only end is strange (you do not see what happens with Pegasus). But I still think that's pretty good. Actors and special effects were good. If you do not see, let's see him. Player: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
