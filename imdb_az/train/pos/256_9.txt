I did not go to the movie and did not see this movie as they were aware of the bad reviews and how bad they were by their comrades. Now, after reviewing the DVD, I'm sorry. I say it's brilliant, but I want to say that it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> After looking at some of the movies, I am very pleased. When you read the actual story behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a big difference between the fact and the fictional description. I do not think Ganghis Kahn was once depicted as far away from the historical fact. Ned Kelly was really a topic of discussion and looks pretty passionate. Despite the efforts of governments and some historians, Ned Kelly became a legend. Legends are stories and stories tell a lot about those who speak and listen, as with the actual figure itself. Ned Kelly has become such a popular personality because he does not admit or accept the aspect of Australian culture. <br /> <br /> So, this does not expect the historic holiday of the Kelly gang, and I find it really strange. an inefficient and refreshing movie. It was emotional and romantic, but with gratitude, nowhere else could it be a cat; For my fellow Australians, follow the "Lighthorseman" and I'd like to say what's wrong with the story's bad treatment. Perhaps the affair might have been canceled in some other ways, such as the withdrawal of soldiers. Considering the fact that the film was actually I was glad, because it would have been the focus of Ned's story. <br /> <br /> This film is the story of a story that has always been discovered by reading different ideas from different historians. <br /> <br /> This movie has always been a difficult time for the global movie market (to pay for pills) and the legend as for Australians; Maybe a bit of Ned is in this movie, because I think it rebelled against people's expectations and, unfortunately, missed both goals. Fortunately for a delightful tune of a movie. For me it was an unexpected movie about Ned and so I liked it. The performance of Orlando Bloom also did a lot for the movie - he really added something. <br /> <br /> As you might imagine some of the movies, you need to reconsider your mind. Send me this time to the CD, at any time from Croc Dundee or Snowy River.
