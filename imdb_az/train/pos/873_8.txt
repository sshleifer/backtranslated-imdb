I do not expect this movie very much and watched it without knowing it. I liked it. Very horny, greedy, deaf girl and old fraternity is an interesting hook and a very good, intense plot at a pace that goes through things without hurry. <br /> <br /> More than a filmmaker, a better movie is a very rich and incredible arreté. <br /> <br /> The only thing that he did not work was the ugly, ugly girl who was neither ugly nor greasy - healthy, of course, and evil, but so much of the face that he always took the screen. Perfect. I want it to be better in the film than generally. For a while, I saw Gilles' wife and a piece of mustache, both of which looked like a stream, and I saw the De Battre mon coeur s'est arreté and, of course, the trash. It looks like it's a little too late, so I can pass my finger.
