I am amazed at how little work is done in the Columbine Massacre movie. There is no very stunning documentary document. Fortunately, Ben Coccio and Gus Van Sant, who directed ZERO DAY, managed to do the same amazing elegant. In two different cases, the true cause of the massacre is always a mystery, the ultimate fantasy of the two killers, ultimately a surprising and inexplicable thing, and that they are actually driven out to turn them into fantasy, turned into a terrible reality. ZERO DAY, which is composed of video tapes, prepared by shooters and found after the incident, is totally riveted. Even if you know where to go, you still believe that you will not "go there" ... and the tension in the last minutes of the film is terrifying. The film is wise from scratch, from scratch to author (although not native, although very spontaneous). ZERO DAY, which disturbs me, has only one aspect. Okay, so we will not be able to figure out what the shooters are doing, but of course one of the participants was ANGER. But these kids will not really be angry. They can say that they can show some things, but in reality they did not convince me that there were things that forced me to kill innocent people. But it still tells me why "???" Director Coccio wants me. Anyway, if you rent or buy this movie, it will slip for you and stay with you for a long time. The BLAIR WITCH people just wanted these guys to want to succeed in a fictional documentary.
