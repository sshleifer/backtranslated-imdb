Science Street 6: Freddy's Dead Screens, this movie, stands for anyone who thinks that the series is old and shows everyone who wants to stop seeing it, or those who want their heroes (or Villian). <br /> <br /> This movie begins with Parody of the Wizard of Wizard, Then only Springwood, the last child in Ohayo, comes out of Freddy and you see a child named John Dove. A boy in a hospital / place to eradicate the children's feet meets this guy, and at the same time there is a dream about a secret person hiding in a tower and mind, goes to Springwood to understand his vision of fear, and soon he realizes that Freddie is a child and we know that sooner or later Freddy's daughter will be able to get some kind of homeowner just because of Springwood. There is also fear. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have a nail to the head of everything you want to know. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Rosenne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and many young Breckin Meyer, who saw the flower's psychic vision and the Iron Butterfly's "In-a-Gadda-da-vida" A young stoner who plays Mario parody. This movie will either hate it, or more like Krueger. The best of the best.
