The only reason why people keep screaming about this film is the fact that a few parts of the story have not been "changed". What is it? Peter Jackson's film was also a perfect definition. Good enough. This is a very nice movie. Backgrounds are beautiful and taken from famous Tolke artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (at Ring of Fellowship and Helms Deep at "Two Towers") and moves at a good pace. Sound casting is the top of a puzzle and most of the characters resemble those of them. Samwise is a bit ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks AWESOME. The film has a great record of supporting the film exactly. <br /> <br /> As noted several years ago, according to Peter Jackson's tradition, the Scholar Ralph Bakshi (Jakson has repeatedly said how much he praised Baker's efforts) holds the same arm.
