As I distinguish with many IMDb interpretations, some reviewers require intelligent intelligence to be intelligent in every film they see. I'm not one of those guys. If you watch a motion picture, I want to see explosions, shooting and heroism. If I watch a comedy, I was laughing in my eyes. You think. So when watching a movie, I want to be afraid of it first. The Grudge is a very intimidating film, but also executing good 'jump' scenes and it's a creepy image. For many years, I've been an admirer of the fear film, and I'm talking about artists like Dario Argento, but the treadmills used by these days are not the heads of young horror flies. If you're frightened, watch this movie. The original Japanese is afraid that it is a "Ring" (I also think it's a big movie).
