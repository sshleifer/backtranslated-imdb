This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I will never really wait for anyone to "get it", but I'm glad when I suggest it, and someone loves it. My father's father was Arthur Askey, but this movie was really delighted and his enthusiasm for the "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted Olmes" was transferred to me as a child. Years later, I am watching everything, enjoying acquaintance. I'm surprised that they will not always be the same, but I'm never disappointed. There are so many things to enjoy. While Askey and Murdoch continue to irritate an arrogant male passenger, the lineup is really inspirational. Later, all parts of the station are very strange, so I have to keep going. Yes, he is dated and emphasized and emphasizes that he is full of Britons (based on the original game by the grandfather's army, Arnold Ridley!), But also includes beautiful signs - Kathleen Harrison. The atmosphere is deceptive as an Arthur Askey. DVDs are as cheap as the UK, so treat yourself. It is a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or a lazy daylight light toy part of any day. <br /> <br /> PURPOSE GOALS WILL BE ACTIVELY!
