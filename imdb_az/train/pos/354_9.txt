A model model dating from primary school is attacked by San Francisco women by threatening them suddenly by sending strange Valentine's Day cards. Who is the murderer and why then is there a murderer? <br /> <br /> My rating often changes to the next look of a movie - sometimes a bit higher, sometimes a bit lower. But I can not remember a movie that has changed dramatically as it is for Valentine's. For the first time, after the release of theater, I thought it was terrible - I gave him a grade of "F" from 10 to 4. When watching for the second time last night, I can not remember things that I do not like about it. I can only accept that I'm really in a mood to follow, or maybe I could not get it. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I liked it this time by giving a 10 to 9 or an "A". <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous to say that she did not shoot a movie. something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy / horror. In 1998, director of the Urban Legend, Jamie Blanks, became popular in the late 1990s after Scream (1996) and pushed many elements into one notch, deliberately delusional / almost absurd point (absurdism was a positively stylized period to the ground). Moreover, he gives a film imbued with humorous interpretations about romantic relationships. This humor is an unusual thing, and sounds like an exaggerated aspect of young fear. <br /> <br /> The majority of the scenes in the film and the modesty of the ghosts, whether enthusiastic or not, depend on the theme of Valentine's Day. <br /> <br /> Many viewers are likely to have different clich√©s, but notable scenarios and plot developments have been deleted. However, the movie about the above is intentional stereotype, unbelievable and ridiculous. Gaps, like satirizing eros, try to overcome typical teen slasher by disguise genre conventions / spoofing (and more success). It's a joke to ridicule a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an inappropriate touch throughout the film, and it's the main thing to do, besides her, for the Valentine's conscious lamponging. Scream had a horror-like purpose, but the film was "well-known". Valentine's Day intentionally recognizes himself; viewer should rely on contextual tips for satire. "I read a lot of movies," she said, in her interviews, "they did not want to make another slasher movie after the city's legend" and producer Dylan Sellers. <br /> <br /> Other viewers are different from the likely source of the Valentine's Day, Tom Savage's novel, the same novel. The symbols, the setting, and the structure of the novel are very different from the film. Sellers said, "Although it's a nice book, I did not think the movie was a true story," he said. Instead, it was used as a motive to make changes to a story of fear / tension on Valentine's Day, the novel, the starting pad, which is more serious in drying and tonight. Although these facts do not help people who are familiar with the book as a movie, it is helpful to understand why the film has a different plot and relationship. <br /> <br /> It is better to look at the film as an independent organization with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> The direction of the blanks is unable to see. Valentine's Day, combined with intricate, deep colors, exciting sets and good preparation, is a completely watery look. The gaps appreciate that it is not too dark, with its acts of animosity and offensive behavior. He also manages his actors with aplomb, often catalyzing slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz, like Adam Carr, takes part in many funniest moments. <br /> <br /> Valentine's Day is a film that is strongly prone to a very good fear / tension film, though no masterpiece. If you watch something more often, you will appreciate it more.
