Yes, I love another great Muppet movie and all; characters, movies, TV show episodes (best comedy or musical television show) and all the artists behind. But here's a rare fatal mistake here, and of course, I'm talking about a strange end! <br /> <br /> I think it's important to be involved in American drama and end her relationship with marriage! We feel free or perhaps lonely, like all poor viewers, who are concerned about themselves, lack of poverty and anger! So all of us are Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, and so on. So enjoy these stories, which collect 2 favorite heroes as a couple in love without legitimate bonds So you feel safe, tranquility and peace with the previous couples and all they love. Therefore, when you look at the creators of this movie, you will come to me many times! <br /> <br /> They were married to the most frightening, most frightening (Miss Piggy) evergreen creatures (Kermit)! This is a historic change with the American entertainment industry! And from this sudden marriage (even the pitiful frog did not have the time to think or decide!) It was quite normal to negatively affect viewers who refused to believe or refuse to believe. . It's no surprise when you know that this film is a serious sinematic failure of up to 25 million, 65 million won (Muppet Movie 1979) five years ago! <br /> <br /> Just in Manhattan and I have been resting in this movie!
