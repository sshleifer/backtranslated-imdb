I recently enjoyed seeing the Great Bad Swim in Ft. The Lauderdale Film Festival and I have to say that it is the best film I've ever seen and that is the only inspirational film to post a comment / comment. This film is beautifully oriented and combines a real-life dialogue with a highly effective and inspirational message. Ordinary lifestyles come together in adult swimming classes and become unusual in celebrating the diversity of life. This is illustrated in the first minute of this tempting movie that we see only the feet and bodies of individuals in different shapes and sizes in the pool of water. This movie is focused on the actors as it puts them in attractive scenes that capture your attention and imagination.
