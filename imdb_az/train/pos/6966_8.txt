In general, I was very sorry about the pilot. The first fifteen minutes was worrying because the creators sought to create a science-fiction version of the OC, but this fear fights with the corrected television when it's a terrorist attack and rarely seen the steps taken here. <br /> <br /> BSG was dealing with topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terror, but they were basically subtext. On the other hand, these topics are at the center of the show, and as I look at it personally and wonder how the issues are being discussed, I have found Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as a reference point. I think that I am an admirer of two or other movie / TV shows I've mentioned, and I think you can find at least one thing here. <br /> <br /> As the starting point to explain how we know the situation in the BSG, I believe it has solved it in a very interesting way, especially as Cyllo explains how he believes in God, and the creation of Caprica is highly developed and modern, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Professor of Qafqaz University: "According to Gateson, this is a technology that is apparent in the future, but not as a spectator." <br /> <br /> The only real weak points I've seen are Greystone's parents, "Lacy Rand." I love Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, but their scenes seem like a lack of chemistry, but at this point they may fall down to improve their characters, but this is something I need. I also found it to be unbelievable in the role of Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For the first time, he kidnapped Caprica a few days ago. our future and hopefully the BSG will once again touch the size of what you do.
