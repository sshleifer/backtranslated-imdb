Successful arbitrator businessman Harry Mitchell (Roy Scheider's perfectly stable performance), a sweetheart with a young stripper Cini (perfect Kelly Preston) is an adulterer. Harry's subtler low-hood hoods blackmailed by trio - sleazy porno theater manager Raimy (subtle fine gracious John Glover), antsy strip co-owner Leo (Robert Trebor's well played) and crazed pimp Bobby Shy (fearful intense Clarence Williams III) - Cini Video captured by video. When Harry refuses to pay, the titles kill Cini and Harry did it. This, in turn, is a dangerous mind and struggle between Harry and his titles. Director John Frankenheimer, who has adopted a tough script based on Elmore Leonard's strange criminal triller novel, is constantly moving at a rapid pace, providing tension pressure and effectively creating a solid thirsty environment. With Harry's bitter wife, Barbara, Vanity, the sad prostitute Doreen and Harry's loyal partner, Jim O'Boyle, like Lonny Chapman, have all the good results with Ann-Margret's back tournaments. This intense field keeps viewers on their feet. Jost Vacano's brilliant cinematography, Gary Chang's harsh account, harsh terrifying sound, and striking consequences also apply to money. As an added bonus, Vanity and Preston also take their clothes. You need to check out a very strong and satisfying few.
