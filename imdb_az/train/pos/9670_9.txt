One of the best films I've ever seen is an Irish movie called Philadelphia. I read them before I watched the movie and loved them both. A story from a young man preparing to leave Ireland to leave Ireland. Another young man who has a look at the other characters of the movie, also reflects his perspective and censorship thoughts and emotions. There is a man in the movie who can not be seen by other faces. This is a very sad movie, but it is deeply touched and I would recommend it to everyone who wants to think about this movie. I love almost any Irish movie or Irish movie, and any film from Ireland, such as Ireland's late Irish actor Donal McCann, receives my voice. I'm cheating on the screen for 2 hours and, unfortunately, I have it. Perhaps I lost her as a young man.
