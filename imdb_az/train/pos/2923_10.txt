Eddie Murphy was really laughing at my donkey to show me a comedy show at this HBO. I love his impressions of Mr T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden at "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo was also funny. This was the first time I came out in 1984. I was very laughing, I fell off my back immediately. Now I think this is very funny. <br /> <br /> When Eddie Murphy was on the "Saturday Night Live", she was very happy to be one of the best people to come out of the "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" Eddie Murphy Raw. <br /> <br /> I give the Eddie Murphy Delirious 2 fingers and 10/10 stars.
