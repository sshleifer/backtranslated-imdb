I'm just nothing more in this movie, it was necessary to see it with a movie sold in Boston. From now on, Boston Red Sox / Farrelly supporters have stuck themselves to watch a comedy in a movie theater near Boston Common .... about Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon's star is this beloved comedy about love and lust. Love is between two young ladies. For Red Sox, who won the world of love. Although Fallon is not a big actor, he is the best player in the role. He is quite funny and most laughs. Barrymore on the other hand is also the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I thought that actress Ion Skye would be a better player for the role. In general, all fans of Boston Red Sox will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
