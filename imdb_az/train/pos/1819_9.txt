When I first watched it, we borrowed from our local library a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We were watching again and I liked it more than I did last time! :): () <br /> The film is made up of two dogs, mostly Charlie and Itchy (featured by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half a gangster and a half who loves me. Beching is his sidekick. Charlie was killed by his wife (NOT) and was sent to heaven. <br /> <br /> The fifth cause of this movie is definitely one: One: I love Carfahan (except Carface). My most beloved are Charlie, Itchy, and a girl named Anne-Mari, who came in a little bit later. Two: I love the history of this movie. It is appointed when it is banned in the United States. Three: The Don Bluth animation (as usual) is perfect. Backgrounds are also good. Four: This film, which keeps me on the edge of the armchair, has a strange excitement. Five: These songs are amazing. My favorite song begins with "Brazil is in need of delight" ... <br /> <br /> So watching this beautiful movie will not disappoint! :);) :()
