One of the best Vance movies is preferred by anyone other than Michael Curtis, and he likes the simple direction. This time it was found dead around the hateful general - a locked and bolted bedroom on the upper floor. Fleet Vance, trying to figure out how to end his strike and letting everyone think he is suicidal, announcing the situation when leaving for Italy. William Powell is as fresh as Philo Vance as you can see. It never appears in the press and always says and does. Powell is supported by many talented actors - some of the first-rate actresses and actresses such as Mary Astor, the only Ralph Morgan, the dead man secretary Paul Cavanaugh, who hate her uncle, Arthur Hohl's mysterious butler Helen Vinson, as opponent dog enthusiasts, and caught James Lee's two delicate cracker police detectives, two really good performances, such as the Chinese chef and portrait Eugene Palette. Etienne Girardot is a social comedy-like mix of comedy that always loses your meals. It's a story of twisted and twisted areas of suspects and many areas of the Kennel Murder Case, which creates a fast moving, fun secret.
