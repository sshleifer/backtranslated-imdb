The "Opening Night", launched in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. It only succeeds in Gena Rowlands's truly striking performance. The actress of the theater Myrtle's character is really a person we love in real life. It makes life difficult for those who are self-destructive, frequent, and those around it - in other words, unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of the sediment - although we put it secretly early, we are pretty sure if the demons who are fighting it are real or imagined. Rowlands is, of course, focused on the love of the actress / director John Cassavettes, who plays in the film. This film is not without shortcomings - it's too long and the last part of Myrtle's scene is very intoxicated. In some dialogues, at least on the stage, "improvisation" takes too long. Some supporting faces give a particularly good performance from Myrtle's sleazy producer, Ben Gazarra. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed, and I've never understood what happened in the movie, apart from shaking Myrtle. Just look at this movie for Rowlands - he is interested in all the times and sometimes you can ask, though it is difficult to get out of your eyes.
