I was totally shocked that this show was canceled. Only a year has passed. Just a while ago I started watching it and I love it. Friends were a show where they could go on increasingly. It was humorous and extremely enjoyable. <br /> <br /> There are about two brothers and two sisters living under a roof without their parents. The Kurdish (Joey Lawrence) plays a part of his oldest brother and takes on the role of a father. <br /> <br /> It's been fantastic since it's been a long time since. <br /> <br /> A master show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
