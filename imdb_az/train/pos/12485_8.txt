I just watched this movie and would like to say that I'm sorry. It's very creepy and there are plenty of moments that will jump out of the seat! I had to make some "emergency" cigarettes to calm my nerves! If I criticized, there was almost a lot of jump moments. <br /> <br /> Each new scene has been jammed with a jump, and it has gradually come to the point where you are surprised, because it's the kind of new thing you come up with. <br /> <br /> In these pictures there are virtually every clue in the genre of imagination, all of which have done a great job, as it protects the creepy, fear factor. There were elements for "The Shining", "The 6th Sense" and "The Changeling" (in particular, the soundtrack, The Changeling recalled). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone looking for good old-fashioned fear!
