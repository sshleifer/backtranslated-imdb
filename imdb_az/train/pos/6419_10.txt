This movie is an excellent military film. It can not be a perfect Hollywood movie, but it is unimportant. Hollywood deserves the best of entertainment for good entertainment, but there is no such thing in this movie. Other reviewers found this movie to be too slow for their taste, but what? as a retired Soldier? When the film crew was given two hours and nine minutes, I would appreciate the pace he has been able to tell as much of his story as possible. The story has been described to him a few times and written, but remains for a professional soldier? and an African American? as presented by the film crew and presented by the US Navy to the world. Brashear's Navy Diver is not the only story to be presented as a life story like a Diving Diver in his work outside his vacation. There he also claimed that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear's test diving did not go well in the diving test and a Stripe and change of assignment, claiming that the Master Chef Petty Officer Market was in charge. Also, how Brashear found the third hydrogen bombs he lost in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1950s and how he saved the life of a sailor, if Brashear did not take him off and take the shot himself, both of them. It was a complex story worth telling me, and it was not enough to tell me a full two-hour-long 9-minute story, and I can say that a group of scenes deleted on DVD were trying to explain a story. as accurate as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to explain such a story in such a comprehensive way and I was honored to see such a natural and complete protection of the tradition and honor of the Navy.
