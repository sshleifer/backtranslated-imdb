<br /> <br /> EDMUND LOWE (reminiscent of me to Warren William) drives an exciting little mysterious motion that moves at an incredible speed and moves for less than an hour. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays the unlucky jockey who want to be sidelined by his own death (hypnotism, everyone) and a large number of suspects - Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an added bonus, Nat Pendleton has a dimwit detective - and, moreover, download the decor decoration set for the fancy interior of a rich house. <br /> <br /> It could have been a series used in many films. <br /> <br /> Of course, the mystery is not so difficult that everyone can not follow the plot, so he is not afraid. Detective Philo Vance is one-on-one, and then has a final confrontation with a murderous shouting film that has been strangled for five minutes. <br /> <br /> Travels in a fun and enjoyable way.
