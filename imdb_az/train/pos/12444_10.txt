The Best Modesty Blaise I've ever seen. This is a good pilot for the television series. I even think that Quentin Tarantino is a little "cult" like a magical touch or something. They were very modest, but I lost a lot of Willy Garwin's losses. Although I have read many novels and novels by Peter O'Donnell, I'm not against the contrary. From this wisdom I was amazed at the modesty and childhood. Since 1966, I did not put my expectations at a very high level for a bad film. So I downgraded this movie a bit. But if you love the novels and other stories about Blaise, you should definitely see this one! wait for a follow-up ...
