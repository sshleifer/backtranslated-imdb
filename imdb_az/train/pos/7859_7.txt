However, by 1922, this movie began to show its age. Ms. Compared to other films by Pickford (such as DADDY LONGLEGS, SPARROWS, MY BEST QIRL and SUDS), TESS is freshly available and is not worthy of any Pickford movie ("America's Sweetheart"). <br /> <br /> This film has a very long and complex structure, especially with the release of most of the films of the era, a rich old crank set up a settlement on top of a hill near the river, which hates at the bottom of the hill There are some bad guys, but he can not drive, so he wants to come in different ways to get out of the land, one of his girlfriend's fiancé ends in a tragedy of killing a nation with a polar nation, the father of the old Mary, though innocent. the only witness to the real crime, and the dead man was pregnant! in prison, waiting for the killing of an innocent man and a pregnant woman "family way" afraid of that. <br /> <br /> As the son of Mary, who falls in love krankın There is a ton of film, but it's good to see the movie for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film is superior to some ways. The plot is very intricate, though it is very interesting and cinematography is top-of-the-line. The very latest scene is also pretty sweet. But you can throw a knife in the same way. Mary is very good and very sweet and very attractive, and sometimes the audience can make it a bit difficult. Despite the great job in 1922 (becoming the world's largest star), it is very historic today. This is true for all his films, but that is certainly. <br /> <br /> By the way, Image Entertainment DVD quality is good, though several scenes have been badly damaged - it is very striking considering the age of the film.
