<br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, despite its shortcomings, is a complete masterpiece and a great piece of art. has shown a great talent and versatility as well as creating a pretty good movie and a director of charming movies. For the adult audience, it does not take 1/100 of the credit worth it to save the animation art. If not for the sake of Mr. Baki, I do not believe that animation would be saved from the Disney attack. Moreover, he created a beautiful animated film with the Lord of the Rings, but created a completely new art form - unfortunately it never came out of the ground. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the movie (use live animation images often using animation using different techniques that appear to be used as background images and tinting in smaller tones for frequently blown animation). But I feel that those who complain about it can not simply accept a form of art that goes beyond normal. No, this is not Disney animation. No, this is not a live action. No, this is not "deceiving" - it's a new, interesting, and completely beautiful art form. Such a striking and novelty in this fantastic tale as "The Lord of the Rings" feels totally at home. The use of this technique makes Bakshi's predecessor come to life with the subtleties of the Middle East, especially in the darkness of Tolkien creatures, particularly in Nazgul, where traditional animation or live action is not possible. <br /> <br /> Peter S. Beaglein's scenario (very little, as I understand, early draft by Chris Conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolki's works. Where possible, he uses the novel directly from the novel and feels himself in the world of Baker's. The first book and 3/4 have many tracks to adapt to a 2-hour 15-minute movie, but there is little change in the story line. There was a number of spaces, such as renewal, Galadriel's gifts, Huorns in Hornburg's battle, but still the longest animation feature. <br /> <br /> Leonard Rosenman (for whom) is my favorite taste? as well as Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (his account is well-known in his LotR case). It's bomber and courageous and I want to say it's perfect. He stands as a peak of the orchestra, but joins a new world of symphonic perfection when combined with the film's images. <br /> <br /> Sound actors are a great thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But keep in mind that not to imagine what you are imagining, but to imagine what you have imagined is an adaptive director's task, and Aragorn is made up of a different Native American feeling and looks Boromir Viking inspired in the wilderness. Perhaps, maybe it's not what you are imagining, but I just welcome Mr Bakshi to show you what I've seen. <br /> <br /> One more far-reaching flight to the Ford Series, in my opinion, has been a long time since Priscilla Tolkien has made an important time for the production of costumes for the film. The most delicate arrays for capturing celluloid. The view is not afraid of slowing down a minute's speed and it is possible to build its craft with incredible tension. Bakshi's artistic talent and the incredible work of Tolkien will reach a respectable summit. <br /> <br /> The latest DVD version of Warner Brothers (2001) is missing. Thanks to the endless thanks to the film's broad presentation, the package is strange. How glorious would have been if he had a comment from the author, he saw the 20-minute video released from the liberty of the theater. Another interesting addition could be a collection of animated live action later. At the end of the film, at the end of the film, which is the latest rabbit film, there is a terrible horror in the DVD broadcast. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest tragedy has never happened. Although we do not see the interpretation of Baku's fight against Gondor, Shalob, Faramirin, Doom, and the confrontation of Eowin with Wading Kingdom or Gandalf. We will never praise the Baker's Auditor or the Palatire or the Dead Road. All this is a shame that Peter Jackson's glitz and glitter Hollywood should follow Tolkien's masterpiece of action movies, but even better than any kinematic version <br /> David
