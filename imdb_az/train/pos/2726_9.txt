This movie is there with classics all the time. Music, camera shots and players are very good. Filming in black and white gave him a better look and perfectly finished music like Psycho. The few people who commented on this film were surprised. I guess it's a tough movie. I gave the movie when I was 9 years old. Watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
