LOL! angry, very funny .. was teary. Eddie Murphys's impressions are absolutely clear. The best impression was James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY! Eddie Murphy is about to see how it is now and how it is now, but it does not explain if she does not like the child's language AMA AMAZINCI AND FUNNY .. I've seen it 6/7 times and still have it all the time .. Eddie Murphy can see where his humor and thoughts are at his head and his films like his strange professor. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
