Three Stooges are always one of my favorite actors. I love each one of their shorts. I love all six of all Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All of the shorts are funny and many other great actors and actresses from the stars, many of whom have many other shots! In my opinion, Three Stooges is one of the biggest players and the most funny comedy team! <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of one of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shams! It's all short cut by all the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre provide great speeches here! There are so many funny parts here. It's a very cheerful short. There are three similar Stooges like a similar to Bridef Groom and I both come!
