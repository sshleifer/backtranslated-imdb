I always found the philosophy that every human being has a different taste, I find this movie a great thing, and I think every college student can agree with me. Nonetheless, a "movie movie" is not about some of her "true" children and some "problems" that they encounter. I found the movie to be fun (especially the pieces where practical jokes play together). If you have the same "wavelength" as these people, you will find this movie beautiful. This is going to win any Golden Globes or Oscars, or do not think that this film will be a "religious classic" among young people who will be the future Hollywood stars, but may be related to his experience. The most prominent person for me is Hans: Son of Scandinav, "not a guardian", but takes all (or one) chicks. In the film, especially when it is drunk, "little people" also play a major role. If I'm going to go, I can provide spoiler and do not want to do it, just go and take a movie and you will not regret it. I give it a 8/10
