Another beautiful Arnold movie. This is a great movement in a futuristic film and is one of Arnie's best films. Arnold is framed as a bad man in this film and plays the Death Game. This movie is an excellent and great Sci-Fi / Action movie. I have always loved this movie and should be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 to 10! PERFECTION
