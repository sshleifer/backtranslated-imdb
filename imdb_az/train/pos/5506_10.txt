I do not understand why "reviewers" give this documentary "0" for any political reason. No, the film did not look at the "side" of the story, but surely Chavez's film against the propaganda tale should generally be regarded as an attempt to balance the story (in particular, the history of the COP in Latin America - the Google National Security Archives and B. and the obvious fraudulent scenes of Chavez supporters who fired on opponents who did not exist elsewhere). The most surprising thing about this film is the fact that the filmmakers stay at the presidential palace - undoubtedly one of the first in a documentary - a shock of both sides!
