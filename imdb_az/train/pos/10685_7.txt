This movie has an open story, which is quite unusual for the music genre. "Cats", "Dreams of Operation" and other Andrew Lloyd Webster music can be regarded as metaphorical because they use their literary works as their framework. The story of Biarkan Bintang Menari (BBM) is the basis of human relations, especially with the Indonesian people. Although the movie is based on a "alleged" fairytale, it's really a fantasy in the Indonesian "adult" kid ". Dance sequences are not perfect, but they show Indians themselves. I think that choreography should explore Indonesia's dance method that diminishes Indonesia's dance development trend. Dance sequences are unusual in some ways and are not synchronized with songs and / or music. However, I still love this movie and wish to develop it in the future. I see it as a new wave of the Indonesian movie genre.
