I did not see that I was a kid, so it was seen with fresh eyes. I never heard of it and rented my 5 year old daughter. The idea of ​​Christopher Walken's singing and dancing made me wonder. Special fx cheeses are pleasing, and singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter screamed. I liked watching this role in thinking that Walken was organizing for him in the future. It's fun to see her dance! And if the songs were not great, at least there was no gum dessert on Disney. From the beginning, the ogre scene was a bit scary for her, and eventually she fell slightly when she saw her again, but it was very good. Interestingly, we recently read "Puss in Boots" and I was wondering about the story impostusibility. But almost all aspects of Walker's players believed it. Great fun. I was reviewing my daughter again.
