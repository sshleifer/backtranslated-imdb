Thank you for creating the best 2 cartoons of Disney Jymn Magon. This show has been greatly improved over the years. As a child, I did not like it, because I thought it was my favorite Disney job of Ducktales (like Grandmoffromero). And then it's good, but it's not good. But after reading the reading here, I decided to give it a chance, and I bought a DVD set and watched the first day of the whole pilot and was very pleasantly surprised. Although the series is so alive, it's still my favorite episode. And until the end of disk 1, I knew it would be top ten. <br /> <br /> Characters are very complicated and attractive. I have to be my favorite Wildcat. Totally cheerful and sweet to boot. My next favorite, Baloo, is the best pilot in the show. I can see why he has built a show around Jymn. Then, Kit Cloudkicker. He has the best relationship in the O & Baloo series. After that, Louie. Jim Cummings did a great job of characterizing his original voice. Then, Rebecca. He forced me to make it harder, and I believe it and Balu finally get married. And finally (for the heroes), Molly. Although she's my favorite at least, I love her. I think he is a very sweet character (better than Ducktales Webby). And the villains were very original. Don Carnage & his air pirates always amaze me, Kahn is cold and cold, and natureists are always less entertaining. <br /> <br /> As it was said before, stories are funny (Time Call of the Blunders and Bell Klangs for my love), short, touching fun, comic and exciting adventures (The Old Man & The Seaduck, Paradise Lost) It's a bit of my favorite episodes, but Talespin Disney is the best, beyond Gummi Bears Some of these reasons? GB was a decent amount of my favorite character (Kubbi), and TS did not have enough Wildcat yet, in the end, Talespin's classic BOTTOM LINE - 10/10 The best 6 cartoons.
