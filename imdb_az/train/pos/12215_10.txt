I liked this movie from the opening sequence to the end. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting and refreshing things about this film was its gender and class stereotypes that it was not attracted and therefore difficult. . The characteristics of these characters are strong, they have no influence, and the characters themselves and each other are able to embrace me and to enter into my own world. With no savior and intelligence, delicate and loving humor, this film has the power to open up new opportunities and gives people hope for a world that sees and accepts each other as rare and precious people. We look forward to the offer of this creative and talented director.
