Robert Mitchum acts as Clint Tollinger in this short but challenging west: Man with Gun. Tollinger is a professional city tamer - as one city needs one to escape from itself; it is a man brought to do so. Tollinger's latest concert comes as an accident: she goes to the city for past tuning and runs to a city playing as a puppet by a local western gangster. However Tollinger starts the day rue the job, because many urban populations put a lot of tax on the way to the city's cleaning (suddenly it looks less original than the High Plains Drifter). <br /> <br /> The people of the day begin with the average western man, but as the film progresses, you start to surprise yourself. After the forgotten and up-and-coming up, the outbreak begins with dark and character-oriented. The whole film is shot very well and the shot is very pleasant. Mitchum, one of Mitchum's best performances, is one of his best-performing features, Mitchum's unique feature. Mitchum still has a high-speed classic and effective screen with a powerful screen that blocks full action, shocking, shocking scenes. The film was right off the park. Gun with Man is a wonderful Mitchum western and easily worth the time.
