This movie uses fantastic cinematography, the depth of the camera is of every character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline put awesome speeches despite the fact that the Washingtons accents died on certain occasions. How will this movie be forgotten? will not be able to rent or lease it lately. is an uncomfortable idea. Atandiborough is the best way since Ghandi, and he thinks he should do some of these movies, SOuth does not worry about winning the audience, not for freedom in the African Apartheid. The critically acclaimed film, though, is committed to the message prepared by Donald Woods and intended to convey it to the world. ta and peace
