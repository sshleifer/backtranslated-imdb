Think about the first movie of Sam Mendes, you think that the American BEAUTY is a very cautious style, wait for its expected second effort, the 30th gangster melodrama for PERDITION. Some critics perceived this new film as a decent solo for GODFATHER, mr. Mendez's shocked by several unusual technical drawbacks. If the mechanics of the film take a great picture, then yes, CREATIVE CREATION is a remote brother for GODFATHER, according to the results obtained with cinematography, editing, music score and sound. All great stories and some rare films are a resonating short story after reading or seeing the reader experience. <br /> <br /> Like in the United States, I feel it, despite many intense scenes that reflect cold, eg paternal love, loyalty, and betrayal. <br /> <br /> The father of a hit man, Tom Hanks, appears to have concentrated on a large number of gangster films of the past years, an old elderly Irish elder, Paul Newman. The father / child motif, hanging over this picture, is so severely cured that there is not much room for spontaneity; the entire enterprise has been carefully worked out and almost all dialogue is delivered with a great tool: it's a clear gangster film, and therefore a necessary amount of violence and blood-loss, but it's free of any humor to talk about the movie; <br /> <br /> Spouse, there are scenes with the participation of a young boy who runs an illegal car on assembly. <br /> <br /> So, there is nothing else but the highest praise for me. the stunning view of this movie; Indeed, this is not to say that it is one of the most beautiful pictures I've ever seen and one of my designs. The veteran operator, Conrad Hall, will earn more Oscars for his work here. Production sets and suits are examples; in fact the whole movie is a surprise. Mr Mendes continues to be surprised by the brilliant use of the color and he and Mr Hall make it even more effective and surprising to use the red blood coated with black-colored walls over the gemini, blues and grays. The film's color scheme prevails. <br /> <br /> If I did not record the player properly, the actors do not respect themselves. Everyone in the film is a top notch, paying particular attention to the behavior of two bad-tempered people: Daniel Craig, the man who wants to hate the classic "hatred" of Newman's gangsters' spoiled, innocent son; and Hanks, his son, and his figures are very important in the second half of the film multiplying the film, which is not known as a sexual miracle, Jude Law. But it's a dazzling, moving actor in a movie, where photography is forced to take a back seat in fireworks. If it were a Rolls-Royce movie, I resembled the PERDITION path.
