If the film's demand can be called "guilty pleasure", this will be a general fantasy type. The guilty ones are wrong, even though I am very happy to be an escapist from time to time. "Stardust" is a good stock fantasy, which should be expected from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman's adaptation). Not the dream of Mirrormask's vision, it's not the Pan-Maze's adult claim, and the fun-loving classic The Princess Bride, but with a fairly familiar lover of fantasy. Being totally comfortable during the entire review. Fantasy lovers should be delighted - the effects of special effects are finally at best good and cheaper that these products are now produced on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> Stardust's story involves a young man called Tristan, an adventure to get a star falling in love and approval of the most beautiful girl in a small town. The fallen star of Tristan is a woman named Yvaine to make her really difficult, and she is just looking at her ... they are facing immortality and their brotherhood, which can give a heart to a star. <br /> <br /> There are all those who come from it, but some of the charming fantasy elements, a warm-hearted interpretation of the nature of love, and Robert DeNiro, the best part, are like a gay gangster. In this note, DeNiro's performance is a stain ... most actors are not too slow to use to describe gay men, but one of the strikingly effective ones is the rough and mixed typical character (hence, DeNiro turns into alternative types of activity) a joke that continues around the character that fits with it). DeNiro has not been something like his Brazilian image and says something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is perhaps the kind of movie it is about to live on the shelves of children and fantasy lovers for a long time. I can not say I suggest something new, but it's not really there. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
