Only Cause draws the best of three films, combines Cape Fear, a Flawless Touch, and Silence of Lambs and a good backdrop of the movie. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to former Assistant Attorney Attorney Kate Capshaw and she is an aggressor against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother closures Connery at the Ruby Dee conference and directs her granddaughter to appeal. <br /> <br /> When Konyeri came to Florida, he faced a harsh sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, and was a compassionate actress like Orson Welles. He touched Satan. <br /> <br /> Then, when it comes to the emergence of the conviction of Connery, he feels very good about himself. At this point, the film turns to Cape Fear into a turn from the evil eye. <br /> <br /> It means to put something soft, not everything you see. Dump is directly transformed into good performances. Ed Harris, who plays Hannibal Lecter as serial killer in the ranks of death with Underwood should be mentioned specifically. He will make your skin slip, and he can reconsider some of the comfortable liberal buildings that Konyeri has put on his prisoners. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, many liberal people think differently after being killed. <br /> <br /> Of course, the opposite is equal. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not the end, but the process. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not the end, but the process. and it will not end it for the whole society. I think that Just Cause can be a spiritual one, it may be.
