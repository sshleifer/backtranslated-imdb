This movie is ridiculous! Well, I love this piece of "Allied Taste". This movie is not easy to convict Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick were in the long run! Time belongs to young stars. <br /> <br /> Yvonne De Carlo resumed his role as Lili, pushing the big 6-0 (even though still good and still the perfect Lili). <br /> <br /> Yvonne De Carlo was given a bigger piece. Nevertheless, it was good to see Fred Guinea and Al Lewis actors who make them famous! During the two seasons of the MINISTERS during the prime minister, the series was Gwynne / Lewis chemistry, which was so successful. The remainder of the remainder was supported by members who did not say it was not necessary. They were! Television series would not survive unless it had already been. Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (original "Eddie"), choosing a choice between them, the selection was very easy. Yvonne De Carlo is also a good choice on Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not measurable to the original TV series, it is still beautifully measured and better reunion TV. <strong> <br / > <br /> <strong>
