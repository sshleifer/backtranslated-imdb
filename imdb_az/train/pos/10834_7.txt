I did not approach the word "I'm still naked" without any real expectation. Just another rock'n'roll picture, I thought good nostalgia for baby bumers. This movie is partly, though much more. Brian Gibson, the director, long ago touched upon Tina Turner's biography and was very successful in his style. I guess it's his last movie. <br /> <br /> Cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in the role of the band's lead. Acting returning director Bruce Robinson appears to have been bathed guitarist for the band. Although he did not appear in the film since the late 1970s, he does a great job. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for some great and entertaining movie, you've seen it. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7.4
