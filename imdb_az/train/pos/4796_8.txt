"A really nice story about a brotherhood love," describes this strange David Lynch movie.

The attraction, in some people Alvin goes on, for example, a dull young girl running off the road, and some beautiful townspeople who are helping older people enter into trouble. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> I live there for several years, confirming the rolling hills and the rich land, this is a beautiful country with beautiful people .... like this movie.
