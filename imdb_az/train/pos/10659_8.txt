The character of Ralph Meeker (Lawson) tells Barbara Stanwyck's character Helen, then she takes a breath of her husband's taste in Tijuana ...! This line broke me and it was like a metaphor for this movie - it was cheaper to cheaper, because a 2x4 cheap chef is a good person for a long time !! I agree with some other comments about Helen's Lawson's involvement. His message says he wanted Lawson to be abandoned, though he was involved in his wild nature and his passion in it would probably not be tired by the tide!
