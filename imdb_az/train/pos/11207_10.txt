This documentary was presented to Oscar nominations, and why it was easy to see. Even after 45 years, this is a very effective piece of work. Why not write in the text, but it's the secret that Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and animations in Tandem. This was used to use Vault Disney as part of a few months, but I have not seen it on the list for a while. * Breath * Most recommended.
