"Tintin and I" first hit me like a masterpiece. Photography and editing are actually breathing (almost anti-dogma). <br /> <br /> Since 1971, we have been pursuing Herten's life with Tintin drawer, an open-ended interview. The Tintin series is the background of the great ideological battle of the 20th century. In the midst of Hergen, he has his own jinn to fight, and many of his drawing activities seem like an attempt to fabricate them and escape to a perfect world. <br /> <br /> Although magnificent photography, the panorama of paintings from Tintin albums and the reading and reading of some of the albums, Hergen's story is completely explained through interviews and archives, and will never be rebuilt. <br /> <br /> Herg√© is a true, painful artist. But the fantastic world of imagination will continue to surprise the readers again.
