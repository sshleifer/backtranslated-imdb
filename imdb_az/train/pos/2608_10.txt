Roseanne's last season was a crazy roller coaster trip. This last episode just says in the previous statement that we know the symbols we do not know as much as we do not think. Roseanne returns to one of the season and tells us that this show is the essence of her life. In this latest episode, he says, he has changed events and people as he deems appropriate. Scott was not really with Leon, but he was there. Marc and David married their spouses, and Dan died when he lived. Like the events that took place in his life, he changed them in writing. We do not want all of us to do that. We all have a moment to ask that we use only one eraser and change our desires. This is the whole episode. According to another statement, I do not feel cheated, my family was real in my opinion, and that changed the situation in the lives of the events. A + A + show ending!
