This is a good adaptation of the Austen novel. Well, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> Kinematography is inventive, sometimes crossing the border cunningly, but this, in view of the whole appearance, prevents the appearance of a TV soap in suits. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION! Mrs. Paltrow demands his own character, but the distance required from other symbols is accompanied by a bunch of lesser ones than his own. In other words, he does not look at the results of the match preparation. Some supporters are very guilty of acting too - in the style that is evaluated on the stage, but in the action scenes. Of course, I had difficulty accepting Alan Cummins as "El Life", but I have to admit that there is no blame for having left a ghost trolley-dolly on "High Life," and it's a difficult thing to accept. Toni Collette and Jeremy Northam, who oversaw the rewards to heat the heat, make his character just the right level.
