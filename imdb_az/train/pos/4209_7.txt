The "Pick Up in the South Saki" is a high-speed drama, which, at one point, is a little time-bound for betraying the activities of a communist group. The action is presented in a very straightforward and dynamic way and corrects with a glossy corrective password. The use of different camera angles and impressive attitudes creates a general impression of permanent motion and vibrancy. <br /> <br /> Cinematography by Magic Fuller's directorship and Mr. Joseph MacDonald is very good and there are many scenes that create strong emotions and atmosphere through their compositions and lighting. <br /> <br /> Ace shooter and repeat offender Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) entered the deep water when he stole a wallet from a young woman named Candy (Jean Peters) at the New York subway. It was used by his ex-wife Joey (Richard Kiley) for carrying the secrets of the US government of microfilm, which is in contact with a communist organization. Two FBI agents watched Candy and witnessed theft. One of the agents continues to return to Joey's apartment, while the other is Zara (Willis Bouchey), Police Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye). Zara explains that the FBI follows the Shahsya for several months behind a leader of a communist group. <br /> <br /> A "stoolie" Thelma Ritter, called Tiger Moe, sets out 8 possible suspicious lists after "cannon" work is described clearly. Tiger thinks immediately after seeing Skipin in the list, he is the man to watch him, and he has sent two detectives to catch him. When Skip is brought to Tiger's office, Zara speaks about microfilm and Tiger is suggesting any charges if he cooperates with the investigation. Jump skipping and arrogant. <br /> <br /> <strong> He does not believe in Tiger and denies all information about theft on the subway. </ Strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Joey wants to know who stole the Candy microfilm and then return it. Candy pays Moy to Skipin, and returns from Tiger's inquiry, Skip, finds Candy looking for his home and knocks unconscious before stealing his money. It requires $ 25,000 for a microfilm when it is restored. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Caucasus> Police is a tool that can shake its focus. But it soon becomes clear that the solution of the problems with the communist gang will only be carried out with direct action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Moe's work as a police intelligence depends on. they can be revenge at any time. He looks like cunning and stretching, but also describes himself as an "old-time fugitive" and earns money to qualify for the exceptional cemetery in Long Island. He believes that "every dollar has its own meaning", which leads to the sale of any information regardless of danger, friendship or principles, and is still a state he has abandoned, and this leads to death. Thelma Ritter's performance is certainly worth the Oscar nomination for his role. <br /> <br /> Last night, a former criminal who was convicted in the past three times, was arrested for life if convicted again. Nevertheless, he is still committed to crime and strangely, when Moe betrayed where he was, is merely a philosophy, and then provides a tribute to Moy so appreciated. Confectionery is an old prostitute and its activity is gradually becoming more noticeable, although its constant danger. Widmark and Peters are perfect for their roles and describe different lines of personality like Ritter with great style and love.
