Damn, I was in a lot of things. It was perfect, though the correction had a lot to do with it. I do not believe that he has a good relationship with most of this person (especially Anton) to take such stories seriously ... livestock. Dandy has left good and middle-class children who use their condition (and therefore!). I felt very bad for Jonestown and especially Anton, maybe it's not something that many other people do not feel. Great part of the film and a great selection of themes. I recommend this to any music / movie fan. You will probably learn something about filmmaking.
