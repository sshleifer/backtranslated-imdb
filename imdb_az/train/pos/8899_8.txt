Turbulence and diversity of the decades, when the film was actually presented in the 1960s (our mixed men around America's belly at that time). Despite the exaggerated, stereotyped characters, the truth remains true. <br /> <br /> It was not just a radical change, but a very striking time. The two main things have changed our world: the great impact of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the press. These two new freedoms have soon begun to be transformed into an institutionalized situation. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity of chaos has come from values ​​of corruption. But most Americans did not deal with it ... they used, played, watched the news ... slowly affected by the efforts and struggles of minorities ... Civil rights workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, poverty reduction ... /> <br /> Particularly, the representation of the power of the press and television was well reflected. the attitude of the general public and those who want to change things did not see the best ... in the worst, mistaken way .. The middle class Americans are angry when they make baseball races or leave their ugly daughters. They were also confused. Nevertheless, let's not forget how the Singers, who once chanted Folk Singers suddenly began, and began an assassination of the "The Beatles" People-Protesting Movement. There is no Beatle song in the movie, even though no word from them. <br /> <br /> If you were to live decade, I think the film is connected to it, the overall picture is a bit dim. My brother lived at Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another point, he played and played home worker in Maine and Connecticut while working in Haute Asbury and Riot in Detroit. <br /> <br /> The middle class family has three brothers in the movie. They represent a hippie boy, political activist and active military personnel. Taste represents a typical attitude and represents the concept of motherhood, endurance and sometimes compromise ... <br /> <br /> The black family consists of a minister and son ... it is disproportionate, I think. I knew all the variables of the producers and I think I should solve the limitations, or the film would be long, boring, documentary. Father's message was angered by bitterness and chaos. <br /> <br /> We were a message directed to today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution for social problems, as well as looking at how the issues are going to be settled ... In the 1960s, this was so unusual and comparable to only Roaring 20. In other words, this film is all moral. Ultimately, this is a collective personality to survive. Put it on your oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> In the 1960s, everyone was God, Guru, or genius genius. It was magic and madness. No one can be beaten to any of the 60s ... it was very different (this movie is close). At least we do not embarrass her, we can learn from her and grow up, and once, a generation has shaped America and changed ... it's better.
