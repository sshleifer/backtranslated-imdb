<br /> <br /> We are making the superstar a little easier nowadays, but there's a really worthy guy here. The song's selection was perfect - only the weakest new songs contained songs that I actually heard and wanted to cut with documentary footage. I really liked that the group was five in the very minimalist environment. (There is no need for vinegar to entertain with the songs of this power). <br /> <br /> The shooting of the meeting was also beautiful. Some performers can affect the original Beatles fans (now over 50 and over), so young children can jump out of the starting point "Anyone Who Can not Love Me" and affect everyone? <br /> <br /> While watching, I understood that after John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney was immediately converted. Paul did not just lose John and George (no matter what their last relationship, it's hard to lose someone who has changed the world), but lost her husband Lindane and really did not accept the murder of Lennon. I acknowledged that Lennon's murder was terrible, but now I just realized that Paul had forgotten. <br /> <br /> There is no need for anything. <br /> <br /> Together with my spouse, both of them were crystal. I think the next people will complain about the quality of DVDs when they are formatted. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> When recollecting John Lennon's memory, for the first time his murder , and then will recall their music. Now there is a new assessment for Paul McCartney, for the first time he will remember his music if nothing else. And hope the McCartney catalog is pretty good, because another lunatic will not change that.
