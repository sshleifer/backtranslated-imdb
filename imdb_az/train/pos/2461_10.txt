Kenneth Branaq shoots all the traces of "Hamlet". Acting is magnificent, 70mm cinematography is perfect, Oscar nominations are suits and sets are striking, and Patrick Doyle's account (also Oscar nomination) is sensitive and moving. Oh yeah - Scenario is bad by a guy called Will S. Film critics threw the film into Branagh to get the fourth Oscar node to "adapt" the screenplay, but the decision to use the full text was gutsy. I will not think of better ways to slip for four hours. <br /> <br /> Please note that Branagh works brilliantly: using the UK Blenheim Palace for outdoor use, Edwardian dresses and several names in a mirror hall in the "Being or not". Drawing attention to small parts of Hollywood lumens, such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon, may be of interest, but this is nitpicking. Benefits of the main powder: Derek occupies the coincident nature of Claudius of Jacobi; Kate Winslet sharply describes Ophelia's shamelessness; Julie Christie is passionate about Gertrude's description; Richard Briers, the pitch like Mr. Polonius, is perfect; and Nicholas Farrell increases Horatio's potential unpleasant role for true apotheosis. Every word, every line, every word is delivered with passion and confidence; There is no empty moment in the whole movie. Recent scenes increase the degree of Shakespeare's tragedy by the theater's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The hamlet of Hamlet is a courageous, ambitious, and eventually successful attempt, based on the fame and poem of Shakespeare's language. equal audio visuals. Perhaps the biggest Shakespeare adaptation in this movie? mighty praise, but well worth it.
