And I'm serious! Certainly, I'm very pleased with most of the audience. It's so beautiful that rarely a good book is just a movie, but it's better than a novel. Probably the Lord of the Rings and Trainspotting, but it is really a rare event. But I believe that the truth that Louis Sachar has taken from the beginning has helped the masses, because the story is close, but it is even further. There are many elements in this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. A unique, original story with a good fun and humorous blend, but one adult edge. 2. Bright actors. Adults and children know how these actors can bring their lines to life with storytelling and style, like how to bring the story life and sometimes happening with children's films. 3. Falling scenery. Whether it's real or CGI is not important, it's also a verse. Especially I love the image of holes in the eyes of the birds. 4. A talented director who breathes the life of the book and transforms it into a genius from the technological point of view. Time passes work well and keeps the constant peak in the book and leads to curves along the film. 5. Louis Sachar! The person who started reading a book I could not understand from beginning to end. She is sure that the script is put on the book so that new bits can be improved. 6. Talk to the scenario! Inside this one-liners are clever, funny and unpatronising. But there are places to love this part more to smile, weep and pull your hearts. 7. Beautiful soundtrack. There is not a single song for me in this movie, and I have something to think of as a punk rocker. These songs combine the story well and add extra jazz to the style of the movie. I intend to take the film, especially if you are a fan of the book and would like to have the "If Only", which contains the book's choir. <br /> <br /> I do not work For people who solve it, I'm not just a fan, it unites my favorite movie and gives it its worth. You did not see it, do it. Now. This is very sudden. Go!
