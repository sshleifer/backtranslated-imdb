Telemundo should definitely consider the Nova Xica DVD collection! I know more than a ton, including people who want to buy Nova Hika! A very entertaining novel set up in Brazil. The city where the costumes of the actors are beautiful and the novel is beautiful. It contains many of the history of Xike. Even if Telemundo 2 in the morning, I would like to have a television again. If I still see Telemundo I recommend watching Xika. I have sent Telemundo several times to show her novel, but my slogans have been heard by the deaf. The only cautious statement about Xika sometimes involves some strange scenes that children over the age of 14 do not watch Hikan. Overall Xica is worth 10 out of 10!
