I was stunned by this movie. There were key elements in depression, grief, loneliness, hope, hope, desire and accompaniment. It was not about a genius musician who just dropped it, but about a man who was flabbergasted to find his taste in his music. He finds a companion who comes with his own problems. Claire and DÃ©s were able to provide each other with friendship and love, but more importantly, they gave rise to events that shaped their lives the worst. <br /> <br /> Des, a rock star, is a difficult characteristic of today's standards. But there is a music genius. There is an event in the past which creates stagnation around him, and everything around him goes away. <br /> <br /> Kleyr is a streetwise kid who needs somewhere to stay. Des finds hidden skills while at the company. He also finds the recipient of his mutual friend. <br /> <br /> These two love fall in love with each other. Love is not a blow to the mind, sex is not like sexual passion but a love that is more than friendship and understanding. Two injured people rely on each other.
