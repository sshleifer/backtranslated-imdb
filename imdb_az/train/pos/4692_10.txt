Despite the crackdown, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funny movies I've ever seen. This is a closely watched movie; Some funny bits are made of passes and there is no amount of ordinary amounts. For example, wait for Michael Keaton's pet store to use a valuable weapon ... and also in documentary-style years that appear at the top of the scenes. Though you know it's a comedy, it's one of the rarest movies that humor comes unexpectedly. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Amy Heckerling, the director is really sharp. > Michael Keaton's ultimate role and supportive player (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is extremely unpleasant. Be advised.
