This film was made in 1948, but it sounds right today. Very, very funny. It starts with a family who wants to get a few places in the country and builds there. Anyone who builds a house will make this movie very enjoyable. Great casting. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delighted in this film. This is a classic black and white film reflecting the style of the 40s .... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are directed to the costs of things and comparisons with today's costs are pretty good. I can not imagine anyone who does not love this movie. I was surprised by the number of middle-aged people who did not hear this. True classic.
