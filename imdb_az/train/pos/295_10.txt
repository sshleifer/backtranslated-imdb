Bogdanovic's (mostly) uneralded classic is a different film than any other movie. The film, which feels a sense of fairy tale, is actually a solid foundation for using the original Manhattan places and the "true" geography, perhaps the best place to lay in NYC. John Ritter reminds us that we can be brilliant with good leaders (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob), and the whole ensemble is a group that will really exist for you to spend time with EM.One of the few romantic comedies in the last 20 years is that it does not look like the collapse of something else Bogdanovich's most successful business is the highest point of success ("saint jack", "long lasting ...", "sounds off" after realizing it.
