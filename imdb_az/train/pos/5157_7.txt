The next and final episode from the original Star Trek series is an interesting, sometimes melancholic taxi that proves that the show is still exploring the characters at this point in the third season; Although defective, there are moments in 'All Semi-Days', and in general, it's moody, compelling. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy rays claim that the sun has been exploded for several hours, so it's time to save its reputation or at least to warn any people. But as you can see, all those present there are aware of the fate of the planet and fled to the past using a traveling device. Everyone in the past was able to choose a time and place where an old man, Mr. Atos, wanted to live in the "library." Atosis shows that three people are looking for a past life to live and that they can choose from watchers. <br /> McCoy - Where did they go? Atosis - where they want. The apparent misunderstanding could easily have been cleaned, but not for slogans, and soon Kirk returned to the 18th century England. Spock and McCoy are sent to the ice age of 5000 years in the past. Here, the main focus is the relationship of Spock and a woman who has been expelled this time by a punishing tyrant. Spock begins increasingly emotional action, showing anger toward McCoy and showing deep compassion for the woman Zarabeth. Finally, he returned to the emotional state of his ancestors 5,000 years ago from Vulcanda. Kirk returns to the library for the first time, and finally assumes that Mr. Atoz does not belong to the history of the planet. Before leaving Spock and McCoy leaving Zarabeth; Leads, like the destruction of the sun-split planet, flutters and extends its speed. Interaction between Spock and Zarabeth provides the most memorable moments of this episode, though Kirk's adventure is entertaining to the "English" past. All of this is an extremely worthy day trip to Star Trek.
