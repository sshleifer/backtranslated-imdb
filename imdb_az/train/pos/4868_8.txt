I gave this movie 10 to 8, at least for Amadeus 10 times and 9 for the Slumdog Millions. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to dominate this film without understanding the Balkan life, its mentality, and the spirit of Kusturica's masterpiece. To understand, you really need to be one of the Balkans. This incredible movie is better and more modern than previous movies, this magic, Kusturica is moving with this movie. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art, every scene is restrictive. The land is probably a fairy tale, do not recall it now, but remember to read a story similar to what my daughter reads.
