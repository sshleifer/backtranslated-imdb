I found this movie very funny, and I enjoyed using the agenda of the sport. This movie is not as fun as South Park, but it's pretty laughable. And because I am a fan of sports, I enjoyed playing some of the funny things in the sport. This film is very good for non-sports fans, probably they close sports when there are so many speculative rules and intricacies that sport more than sport and actually do not mean anything. I also found the actual game they found out they were interested in, such as the father's basics and psychic materials (for fire). In general, I come to see this movie and I believe you believe in this movie. But if this comedy style is not favorite, you probably will not love it. (but with any comedy movie)
