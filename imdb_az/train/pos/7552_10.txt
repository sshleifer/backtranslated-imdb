CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. He won the Best Short Film Award at the 6th Fantasy Film Festival and won the Excellence Prize within the Japanese Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When Niyako's little soul was stolen by Death, he and his brother entered a strange journey to return to Nyatta. On the other side of the surface dreamscape, they can withstand many fantastic characters and adventurous, often worrying adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is anime like something you see. It's Hello Kitty's Acid! It's a very original, surprisingly beautiful, and has a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surprising (no dialogue) and is sometimes cruel and frustrated. So much more for adults than children (can not understand!). This is a great journey for those who have an opportunity to see the masterpieces of the absolute masterpiece. Need to see!
