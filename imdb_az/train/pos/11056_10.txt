Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner watched a movie "The Baron", a fantasy series about three superhuman spies, the advantage of "Six Million Dollar Man". When I was young, it was something I loved and I'm still watching her. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt, Craig Stirling, and Richard Barrett, a sweet chef, and Alexandra Bastedo, played a role as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a beautiful mixed Tremayne. The best episodes were written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, and the spooner compared his "Query" to the "Detention". I'm sorry that there was never a second set; there was so much life in the concept. Are Craig and Richard Sharron influenced by rivals? Would the Horse learn the powers of the Champions? Do champions have no other than what we see? We have never found it, sadly.
