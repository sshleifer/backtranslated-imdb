A man and his wife go through a terrible accident. When a husband is in a constant vegetative state, he must choose between pulling the plug out of his or her life. <br /> <br /> This is even more difficult when he realizes his dream of revenge for us and those around him. <br /> This is not what we have seen with director Rob Schmidt, who was filming "The Wrong Turn" ("I'm wrong"). With only one fear film under his belt and an excuse not like that, I was more reluctant to watch this episode, and I was expecting Schmidt to be the only liberal "Horror Master". I apologize to him for my sorrow. Episode 10 was the episode of the 13 episodes, but it was still the best. <br /> <br /> The issue of "the right to die" is a solid construction device, with enough detail to be solved. But this is just the essence of the story. After the horror elements are shown, the film becomes "spectacular" from "decent". Great entertainment, great organization, great dialogue, great tension. I (sometimes good) and from the very beginning have climbed a bit: unhappiness is more! I did not expect this episode to be reviewed, and I said that the reviewer was a strong sign of Hellraiser. Thanks to the first part of the show, I did not know what they were talking about. Then there are some pictures after a bit of reminiscent of the name "Hellraiser 2". Nevertheless, I'm not moving away from the movie. I do not see any other way to create the created effect, and in my opinion it looks very good from the Hellraiser 2. <br /> <br /> The roots of some areas may appear and invite the audience to come later. gives a second look to the movie. I did not watch it for the second time, but the start would be more meaningful to me. The subplot with the dental hygienist is also beautiful, I found myself going out and back if I did not like the main character for her affiliation or if I felt bad for her. If you want, he has some anti-hero for the entire story. <br /> <br /> Stuart Gordon's episode can be better, and if I admire the episode of the Washington, I am sure that I can be sure that it is the main part of the season, and it's another kind of undeniable and regular grace of saving. John Carpenter's legends have resumed me (again) worried about the future of the genre, but then comes a fresh face like Rob Schmidt and gives me hope. This is a goalkeeper and bring Schmidt to season 3!
