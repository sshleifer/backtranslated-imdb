I can not accept the negative reviews of other reviews. They are very important, perhaps because they are in the past. Some Temple Instincts would like to see a single person, perhaps a very young person, comment? I am glad that I'm not upset by the IMDb reviewers. After 14 hours, I am still trying to find faults on the beach, but I do not think seriously. My advice to everyone is for you and it is your mind. <br /> <br /> This is a similar example to Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less complicated. I was still curious, but in a more satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is sexually bad and bad, as well as his 48 year old. it remains its certain role. David Morrisey was not satisfied with Michael Douglas. I liked the assistant player, especially David Thewlis, as a police detective.
