I watched a night "read easily" and thought that something was missing. Perhaps, Buster Keaton threw me in a strange speech or conveyed to the leading lady's employer line. The next day I was thinking about the movie. I could not get Durante's songs from my head, trying to better remember the first scene of Thelma Todd, maybe Keaton made some funny fights and physical comedy. The next night I watched Thelma Todd and a dear chorus girl trying to influence Buster and Jimmy's sexual orientation. A very funny scene, the actors are excellent, their faces, eyes, foolish expressions. I watched another scene and their show opened at Broadway. Buster is wrong in every act of happy innocence. Again, Keaton's laughing loudly, evaluating clowning and tumbling. The next night I watched the whole movie again and this time it was the first time it was great! It's hot! This is magnificent! Three great comedians! Todd dances! Durante's reading! Keaton speaks! Surely this is not weak ... but in this way there is a lot of laughter.
