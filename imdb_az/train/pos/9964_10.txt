Just go. The DVD is cheap and easy to reach, the length is already standard, and you have been without it for a long time. (When the video was started at home, there were at least three releases missing parts.) Everything you read is right. It does not protect it, it does not exist anymore. The color is ridiculous and beautiful, and the production values ​​are pretty good for a Saturday evening kiddie epic. But there is no question ... all Santa Vs. The devil's angle fell into such a paradise and struck a STRANGE movie at a time, and a home video really continued. How good / bad / strange / is that? I just saw TRAILER as a kid and reminisced about BT for about 30 years ... Murray spoke on top of my voice, including my older brother, and he called me a liar and could do it for anyone Santa and SATAN a movie .. Santa Like Christmas Mary, kids wanting to get out of it, kids wanting to catch her, and their SLAVE ... and an international kiddie sweat shop ... and Santa is probably approaching a lot of children in the 60s. watching the season. (My version of my choice is The Mystery Science Theater 3000). But any old way you choose, the movie is a demented masterpiece, and a total (along with Brianiac ..) will not laugh at me. When I think better, then SANTA CLAUS receives MARTIANS. How many parents are coming to cocktails on Christmas Eve? "If you're bored, just go down and play the pianist." DANG ..) Freaky, boring, uncomfortable, funny, childhood, strangely ... What do you want more?
