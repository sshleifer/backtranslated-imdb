In all truth, this is not really a "movie" as a long last episode; In my opinion, if you do not have a look at the television series (Aggression: Lifetime), I suspect you will have a hard time after the movie made for this movie.

Giardello's mayoral candidacy appears to be particularly controversial, and I felt his shooting could be resolved in the context of his regular position. Also, Det.
