Gene Kelly, along with MGM, came up with really great ideas for musical compositions. Together with Arthur Freed musician, he is at the forefront of his creativity. It is difficult to believe when an American player in Paris is left out of the MGM. <br /> <br /> In Paris, creative design and MGM's sets of guides under a guise of American magic Vincent Minnelli have been mixed with the creation of a number of backgrounds. The idea of ​​the film came from Kelly who just wanted to shoot a movie with George Gershwin's long ballet sequence reflecting an American poem in Paris. Gershwin called Arthur Freed, who approached Gershwin, saying that Gershwin had been called "Irving Berlin" and that Gershwin had spoken well of him during his use of something else. In Paris, a note from non-Gershwin music is not heard in America. <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <span style = "font-family: Of course, he wrote a sophisticated story: everything about former GI, played by Gene Kelly, who never left France after the Second World War, was merely an affiliate of the Left Bank, <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in her, and Nina Foch is planning to deal with another issue that she plays as another American, but at the start of her Kelly film, Leslie Caron he is interested in a store girl he has played in. Caron is also interested in music comedian star Georges Guette here. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance George Gershwin music. the first film I saw as a flight film on the first flight, and I still remember coming back from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy airport, and when I see Gene Kelly there is Rhythm. My favorite movie in the movie, but with Traly La-La, Kelly sounds and dances in the piano playing house with Oscar Levant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will tell you about a book about Arthur Freed, French impressionists who think the public will get more space than the streets or back windows. That's how it happened. Kelly Words and Music, The Pirate and Town made a long ballet sequence. But they all surpassed all of them. Still, in my opinion and some of Gene Kelli's next films. <br /> <br /> The Oscars were surprised to find the best picture in Paris in Paris in 1951, and I want a Tramcar named. I can say that fantasy is a fraudulent realism that year. Big budgets are also in their hands. <br /> <br /> Americans in Paris are still one of the best movie tracks, and the studios are no longer able to recreate their creativity at the bottom of a roof.
