It should be one of the best comedies on television today. A close-up family takes a show-sweet-sweet idea and turns it into a pretty realistic but funny picture of a typical family composed of brothers and sisters, brat brothers, very protective fathers and bimbo sisters. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Numerous demonstrations (for example, "Brothers, Brothers" and "Lizzie McGuire") are now considered to be teenagers, so they have to solve social problems and think that they should lose their humor by hitting a very stiff shot. This trap was prevented by '8 Quick Rules'; solves some issues (eg, when the school is removed), but enjoys doing so. <br /> <br /> And although John Ritter is the reason he is not kidnapped, I think it was just a matter of time. the show showed its brand, '8 Quick Rules' still remembers humor and can do better if Cate's father does not make a second version of Paul Hennessy.
