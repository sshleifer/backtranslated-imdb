"The man in a white suit" is another featherweight title by expert Scottish director Alexander McCarrank (Whiskey Galore, Sweet Sweet Smell of Success). The star of the film is Alec Guinness (comedies include Kind Hearts and Coronets and Lavender Hill Mob). Guiness brings his usual class into the movie and is more typical of comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the comedy is not completely open. After completing the picture, it becomes a complete drama. <br /> <br /> This is a comic Ealing studio comedy that does not produce laughter, but it's a fun feeling, like the best English comedy. <br /> <br /> The whole suit of the suit is not very original, but it is a way of implementing it. The film is very original and is recommended to any admirer of Guiness or Britsh comedy. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7.6
