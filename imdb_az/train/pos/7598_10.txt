"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... go from the list. These and many other high-quality demonstrations prove that we are in the middle of the golden age of television. "Lost" is pure genius. Different and psychological stories are highlighted by high cinematography (incredible to use this word, while describing a TV show), killer scores, great speeches and editing. Anyone who does not like it does not lose one of the most important creative expressions on television. While watching only one episode a week may be a problem, but the DVD format is really an incredible way to watch it. I hope they protect it (I'm sure they are doing it).
