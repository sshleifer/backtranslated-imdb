In response to the person who commented on the film and how it was believed, I'm not interested in the role of Jesse's brother here: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Craig Sheffer / Norman, Jesse, could look into the challenges of life, looking at his brother's appearance. Brad Pitt and his wife have different examples of how they can work, for example, Jesse's brother, Craig Sheffer, leads to a confused bar and finds Brad Pitt a few days later. There was dramatic irony, so Craig Shifter would have had a bigger emotional turmoil in his brother's death, and he did more to prevent it, and later created a more attractive mood in the film.
