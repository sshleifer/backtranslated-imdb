The title "Before You Know the Devil's Death" comes from a Irish ancestry that the film plays as a tragedy in Greece. <br /> <br /> Stayed well with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke. the above-mentioned brothers play. Outstanding support recognizes Albert Finney as his father and Marisa Tomei, a wife of a brother and a lover. <br /> <br /> This story is compelling and is explained to some extent by threat. The narrative structure maintains interesting things by providing a variety of sources of thought and often making time changes. The film's unexpectedness has been silenced for a while because this story is an early and future tragedy. All this is a very effective start for scriptwriter Kelly Masterson for the first time. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet's direction is well developed, but it still holds more than eighty years. I was less impressed by Carter Burwell, but this is not a big deal. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film may have an attractive appearance and may have superficial similarities with the story and presentation. These films remain a unique experience.
