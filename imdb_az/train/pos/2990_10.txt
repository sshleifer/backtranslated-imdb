I was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four, but I have never read the positive theory of this sad misunderstanding about classrooms, love and sacrifice (the biggest romantic stories or movies in all three themes). <br /> <br /> The main topic here is the classroom. Stella is an American story from Depression. That is, the screen has become so memorable that this remake (if you're a Stanwyck admirer or two) has not been fully evaluated. The fan of the original did not give any chance. In addition, this version of Stella was developed not in America in the 1990s, but rather a major financial problem (as well as depression). <br /> <br /> It's time to remove floral goggles. <br /> <br /> In the midst of a new era of decline and poverty in the United States, we see that this powerful story is not yet true. <br /> <br /> Yes, the classroom is a key topic here. Stella is the poor, the only one who has great dreams, little hope to realize those dreams. Works in a bar, does not have much money, lives in a small apartment. You get the drift. In the morning, he really does not want to get out of bed. <br /> <br /> A man sees his dance in his bar. One of these high-class families, who have nothing to do with Stella, is wealthy, educated. His main concern is the participation of a college college with a height, how to pay rent and how happy he is. They have a relationship. They resemble each other. Stella is pregnant. Stella reports. His answer? "How is abortion?" He replies, "I'm just a room full of balloons." He provides balloons and offers, but he sees that he is not in his heart and is proud to accept it. <br /> <br /> The girl is divided into two lifestyles - her love for the mother and the privileges, happiness and love she has given her by her rich father. Only and unloved Stella, the last victim who does not want her daughter to be as unhappy as one day. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> For the movie. Everything is right. Bette Midler, especially Oscar-worthy score, artistic cinematography, great design design (contrast of two lifestyles, messy apt and decorated houses), beautiful and sincere speeches by the whole cast <br /> <br /> This is more than you believe is a very important and well-prepared movie.
