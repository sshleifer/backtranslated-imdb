I really enjoyed this movie. Now he was able to do some of the movies; family values ​​while entertaining me. Nancy Drew is a role model for looking at a hero and young girls for all generations. When I left the theater, little girls were interested in the movie and talked about Nancy. The film creates relatively few problems for families and I do not think parents will be bored in the theater. No, he would not win an Oscar and did not show spectacular special effects, or even a terrible mysterious mystery, but it welcomed me and was in harmony with the spirit of the books. I love this movie with a young girl (he will love it!) Or it's definitely for any admirer of books. You will not be disappointed.
