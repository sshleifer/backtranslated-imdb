The IQ is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great players, which looks good on the screen. The field is a typical man for a girl, the boy is in the form of a girl, but not in heart, but in a definite point where he needs to love his heart. Albert Einstein and his genius group add a great comic relief. Generally a good movie. Not great but good
