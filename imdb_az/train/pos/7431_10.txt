I am very enjoyable in the movie. It was my most popular movie in 1976. As I grew up in the 1970s, I liked Kris Christoffersons, and, of course, I'm not a critic, but I think it's good at times. I love the opening of Streisand and Christopher. I thought they worked together well. I have seen the movie many times and still love both of them as Esther and John Norman. I'm a great fan of Kris and I see him at the concert when he can do it. Not a talented song writer, nor an actor. I saw him in many films, but I still think that a star is born.
