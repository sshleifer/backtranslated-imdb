The Peter Jacksons version is generally the best in terms of objective. They said that they did not have the Rings of The Rings version of my favorite screen, and why would I explain? <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters on the screen are simply ordinary and unkind with Jackson's LOTR. All the wells run well. "Do you claim that the legendary cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi are better players than real people?" one may ask. Yes, they are not really clever (for Hobbits, after that about them), and they, of course, have more personalities than Jackson's party - even less time for dialogue. And this is one of the superiority of Baker's LOTR. Take Aragorn for example. In this version his voice is full of deep and charismatic power (Aragorn lord) and a fresh raspla (Aragorn the ranger). This is John Hurt's brilliant voice player. Compare Viggo Mortensen with a loud noise, and the duels soon become uneven: Hurt breaks Mortensen. And then there's Gandalf. Probably the best (and most famous) character on the whole board. In this Bakshi version, Gandalf (William Squire) is a real magician. And so I do not want to say that he hit bolts from the tip of his fingers, but his presence is just attractive. He may pass from a mysterious, strong, and subtle old man to a fearful person. Add to his look: Tall, old oak, old, bearded body, sharp eyes, magic fork nose and, of course, a classic wizard. Perfect Gandalf, as in books. On the other hand, Ian McKellen's Gandalf is simply too boring. It is like many people, many people are singing, many people work, no hat, no sword. Yes a sword. In this Bakshi version Gandalf kills bloody swords with a sword (as in those books). And this sleek slow motion kills. It's not a force to agree with Gandalf. It should be noted that, while I was sorry to say this, Christopher Lee did not leave Sarumo right. Fraser Kerr made this movie with limited screen times and lines. Before going through the film's ability to see it, it's worth mentioning that the Orcs are superior to Jackson's bad guys. The orchards of the eye are accusing their enemies (or each other) in a growing, shocking and terrible language. They are more convincing than monsters and, in my opinion, are more loyal to their book. And finally, Black Riders - or Nazgul. These giant bad guys are ghosts in fear of each other - not just some warriors fleeing. They talk to the victim with the humble voice. The scenery I love in the film is the time when Nazzul chased Frodo near the river. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Peter Jackson does not do anything, but the ships just follow the party, Bakshi, a cool sleeping actions and the sky thunders in a sleepy dream. <br /> Jackson is second only technically better. Here are some key visuals. As you know, Bakshi LOTR is a real mix of animated characters (all hobbies and main drawings) and painted by real actors. Actually, in this animation, I have no problem using real people, but they are not very well adapted to traditional cartoon figures. This is especially true with people (Rohan Riders, tavern people, etc.). Orcs are different issues, because they look different than other characters. Orcs is superior to the Jacksons version when playing by people with animated blend. They have brown-green skin, bright red eyes, flat facial and gear teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest farewell in this movie is fun, hobbit. Compared to Jackson, I prefer almost every character in the Bakshi version, and secondly, there are pretty good Hobbits, in fact they are perfect. Take some discomfort with Bakshi and buy insanoid Disney bambies, which is very badly drawn. And you have to spend a lot of time with them, so be aware of it. Again, the voice that votes is good for them, but the mouths of mouths can not hold the "dipping" of these small dreams. Yes, I did not like these semi-finals. <br /> <br /> Common misconceptions in Baku are well-known. During limited play (with limited budget) and many missing scenes. So, while this movie covers nearly half of the story, it does not give much detail than Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> LOTR's Ralph Bakshi version prevails: <br /> <br /> - Excellent atmosphere (More like Middle-earth) - All voting - Music (really <br /> </ strong> <br /> </ strong> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" </ strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch? Look, besides well-known shortcomings, the best animation and Tolkien's fantasy world is very good, but it's not perfect, and I'm going to give it a score of 10 to 8Â½.
