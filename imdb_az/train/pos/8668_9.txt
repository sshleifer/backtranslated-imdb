I have not heard Leos Carax until the Merde segments in Tokyo in recent years, and she has easily separated from the three stories of her film. This shorts are not my favorite, but it was the most unique and most iconic. "The Lovers of the Bridge" is one of the full length features I have ever seen, using a visual and romantic film to communicate with a young love affair to the poets. Although classified as a neo-nouvel fashion, the films owe to silent cinema as experimental stories of up to 60. His films are closer to Jean Vigo, "L'atlante", closer to Jean Cocteau and Guy Maddin, Godard and Truffaut. <br /> <br /> For the first time in 1984, Girl Boyda Carax's vision representation for showing black-and-white and emotional states of severe confidence. <br /> <br /> I'm going to follow one of the allies. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Career Girl Passed Simple and Carax's "Young Valentine's" Trilogy It looks like a movie. A son named Alex, Denis Lavant (Carax's next two characters, Alex, playing a character named Alex), was thrown by his lover who fell in love with his best friend. At the first stage, he kills his friend on a board, but escapes death. As he walked around, he recalled his neighbors' sex-related voices, their lover's agenda, and his closest friends. She stole notes and keeps her in her friend's home, but keeps her in touch. <br /> <br /> She travels around and finds a party with a suicide bomber, and is part of the movie "Breathless" and part of the "Limelight". <br /> <br /> Then, he speaks the sign language "speak for yourself ... young people have forgotten how to speak today." The old man gives an anecdote of working quietly in the days of the film, and a player on the stage in front of the camera was a lioness of tranquility. Films they find in the movie, but they refer to the silent movie because the style of the movie (silent and expressive), the content (a lovelorn young man who wants to work hard) and can really do what he wants. Alex is a shameless actor who turns into a lion thanks to movies, although in the first place it is a weak torrent, but the inner emotions that are not so easy to climb up to now are a shattered actor <br /> <br /> Beyond the desire to fall in love. <br /> <br /> Alex has a scene from a party where guests come from a room where their children and children caught her, and she fills that room until a child show is silent until she returns to a tape. Due to one expectation, the television ends up playing a hidden bathroom and transforming its owner into a shimmering ghost. Carax tries to talk about the age-old fossil from the many reflexive and self-reflecting words in the room (a baby room full of babies), and he is quite capable of watching the mystery for lovelorn in everything. Even a rich old, bunch of balls he has a brother who abducts himself. An astronaut in another field looks at his feet one by one during a cocktail whistle. <br /> <br /> Carox is a musician who knows when to film before talking, <br /> <br /> Death to Kennedy's "Cambodia Holiday" or early David Bowie song from a man playing piano or sounds gentle with a girl. <br /> <br /> When she broke her shirt out of the shirt, when she kissed them in a few lanes, as Alex jumped 360 degrees, when Alex entered a party, he was really involved in the world's most exciting people; a bullet placed in his brain or as a famous author in front of the astronaut through the missionary universe in 1950. This film, Jan Piere Jenuet, Michel Gondry and Wes Anderson, parallel to different visual, musical and emotional desires in Caria films, each dialogue, Every music and every effect and editing in this movie has resonated with me at some emotional levels, and some have no words to express. There are many tales of a guy who met a girl, but this film is more than just a study of information about any event that reflects the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment. You can watch other movies you want to watch. See it first. If I filmed it, I would like it to be like it, in fact, I want all the films to be bigger in life and life itself is a dream.
