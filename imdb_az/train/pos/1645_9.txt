This is done in a different way than most western. Realism is fundamental here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn in his ranch. This is the most interesting part of America where this is presented. I would like to see it on the big screen, not a tape, but it's worth seeing how life is in the real world. Cinematography is very good. Floor 9. Torn & Farrell is outstanding in this film.
