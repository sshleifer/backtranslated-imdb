I thought the film might be a bit more complicated from psychological point of view, but the action and voice actions were the top hook. The animation was a heavy CG on many stages, but it was also very good. It is one of the Batman Returns / Forever movie, which includes novels and motives for Wayne's conflicts and dating. 007 admirers loved it, and thus, women, a great theme poem! Wayne was described very well in this movie, and Penquin has returned to his genuine form this time with no mutant gene! <br /> <br /> <strong> I liked the truth that Robin was not very popular, Tim Drake was just a good computer, a little indigo boy or thought of the future. <br /> <br /> Supported player, some soap operas, stars, decent talents and symbols resemble sound actors. Kelly Ripa was surprised at this movie. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this from Phantasm, Joker, and Batman and Dracula, but I loved Better Script than Subzero. 7/10
