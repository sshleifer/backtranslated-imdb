So, "Film Cinematography Guide" begins, including the Slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek, who uses his Freudian / Lacanian brain scalpel in world cinema. This three-part film is the second documentary by Sophie Fiennes (Yes, Ralf and Joseph's brother), watching a man in 2 1/2 hours and still spectacular and attractive. In fact, this is a great movie tutor and the best you can get. Throughout the film, Zizek directs us through a catalog of wishes and desires. She touches on more than 40 films, and it often takes a lot of time with Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin, Tarkovsky, Marx Brothers and Eisenstein. But he also looks closely at "Persona", "Conversation", "Three colors: blue," "Dogville", "Fight Club" and "Exorcist." The research that Zizek has done to the cinema extends from the thematic theories about death to the "desires of desires" and to "partial objects" from Gnostic. <br /> <br /> If the Pervert's Guide is a little better practice, you have been exposed to the basic terminology of Freud in just a few minutes. However, even though he is not in psychoanalytic theory, Zizekh's dynamic and exciting personalities lead him to something that is not likely to spin a particular lingo. The film often cuts from the movie clips in Zizek * 's pictures * in its original film, namely, in the original places and sets. The transitions of these sequences continue to be such a tension and trick that the trick will never be old. And Zizek himself makes us laugh with strange little jokes or enthusiastic insistence, for example, a brave Oedipal interpretation of the Birds. In both Fiennes and Zizek, this passage is crucial for the gonzo character of the film. Spoon sugar, which helps digestion of strange medicine. After all, we all have a certain point in the past, the psychology theory is just a foot?
