"GEORGE LOPEZ", in my opinion, is definitely ABC classic! I have not seen each episode, but I still can do it. There are some my favorite episodes. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) entered a moving car. If you want to know why, you should see it for yourself. Before I complete it, I would like to say that everyone has always been a good performer, the design of the design was spectacular, the suits were well-prepared, and the writing was always strong. As a result, although new episodes may still look, I suggest to capture it only when it is turned off for good weather.
