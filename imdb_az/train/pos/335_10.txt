I was trying to learn about this series for ages! Thank you, IMDb! I have seen it as a child and never could. Of course, I was shot with the episode of 6-year-old cyclops, especially talking to me (I talked about it, my brother told me that he was cyclopping a plastic cave), and I remember that from the very beginning an unusual situation - mysterious, tough and extremely safe atmosphere. After many years, I had the same feeling when I read the original. Hollywood is a difficult thing to do. Every 'Odyssey' I saw was a huge refusal. The characters in this series are genuine, real people - an ancient Greek people - not some Hollywood stars in suits. This is a true work! But - Why is it better known? And why not VHS or DVD available? I just want to have a chance to see it again!
