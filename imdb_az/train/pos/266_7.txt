This story has never been in Christie's works, so I'm very pleased with this adaptation. The mouse motif is effective even though the story's bones are a bit modest, though more and more attention to past crimes is concerned. The students were pretty much as I imagined, though they were unfortunately not because they were more cosmopolitan - perhaps the 30th amendment did not allow it! I was thinking about drawing a lot of courageous risks with filmmaking; <br /> <br /> Maybe, because I did not read my book again, but it seemed to me as it looked from the murder scene. <br /> <br /> Early Poirots were more popular in the competition. Sometimes it works, but in this episode I found something very hard (although I smiled at the "Lemon Sole"). Even though it's not a solid entry in the series, it's not the best.
