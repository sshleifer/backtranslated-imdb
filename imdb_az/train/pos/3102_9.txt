I've seen Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, Wow! <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jennifer Bourne, the CIA agent who is trying to find out who CIA agent Jason Bourne is. <br /> Previously I said that I liked this movie from beginning to end, no field holes, slow scenes, everything was just right, and it was compatible with other films, but all the feelings were much better. <br /> <br /> I saw the best stunts, car tracks, actors and effects I've seen in all summer (amazing Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.). But, just in action in this movie, Jason is not just to kill and escape. It has a soul and the audience feels for it, so it involves drama. <br /> <br /> This was the best of all the tripods from last summer.
