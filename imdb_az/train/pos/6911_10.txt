Despite being beaten by Raul Julian as a political prisoner in a Latin American country called "Spider Woman Kiss", this time it works for a dictator in a so-called Latin American country. Particularly, the dictator suddenly died, so to shoot a film in the country with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) replaced by Julia El Presidente. From there, Dreyfuss should consider how to become a dictator, balancing them all with his own life. <br /> <br /> In Latin America, the tense situation has to make a comedy? Well, "Month Moon over Parador" is a good job with this. Whatever happens in this movie, they shoot it. This is just going to show that Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of the era and what we have lost in the death of Raul Julian. Definitely worth seeing. Sonia Braga (starring Raul Julia together with "TKOTSW") plays a leading role with Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree that the first woman is hot.
