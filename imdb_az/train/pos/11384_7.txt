A 17-minute dance dance series, "American in Paris", is part of a debut piece by George Gershwin's 1928 orchestra. A colorful, musical and dance combination of genuine choreography by Gene Kelly is astonishing as it is divided into scenes inspired by selected master artists - Place de la Concorde piece at the opening of Dufy, Utrillo at Manet Paris, Rousseau at the exhibition, the magnificent Place de l 'In the opera Toulouse-Lautrec for Vincent Van Gogh and Moulin Rouge, Kelly's famous white bodysuit. <br /> <br /> This is not an exciting moment, but not the last 97 minutes before the final, but in 1951, there are several glamorous attraction to Oscar-winning music. <br /> <br /> Director Vincente Minnelli and screenwriter Alan Jay Lerner, Jerry Mulligan, have developed a strikingly romantic event that focuses on an old GI. In the post-World War II, he lived as an artist who raised him in Paris. With Braggadocio style and athletic dance style, Gene Kelly can also be as strange and intriguing as her personality, but she finds her job as carefree Jerry. The love-triangular structure links Jerry to an artist who proclaims himself when he comes to young artists, with Milo Roberts, a sex traitor. For the first time in the crowded Montmartre nightclub, Jerry becomes unapologetically High School, a young woman, Henry's fiancé, a friend of Jerry's friend and friend, a concert pianist Adam's fiancé. Romantic complications occur before the imminent ending, but is not performed before a few classic Gershwin songs. <br /> <br /> The best of these is most imitated - a romantic song and a dance "Our love is here to stay." a faux-Seine tea with a blue smoky wheat with yellow smoke lamps. Kelly and Leslie Caron are intertwined with each other's circles in sync with the music they have come to each other and to the final grade. Several films have shown the love of two men in a very elegant and imaginative way. "I Have a Rhythm" and "S'Wonderful" entertainment, Kelly's fast dance and dance singing, "Embraceable You," Adam's dance while impressing Caron's five-pitch assembly of Henri's Lise's comprehensive description. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Caron is designed to demonstrate versatility in dancing, / Like the high school, 19-year-old Caron (his first film) plays a role in unformed ghosts with dancing skills dominated by dance players for several years. Nina Foch plays an old manipulator like Milo and the Oscar Levant can only be enough to care for his destiny, if he is just like a man of the Sardonic. Elegant "I'll build a Stairway to Paradise," says George Guétary Henri, who feels bad that he eventually loses his daughter. This is not the best MGM music, but there are enough movie spells to make that pretty much worthwhile. 2000 DVDs are quite pristine, but they are very small in terms of extras.
