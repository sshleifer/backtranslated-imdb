Why I can see that this film is the best Live Action Short for Oscar nomination. Especially if you do not like Blues (though I have a lot of jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It's just made well, though, for my life, director Gjon Mill was just a movie - why I did not see it. In other words, the nomination of the film was nominated, and yet the director did not win any career. As for the black singers, I understood that this did not turn their career into high-end devices, unfortunately most of the white community was black or "neglected" for the "kind of music" (or worse). <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, especially if you do not enjoy the previous episode, with a 5:50 mark - this is a very important place. The lady stopped singing and improvised the performers, the pace had improved slightly.
