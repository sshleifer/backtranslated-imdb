Hot Million is a great movie of all kinds. An entertaining, unusual story with four of the best professionals to work in business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant as usual and Maggie Smith --- definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time --- a total pleasure. Carl Malden and Bob Newhart are on top of the stunt and are perfect. If you like a movie with a perfect pouring, this is it. The most effective thing is that these people work in a natural and easy way, creating a lot of fun and fun moments. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a great sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and editing are also first-rate, and this is a great time capsule of London in the 1960s. This is definitely my list all the time.
