Yes, I've heard that Ossessione is a poet for the Italian movie genre and especially my favorite "Giallo" movie ... but in fact it is a tension in Italy; both have very little to do with. In the sixties and seventies, Italian filmmakers gained the reputation of destroying any successful American film they had left. They did not do this, but Ossessione almost did the same story with the film "The Postman Always Rings Twice" without giving credit to James M. Gain! In any case, the plot Gino Costa stands on a beautiful twinkle, which, by accident, slams into a cafe where Giovanna Bragana is working. Soon she learns that she is married to Giuseppe; Govanna is a great bored man who can not even stand to touch him. He does not want the idea of ​​couples trying to escape to each other, but it does not want much. But fate is destined to end the intervention and her husband's plan to succeed ... <br /> <br /> Although film director Luchino Visconti has lost some credibility to lend credence to the film's author, the film's good use of the noir style and the ambiance of some movies noir classics. The story, as you would expect, is extremely powerful, and Visconti is trying to get good performances from his game. Visconti is a little more dragged, but with almost 135 minutes of work, I felt that this story was so subtle to ensure that length. As I'm a very good movie, I feel guilty of all this Ossessione, but this is not a "big" movie. Relationships between the two central characters are not really properly investigated, and it seems that something is more restrictive than not putting the characters in the characters. As we already know everything, there is no secret to the field, as always, the heroes themselves do not stand on their own; The film is not as exciting as possible. Perhaps this is for an interesting view and is therefore recommended ... although not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M. Cain classic.
