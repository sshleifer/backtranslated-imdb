And I love Isabelle Blais absolutely! She was very sweet in this movie, and she was very different from the role of "Quebec-Montreal", which was more like a man eating. I think he should be a candidate for Jutra. So, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabel was superb, IMO. Pelletier performed a great deal of work for the first time, and I joined Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage, and several other friends called Andre Ducharme. <br /> <br /> Because it was fun to see them, I did not know they would look. <br /> <br /> I saw a romantic comedy that I did not like in Quebec. This is as good as I enjoy seeing. If you're in the states and wonder how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca has conveyed me for less than a week.
