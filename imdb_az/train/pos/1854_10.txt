Having a critical look for the movie and developing good movie love, I have Antwone Fisher symbolically breathing. I'm not an admirer of Denzel Washington, both of which are talented as the actor and his public staff; I am fairly honest to object to a very short time in a movie or two. I can also be wrong about that - I'm not all actors. But it was different - Denzel pushed his career into one of the most sensitive topics known to man - a child who was abused by a child. Its directorial debut is less than that. Develop a film to show that a person will succeed successfully. <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Watcher short, but childhood He looked at the life of a young man with a hell of hell, but despite all this, he won. This film made it, and there was no dry eye in the theater. One gets someone to know the topic in this film to know when the true truth is presented. When you are inexperienced, a talented filmmaker takes you to convincingly tell the story. And if he can attract the audience and does not respond with a sense of regret to a viewer, the director has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. Makes good movies. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luka, Joy Bryant and more, Antwone Fisher - you really won.
