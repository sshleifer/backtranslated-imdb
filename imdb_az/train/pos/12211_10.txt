Harry Dodge, a very clever and talented filmmaker by Hook or Crook, and Silas Howard, a very innovative film. An original story is explained in a different kinematic style and beautifully drawn by Ann T. Rosetti and written in a beautiful way - it is truly poetic. <br /> <br /> The lead characters are the true heroes and serve as a rare example model / inspiration for bush dykes and trannies everywhere. This film is a very strong, very sensitive passion and has a heart of San Francisco. I can not recommend it enough! <br /> <br /> The best friend of all time!
