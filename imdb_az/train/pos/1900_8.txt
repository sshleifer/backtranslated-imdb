The late Dudley Moore had a very short career in ARTHUR in 1981. Warm smiles, big laughs and smiling moments when you are in the right spirit are sometimes tear-borne. Moore has been nominated for Best Actor Oscar for his drunkenness, Arthur Bach, who "runs sports, plays tennis, protects women, but goes out of the weekend and is his boss". Arthur took $ 750 million when he married a baby girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), a secret gangster's daughter. When things happen to Arthur's father, Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli), a waiter / fighter from Queens, who holds a tie for her father's birthday, things become sticky. Moore illuminates the screen in one of its funniest performances over the past 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgood won Best Supporting Actor Oscars for his flawless turn as Arthur's hungry bull and his best friend, Hobson, who covered more patriarchal feelings for Arthur's behavior. Barney Martín has other sectarian activities as Lindán's father. Stephen Elliott, as Susan's father, is like Arthur's grandson Geraldine Fitzgerald. The film was originally directed by director Steve Gordon with an eye-catching comedy. A few years later, there was an unforgettable event, but it should not be missed immediately in the classic.
