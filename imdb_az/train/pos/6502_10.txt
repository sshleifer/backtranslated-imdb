Although I was very young to remember the first show of the series (being just a baby), I repeat television in the late 80's when it was interested in war and all its aspects. My father was the first to show me the series and gave me my first interest in Malta and later in the Royal Navy in the Pacific Ocean. Since then, I have burned many books and I have seen many television serials in mixed thinking, the Second World War era. English television stations are generally very good at producing them, because they can easily approve the BBC at the World War II and many stones of independent companies. I come strongly into topics such as "Nazi - Warning From History", "Blitz" and BBC Series on Dunkirk. "British Colors in War", "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are in a very high standard. It is the best in the World War II and will never succeed in delivering it despite its age. It is not always included in the series, and, of course, the Second World War has been on such a large canvas that produces a series of details that will take more time and money. then any other such an initiative is possible. Those who say thank you to those who say that they are not in the whole world think that during World War I can not do it physically, but maybe heck can offer more research and he likes it. Of course, it works for me: Now I have a large library of books, videos, DVDs, tapes and CDs. Even with the passing interest, advise everyone. The series was well designed so it would be difficult not to realize that they are good programming and highly informative.
