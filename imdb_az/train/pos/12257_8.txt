This book is better suited than Paltrow (although I liked it). Beckinsale is better - they are also good, but the scenario is better. Davies is a master to adapt Austen to shoot the film, and here's the production value is very good. Hollywood treatment is not as shiny, but close, and places and suits really work better.
