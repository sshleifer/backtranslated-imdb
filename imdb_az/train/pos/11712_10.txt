This is a big movie like "Call Me Anna" because it shows that a person has long been without knowing it is wrong with him. Patty Duke is inspired by the public and his stories of those who suffer from this illness. I have a lot of respect for him as a man. The only thing I do not like is that I can not get it on a tape, I'm looking for it, but I've never been successful. How Does Everyone Know It?
