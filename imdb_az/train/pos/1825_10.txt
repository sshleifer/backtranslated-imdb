When I was a young man, I saw this movie and remembered it as one of the first movies I really love if it's not an action movie or comedy. So I decided to follow up again in my next years and see if it's just a nostalgia or something really in the movie. The film that I was surprised had spent all my expectations. This is a great movie. Properly-priced, some jokes, beautiful songs (though not beautiful and actually a music I did not remember), and everyone's bigger use in my time. My last childhood films did not meet the minimal demand of a decent film, and I was amazed that this film, which I have seen in the second class, has forced me to cry, as if it were crying. Perhaps, my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but it's important for me to feel that the filmmakers (and, of course, money and money) do. Yes, there are sustainability glitches. Yes, there are gaps in the script, but it does not matter. The film itself is entertaining and smart. So do not be fooled by those who are always looking for bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and it takes 10, not because it's perfect. It just takes 10 people for me to feel.
