I saw this movie in the BIFFF Festival in Brussels in the spring of 2004. What a surprise! This German-made, stylish and creative shock, is one of the most terrible blades I've ever seen. Be alert: this is not a joke! This is a terrorist good actor (as an example: Peter Martell has a strong presence of the European guru), excellent direction, beautiful production design, a very good soundtrack and many Italian horror films eighty. The flesh is cleared of bone ... and the blood works red ... this terrible Heart Stopper will catch you ... and you need to give a dark dreams ... A must see!
