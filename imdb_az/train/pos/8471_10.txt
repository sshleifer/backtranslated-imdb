This is my favorite Mr. Motos and I've seen it all. As usual, Lorre is his seductive self debonair Mr. Moto is. Lionel Atwill enjoys a tremendous museum curator, the usual funny relief here is pretty funny and many suspects will be exposed. Archaeologist Tom Beck does not seem to be the same as the usual second lead in these programmers, but it's enough. Stephen Fetchit is in the boat, and when he speaks stereotypically, his lines are not contradictory to intelligence, it's funny, and really keeps the day on the screen shortly.
