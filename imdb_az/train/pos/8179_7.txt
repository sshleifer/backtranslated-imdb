According to Trivia, the film was shot for 21 days. Of course, post production can sometimes take longer than filming, and the edited picture for "Dentist" is perfect. Fast fractures increase the tension that the dentist has only two speeds that show what's happening on the scene that cares for "his wife." The rest are put on our productive imaginations! <br /> <br /> Corbin is a good choice for the role of Bernstein, because he has a very psychological experience of playing "off" characters and has completely sold obsessive-compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> Right for the film's pacing. Filmmakers correctly reveal the misery of their spouse. All the characters in the dental cabinet seem to be real people working in the real world. There is tension when dealing with impatient people waiting for the dentist to come. In the meantime, the dentist is bound by the abolition of major psychotic rashes! Unlike many of these genres, the script is too tight. All victims fall into the dentist's trap in many ways. <br /> <br /> Certainly, not the heart and dental-phobia weakness, the true roller coaster is not necessarily for the beach. it is very difficult for smart gorefest fans.
