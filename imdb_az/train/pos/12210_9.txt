People claim it's content, but they were forced to cut significantly in post production. There is Harry as a professor at ucsd at the moment, and one of the best classes I've ever had is honestly as enthusiastic about the events that make up his film. I first watched the movie "Joy of Life" for another class that sounded in the movie, and after watching the class, I started watching this movie. Harry actually did some performance work, and in fact, when it was time for things to be done until the moment it was shot, it was a real fact to create moments that actually acted in this movie.
