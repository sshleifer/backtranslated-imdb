Maybe I have to look into my head, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. CG is not too bad. We found the animals (and good and bad snake) worse than what they saw. Moving scenes involved quite cool.the announcements were really good, I thought. When some of the lapses of logic and story are always sense.but for a popping feature, it's a lot worse. other creatures were removed from other films, and therefore not entirely original. Although the story itself is original, I believe that Allahzilla (big budget American version) likes many similarities. Like many in this movie, but still pretty good. I like all music, I think about Dragon Wars 7/10
