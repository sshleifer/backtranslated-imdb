I have licensed this show to Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It was a surprise that the Chinese refused to listen to anything. I've just started casting and story lines just because they are fair and thoughtful about NYC. There is nothing unbelievable even though I think Damien is very stereotypic to write as a potential black man with a layer !!!! This is the most disappointing thing. The rest is good, and when I return to the US, I will not wait for the season to wait for 2, so I'm sorry to learn about IMDb. Like other commentators, I was disappointed as I looked at my words, quality, and taste. But the closer we see these characters is that it's difficult to expect people watching and watching a few episodes. Which, for some, is a little overnight for intentional networks.
