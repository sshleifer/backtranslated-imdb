Four stories about different people who live in beautiful, old mosque and happen to them by Robert Bloch. First, Denholm is a novelist who sees Elliot's murderer's life. Some strange moments and finally bending were good. The latter showed that Peter Cushing was holding a waxlike thing like a dead partner. A third child, Christopher Lee (Chloe Franks) and his fears. All this is pretty scary, even though the story is far worse. The last is a comedy with John Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chew the scenery) and a hat that turns into vampires as a man! <br /> <br /> There is a lovely line on Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good anxiety anthology. It was not a terrible thing, the first and the third ended, a little bit flickering on me. Also the fourth is really very funny and Pitt is a very sexy vampire! The house itself is beautiful too ... and it's very creepy. Some nice ambient touches are well positioned. There is also a very good and unusual movie account. All in all a good little anxiety anthology look for good value. Try to see on the DVD - The Lions Gate looks fantastic with intense colors and great sounds.
