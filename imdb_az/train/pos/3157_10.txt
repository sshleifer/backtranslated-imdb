"This is an indicator of the 70s." I started watching about two and a half years ago and after seeing it, I would say it was a great show. I love all the characters, but my friends are Fez and Kelso. Leo was awesome when he was there, and I really hope he will come back because he's cheerful. Fez is going to be a classic when you go to "son of a bitch" and Kelso says he always laughs at me. Both are a great symbol and always have something to say. Jackie is another reason to watch the show is hot; Looks really good around a 5-6 season, but damn really started to look good. I have seen many episodes many times, others 10 times and still fun. This is one of the few shows that I can follow so much and still laugh as I did for the first time. The cast is classic; Almost everyone has only a few comic characters with so many comedy. I'm sorry to see this show coming to an end next year, but it will never leave the air as one of the best demonstrations.
