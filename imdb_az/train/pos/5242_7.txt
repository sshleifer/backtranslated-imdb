I liked this movie for more than two reasons. First, Northern Ireland gives an idea of ​​loyalty that these films are rarely treated in movies that tell us about the struggle of the republic. The second reason is the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I thought that many people had very honest and credible descriptions of the terrible underground world, which did not hear beyond my native coastline. <br /> <br /> In general, this is cast in Northern Ireland actors. The earth did not move, though some peoples may have little to do with the dark world of loyalistic paramilitaries.
