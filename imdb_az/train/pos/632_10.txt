OK how do I do it. Class I films are composed of 10 components. Each component will start with 5 points. <br /> <br /> Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - This component will give you 10 points. All five aspects had a perfect balance. The event was fun and out. The romance was too late, but it was very emotional and moving. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film was very difficult and laughed for a long time and I was still admired with fantastic drama. <br /> <br /> I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tale had already said. I found myself, sat in the theater, returned in my childhood, and then rebuilt the unicorns, the evil witches and the falling stars who had fulfilled their desires. <br /> <br /> This component of Cinema Photography is 8 points. <br /> <br /> FX - I'll give 10 points to this component. I love using CGI. In small quantities. Epic scenes were convincing. The magic powers were frightened. Everything is less, more and it was ALL! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No name and experienced actors are the same, the shot was incredible! <br /> <br /> Michel Pfeiffer was an evil man, Charlie Cox was in Tristan's life, Claire Danes gave the stars a feeling, and will never be seen, and Robert De Niro will be the same again. points. Even the new players all played excellently. I will never again appear and Robert De Niro will be the same again. <br /> <br /> Character development - I give this component 9 points. <br /> <br /> - It fled a bit and although the film was a little bit longer, they could do some better than the symbols. <br /> <br /> Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. Dialogue was smart and entertaining? Even the mush had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this item 7 points. We can only remember a small piece of music from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Last - I'll give this component 9 points. Almost perfect finish! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the latter seemed clearer, others could be more unhappy, but no yarn was opened. <br /> HEL YES! Look at the theater? Most definitely! Bottom Line: A perfect movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend seeing in the theater, I know I'll go back in a few seconds!
