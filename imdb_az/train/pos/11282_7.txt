<br /> <br /> This was the second of a series of 6 "classic Tarzan" by Johnny Weismuller and Jane's Maureen O'Sullivan. <br /> <br /> As usual, this series was a great movie; and perhaps "between" a film projection that can almost prove the development of cinema from the early 1930s until the 1940s. So, he showed a good movie, though not as good as the next movie. In the same way, cinematography is less commonly used in this series than in Tarzan films. The paper I saw was unequaled, with some decorated scenery and some explicit exposure and scenes. Here's a strange show of the next Tarzan films. On the other hand, there is a very early event that the camera of a sliding camera in front of the camera was really modern, showing the safari men traveling safely in the woods. it differs from stationary shooting, which is the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> At an exciting moment here, flirting while going to paradise, Mart√≠n. Kiss? and Jane is surprising and partly guilty, reaction? In the future, this is something that we see in Jane's films. For example, compare Tarzan with a child! Jane's routine movements deceived Tarzan and conveyed Boy's to his family. He later said that Tarzan was wrong. There is nothing too clear here, but Jane is back in Jane Parker's "returns" and is almost in the process of repenting, cooling off his nightly dress brought by Martin and Harry to remove Tarzan. <br /> <br /> From this point of view there were some drawings and serials that hit me. <br /> In short, the picture we got from Tarzan's inner life is a terrible idyllic combination with the likelihood of a severe death. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the most important part of the Tarzan practice. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by the violent scenes of today's standards. <br /> <br /> Many scenes that give me a special pleasure are: Tarzan, who leads the Philistines to the Valley of Cemeteries of Fils; Tarzan was rescued from aquatic death by the hippo, and later, despite the health of the monkeys; Cetah is going to find Tarzan, Jane and other men remain stranded at the foot of the garbage; Difficulty goes through the log, especially on the river. The last battle scenes of monsters and lions on the ground and monsters and monkeys in the trees. <br /> <br /> Recently, Jane, who shows the world of Tarzan, is rapidly demonstrating an entrepreneurial wooden machine to fire a lion to save the lions. <br /> <br /> The final scene series is amazing: suddenly Tarzan called at the scene, the monsters from the trees, taking the responsibility of the lions, to save the plum! <br /> <br /> A picture that is remembered at the summit's final summit, in the hands of happy Janein, a dance and a loved one with Chita, is really a beautiful outcome of Tarzan and Jane's story. <br /> <br /> All this is a beautiful classic Tarzan film. I would strongly recommend this movie to everyone.
