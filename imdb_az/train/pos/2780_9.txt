Great movie - I liked it. Great editing and use of soundtrack. Indian lives in a real sense of life, but we can contact everyone. A well selected by some of the great characters. The film is developing all the symbols, so you really care about them all and you know them. In India, music and drums are greatly exploited in some soccer fields, and everyone really works in the same direction as income. You can not help, but in this film you will root for Jess! The player was really good, even though the two leading lady's picnic and body stance were as convincing as a man playing soccer.
