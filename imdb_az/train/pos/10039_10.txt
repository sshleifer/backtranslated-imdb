The Titanic is classic. I was really surprised to find that this film is not a solid Worldwide IMDb rating. Maybe it's just cool that Titanic does not give up on these days, but it's really something when it's done for the first time. After the movie, people flocked to theaters. When I went to the video, my brother and I would watch it twice a day. We can say that we have been insulted and for a good reason. It was hard to forget some of the disaster, like a frozen baby or a man who committed suicide after killing someone in an unbreakable meeting. Many people have died on this ship and the immediate need and immediate emotion of the film is a challenging problem that James Cameron has to endure. And do not forget the wonderful romance between Jack and Rose. Their relationship was pretty good to have one of the dreams of someone else. They knew only one another, but each one died according to one another. They trusted each other. For Hell, Romeo and Juliet are the orders for money. "I will never leave, Jack." The "Titanic" is a very beautiful film. A brilliant player is a powerful story telling a wonderful crew of beautiful cinematography, beautiful music, and a hard-working and dedicated staff. When I say that someone hates this movie, it really captivates my mind.
