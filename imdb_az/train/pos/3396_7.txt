Very interesting. The big twist was not a big shock as you hoped, and it was very dated, but my mind worked. Indeed, I think about a world without vegetable or animal breeding and thank the world for which I live more. Charlton Heston has done a good job like all the supporting characters, and this was a very strange truth. Sometimes he did not go in the direction and many parameters and sequences required more explanation, but still a surprisingly good and clever film. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
