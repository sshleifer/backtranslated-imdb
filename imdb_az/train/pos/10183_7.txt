This is probably Karisma, apart from Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar gives her the best without even trying. The story is sometimes very good, but when it comes to the picture of Shahruh, it seems to be dragged to the end. What really was about me, the potential of the audience, the dialogue, and the story. It could have been better oriented and edited. <br /> <br /> <strong> Supportive allegations, including Mary's mother, were even great, although she was just a brilliant moment, watching her great. <br /> <br /> Sounds were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> <strong> I did not like the image of a family living in the Caucasus, but when it's time to take a step in India, it's not as real. <br /> <br /> Generally I would give a thumbs up!
