For my humanity pupils, I chose to set up a human trafficking school project. After completing an internet research, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and still think. I can all say "Wow." It's such a seductive story of an American named Holly, a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl and Patric who is trying to save her. The last breath remains, though it is very realistic if it does not end after a happy time. This is wonderful and I advise everyone! You really are in contact with Holly and Patric, and your heart is broken for him and for what happens to him. I really like it and I want to know what happens next!
