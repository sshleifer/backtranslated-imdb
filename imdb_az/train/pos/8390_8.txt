My first Fassbinderim was a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> It was a perfect game in the film and in the alternative cinema (small hall, uncomfortable seats, had to wait while changing public mass films). <br /> <br /> There were many clicks on the film, but Fassbinder presented them with cleverness that they found really entertaining. The sounds were also brilliant (sometimes more intriguing than dial dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in the right place. I liked how the postwar period was presented. Real fun! <br />
