Yes, commitment. Being deceived by saying "Fever Pitch" is a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Farrelly Brothers have become a baseball fan to really use this picture. Of course, if you are one, you will enjoy it more; All references to the history of Boston Red Sox and his bittersweet (I would like to say pretty clear ones); <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, the Bambino Curse, he meets a wealthy schoolteacher? Well, Fallon's character, Barrymore's heart is funny, caring, sweet and honest, perfectly. But his friends ask him a logical question: if he is such a goalkeeper, why is he still in the market? Enter Boston Red Sox. His uncle has been loyal to his team since his Sox season tickets were given to him; <br /> <br /> Some time ago, he never missed the Red Sox game at Fenway Park. <br /> <br /> This sensitivity is how much the businessman wants to give up for the boy's goal; <br /> <br /> What do you think about this movie? First of all, you can think of sport. The bits of the movie are exaggerated for funny relief. Yes, I'm sorry to admit it, they did not. In my life, like the Houston Astros fan, they are not all right. I would try every way to see each Stros game; Listen to the radio or watch it on the web. Everyday I read the chronicle sports section. Yes, my room The Thed looks like a Minute Maid Park gift shop; You know the Astros gearbox with a wardrobe, 5 shirts, 20 t-shirts and the rest. The character of the Fallo, even the Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. Fallon, despite being a cartoonist, was able to produce it, but was a fanatic like Red Sox. ); <br /> <br /> This is fraud around how each one is trying to control one's passions. <br /> <br /> It will be a classic romantic comedy. History is not enough to be among the best films; but of course it violates the genre's form and appeal to men and women.
