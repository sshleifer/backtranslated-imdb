Roman Polanski is regarded as one of the most important directors of our time as the classics like Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown. Perhaps the thing that made Polanski cinema very interesting is that it can create commercial attractive films, like the above-mentioned masterpieces, although he likes more of the low-pitched movies. "Le Locataire" or "Tenant" is one of these films; Polanski plays a young man, Telkovsky, who is looking for an apartment in France himself. Finally, he finds out he is empty after finding one, because the previous tenant, Simone Choule, attempted to kill himself by jumping off the window. <br /> <br /> After the death of Simone, Trekkovski concluded that his death was caused by the tenants staying in the building. <br /> <br /> Another "circular-themed" ("Repulsion & Rosemary's Baby"), the same claustrophobic perception, may be or may not be at the head of Trekkovsky, which may be strange assassinations, paranoid catastrophic impacts and strange drowsiness <br /> <br /> Polkovsky said Polanski had previously leased. Polkovski's darkness is perfectly described by Polanski. Although his performance seems flat and wooden, slowly Polanski behaves in this way, because he is in this crazy sub-world, where Trekkovsky can live by a group of these perfect people a simple, nonexistent, self-destructive, supporting actors are really important for the success of the film, reminding people of their lives about the building. Also, Polansky's fine cinematography, which runs the film, helps to increase the insulation feeling and gives life to a beautiful building that serves as a cage for Trekkovski. . <br /> <br /> Polanski uses a supernatural beauty to make a sense of confusion and madness makes them scary and attractive. <br /> <br /> If there is a defect in the film, this is definitely a little slower. it can sound like a signal, but in fact, the slow pace of the start works as if Trekkovsky imitated his boring life and gradually entered a different area. Additionally, a complicated storyline is not easy to understand thanks to the very complicated layer. <br /> <br /> The "renter" can be someone who is interested in psychological horror and irreal story lines, but not more than a defect, will be pleased with the experience. "Le Locataire" is actually one of the works of Roman Polanki. 10/10
