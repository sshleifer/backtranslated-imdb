The person who writes the scales "sweating and spitting enough" does not understand what a cultural, literary or psychological arrangement is. He rejects Zizek's comments because they do not seem to be "lines" of what the director is saying. So what? The importance of the author's (or the author's) intent is not critical in the theory. <br /> <br /> An article or movie can be analyzed through a series of theories called CAN. they do not agree with each other, nor do they see the author's intentions completely. <br /> <br /> For this reason, everyone who wrote the wall of the text made a lot of effort and effort to insult Zizeke. <br /> <br /> Indeed, anyone learning the theory will immediately condemn the views of these children (I have to offer you). <br /> <br /> Almost Laconian, or Kristevian, this movie is a must. These theories are related to a popular movie and feel more important than simply reading or thinking.
