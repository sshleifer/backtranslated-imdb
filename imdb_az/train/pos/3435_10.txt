This movie is a wonderful work. From the beginning to the end, it is both grieving and at the same time pleasing. Miranda Otto (oh, dignity so much!) And George del Hoya's performances are beautiful and even painful because the two people who are tortured are coming to understand each other. Dead Letter The Office staff's support arm is a wonderful part of Alice who does not feel a bit sad for me as she is a patient lover. There is a scene I can often watch (and I have it!), Such films are not recognized and thus a shame that will bring them public attention to enjoy more people. We cried, laughed and came in. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.
