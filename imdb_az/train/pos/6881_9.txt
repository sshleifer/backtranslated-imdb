How bad is a movie that Curtis Mayfield plays? It is impossible! The Groove Tube is a colorful sketchy black sketch from 2001 to the Olympics. High (Koko clown, lightweight barbecue recipe) is more than many clusters (too long sellers), but even minorities are funny. Not all of the best Ken Shapiro's intense mane dance on Manhattan's slope (Nat King Cole, Just You, Just Me), Shapiro. Now it is definitely dated, but the Groove tribe was irreverent, courageous, shameless and hysterical. Ken Shapiro struck this small cult hits, then 7 years later Christmas Bomb, Modern Problems (though I enjoyed it) and since then he has done nothing. (He can play drums in the jazz band) Groove Tube still delivers me pleasure when talking about the positive energy energy of 26 years at first glance!
