It was a really nice movie. Just to make a movie proves that you do not need silly litle things like sustainability and scripts. The continents take a few seconds, people are shot and nothing happens to them, the swords of fire, the samuari fight in the immersive galliards, the episode of David Essex slimey cruelty, and John Rhys Davies is just friends. I'm very happy with this movie, but I love movies, this is just a perfect example of many movies like KICKS ASS. If you like the Battlefield Earth, this film will love its swashbuckling, its faster, its mind, its samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It looks like it was in 1972
