Philo Vance (William Powell) helps to solve many killings among the rich after a dog show. <br /> <br /> Normally, I hate the extreme difficulties (such), but I'm LOVE this movie. It is very fast (just 72 minutes), driven by beautiful Michael Curtiz (he uses only the tricks of the camera that accelerates the story), there's a very spectacular storyline (only incredible) and has a very good arm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mary Astora is not given much, but adds classroom and beauty to production. Everyone is very good, but the best of all is Eugene Pallette, Detective Heath. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the secret of Hollywood's murder in the 1930s. It's worth seeing. <br /> <br />
