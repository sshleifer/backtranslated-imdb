This is the best movie I've ever seen in all categories. Do not forget about Hollywood - movies are always sucked - this is art! The Moon Child story is a Japanese vampire that begins with Kei. He denies what is happening and lives in denial. Her wish for her death leads her to the city of Mallepa, where several refugees from Asia are living. Here he meets Sho, an orphan who lives in the street. <br /> <br /> Here, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional part of the film. Everything is there; laughing, crying, angry, excited, sad, happy ... One movie did not touch me the way of this movie. And the actors are surprising - I've never heard anyone speaking in many languages ​​without strangely speaking. A great definition of the editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> The final comment about this sparkling movie, his star Gackt (former vocalist of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (vocalist of L'Arc) excellent roles. <br/> <br /> <br /> I am impressed by how Gackt can change the way he speaks and act according to his age. <br /> If you do not see any movies, see Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the new masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. Of course, in their original languages!
