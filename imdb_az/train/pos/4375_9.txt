Mel Gibson's Courageous Wonders was a spectacular film, but left a fuss in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the contrary, is a bit polished, but a better movie. This is, in fact, a historical film that combines historical values. But Braveheart puts a thorough and unpleasant temporal sparkle in an ancient tale. What is the filming of this movie? Liam plays the protagonist of Neeson, he is basically reprized in Phantom Menace (in a watery way). The character is heroic, but not the greatest warrior, nor the most devilish lover. It's a pity person, he orders the screen. In contrast, Tim Roth's Cunningham, immoral, but brilliant, is selected by a number of human opponents who have committed bankruptcy by John Hurt. Jessica Lange, as well as a pragmatic wife of Robin, is both powerful and noble, but must be alone, with a distant hero of 300 years. This is not the original film you see, but the courage of those who believe in you, and strong performances are of interest to you.
