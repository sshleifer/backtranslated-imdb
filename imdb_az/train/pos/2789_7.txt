It's packed with exciting entertaining scenes like Beckham, but there's usually a predictable stroy line. A girl named Jess wants to have a long-term desire to become a famous footballer, and finally gets a chance to offer a position to a local team. There are so many limitations and restrictions that are still set and run. I would recommend it to everyone who loves a beautiful light film and wants to inspire people to do what they can. The song's selection is really good, 'calm my child, just move towards your goal and fix your boundaries and complications.' Anyway, we hope you have at one glance helped your needs. Beckham bent like a big flick
