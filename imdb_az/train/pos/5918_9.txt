One of the most exciting films to be classified as "Blaxploitation", Bakshi's "KÃ¶nonkin" is a rich text with a beautiful idea. He also collaborated with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appeared in the film. These racist images can often be disturbed, but the film's message was so powerful that NAACP approved it (but sadly). <br /> <br /> I advise anyone interested in this film. Investigating the racism that they are trying to deconstruct. Beautiful things.
