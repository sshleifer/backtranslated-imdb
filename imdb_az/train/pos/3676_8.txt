My 19 year old daughter took me to see these exciting exercises to film. I am always interested in getting the ideas and ideas from a different generation in the film. It's better to get an impartial view of a film that has not yet come to the film that he has seen "been there, done it." I'm very happy that both of us were really happy and the successful mom / daughter treated as evening. According to demographic data, is it better to see that many bodies are gathered to collect the dead "chicken fever" that we should enjoy? <br /> <br /> For about 20 years, eighteen directors were asked to prepare a short piece about each part of Paris. But I wish I could. They are graciously linked to the filmmaking and represent different approaches in the popular city of popular culture, the favorite romantic capital of the world. Some movies work better than others, but other reviewers say that it is less expensive than kitsch. Some are laughable, some are sad, some are interested and just plainly surprised (still trying to divide some deep internal truth into the "Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon" Hair Studio). Some are just entertaining and maybe not much to say (vampire and tourists, for example). I'm all critical of the film, so Paris looks very good. It can also be cold, juicy, smoky, indifferent and strange, or in the summer, it can be full of hot meals and a large number of tourists so that you can experience some sort of sardine at an hour to see every attractive one. But I'm collecting nit. <br /> <br /> My beloved beloved was a Coen Brothers movie shot at the Tuileries Metro station and played with Steve Buscemi, a perfect player as a mixed tourist, a tiffoon-like lover. Buscemi is absolutely perfect and very laughable, without saying a word. Also, I was delighted with the rhythmic artists who were the best in the film - it was certainly teethered on the edge of kitsch, but survived alone. Rufus Sewell and Emily Mortimer, having received an insight into Oscar Wilde's grave, have made me very insensitive, and Juliette Binoche, who is trying to cope with the death of her younger son, was very upset about me. I also thought of Bob Hoskins / Fanny Ardent and Ben Gazzara / Gena Rowlands fell slightly, but Maggie Gyllenhaal was good (he looked at shades in the market?) I watched Sherry Baby last week. <br /> <br /> But I felt the part of two "social justice" (to be able to ask for a better way), worked very well. First of all, I would like to say first of all that the film about the young mother stopping her innocence and watching the mother of another man's baby. Later on, the film about African migrants stabs on the street in front of a young, new paramedic who lives in an indirect society margin. Another murder statistics in the world of thousands of migrants who have died in the struggle to achieve what they see every year as a better life. <br /> <br /> Margo Martindale's latest film, a postman from Colorado, is a film about the story of the 14th Arrondissement's first visit to Paris. very badly in French? his night school moved me to the French class. A perfect ending, if not good, is a pretty big movie. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea, but it works very well.
