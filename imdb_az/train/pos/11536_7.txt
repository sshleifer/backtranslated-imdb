It's hard to watch this movie without thinking about the TV show, especially for me like your TV show. But there is much to the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a New York City sports writer who lives in an eight-room apartment. stubborn elegance Enter the friendly friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), who needs a place to live after his wife's heartbeat for neatnik mentality. As a result, a train crash and Neil Simon will be one of the favorite films of the scene game. <br /> <br /> First thing first: I love this apartment! Poker boards, novelty darts, a few photos of baseball players, empty booze and beer containers, even a pair of columns. A place where people can be a boy. Simon and director Gene Saks are doing a great job by stretching a single set of scene games, stretching Oscar's hall, moving the bedroom and kitchen to the corner, and stretching between Oscar and Felix. <br /> The television show called Neal Hefti has been called, but it's never been so, in a few different arrangements, that it raises the screen movement when it's played. The real-life business and night shooting movie in Manhattan gives a generous amount of energy for those movies and movies (Buddwing, Henry Orient World, Midnight Cowboy, Manchuria Candidate, Rosemary's Baby, etc.) <br /> Is Lemmon and Matthau very tough compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? In order to be fair, the film is a more serious phenomenon dealing with the unusual situation of the common habitual life and the inadequate state of affairs. Simon, with the "Password" or Howard Cosell, is noteworthy about entering Felix and Oscar in a single battle. But I do not know ... <br /> <br /> Both Lemmon and Matthau were terribly comedians that I would watch in the middle of this movie, especially since I was in some movies, but it was considered as a great comedy group that I did not understand. . They act here in two different films they make the best partner; Lemmon is a comedy-drama and a fiction of Matthau. Matthau, around the poker table with a very nice toy bear at the beginning, but closing to the end of the movie, "The Shining", Felix's cleaning and maintenance of his apartment <br /> <br /> Although it's something that disturbs me, in many cases I look at the most punishing, works as good as I see. Felix is ​​not a great comedy, though he is trying to kill himself, but it is a good way to get into a great comedy, and he builds us with a real life pain before we bring it to heat and laughter. In the middle of the film, this scene would be a mistake, but it works as a way to create Felix's suffering and a sense of relief. <br /> <br /> We see that Oxar and his poker comrades are bicker and feud. <br /> <br /> Simon's lines are so great. They are the main force of the film. The suspect is right and true and is still funny. "I'm not talking, Felix, you say, things that offend me begin to listen." Television demonstration showed how wrong it is to accept the movie all the time, in fact, the TV show has put a good point on "not accepting anything" once, but the film has created a solid foundation and a joy itself.
