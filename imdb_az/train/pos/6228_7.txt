Another entertaining, gentle, sparkling RKO music with Astaire and Rogers is a charming movie on FOLLOW THE FLEET. In the absence of short-term noisy noises (the latest issue is "The Music and Dances Face" is the best and best of the team), it's very nice, because these two are not directly wrong with each other in the 1930s. Once again, the plot is light and unforgettable, but watching dance together with Fred and Ginger is a transparent paradise. In this dual movie, she has come to the stage with more romantic and magical love in dance than many couples. While Fred and Ginger music are better, this is certainly a must-see.
