Erich Rohmer "L'Anglaise et le duc" Peter Watkins is a perfect companion to La Commune (Paris 1871). Both films featured in this year's Toronto International Film Festival show how ironically the history of the tale is shaped. <br /> <br /> The film, based on the film "Memoirs" by Grace Elliott (Lucy Russell) during the French Revolution in Paris, took into account the tragic events that took place during the disaster in Paris, the first of its kind, hand account. <br /> <br /> <strong > Is like the history of the Caucasus. Rohmer will fall down. Rohmer, one of the earliest French films of the "New Wave", is criticized for being very conservative. In the middle of the last, rebellious youth-Viet Nam, in the late, 60's and 70's, she was attracting romance little candy like Claire's Knee. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's heroes do not sell the old boy, and he is not always a student of human nature, not an ideologist, as "L'Anglaise et le duc" continues. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's characters are never "bad guys" and "good guys", they are primarily humans and restrictions to exhibit all kinds of human potential, so films are always provocative and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> Now for technological nuts and bolts. <br /> <br /> Rohmer is still in the 80's, but still in front of cinematic innovations. "L'Anglaise" is like something you have never seen before. You've guessed, the old man, many of the festival directors this year were digital. <br /> <br /> All the external images of the film can actually be brought to life in the Parisian setting in the 1780s, without being surprised by the reality of the movie. <br /> <br /> Toronto this year is one of the world's oldest young directors. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify, as well as some of the oldest in the world." Long-lasting young people, older masters, and young people also stand on film cuts. life-long Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br />
