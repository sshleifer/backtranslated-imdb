SPOILERS Sex huh? It is one of the most important parts of human life. But can we never take it seriously? People always want more, even if they are on the agenda and unlucky, there are potential life-changing results. Almost all of us claim that all of us have started to engage in sexual relations at the young and younger age (even though Victorians marry and have children in their early years), so it is increasingly difficult for those who go for a point like girls. On Steve Carell's first big screen, a man who has won 40 people without control is playing. It is not a funny thing to intervene in many of the tragic and extreme sexual situations, rather than to blame more than the Eurotrash Episode. That's why it's a great surprise that there's an incredible number of inconveniences, unsuccessful jokes, brand-name, and hysterical release of the audience. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a wonderful person with a good job and a pleasant temperament. At the same time, he takes his life very seriously and after inviting you to the poker game as a member of the necessary fifth, Andy's comrades discover his secret. At age 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for many reasons, on the contrary, unfortunately, three people (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Romany Malco) advise Andy for the same purpose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br In an impressive way, "40-year-old Baki" is also unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Carell is a unit that has been hoping for a perfect, shy appearance for perfection, and Carell is gradually becoming more and more sure to start helping her. <br /> <br /> Carell is not alone in performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener love are as good as interest. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise about this film is not something that Rudd shares with Roghin the best scene and is loved by her lover, David. <br /> <br /> Many of the jokes hit the brand, but in a really clever way back to the head of the message. Obviously, it is designed for Conservative America, and all the sound of the film is one of the safest sex and flaws of a simple story of sexual conquest. The virgin does not need sex to complete her life, she needs only trust and true love. <br /> <br /> A decent message and considerable improvement to propagate something in the past. <br /> <br /> Continuous funny and well-behaved, here is, "40-year-old Virgin" alone. Take a good message and you're good on a good comedy. Amazing joy.
