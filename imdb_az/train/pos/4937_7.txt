Taking into account the threats of bio-terrorism and superbugs, the West Nile Virus and the SARS, this movie really is today. As a tension, the voltage is too tight. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more involved in their roles. The interior scenes between Widmark and his wife make a good intervention to the main area. The most common trace of this film is the actor Jack Palance. Its sharply-defined features and, in a seemingly rare appearance, are always the way to discover the treacherous and cruel man on the surface. But the packaging scene with the packaging plant is also effective today. Recommended, 7/10.
