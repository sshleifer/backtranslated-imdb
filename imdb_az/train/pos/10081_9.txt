Rich, rich and very good film, which is a rich and meaningful story. In fact, the old master tells the story of how to find a heir to continue his artistry, but many men can not get what he expects in his ruling world. The heroes should then settle their situation and the old master must fight the confrontation between his wife and her husband and the traditional concepts of society and society. <br /> <br /> The story is entertaining, emotional, and intricate. The research of heroes, their lives and emotions is rich and the development of characters is strong, and the characters are not complex and dimensioned. The film reveals the emotions of an elderly person and the desire to find an heir, and shows how he and his child are able to handle the situation. There are sometimes gentle, as well as humor at the appropriate points. The film also explores the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture, and creates more interest and depth in the film. <br /> <br /> Director, actor and decor are all outstanding. Added to other powerful, rich and convincing visuals and attractive, realistic characters. <br /> <br /> Someone claims that the end of the film weakens the film, but I do not agree. Maybe it would be stronger with a different end, but any change in the overall movie would be very small.
