What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and Fear is different and original. She really brought me to the monsters of the '80s. The budget is obviously less and everyone's lens is not behind Pacino, but it's not important because it does not take it seriously once. The trash redneck, which moves to the high-flying martial arts of the Black Sea, is actually a b-film gem. Hold some snacks, snacks and several friends, and come back and relax. I enjoyed this movie, bought all 3 Fears movie. Of course, not for everyone, but for each one of them. Sometimes it is necessary to lower the meditation lid and smile.
