The French and the Belgians did the best. Stylish, visually inventive, exciting and emotionally challenging story. Director Jaco van Dormael calls us to the world of Georges, a Down syndrome patient, and a meaningful relationship with everyone, everyone. It is not a patronizing way, it is a great entertaining feeling and honesty. <br /> <br /> Eighth Day Barry Levinson puts on a Hollywood surprise, like the Oscar-winning Rain Man or Robert. Zemeckis Forrest Gump is good and really shade. <br /> <br /> Milos calls a fist of one of Forman's humor, a good size of Dennis Potter's shades on Kuku's Slot. <br /> <br /> Harry, Daniel Auteuil, who is emotionally extinguished and desperate, is still another great performance. But brilliantly adapted to Georges by Pascal Duquenne. Shoe shop scene, car showroom scene, George's Creator's "Jesus knows me" dances, conference scenes, fireworks scene - are equally powerful performances and numerous, memorable sets. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing. Just rent it and you'll soon see a demonstration in a retro movie theater and see what's missing. Better buy this movie. The elegant genius .....
