This will be a different kind of research. I've seen this movie twice on TV, and it's one of my favorite times to be there when I'm in Panama City and during a winter beach season. It was the first movie I saw by Ashley Judd and she was great and I loved everything I saw. The Sundance Reaction also impressed me, as director Victor Nunez has shot and wrote several films about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I have not seen anything to compare it. The plot speaks less about me. Yes, I said this would be a different view.
