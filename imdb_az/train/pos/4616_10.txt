The name of this film is taken from a party game called "Seven Minutes in Heaven". When he was a high school student in Brooklyn, NY, he was popular with my friend's friends and described it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other preteen kissing games. According to the rules, the name of a boy and a girl, and those chosen were ordered to enter into a dark closet and stay there for seven minutes. Meanwhile, the party's guest was speculating about whether the latter was nervous about holding hands, hiding and / or kissing each other in secret privacy. At the end of seven minutes, the leader of the game beat "Time up" or the door of the cupboard, and the pair would come out of the wardrobe. After being questioned by other guests, couples must admit their work in "Seven Minutes of Heaven". After all other guests did not attend, other couples would be selected to access the glass. <br /> <br /> Such games served as social "ice breakers" for children and adolescents, but it can be embarrassing and intimidating to scream. . The film is named because it links the teenagers' first experiences with crushing and romantic love.
