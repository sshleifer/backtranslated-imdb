I think you should avoid getting too much jokes from the US. But if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. Of course, we can not compare the quality of the film, but the arrival of the cameraman has been made publically. Killer Tomato is 100 times better than Nepolean Dynamite. It's just my idea. I am convinced that the French people will not appreciate the French cartoons. So this movie is not for the world audience. I am not a trained movie critic, I know what I want. I could not stop laughing throughout the entire movie. My side and jaws were damaged at the end of the movie.
