15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" was not too late or even more. This is one of those who are trying to deal with the second sad side of the war. Unlike movies such as "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo", which used to represent the main symbols as a bad hero after the war, the film's audience differs from Vietnam's wines. Their development was preceded by war and especially in a very precise way. Problems are obvious, but in all this tragedy there is always a sense of hope and love based on friendship. "Jacknife" can be the quietest Vietnamese movie, but in about 15 years it's really good and justified. In addition, we believe that war is not over. at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> Three key characters are incredible. De Niro did his best, but Ed Harris was the star of this movie. Maybe it was the best performance.
