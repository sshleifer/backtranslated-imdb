I found the most unpleasant Muppets movie because I felt that I was the most beloved, and most of the lines had been funny. Muppets are trying to go to Broadway to sell their original music, but along the way, they run to ordinary problems, including the memory of Kermit's memory. There is also a big crowd here, like the original Muppets Movie, but also Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simply, most of the lines are time-consuming and the delivery is great, and the situations they find themselves Muppets are cheerful. The original songs are good here and the latter is satisfactory. You can not talk much about the movie, but the Muppet fan should be convinced. It is sure to enjoy the funniest Muppet movie and all. <br /> <br /> *** *** 1/2 out of ****
