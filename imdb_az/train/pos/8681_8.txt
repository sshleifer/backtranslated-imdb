This cartoon is a short, yet sophisticated piece of work on the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a short article that incredibly small gnomes are responsible for the return of the underground every spring, and even have to deal with a winter that is not yet ready. Gnomes and storm have both their own songs. It's pretty much the area. But this is about the cartoon area, not about color and animation. Visuals are exceptional. In 1936, such a bright color was still something, and there is some incredible inspiration here. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are the movement of compressed colors through tubes. At several points, a number of pipes are aligned from the top to the top and the colors move from the pipes and the music path looks like a pipe body. <br /> <br /> The visions of the battle between burning greenery and the quiet winter storm are quite well executed. These types of shorts were what were mentioned for Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, but they probably have been the last to leave the MGM because the cartoon was probably out of the budget and the MGM finally decided that costs could be managed better. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful cartoon and worth seeing. '30s Characters are available for DVD attack. Especially if you like good animation, come.
