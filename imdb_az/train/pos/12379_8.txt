This film was a usheret in the old theater of northern California after leaving. The DVD is as good as on the big screen, it's terrifying and terrible. Although it's been about 9 years since I was looking, it's still one of my favorites. Under the risk of sounding, "They will not do anything like this anymore!" The Eighth Sense has surprised all this, it is definitely for you! Great story, amazing casting of characters, malicious setting; Even the soundtrack has its invaluable quality. I recommend you not follow it individually. Only in 1977, when you rent an apartment in a coffeehouse, you will be at least 10 times so far.
