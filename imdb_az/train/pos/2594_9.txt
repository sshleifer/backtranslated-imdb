This film took Jerry Springer's approach to super-human power. "Wilder Napalm" is a favorite theme movie about the idea that American lovers are determined by their own gifts or attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film pointed out that not every prodigy is more fearful or worship than just human but other people. It was a spectacular comedy, fun and easy-to-reach.
