If Lost initially did not want to jump on the group, I accidentally had an episode at the beginning of the season, one by one polar bear, and has not lost my focus since. Show, that is. Not a polar bear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br deeply and sincerely to the island and to every character, gradually adds its advanced depth? Where did they come from? It soon becomes apparent that they are acting as a common denominator for many things in their lifetime, whether they run away from the rest of the island (between Sawyer and Kate and others) or relate to spirituality (Locke, Claire). . But Lost is a mysterious horror that resides on the island itself and at home ... and it's all strangely intertwined. <br /> <br /> Television actors, the "Lost", which depicts sensitive or dazzling performance, are actually spectacular actors for their part, and their speeches heart and humor. Like most television shows, there are also many eyecandy but generally not plastic Hollywood. All of the characters are very realistic and are extremely compelled to watch. Their mutual relationships rarely damage the anticipated happiness, minor arguments, or cheerless melodramas (even if any treacherous secret)? these people are primarily trying to survive, and the act of looking at a second is viewed as a second. The reality of these characters is now aided by a sculptural plot. <br /> <br /> About this plan ... Think of a tree like a branch of the template area, then branch branches (in this case, a branch for each character)? Well, Lost, adds twigs to each branch, and then to small pieces like other poems. If you are one of the main characters of Flashbacks, you will get your own story. If you are a Dog, you will have your own story. If writers put together one another, they build themselves up, unless they eventually become a few famous winds. <br /> <br /> And if the writers are banned from doing this, "Lost" is probably possible, but I am sure that this show will be a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> 9/10
