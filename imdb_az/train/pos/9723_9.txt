I really love this movie! When he first saw his poster, it was another easy romantic comedy, but it's more than that! Personally I believe that this idea is a part of the great concept of the movie itself (or even marketing strategy) before I see a good part of the audience! I want to say: Today we are in the pictures! For the show! I went to the cinema because I looked at the wrong impression and mistaken expectations of this movie, and eventually I felt that I could be superficial! For example, when he came to a sequence until Sidney's plane ticket was returned to New York and he was required to sign a ticket, he thinks he now receives a television scandal due to the award-winning type of award. And that's just what I believe is the peak of this key theme that begins around this film. On top of that, I believe the film also offers a solution to the story we are talking about with Sidney's attitude on this subject: there is nothing serious about you or anyone else ... "Even the saints were people" ... Sophie once in the movie he says. The saints are the stars. We have given them perfection 'aura', eternal happiness, but the reality is less than that. Even the saints of any religion are ideal models of how to behave, how to behave, and how to live your life. Even though they were not true ... after their death, we became "real" and we looked at them. And catch it: we need our saints! We need our stars! We endeavor to endeavor to endeavor to strive for them, so that we will not endeavor. Television and all other media are the means to create and capture our success. We need absolute measurements to measure ourselves. To watch this film first, there is such a thing in the film: whether we can adjust to the size of the comparison, or the criterion is small for us. This time it was bigger than expected.
