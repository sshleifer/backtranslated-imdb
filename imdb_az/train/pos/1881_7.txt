Like Alcoholic millionaire Playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as a trained adult in childhood. It turns out that the role is perfectly compatible with Moore, and it also traps him as an actor. Soon he was followed by a lot of disappointment (including the faded continuation of this film), but it can not diminish the charm or charm of this cleverly-written and directed photo. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are compelled, the film's pieces are shaking, but pouring is very happy that it can resist a tough movie. This is a very great heart and Oscar winner John Gielgood gives Arthur vale a tough, dry fun role, like Hobson; Connection with Arthur is delicious and a miraculous relationship. Liza Minnelli (like a blue-collar love affair) is a low-humped naked and Moore is fragile, but she is seductive and lively; He never shook the shadow of Arthur, but at least we liked this document very much.
