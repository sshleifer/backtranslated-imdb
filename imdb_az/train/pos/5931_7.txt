Though it is a writer by Stephen King, this is a really fun B movie. Vampire, enchanting creatures living in a candy house and virgins, great cemetery scenery, heroic cats and very beautiful virgin life force. The soundtrack has Enya music, it's a very nice idea ... Beautiful. I am convinced that the King is disappointed with this little movie, though unhappy dialogue and ideas are all taken from the real and tiring King Potatoes. (Though I think temporarily, the Sleepwalkers are a script without a novel or a short story behind it). Still, the touch of the sewer-odors shows that after all, he did not use a ghost-writer ...
