Farrah Fawcettin Marjorie played the vertical drama drawn by William Mastrosimone, attacked by his rifleman Joe (James Russo). He tries to get away, but the police say that he does not have anything to tell him. However, Joe realized that he had received his purse and knew where he lived. When his boss, Pat (Alfre Vudard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are dismissed, Joe makes a visit to complete his start. Joe's humiliating and humiliating her in different ways, she gets the chance to go back and arrest her. <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> </ span> <br /> <strong> The result of the film is the camp between two opponents. Marjorie shows such an aggression that he should not be surprised, as does his non-existence. Fawcett does not work enough, and Russo is as good as the immoral reptile who does all he can to manipulate the situation. For the majority of the operating cycle, there are only two characters on the screen, with intimate nature suggesting that the movie works better on stage. Director Robert M. Young does not hesitate to go beyond this ugly and more exploitative element of the situation; The film is sometimes concerned about watching. <br /> <br /> Marjorie has, of course, sufficiently changed so far, so it's not easy to encourage her to go to the blood, and it can lead to Pat's hopes. <br /> <br /> "Extremities", I felt, was a very good film that at least had a curiosity and a high enough intensity level. Woodard and Scarwid are both good (Scarwid, Terry has a great moment when it turns out to be a victim of aggression) and the speed is stable. Of course, dialogue is not always too sharp, but the material is compelled by every step. <br /> <br /> 8/10
