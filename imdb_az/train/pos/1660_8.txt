I'm an admirer of ART, I do not want anything about art, paintings, sculptures, etc. I love. This film shows it, so I love it, it shows that a woman wants to paint anything about Art, especially bare bodies. At the beginning of the film itself was painted naked, but wanted a man for his painting, but his family could not do it because of his serious family (father) because his family did not allow him to paint his naked man. Even Artemisia could have completely dumped her boyfriend and art teacher. He is fond of art teacher, and the art teacher is totally loved by him, so he eventually sacrifices his own freedom to falsehood. He said he was raping, but that was not true. Artemisia was in love with her, but Artemisia, a father and a teacher of art, told her that if she had been hurt to deliver her hands to the truth, she would suffer much. Here is a great film about ART and an artistic love. Valentina Cervi is as great as Artemisia, she works very well, and I love the performance of Pansy Osmond as "a portrait of a lady." 8.5 / 10
