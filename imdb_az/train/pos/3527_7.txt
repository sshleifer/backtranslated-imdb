Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets with a mysterious woman at the bar (Fay Helm) and invites her to see a show with her. He agrees not to exchange information about one another - even the names. Sometimes this is the best date. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was killed. His wife is a mystery woman, but nobody can remember her as a result, and Scott has been sentenced to die for her husband's murder. <br /> <br /> <strong> There is an article about the events in the Caucasus. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Kansas's attempts to reach the truth. It is a claustrophobic place where some of the memorable scenes that follow with the bartender on the Mac (Andrew Tombes) and his drummer Cliff (Elisha Cook Jr) are compelled to dance, drink and dance with her friends. This is a clear picture of sexual desire that an undivided part of the film is that everyone is intensely and rhythmically swept during the scene. Ella Raines is good in female leadership and Thomas Gomez is a cheerful cop. Alan Curtis began as a mixed, innocent man, but once he was arrested, for some reason, Kansasa was totally unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film is about half a day. But this is not important. In fact, we will add the tension and dramatic development of this event because we will find out what happened to Kansas and then to hell! It's a good movie with some beautiful scenes, but though Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I have never seen him anywhere ... I do not attach a necklace to anyone .....
