<br /> <br /> <strong > This is a film that took place in Los Angeles in the late 1960s and early 1970s. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that will be watched on a few psychological substances, taking into account H-I-G-H. <br /> <br /> Find some kind of bulbs or find smoked or diminished pickles. Seriously, these straight and sober visions of ZP do not give up. <br /> <br /> When I left this movie on the big screen (because I was lucky to do it three times in the 1990s, ZP was pretty rare), and I do not know what this film is about. <br /> <br /> If you insist that you are not drunk, at least, when it's happening, Pink Floyd's "Ada, Eugene Careful", "Come on 51, Greater Than Time".
