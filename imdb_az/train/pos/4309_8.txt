Many comments hit me as an excuse to lose my point. Kasdan wants to live his life simply. It is a well-structured story that has accidentally changed lives, and then silent and the film ends up making it a bigger canvas. There are so many illuminations in this movie, and then they move. Sometimes they can keep their thoughts, sometimes they do not know it, and this is really a way of life. In other words, Muscle is a traditional dramatic structure that supports the study of the sustainability of life. A happy ending, just a finish; and before that everything is still in the process, is it always in the occupation? and if you insist on a matter completely, investigating the miraculous role in our lives. What is a miracle? Life itself, for a start. Then add all the occasional events and link links that make life or each other connected to each other, and you have miracles by bucketful. Kasdan emphasizes this subject very lightly and in the center of the film, Mac and his wife dream each other dreamed of their dreams, the most memorable way in the film center, and how the film then demonstrated their power in the film to shape the reality of those dreams shows. It's not a movie with an easy or open message. You just have to let go in front of you, and then sit down for a few days, one month, several years, and see what you have done there. Certainly the best film of Kasdan is the oldest, most humane. Great thinking about one of our most talented writers and executives. The tragedy, of course, is that it is not allowed to work for several years, mostly with studio restrictions around Dreamcatcher. Hopefully we have not heard the latest Larry Kasdan. A great film by a great artist. Remember, art does not need to be complicated by art to succeed.
