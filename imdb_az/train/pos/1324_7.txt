You sit there for half an hour and tell the story by explaining the story, then look at the half-hour of the same story ... then put it again. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most fascinating feature films in the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know - except for Andrew Jarecki's "catching the Fridman" - nothing like Anna Broinowski's "Forbidden Lie $". <br /> <br /> <strong> Asked, illustrated, defended, clarified, and questioned everything about Norma Xuri, author of Honor Lost, the best and most lambasted 2001 salesman in Jordan. The film is so exciting that Khouri's "opening" is done with the full participation of Xuri. <br /> <br /> For the initial part of the film, Xuri presents his story about the murder of her husband. Amman, the story of the book. <br /> <br /> Then his stories are explained separately by incredible and convincing people, such as women in Jordan, human rights defenders, investigative journalists and Hurry's Australia. for a while. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It will reduce the value of consciousness, because it should not be pointed out that another part of the threat is coming ... and then Xouri comes back and faces accusations (not the main issues of the book). And the Houdini movement continues in surprise after the surprise, in this heavyweight, falling prize, and there is no "happy end" in terms of resolution. Brilliant.
