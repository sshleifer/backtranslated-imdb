An interesting story based on a true story is accused of killing a baby girl in Australia, Lindy Cumberland (Meryl Streep). He insists that a dingo has taken his baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film, in essence, is an environmental media story that tells what the Australians have done in the press, and the lingual mobi mentality, which leads to the conviction of a woman, is based on any heavy evidence. I love movies, I like movies that are interested in the media about how people are trained by the justice system. I always thought that before the execution of their duties, jury members should show 12 angry men. As it is often said, it is not a liberal movie, but because we are human because of the clinical outlook, the events, the prejudices and the vengeful intentions. A mixed pain also clinically. Schepisi focuses on not making the film melodramatic. Some may find the movie boring or dry, but I found it attractive.
