It's in the same league as The Black Cat, but I'm going to give 9+ instead of 9. <br /> <br /> Part of the "Invisible Ray" is horror, partly drama and, of course, part of philosophy science. The science elements for the film shot in 1936 were preceded by a good job. <br /> <br /> Lugoshi and Carloff's actions could not have been good. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer, James Whale did it very quickly. What I'm saying is that this movie is heartwarming and well shot. With the gargoyles outside the Lugosi room, the scene is a perfect example of a mood. <br /> <br /> Why is it unclear, just like the Black Cat and the Lost Spirits Island? the movie has not yet been published on the DVD. <br /> It's even more amazing when you think of a few junk that have been moved to DVD. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this chance, watch the movie. When released on a DVD, hold it fast and place it in a respectable place inside your DVD library.
