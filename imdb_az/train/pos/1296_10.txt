In particular, it is a very difficult film that targets the innermost core of our lives. But in the end it is a very nice and deep film. Everyone who has difficulty has to say that the whole message of the film should not have satisfied the point. Indeed, for those watching the film, the way to solve issues is entirely important, and they see it as a lasting one. Of course, watching is hard, difficult, and even cruel. But it is very important for society and everyone. This shows the peak of what is happening in the world cinema (I will not limit this process to France) and everyone should try to see it. We can say that it is good to go with a clear head without going through conflicts, and only the film will work for you.
