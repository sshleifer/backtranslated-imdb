When I sat down to watch, I did not know the real facts, but it was true based on a real story. After the death of his father's father, Rhonda tries to help Desiree daughter ... (I do not know that one who can not cope with the loss really names their descendants). This is really designed for children because they often engage in "family" boards (say that you keep going, and everyone will be together for a single review), but talking about the death of a parent and really does not speak to anyone . The area is quite interesting and it is good enough. The organizer is pretty good, Mathis and Ferland and his peers (with a few exceptions) are most convincing (and obviously they worry about, and then again, I am not really in the audience in this regard). Editing and cinematography are standard and, of course, not less. Although humor is limited to a few fun lines, the tone is not unpleasant. There is a tense scene or two bullies. I offer this to fans of such films. 7/10
