Deanna Durbin said he was creating young people. This first movie was one of the best. This joked story was presented as "Miss Fixit" in the division of the family with 14-year-old Deanna, a beautiful beauty with a beautiful voice, divorce. See other IMDb entries for field summary, but quickly, Deanna and her two older sisters plan to go from Switzerland to America to prevent their father's re-marriage. Best Supporting Sisters, Barbara Read and Nan Gray, with the best direction and correction, are able to attract even when watching the movie directly. Deanna's only three songs come from the classic repertoire Il Bacio, but when he reads on the station station, the film's history is followed. Deanna, at least 15 years old, was for this audience, who was a signal for life with classic music. One of the great touchs on the SMART GIRLS is a brief definition that extends drunkenness to Deanna's final look, as the police are hitting him! The success of this film, the subsequent writers of the Durbin tools were soon locked on the obsolete "Miss Fixit". Deanna never herself. As an actress she is, of course, questioned more than her charisma. It seems to me that many other films have replaced "nature" because of their lack of identity. 21 worked well for the feature film.
