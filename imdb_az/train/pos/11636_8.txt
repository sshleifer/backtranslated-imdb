A beautiful film shot, made a good move, intensively scripted tension film. It was on the edge of my seat. I loved the very important actress and thought that the abusive man had done a very good job. Here's not a lot of chewing it on a theme, but if you're sitting in it, turn off your brain, watch the fancy camera work, and enjoy the plot, and you'll have a great time. Those who are well-worn and regularly filmed will likely know how much or little they can expect in about ten minutes. But it did not bother me, and I was very pleased to watch it. In the old days, they could not just focus on two characters, and some of the other charming moments when some other people were hoping to draw a few lines. But this nation probably had to justify the film very tightly. The field took me early from the throat and never left me. It is not a good idea to think too much in the film or later. I do not believe in that sense. Just sit back and enjoy.
