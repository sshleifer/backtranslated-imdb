This reminded Spinal Tap of a more serious level. The story of a band's reunion tour, but there is no match between them. I'm particularly sorry for Billy's work like Ray. She was sorry for her, but she had a heartbeat about her. Your favorite band is highly recommended, it's a great movie to watch if you've ever seen pick up, old and pathetic.Bittersweet.
