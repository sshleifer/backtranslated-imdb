In 1942, MANHATTAN TALES talked about a number of stories which were largely inaccurate, but matched with men's evening dresses. Each story passed from one owner (eg, Charles Boyer) to another (Ceasar Romero). WINCHESTER '73 has a superb movie and a great western, similar plot twist. First, Jimmy Stewart's Stephen (Horace) MacMahon is to look for any deadly insult. Two people go to the filming competition, Marshall Wyatt Earp - one of the new Winchester rifles given by Will Geer. Stewart hardly broke MacMahon, but the stolen arms were stolen and chased. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Charles Drake, Dan Duryea (delightful deadly and psychotic Waco Johnny Dean), for MacMahon. Finally he returns to Stewart. <br /> <br /> The film is featured by Anthony Mann. Each character has extensive experience. Duryea receives a rifle from Drake's dead body (Duryea raises the issue). But it is not a fool enough to fight for the Duryea rifle - it lost MacMahon'a faster than the shooting. She and Shelley look at MacMahon as Winter, Duryea is horrified by an armed man to ask why MacMaho is causing the violence, while killing former Spyder Drake Winter (suddenly). Philosophically, Duryea says she can wait. Some opportunities will come later (ie, MacMahon can safely kill and take back the rifle). <br /> <br /> The heroes are quite human. Winters first appears to be the future of Drake, but he really sees a great deal of negative for him - a pardon party. Drake is aware of this break and causes it to be destroyed. Other symbols, like J. F. Flippen, have Steward and Steward's wife, Millard Mitchell, as realistic trends like a soldier sergeant in India. Yes, Flippe's assistant, Tony Curtis. Flippen believes that this soldier may have been in a hundred battlefields since 1861. Steward has shown his feelings in other films. EVERYBODY IN THE EVE, when he thought that his life was wrong, he showed a degree of anger and showed a close nervous breakdown. But here he showed an angry demon - at the expense of a surprising Duryea (usually such an anger). <br /> <br /> The parts of this film come together with Mann's authorized hands. Because the audience is watching the Winchester rifle's journey, it's a never-ending western.
