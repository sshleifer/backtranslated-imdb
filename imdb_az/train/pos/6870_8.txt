From the start to the end, I laughed at the whole movie. The Groove Tube is probably the most advanced comedic skate movie, and it's best to watch TV alone. This is not to be bored in the channels that suffer from insomnia alone! Strange, strange humor never stops for 73 minutes! Imagine that this excitement laughs more easily than life! This way is better than the Comedy Center or any time! Give yourself a blessing and put all the soft, shaded romantic comedy films into the trash bag! Better still want your box office manager back on the big screen, "The Groove Tube".
