Mark Frechette Mark, a college radical soloist. Mark was charged with killing police during a campus rebellion and escaped all the way down the desert. Doing so by stealing a small plane at a local airport and flies itself. <br /> <br /> After fleeing in the desert, Mark put the air on the ground. She goes to a young woman called Daria and sees around Marc on the plane. Mark dropped the airplane a few times and Daria causes duck or shot. He gets acquainted with Daria, who is strangely attractive by the land sparks of Mark. <br /> <br /> After spending hours talking, Mark and Daria are barefooted and they love the sand. However, they must realize that they must continue to escape by escaping from the Law. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was Eraserhead, which took place in the early 70's. In both films, along with complicated meanings and symbols, there is an uncertain, uncertain quality. Frechette was unknowable because of his character in this film. A few years after Zabriski Point, a bank in Frechette robbed a real life. Mark Marks died before his death. He was killed in weightlifting with a weight of 150 lbs. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is its outstanding cinematography and special visual effects. After an explosion, the incredible, slow-moving scenes of shattering in the air were even a hit. Even though it is not like filming Easy Rider, Zabriski Point has resonated with anti-culture in the early 1970s. I advise those who love avant-guard films that reflect the severity of the youth revolt in the early 70's.
