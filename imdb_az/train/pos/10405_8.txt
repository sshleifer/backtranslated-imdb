This movie was one of my childhood favorites, and I must say that at that time, I liked that the Buddhist thief, in contrast to other films, had the quality of my growing up. This can be viewed and used only by adults, not just a movie that is loved by children. There is a disadvantage that one does not cross the bad effects (as opposed to today's), as with a child. I did not remember anything from these ideas, of course, ten years have passed since I was ten years old. Who is watching the effects? One is just looking for good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this movie is about. In my opinion, this movie is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. I feel like Indiana Jones looks like this movie. All this has a comedy, romance and adventure. It creates a wonderful mix of things to keep you from the beginning to the end, and although the film is old, the music and style of the movies are not up-to-date, it's dusty and old. All of this is mainly related to a great story, good leadership and good performances by actors. Soap (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (like Jaffar) divide most of the film's comedy and cold elements. Great movie and though an 'oldie' is definitely a goldie '. I hope someone's brain and courage are a DVD today. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8
