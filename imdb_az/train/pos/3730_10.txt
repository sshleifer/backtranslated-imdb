If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it, Tigerland is the movie for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The perfect scenes of this movie are so realistic; It's not like a drama that's happening in real life. Boy, I tell you ... REAL Drama They really do not fight in one of the scenes (tell your DVD it is unclear). I see it as a group of desperate young people who want to escape from a film that protects themselves from this film, Saving Private Ryan and then evaluates what is "a threatening threat" and how exactly does the people in the movie feel? . I see this movie between Stand By Me and Private Ryan Save. What do people do when they are in a "burdened" position in real life? Some people are naked, some are crying, some are fisted, some are narcotics, and some are accidentally trying to overcome love with brothels, while others feel guilty by overcoming the pain, skipping some buildings or bridges, and others feel so sick that these illnesses are physically collapsed. This movie has all the hopeless feelings rolling into a ball. But do not take me with a movie that does not make a mistake, its true, very humorous film, the rough and funny Bozz (Collin's Character), and there are also about five female actresses in the film; I'll let them know what's going on! In addition to relevant music, dialogue, war / movement schemes, perfect scenes; all of this movie, I said down from the top. Under Tigerland's weight. The best thing about having a movie is to write a great article on the cover, "The Best Movie of the Year", and it's totally nothing. It keeps rare stones from Hollywood, 10/10.
