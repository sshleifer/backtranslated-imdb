This show was Fabulous. It was inkwriting and well-written and all the characters who could be fond of being sweet. Even the benevolent lover was like Jonathan Cake. It was a pleasure to see a drama with lots of soap operas, since our air waves were full of American dancing and dancing with stars. It was always interesting to see how each character depends on the next situation. Indeed, we do not pay attention to the majority that annoying that we finally get a show that is a little bit thrilling and thrown thanks to many mysterious numbers. Some of us are not sheep. This show will be missed by many loyal fans, not by many people.
