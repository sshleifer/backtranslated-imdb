This is a really nice movie! When I was really young, I remembered it for the first time, and once every week I was watching ... Shadow movie was my favorite character. Homeward Bound is really funny and it's really nice how animals have grown up to do all this. The parts of the movie are sometimes sad (eg, Sassy, ​​cats, mud, and shade, when the hole pours out). I had seen the second Homeward Bound, but it was necessary to say that it was not good. the first one. The shadow is clever, Sassy, ​​good, Sassi and Chance are also funny. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedies or speaks to animals. This is one of my top ten movies!
