"If I sit down, I will never stop," says the mother (a hood) when she tells her son to rest a bit (she is only a widow). It is almost like a woman who is in her age and in her condition: to rest in peace, to neglect her. But it's still not for "rest" yet. In her life there is a daughter who criticizes her for every catastrophe ... Suddenly, it comes in a single: sex and passion in the form of a 30-year-old muscle carpenter (Daniel Craig, new James Bond) "When he thinks he will never touch anyone." This is a story that allows her to think about some 60 of her life as part of her life when her husband dies. Even though we are so developed in this regard. By the way, no one was surprised that Sean Connery was a lover in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what else did you think? An old woman, a young man ... Well, you're not ready for that? <br /> <br /> The film has intimist tones throughout its entire length, with the exception of 2 or 3 sequences. breaks in tones, and comes with several open and foul-mouthed dialogues. The relationship between the boy and the girl's mother's lover (which is quite absurd - I know what I mean when you explain it) - The elements of "mother" are these vulgar touches and the way. <br /> <br /> My degree is: 7/10
