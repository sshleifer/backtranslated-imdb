I remember that I've been a Star Trek fan for a long time. <br /> <br /> I am very excited when I announce the 5th series planning and premiere. <br /> <br /> The company's premiere was worth the wait. Performed a great job done by the perfect setting and all the characters. <br /> <br /> NX-01, Enterprise is a perfect boat to show the start of what many people love. <br /> <br /> Scott Bakula is as superior as Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave the team performance like Subcommander T'Pol. <br /> <br /> Only two of these beautiful new crew are bravely preparing us to take on the great history of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> The enterprise will be a good team to look at,. See it.
