It was a lovely kind of childhood - I remember and remember it with television. Now I grew up and I have a child myself, and I would like to introduce him to this classic movie. We looked at last Friday and loved it. When my son struggled with the giant spider, my son's hands fell to the ground and he caught me - he was really scared. "Will he knock the spider, Poppa?" Just look, you'll see. There is no historical framework to talk since age eight, so Aaron al-Rasheed's granddaughter might be beside Baghdad Ã–zma. <br /> <br /> I think he was heroic and charming, but not by a thief who was a thief. In fact, if you deconstruct a part of the movie, the king is a hero, not a hero who should be very happy with the young, the thief is sidekick. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a period of time - I think I'm eleven or twelve years old, and my son can find this "rooted" or whatever next word he / she will use at that time. The story of love is not one-sided - as a cynical friend, "Ahmed loves a prince." Abu (pbuh) threatened himself (for many times) for an extravagant, self-denying ruler, but when he accepted the flying mechanical horses, the fifty-footed gin and the All-Seeing Eye It is too much to talk about such things when accepting the temple. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy being fulfilled at the peak of the film is so great that it is the ultimate stroke of seeking a "little fun and adventure" by flying over a "stolen" magic carpet.
