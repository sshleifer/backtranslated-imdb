We know that many people in our lives will meet once in our lives, but for some reason we remember these people in the rest of our lives. It happens only once among the people who are in the long run between friendships and there are some natural reasons why we do not always meet these people. We do not always know their names because we have never been offered each other, and sometimes we ask what their names are. It is funny how united by humankind among random comrades, and we do not want to do anything like this, because reunion can spoil the memories of the memories or we do not know it. <br /> <br /> The movie "Before the Sun" was followed by me. I was never going to watch it, but as the discussions between the couples seemed interesting, I looked at the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect, but there were no young couples. They had time to meet each other as much as they could before the sunrise and separation. I believe that this movie has good reviews because the situation is that everyone on this planet has lived at least once or twice. This is what we all think about all the people we once met in our lives.
