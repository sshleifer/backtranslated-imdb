I've seen this movie twice in public performances and really liked it. I was working in the Jane Finch community, and I really feel that the film really touches the essence and taste of society - nervousness, resoluteness, admiration, creativity, ugliness. Writing, dialogue, and acting are exhausted, and I have drawn myself to the story of Raya, a young woman who struggles to reach the goal and loses her self in the process. Large dance sequences, and not just smooth and electrically moving bodies, the camera also acts with great fluidity and intelligence. All characters are multifaceted - absolutely good or bad, and female characters are admirably stronger. It is a film that has a strong heart mind and a celebration of the irresistible spirit of young people, hip hop and Jane Finch.
