I've been a Producer Accountant in this movie, so I have not seen some noise, so I'm not entirely unbiased, but if I'm afraid I would say that. I thought it was not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but a fun movie, but there were many laughs along the way. The Bible says that laughter is as good as medication, so watching this movie can be good for your health. <br /> <br /> Most actors in this picture are the movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, has become a bigger fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV once a week as a photographer in the Thirty-Something TV drama series. Robert Englund is later known as Freddie Krueger, still amazes people's dreams. This show was Dub Taylor, one of my personal favorite actors. He was an excellent comedian and was a really nice, sincere person. We all enjoyed this show and I think that's fun.
