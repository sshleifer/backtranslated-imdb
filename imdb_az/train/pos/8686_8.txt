The second official episode in the series "Columbo" (later "The Book of Crimes", shot for the first time). With Robert Falk's detective, Robert Culp is surprised to be the short-term leader of a prominent private detective whose bodyguard killed his spouse and refused to return to blackmail programs. Two stars, one of the best in the series, fit well in this smart cat and mouse exercise.
