In addition to the dramatist, a tremendous tension movie with a terrible slow camera work is a cure for watching and enjoying it. Author Writer Brian de Palma features many Hitchcock imitations (many call it "ripoff") and a 2.35: 1 wide-screen DVD camera work (and each side is filmed on a tape for film format). <br /> <br /> The film, which has at least the least negative quality of the movie, is played by the general sleaziness of all the characters, NYPD's Dennis Franz (here's the hair!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocked by Angie Dickinson's pretty long shower scene. <br /> <br /> Like Dickinson, there are several erotic scenes in the movie (though this is really close) and Nancy Allen is not ashamed to show her body. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes, and there is no bad language until after the murder of Franz. The first 36 minutes are rivets and although it is clear who the killer is, it is still a good tension and fun to watch all the ways for men who shade naked women.
