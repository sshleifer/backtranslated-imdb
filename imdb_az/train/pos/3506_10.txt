<br /> <br /> Peter Sollett has created a delightful portrait of real people living in poverty in New York or Loisida as it is known by local people. <br /> <br /> Sollettin's heart is in the right place when examining this unemployed family, which belongs to various "internal cities" of that country. Mr. Sollett stresses that the story presented is positive. They were basically good guys, children of parents separated from their parents and thrown under the wing of their grandmother. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting her characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows them all the positive side. These children are not involved in medicine or they are stealing because they are poor. When this story was made by Hollywood, we would see a stereotype parade, not just the struggling children, but the deeper ones who were not defeated. <br /> <br /> Viktor Rasuk Vahiy like Victor Vargas. He is natural. This is the case in March. His character does not deceive us, and shows us no nonsense girl to do something that she does not want. Altagracia Guzman, perfect as grandmother. It's about why he does not trust his grandchildren and why he does not care about things that matter to him. <br /> <br /> All this was a very good picture thanks to Peter Sollett.
