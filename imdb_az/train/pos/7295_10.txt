I accomplished this with my sweetheart in November 2005 at the New York International Film Festival. We were also struck by the complexity of the field and found it in an emotional move. It was well oriented with powerful images. The visual effects were nice - especially in short. It was a genuine fantasy approach on a very real and serious matter: this movie is about a young girl who was visited by a devil to help her with her abusive father. In the end, there is a surprise twist to protect me. It sounds like Gothic. I would like to see it as a full feature film. - Carrie
