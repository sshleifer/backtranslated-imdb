When I first watched, this was one of my favorite shows. Melissa Joan Hart was very laughable and talented, so the skills and other symbols and the star of the Salem Cat were quite funny. It was my first thought that Sabrina was a teenager in a middle school that fit into the witch's life. The most entertaining, most entertaining and best ... well. When I know Brad and Dreamer, I'm not a fan, because I liked Valerie very much, but the problem was just one season. If you can at least have new people. He did not love me like Josh, I preferred Harvey, but then he disappeared. and Libby! It would have been nice if you were exaggerated in your seven years' dissertation. and Mr Craftsman, if Zelda and Zelda were golden, were married. then Sabrina goes out of her lady's house and into the house of Roxie / Miles / Morgan. I did not like these people, I liked Sabrina. Sabrina has lost her charm and belongings and thinks that she can escape the life of the betrayers and that they are stupid stories. I paused for a while and worked again and again, and I was like kimo-hoo! LOL. I have not said that the last few seasons were terrible. They were saved from the brothers who were sent on the grounds that they were a great part of the show. then suddenly he allows the beautiful home move when he treats these two freeloader dirt like. and now he works in any magazine store, so they put the celebrity guest stars on the show if they have these remains in each episode. the program really disappeared and lost its glitter. I've seen the last episode. there was aunt (Zelda had been pushed) and she wanted to marry, but ended with Harvey. I would like to know what happened next. Well, my eyes and the only thing I can say is that Salima was a cat for seven years, and this is the only thing that makes her attractive.
