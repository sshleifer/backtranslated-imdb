The "fox and child" was a spectacular experience. <br /> <br /> Simple images, the landscape's integrity and reception, and the beautiful beauty of the characters have made me enjoy. <br /> Deceptively simple. <br /> <br /> <strong> "I trust you" I cried. I learned. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a self-confident movie. I say that love for an innocent heart is an act of love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once says that it is beyond the true art audience. From the standpoint of the ecstatic presence on the real side. I feel privileged to watch - not to participate - this is a movie, a real work of art.
