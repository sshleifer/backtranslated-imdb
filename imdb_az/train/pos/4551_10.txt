I have never seen such an incredible move in the movie I've seen when Daniel Day-Lewis plays "Kristi Braun in my left foot". In fact, the role of leaving the scene was not even finished. In the filmmaking, Christy Brown played a role as either a disabled or at least a disabled person, and his superfluous replacement required surgery. It is remarkable for me to say that he has played Oscar's decent performance at that time with all the pain that may play that role. He was so skilled in this tough, that no one could have been more or less influenced by him. I can not say the biggest film of the whole era, I can say how it played its role and acted as soon as it operated, no doubt I will never see an actor to make the biggest legs. Perhaps there is one issue.
