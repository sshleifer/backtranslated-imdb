Listen to many acerbic and derisory interpretations that fall on this movie ..... just put on ninja movies, it's as good as my friends are taking! <br /> Yes, unhappy, yes player and scenario are completely miserable, but with chewing gum - it's bloody! In fact, as in the B-Movies movie, this movie is really a pitiful "action" between the joys of my favorite days and is actually "ridiculous" <br /> <br /> Of course, battlefields are the key to this aspect and in most cases, I'm happy that they have done very good choreography, in particular (the witness we are witnessing later that the ninja is not restricted by the laws of normal gravity). <br /> <br /> If you are an admirer of Ninja movies, still trust me . After seeing Sakura Killers, in my opinion, you are missing from being one of the real stones on the genre's crown.
