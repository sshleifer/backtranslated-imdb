Yesterday I gave free access to the front of this movie and did not know what to expect. The stage seemed meaningless, and I would have been a very quiet, fun-nuanced humor. What a great surprise. I joked in some jokes and laughed too much. This film should be open for everyone who has a sense of humor and soft humor. Okay, it's not a movie to go with your little boy (Jack Palance?) Or with little kids. The language is bad, jokes (too) are raw, and sex is a graph as you can find anywhere. But surprisingly, the film is still a sweet love story. My daughter and I liked it. Steve Carell is terrific, but the player who supports (like Office) really does the movie job. All characters have flaws, but they also have depth and likeness. Everyone draws on their weight and chemistry is perfect. It is not possible to wait for the DVD to get. I'm sure there will be there for replays and quotable lines in Office Space.
