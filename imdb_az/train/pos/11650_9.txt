The most anticipated film of 2002. Rajini moved after this three-and-a-half-year hibernation. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini film, but also a moral message in this film. <br /> <br /> I will instead rate this movie instead of the scenario. <br /> <br /> Rajini, we should look at her film. Dont miss it!
