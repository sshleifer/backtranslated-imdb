It was one of the most funny and greatest sitcompes to reach national television. Unfortunately, the show was not placed among the bigger sitcoms it really is. The actors did a great job and one of the seasons was the show at the sixth highest point. Compared with the previous six of the season, it was still funny. It was a real problem starting season 8. Without the Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher, the show just separated. Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also very big), none of the other players was good. show the same effect. And although it was not included in Randy's (Josh Meyers), he did not help because he was not well received by his fans. I believe that if the show ends a year ago, of course, it would have been one of the greatest citoms in the history. Season 8 was a little fun, but the finals were excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I hope to wake up just one day so that the show's 80s will return as the same as the show.
