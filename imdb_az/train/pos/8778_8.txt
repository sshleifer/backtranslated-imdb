James J. Corbett, the world's heavyweight champion from 1892 to 1897, was a favorite role for Errol Flynn. It could have been because he was not using the sword or in the west. She grew tired from swashbucklers and in her biography, she felt that she was miscast and feeling in the west and understood what people liked them. This is a pleasant film, but it is not difficult to say the true story of James Corbett. <br /> <br /> Corbettin was the first scientific boxer to win the heavyweight division, as he was using a brains and accelerating a lot more than he could handle. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost his heavy crown, Bob Fitzsimmons. She was also a compulsive woman, and she was more like a man describing her. Of course not shown on this screen. Alexis Smith's character, the banker's daughter, has no basis. Corbett actually married twice and was not wearing a headscarf. <br /> <br /> After the film's shoot and after the events, a great personal tragedy took place. His father was betrayed at a time of depression, probably betting on his son Bob Fitzsimmons, because he killed his mother and then turned the gun back to him. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond, the role of career in his life when playing John L. Sullivan received. The filmmaker Raoul Walsh won a great performance from Bond, but his favorite Sullivan. <br /> <br /> This attraction described by Bulbul is a good thing about John L. and the most attractive Jim. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, Sullivan's champion, black and Australian Peter Jackson, refused to give up because of race to meet with the best of his time. I am likely to say that an ambitious Corbett meets him and asks for a draw for 61 rounds. In addition to this fight, Sullivan-Corbett has created a demand for a match. Of course, when Corbett became a champion, he did not give up on Jackson's header shot. <br /> <br /> Ambassador Jim Jim Corbett is not a story, but Errol Flynn, who was able to become James J. Corbett. But if Corbett was alive in 1942, he loved the movie and loved the story of Flynn's life. He would not want to be remembered.
