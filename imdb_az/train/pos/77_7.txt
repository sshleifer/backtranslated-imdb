The film begins with Vincent Price as a magician. But in the middle of a very successful show, the police came and closed it. Apparently, his former manager deceived him from the schemes he had created - even at home at the right time. As a result, the price is fairly killing bad guys. Considering the issue here, we understand why the price was killed and, most likely, understood why it was a valuable thing, the price was a bit strange and could not stand alone (Layt Potato Chips). <br /> <br /> The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a large circular sequence and a crematorium for shows), a great space folding and exciting action. What you can not say about this movie is that it's boring. <br /> <br /> Vincent Price I have never seen the WAX ​​version of the price, probably you liked MAD MAGICIAN more? Since MAD MAGICIAN's movie is a beautiful movie, the previous movie (WAX OF HOUSE) is a very reminiscent of things. The bottom line is that WAX HOUSE is very successful, so the formulas are mixed again in the follow-up movie. Both have been made at 3-D, both have an area where there is every reason to kill the price, but can not stop after the first work, and both are great fun to watch. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see this movie, with the biggest differences and a small number that WAX HOUSE is a colorful and more fun movie, and MAD MAGICIAN was definitely a mystery. <br /> <br /> AND WAX HOUSE (Only Price Version). They are also terrifying movies of 1950.
