Thinking about science fiction films in the 1950s, the black and white B-shocked films of the old Mysterious Science Theater at the 3000 television show are thought to be shocked. Nevertheless, though much of the good movies were more like Plan 9 from "Outsourced Space and Robot Monster," it was a little better in the 1950s than the day before. Body People, World War II and Things From One World. But the best of the group for literacy and production values, undoubtedly, turned the MGM's first major initiative into a science-fiction, called Forbidden Planet, in 1956. It was a 98-minute color film directed by Fred M. Wilcox. He later became acquainted with art's special effects and had a very good screenplay by Cyril Hume, a Screen Treat for the Flamen Planet, by Irish Bloc and Allen Adler. He adapted William Shakespeare's The Tempest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Inspired by The Id Of The Id (MOTI), animated by a Disney studio loan. Robbie Robot's first appearance in the film, or television, is even more popular. Later, he appears in several appearances that featured The Twilight Zone, Night Galleries, and Space Lost on the sci-fi TV in the 1960s as a bonus in The Invisible Boy on DVD, with his own robot There is a kerosene look in 1984 and Gremlins in 1984. <br /> <br /> The fairy tale is simple, but elegantly built and is packed with a humorous edge by mixing the compelling "love story" in the movie. The 23rd Century Planet Cruiser C-57D - a flying saucer, Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen - a leading man at the time of the Police Group Day at home) is the route to the planet Altair IV to investigate what happened with the Bellerophon crew, twenty years ago, on the planet. Prospero stylist philologist Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), his beautiful girl Altaira (Anne Francis) in the early 1960s and Robby Robot, a Caliban-based in-house servant, faces only the survival of the party after one year's journey. Morbius warns the staff of a mysterious force that killed the Bellerophon party in the first year, but it was against it. All this is a technically good film - with some background forecasts and matt images and the absurdity of adult responses to Timmy and Robby's exploits limited to a Dalian surreal absurdity. But filmmakers did not realize that the shooting of the film was absurd at a high level, as it was smoothly played, even funnier. When it comes to the main feature? The Forbidden Planet deserves all its power. It's not a perfect movie, but it's a bit better than Star Wars, but it's a couple of hours and much older and younger than twenty years later. <br /> <br /> Movies like 2001: Space Odyssey, Solaris, Alien and Aliens, and the first two Terminator movies have compared or duplicated this classic with depth and effects. <br /> <br /> The "happy ending" of the planet, MOTI is still likely to be within Alta. She is the daughter of her father, and MOTI has a much more brilliant nightmare than her father when attacking the ship for the second time. Also, the movie just shows 'MOTI' and never shows Krel because imagination is always more intimidating than the best special effects. The film also uses artistic ellipses to ease the story, and more realistic art films are often unusual. The Forbidden Planet is one of the rarest films of its time, unlike other fantastic films that are quite clear against the Cold War. Look, you agree, and you lie a little easier. But, even if not, there is Anne Francis' skinny scene. Loneliness is not alone.
