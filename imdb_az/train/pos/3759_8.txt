Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) approach the rock stars in the near future, but they still need more tools. In the future, Bill & Ted is in public history, but then the wicked man (Joss Ackland) is set to kill by sending cyborg images to kill Bill and Ted. Cyborgs is sent to the past and actually kills Bill & Ted. Now, both children are souls and they have to travel with heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) has come to an end with clever visual effects. More fun and entertaining than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) plays the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> DVD has a good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85: 1) transmitter and beautiful Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD theater trailers and scenes are entertaining behind the featurette. This is the next Box Office shot as originally, but this (Believe or not), none of the best albums (depending on the look). George Carlin writes briefly about his original role. Pam Grier also appears a little bit. It's a nice fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
