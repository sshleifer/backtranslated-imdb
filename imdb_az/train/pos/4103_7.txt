The main characters in this film are divided into two categories: smart and stupid. It's simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays an unbearable dopey boy arrested for a crime she did not commit. <br /> <br /> Even though Standa really is a stupid (but lover's) idiot, her friend Ondrej is a stupid foolishness against everything. Every time he is able to say and do something wrong. Without Ondrej, Standa may have the chance to live a little bit of success. Living with Ondrej will never get bored, but sure it does not have much headaches! <br /> <br /> The Ivan Trojan plays a bad genius type Zdenek that degenerates into some Hitler-esquire delusional tyrant. Zdenek and his merchants are trying to kill Standa to keep secrets of Zdenek safe. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry about the high quality and imagination of Czech films. The Czech Republic, of course, has a great entertainment share for a relatively small country. The best Czech films I have ever seen are: 1) Peli? Ky and 2) Tmavomodri Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you've seen the best of Czech cinema.
