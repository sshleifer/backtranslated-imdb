To understand that this movie is a success, you need to speak of two failures: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". You are excited and unpleasant with the concepts of these two films (like me), yet you will enjoy the Renaissance. She immigts you to the world of Paris in the future. It's not quite dystopian. They improved the animation so I thought it was a rotoscope, but I can not say that it was just a move. Facial expressions are wonderful! Ever since I've been in the TRON, I've seen a fantasy world that is shown in any animated / live hybrid. Black and White medium is used to direct attention to the scene issue slowly; my extraordinary effect was what they did with flashlight rays, look. The director plays with attention and confusion, but ultimately agrees to find the subject you want to find. <br /> <br /> Peace is secondary, but not terrible. This is not a job. There is a rule for the majority of the basic characters that give them some depth. There is air. You can feel like you are in different places in Paris. Some moves, even in a car, have to follow. I have to see again to get everything. I also offer a very large screen, because the "sets" are detailed and the loans are smaller.
