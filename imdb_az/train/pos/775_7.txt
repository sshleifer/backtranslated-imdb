A strange, yet strange story about love. Personally, in reality, I never make a similar story in my life. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> However, after looking at it, I got the feeling of "illness" associated with such social rules. This movie has a good thing ... something that is effective ... I will not be able to use any moral or social rules. <br /> The film focuses on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You see how this attitude began, developed, and eventually ended. You notice the flower of love, the first fins, the moment of touch. You feel the connection. But no matter if it is immoral. I even hope that it will not end .... it can not break ... this is not true. <br /> <br /> However, I have to add a negative spin to this statement ... I do not know if the story is in no way. * It has shown that these relationships are only in form, but not in content. There is no general story, only fragments. When the movie started, I was in a relationship with Kiki and Sandu. So there is no clue about the nature of the relationship. You feel only a tension between them ... the battle between the need for love and the desire to break this connection. Sandu says this line of Kiki: "I want to stop ... and you love me, and I will do what I ask you". <br /> <br /> This movie is likely to be love, what is morale ... and what's the border between them. The idea of ​​this film is "I love all the love even when it comes to social and spiritual standards", or I can not say, "How nice and noble, no matter." But in my opinion, this film succeeded for a simple reason ...
