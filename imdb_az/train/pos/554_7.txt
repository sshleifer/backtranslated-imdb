(composed of light spoilers) <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann is interested in how James Stewart is using here. Stewart, of course, recalled George Bailey as Frank Capra's "This Beautiful Life", so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. As "this beautiful life", Bailey never came to the world, but looking at the world. Stewart's Jeff Webster sees the same thing as "in another country", without helping one another (except for himself): a world that does not exist (for all practical issues). / / With no involvement (and not caring for anyone), Webster has to look at those who can not help, but he can hurt himself, push it, nothing. This reminds George Bailey of looking at a world that is hesitant to watch, because he was not born that he decided not to be involved. <br /> <br /> Both films end in the same voice - a caller's call. Stewart appears to have gained his "wings" by turning his non-participation philosophy around.
