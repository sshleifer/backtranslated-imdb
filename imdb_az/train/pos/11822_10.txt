Dick Tracy is one of my favorite films of all time. I have to admit to those who have not seen this. You really love him or you really hate him. Batman's success came a year later. So everybody's expectations were so high that many were simple, simple. But what about his comic tape ... what do you expect? Creatively, this movie is incredible! Sets, makeup, music, suit and impressive fun make this movie fantastic. The film has bloody violence and a bad language - something rare today. Al Pacino's wicked son, Big Caprice and the Thugs band, as ace criminal warrior, producer, and producer Warren Beatty. Madonna's performances are just like a charming Mahoney. Madonna is one of the best characters ever played. I have the best liners I've heard! Madonna fans loved it! One of the coolest things about the movie, they used only seven colors to look like a comic strip. This film is actually a work not to be saddened by the public. In order to sum up everything, this film brings out the child inside of us. Finally a smiling film.
