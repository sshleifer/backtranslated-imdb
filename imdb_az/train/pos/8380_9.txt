Now I've always been an admirer of the puppet work of Tam Moon. But I want to say that Robot Jox is one of the better projects there. Yes, you heard me. The story works fine, the atmosphere really works, and actors are doing their first job. Gary Graham, a television show host starring ALIEN NATION, and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE show that it can be a star of action and a star of action. The effects of stabilization could have been a little better. The color was wrong, they look plastic, instead of the metal I mean. But if you love these Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, Robot Jox is a minor complaint compared to all that you will love this movie. USED ​​9 STARS.
