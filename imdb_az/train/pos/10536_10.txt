Yes ... I'm going to 1-0 on this subject and therefore why. Over the last few years, I have watched a few comedy and only a few laughs and some videos were delayed by leasing because the movies were easy to forget. Then I do not write "nothing". It looked interesting, though I did not expect much. I was wrong. It was probably one of the funniest movies that had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew created a great comedy pair, and it was attractive enough to remember humor, but it was not as complex as the joke. I do not want to mention one of the real scenes, because this is a worthwhile movie. The more meaningless concepts coming to the film (as you know, the killer military jets and the "fresh" remakes that destroy old classics), this movie is happy to laugh at Nothing.
