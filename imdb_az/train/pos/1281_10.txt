It's as good as finding a movie. The hero of the film (and writer and director) Simon Geist - is a man who came to the agenda. Only in Los Angeles, he is preparing a fake magazine to have an interview with the pig - actors, models, musicians - do not believe in the smell that protects them. Zucovic was able to succeed in this intelligent dialogue. Of course, the budget of this movie paid a car that was supposed to be, but he wrote that this movie works very well and works very well. Everyone who performs a reperiment called Edward The Munk's "The Scream" should be nominated for a kind of prize in reflecting a silver trash at a local coffee house. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... Because it's the same car since 1986 ... it's called a "car". Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
