Yes, this is no different than Lynch. There is nothing supernatural, there is no violence, no blasphemy. Nevertheless, a nice flick. It was a little slow, though perhaps deliberate because the old man has a story of six weeks (my best guess for this term). The characters are daily people and therefore are convincing. The performances are good and the final scene is incredible. Anyone who has a brother can be related to it. Lyle and Alvin did not even say anything. A moment ago, they returned in the old days and all their fights were forgotten.
