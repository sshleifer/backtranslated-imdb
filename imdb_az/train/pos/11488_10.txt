I rented Zero Day last week at a local video store. I have never heard of the movie, and I have a note about it. Just because I looked in the box, I knew that the film was an Indie movie, so quality would be less than one master movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after watching the Zero Day I immediately started it again. The film explained the essence of what happened in Columbus High School in April 1999, but what made me believe was that the two leading actors were convincing. By watching this movie, I was not sure if my first audience was the real bands left behind by Columbine shooters. I knew I could not be realistic about what I saw behind my mind but at the same time it was quite convincing that the player should continue to shake your head. <br /> <br /> Does the film worry? Completely! Do you see what you're going to question about the value of the movie? Maybe. I think that people would be very worried, there are really two sensing characters for Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). What is the problem for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre in their schools. I know myself, for Andre and Calvin I had a great feeling of sadness. They had empathy for me, because their lives had come to such a terrible end. They had fallen deeply into the ruins that some of the surrounding people had set out on their own if only they were to consider their situation. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal film. This will give you closer and personalized view of events that you most never see. It thinks about life that interests you. People are surprised at how it goes. One week after seeing this movie, I still think. <br /> <br /> Those who do not see Zero Day should consider the following: Film is a movie that is not dependent on any budget, and movies are shot on cameras. The film is concerned about the material. This is not the ultimate Hollywood and does not have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you put all these off, Zero Day is a movie that will stay with you and can only help you open a little.
