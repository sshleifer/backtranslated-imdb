I am not an admirer of Adam Sandler. In fact, I do not think that you do not like something that I see. The opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears. Adam Sandler seemed miserable and missing, playing a little funny-looking game browsing around New York City on a motorized scooter. I thought about the typical Sandler loser character again. I almost quit there and there. But then, when I got stuck with it, I really found something I already knew: Adam Sandler can move! He is an outstanding poet in this film: Charlie was killed in one of the aircraft abducted on 9/11 (including dog) and eventually contacted with reality. Don Cheadle plays his old college guesthouse, unexpectedly joining Charlie and taking her as a mission to help her get better. Of course, Cheadle's Alan Johnson has his own problems and happiness, and these two men try to help one another to deal with each other. Both made a totally convincing team, and Sandler made Charlie Real especially, working with emotions and feelings. This is not Sandler's comedy. If you are looking for a part of it, look at things that are silent. It's a pretty heavy movie - sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful and always enjoyable. There are some funny pieces here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Saffron Burrows, the film's film, is a Donna as he added. The only reason the character (on a flashback) seemed to look strangely like Charli's late wife, but it really did not develop and did not pay much attention to the character. See for the referee, but I thought it was the party that Donald Sutherland played. It's Sandler's film and it's a kudos for a great performance, though I am worried. In my opinion, he is the best of all. 8/10
