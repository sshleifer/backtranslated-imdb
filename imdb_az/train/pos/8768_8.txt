I saw this movie at a store in a cheap store. I actually remembered that I looked down on advertising and trailer many years ago. <br /> <br /> <strong> Kate Beckinsale's great player </ strong> <br /> <br /> < About two girls sent to Bangkok, drug substances (they are guilty), and then sent to the Thai prison, what happens to the film, and sometimes questions their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give great speeches, and the plot of the film unites with uncertainty and raises some beautiful moral questions. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ strong> <br /> Besides, besides, this is a good movie with some great performances. <br /> <br /> For all pop-culture junkies in PS, Paul Walker should be watching for a two-minute role. I did not see the movie for the first time.
