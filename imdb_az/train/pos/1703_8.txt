We can get into this movie from a small town in Illinois. Given this period, the urban population seems to be anxious as many as I am growing up. Yes, this is the plot. And yes, the actor soon will soon be nominated for Oscar. But this is not the point. The point is that there is a FUN stopping the truth. And there's plenty of fun in this movie. From a strange, uncaring banker to a good sense, but lovingly, this film was prepared to have fun in the SciFi genre and the smallest town in the best way. Enforcer Drone or Vern Droid can not smile in the eyes? and I liked the FarmZoid. When I get older, I want to get acquainted. In general, taking into account their technology, this is a pleasant impression when you come back to Popcorn on Saturday afternoon and laugh at the laughs in the small town. This is a movie that I will follow once again, except for myself and my small town.
