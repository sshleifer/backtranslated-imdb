The film was very moving. At the same time it was tender and funny. The decoration was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave the award-winning speeches. Olympia Dukakis was very nice. According to the storyline, I realized that his part should be short, but I wish he had seen more of it - he was a real pro. You remember the experiences from your own life, hopefully seeing this movie. After the review, we're glad to see Paul Reiser at Q and A. He is a beautiful person, clever, eloquent and "real person." It was a really nice night! You need to see this movie. You will be very grateful for your going.
