After many years, I was expecting it, and I remember the flop's memory after its original version, and I was surprised to see how good it was. One of the reasons for his failure was a disappointment that one generation thought he was simply an accident and that the younger one did not show full hippie fame. It has now been discovered that Antonioni was already aware of the great confusion of change and of the strange excitement of any apparent lack of vision for the future. The pair of lead is very good and very exaggerated due to the advanced failure of the film. They are ideal and perfectly convey the various contradictions and demonstrate a clean flavor of lovemaking. I blamed others for pushing others apart, but it is one of the most beautiful directors coming here and, of course, has taken the best of human beings and natural scenes. Oh, and I'm not even talking about the high explosive end.
