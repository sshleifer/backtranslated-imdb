"The Grudge" is a series of Shimizu's famous Japanese horror movies. He knows that we are not interested in something new, and he does what he can to any intelligent man: he forgets logic and directs viewers to entertaining. He uses popular clich√©s related to fantasy stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements creatively. This non-linear narrative is not just a gimmick but an interesting way to present consistency from different perspectives. In the end, it is almost the only purpose of a film of fear to scare the audience (in the same way comedy is to make people laugh), and this film has flying colors. I was watching with a audience at a theater and the audience was entertained to go wild. Probably not as your living room.
