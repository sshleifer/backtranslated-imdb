Really friendly, charming and courageous, this unpretentious old-fashioned series; I was delighted to see the old Luke. Extinguisher is friendly and vibrant. A long time lost workmanship certificate. (Today's best television series is unlikely to compete with those old mid-levels.) CHANDU is deep, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. This refreshes my mind. It's not stupid; Stupid ones are those who do not get the conditions they work on. Chandu has a fun, simple, unpretentious and fun fun feeling. <br /> <br /> Chandu is a western magician who goes to the East and loves and protects his nephew. <br /> <br /> Chandu performs superficial gifts in a very discreet and firm manner. <br /> <br /> Nadji, who is very sexy nephew, was kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: strange Vindhyan. The weak sexy girl was actually kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent off with a flower; they escaped from a boat; by a fake police; The Lemuria Temple and its bizarre, creepy rituals resemble the KING KONG image and make RCC ceremonies and ceremonies a barbaric mockery. <br /> <br /> Lugoshi was an old libidine and was not heartbreaking, drunk, and it only helped her performances. He is a drunken uncle who is a prototype, ungrateful, cunning, and oblique. This could have been a very crooked look for Lugosi, but Burton's biopsy left me impressed with Lugosi and showed a strong affection for the unhappy actor. <br /> <br /> I am delighted with Lugosi's fancy shows. <br /> <br /> This serial is buried in justice.
