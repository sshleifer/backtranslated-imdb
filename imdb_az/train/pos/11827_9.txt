Dick Tracy was black and white, the Pope would not be religious. In a film, the concept of color is a unique experience in a comic strip world and is one of the few films that can do it through a serious script, good direction, and great speeches. (Al Pacino is amazing) and, most importantly, is a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costume design. Using only the main colors, the practice differs from what we have seen before. There is also a very successful gift for all genres of gangster films that have been completely destroyed by modern movies. In general, I view this movie as a new attempt and a kind of touch to a cinema that is more reverent in the old and already seen formulas. 10 to 7-i.
