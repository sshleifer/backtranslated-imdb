A dramatic dramatic drama of dramatic rebellion against the inevitable coming of World War II, the Spanish Republic (Charles Boyer), soon to surrender his government to Britain, did not sell the rich land owners to the Nazis to return to Spain. He is worried about the locals who are facing an angry crowd of miners who are persuaded to be beaten on stage and then seeing another threat to the vibrant creatures in the film. Despite the socio-economic hierarchy, external hostility, and world politics, this film is fond of a dark and flawed intrigue covering loyal subjects singled out by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre, and James Wong Howe, one of the most experienced filmmakers, has managed more than once to access your skin.
