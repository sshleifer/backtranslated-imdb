Jim Henson's Muppets has been my favorite since childhood. This movie feels like a child again. Ok, Muppets Miss Piggy and Kermit are back with frogs and their friends. The main thing is that they try to take part in a music show somewhere other than Broadway's New York City. Then you will see people from New York City Mayor Ed Koc. Anyway, this year the film turns 25 and I hope children today appreciate the Muppets Gang's magnificence. Problem with the show Kermit was missing and the network should find him in New York. Children like me and even sentimental adults need to watch.
