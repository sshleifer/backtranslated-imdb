I have not seen this movie based on the funny novel of Nicholas Katzenbach and decided to look at the first level of production. Though it's not a terrifying movie, Just For Cause requires too much freedom with the material that Jeb Stuart does not have in its treatment. Arne Glim√ßer directed. <br /> <br /> Our first thought is to violate the police when the young black man's request is taken to the local polling station. Sheriff Tanny Braun and police officer Wilcox do not show any compassion to defeat Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. <br /> <br /> We are worried about what the survivors are doing. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline wants Bobby Earl's grandmother to defend Paul Armstrong for Harvard professor, a retired lawyer. An elderly woman is fairly convincing to watch Armstrong's case. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Blair Sullivan, Bobby Earl a person acting in the same place, tells us how the young girl is linked to the murder and has changed the dynamics of the work. As he plays in the movie, he is used to mix the audience and avoid Armstrong's coming to the truth. <br /> <br /> This century is pleased by Sean Connery playing Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, a powerful actor, creates a wonderful impression of Sheriff, guilty of abuse of prisoners as we can see. Ed Harris is a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best players. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson. <br /> <br /> The film will not fail even with its errors.
