Sniper gives a new meaning to war movies. I remember the films about Vietnam or the Second World War, many shots, everyone dies, too. The Sniper fights against a new level or elegance. The film, of course, transfers all targeted sensations - the inability of the people in the forest, the hate between Beckett and Miller, and the trap of the moment when they are making a huge trust and a trigger. As you can see, a low-budget movie creates every defect with movement, inaction and excitement, because when it comes down to it, it is a shot, one is killed.
