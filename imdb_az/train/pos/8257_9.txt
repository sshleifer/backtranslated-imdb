I saw the World Fido Organization at the Toronto International Film Festival and I'm very glad of it. Here's a perverted idea by Jor Romero (of course, 'done extensively and successfully'), and has an unpleasant job. But this Canadian movie and a comedy by a Canadian director! And, yes, I really think the "Shawn of the Deceased" is better. Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss, and young actor K'Sun Ray, and I doubt that we will see more of the unpleasant speeches and future features. But, like Tim Blake Nelson, I'm a talented animated version of Corse Bride (or, for those who do not see the film here), like Mr. Theopolis, to read better, like Corpse Pride?) And, of course, Scotch actor Billy Connolly is the least animated, but in some way plays a role as a deep-titled character. Only Peter Stormare's Prison Break will not be able to get this role unless he has a commitment to the Prison Break, as he put it at Q & A after Thursday's show. Scenarios will not think that Dead Of Zombie should have been inspired more than Bub, but I can not speculate. I am not in a hurry to reveal any plot details during the comment, and I will not start now. It is enough to say that Fido is not one of the graphic zombie films that Romero can trust. On the contrary, this is always a movie that will always be in confusion, and in spite of this (and I have to think carefully) with just blood pressure and violence, sensitive humor, a very good surreal environment, this is to be evaluated at PG-13 level, created by Currie and its co-writers continues to appear as a feature. I invite you to see this small Canuck ship. I will, of course, get a DVD after coming out with hope in the next summer.
