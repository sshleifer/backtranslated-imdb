It's rare that a film is so flawless. This is one of the best and most structured movies I've really seen. Each dialogue line can be interpreted in several ways, unlike the three main characters. The film traps you and traps the inner circle of motivation and double crosses that refuses to go. Tell us that slowly burning romance between Kevin and Faye acts as something that is true to cellulite and that you have a perfect film for your movie. It clicks the romance of movies like "Titanic" themselves. If you are looking for a movie to watch while washing it, this is not it. You must commit yourself to this movie. You can not talk while in the room and exercise. This movie requires your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve, and you will receive a lot from it. In your opinion, "Titanic" is the biggest film.
