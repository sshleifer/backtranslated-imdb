Everyone at BBC Times is featured in the BBC on how to deal with the post-war world and prosperity. I do not think it's the point of this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is parody of spivs (hackers in the small market) and housewives league, which is actually a Tory front organization that campaigns against government restrictions. <br /> Of course, the film is politically / socially <br /> <br /> <BR> <br /> <br /> < br> <strong> exactly as it was before.
