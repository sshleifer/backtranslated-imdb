This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then I saw the 30th anniversary of the film on 11/21/01. WOW I remember why I liked this movie. The DVD is extraordinarily magnificent, it's an extra 30 minutes. I did not know when I was watching for the first time. The film has done so much more than ever before. They had to leave their music. You have not seen this movie until you see the full 131 thousand version. Many people say music is unforgettable. In this movie, I recall each song heartily, each song has its own Charm and it comes together as a hole. When I was little, I remember that for some time I had a song called "Eglantine". Also, "Briny Sea" (this song was intended for marriage with poppens, but was removed from the film). Please watch the new 30-featured movie and re-vote for this movie. That's really 10.
