<br /> <br /> This film, accompanied by Oscar-winning composer Rachel Portman's dinner, emotional and imaginative music, remains a delightful experience worth a year to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect in the role of Emma. Toni Collette was as big as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> It was MISS BATES who stole the movie! He was very happy to watch, and he found himself on the edge of the laughing horses, which was dependent on every word of his own. One of the oldest characters I've come from. One of the opening scenes thanked Mr. Woodhouse for sending the "best quarter of the pork" ... PORK, MAIN! "<br /> <br /> Emma's funny ways to prevent Miss Bates, she says," My wife, Emma, ​​for a scene in the picnic, when she really insulted Miss Bates, It is self-sustaining. Then we see poor Miss Bates screaming and tears, and therefore a crushed man can not help, but I feel his heart broken. <br /> <br /> The latter is equal to "Sense and Sensitivity" and should marry one of the best lessons in life. <br /> <br /> I hope this film is so much to me. <br /> <br /> I called him!
