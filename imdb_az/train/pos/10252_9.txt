After watching the "Guinea Pig", two questions are considered (albeit, 'I'm really a psychopath to watch it'): No answer; although I've seen that a snuff is the closest thing to the movie. And then: "Where did hell find it?". 45 minutes of torture, for no reason (in fact, there is nothing else in this film!) Tortured: The nails are beaten by hands, feet, tools, flies, and more I'm not sure how he did it). It is clear that he can not get too much money because he belongs to the 'Japanese underground scene'. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "text-align: justify; I have not seen all the series yet, but it is not known that the first "Guinea Pigs" is the best I've got 8th grade because if the goal people believe in this crunch, the matter is pretty good (Charlie Sheen, the actor's question). /> <br /> I'm hiding another movie from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
