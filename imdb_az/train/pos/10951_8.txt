Big S does not play with tabs or they are called Mencia or Chapelle (although I love both). He speaks with elegant, close words. His show will not change the world, and not what it is. But with Mr Shaw, along with famed Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston, this is an indication of an appetite for destruction! My side was completely sacked by the first episode. I love this woman and, like her beloved lover, Jimmy Kimmel, she only provides lines and allows the viewer to work. The best comedy type around here. In the second episode, like Mary Poppins, do not leak anybody into a quick comment on the elderly absurd nonsense in society and college when addressing the birds. It is recommended at a high level, but for those who still have a funny bone (and have not lost in recent lipo-suction treatment or boob work).
