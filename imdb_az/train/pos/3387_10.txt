A really good movie frightens the concept of a future prophetic meeting of the future. Due to the harmful ozone layer, it has consumed an unbearable heat and all natural resources, with more than a million inhabitants. <br /> <br /> In this gruesome society, Charlton Heston's film is like a movie movie style detector trying to grasp the truth behind a crime against Edward G Robinson's latest performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the drawings that I will always enjoy with this movie is the mass of the ladder, and Thorne (Heston) The film's use of music is also worthy of note although it has no scores in the ordinary sense, the opening theme is good, and the number of Beethoven numbers at Simonson's apartment, especially the Euthanasia clinic, is atmospheric.
