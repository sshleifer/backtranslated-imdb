~ ~ I was able to see this movie early in the morning. <br /> <br /> I am the mother of two children aged 11 to 6 years. That's why I'm sure many parents may be forced to see many "kids" movies. It was refreshed for me. I have not read this book, so I do not know if the book is not true. But this factor of indulgence has reached a high level. This is a story of a "new" child in the city, and there is just such a thing that there is a group of guys who organize a kind of club and love to choose children ... is it familiar? We did not suffer all this or even once. She has a younger brother and says her parents are embarrassed about her. He saw that every character I loved was totally different from each other. The bully (why are they always a red bull in one? My daughter has red hair!) And she is no violence! .. lol) is a good bully wrapped up by his older brother. It took the twists and queues and you are in love with all that you are and really find the route for all your characters! Even the great relationship between parents, father and son. All around, nice, sweet, funny, generic and so on. ...... Get your children! You will enjoy them as much as they do!
