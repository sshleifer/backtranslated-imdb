Only a hidden front for this movie appeared. He did not laugh at me every 30 seconds. It was silver that my last eyes were rolled up and I wanted to buy a big coke. Certainly there are some tremors, but it is generally very entertaining. The film will shine after stealing the spot in Steve Carell's "Jimmy Carrey" in "Bruce Almighty" and Ferrell's "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy". Paul Rudd is not fun as always. I love that he can be so funny in these comedies and continue to work in the Indian drama (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should do more, because he is very talented and attractive. Leslie Mann also had incredible fun moments. I would highly recommend those who want to laugh just like a crowd. But if you insult them easily, do not watch this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, do not see this movie. And, if you think that you are one of the "hip" parents, do not take your children to this movie, no matter what. Of course, you have to let the teenagers see this movie, just watch them out. It creates some incredible tricks.
