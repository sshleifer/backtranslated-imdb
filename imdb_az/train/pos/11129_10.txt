I did not think this way, but my friend said that when I first heard the name "Midnight Cowboy" he was the first to think, it was a gay porn. At this point, in my Seinfeld episode, Jerry Kramer was trying to take Kramer to Florida and Kramer was full of illness and nose. <br /> After meeting with his wife and relatives, the filming continues. When a woman calls her for sexual intercourse, they try to become a hustler (mostly a prostitute), thinking that they will be easily captured by hitting the brick wall after HUMA is over. <br /> <br /> Then she gets acquainted with Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, who is called "Ratso" by everyone and is always fond of gay gay guys. You think of it as an argument, but it's a lovely one (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and, surprisingly, he and Joe become friends and the movie is very friendly to them and so and so is beautiful. Rizzo really wants to go to Florida, where he is very sick and has a lot of depression and self-conscious "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida where life is going to be better, and he will solve all of his problems. <br /> <br /> No, Joe Many fun moments for taking her to Florida (she is trying to steal her as Ratso) was captured by a woman who said that she was "free, you know, it's free, you do not have to steal it" at the hippie party and "Well, this is where Hoffman and "Hey, I'm here" says that the classic moment is completely unplanned and unplanned! I'm here!) and the player believes Joe Buck will grow up to be a respected and respected actor Jon Voight and Ratso Rizzo, the legend and loved Dustin Hoffman. /> <br /> Therefore, it's just a stunning one to call it a "weakening" eydir. Ratso Rizzo, along comes a film, but difficult to eat way too much cough gets sick and the bus on the way to Florida is a prime spot. Finally, he leaves Miami and dies at the bus. The bus driver makes sure nothing is wrong and keep going. <br /> <br /> Behold, I do not want you to go home and cry, and feel as painful as if you lost your dog for 13 years. <br /> <br /> Generally, a great movie. And most of the noise is made up of "Talking Everyone". It's a strange move, but the big thing is that the song is good and it's perfectly suited to the tone of the movie. Go, look, it's good, buy it
