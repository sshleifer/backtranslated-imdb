There was an indefinable idea of ​​who Bettye was, partly, much more than the day of Playboy (apparently, when she took her photo and took her Santa hat, she was). The film, written and directed by American Psycho by Mary Harron, is a good way to make the most of her life. A south-facing church is experiencing some of the worst experiences and looking for a better time in New York City, which is modeling them, and much more than that. Soon, she gets a sense of pin-up on the ground, and she's obviously associated with her (and the name is "notorious"). Actress Gretchen Moll describes it and shows that this woman can get the spirit really is very successful. He is sometimes questioned by moral thoughts ("Well, Adam and Eve were naked, did not they?" He comments several times). As you can see, filmmakers have left their lives for years to come and leave with it in a lifetime. <br /> <br /> In general, the Notre Bettie Page is much more than a usual bio-pic, presented by HBO films, this time with a tolerance for the freedom of film. Harran's best scenes are the pages in his "suspicious" position, he draws photos taken in the overlap, and plays ridiculous movies, chains, and skin-ridiculous movies. It adds a very funny relief to another ordinary nature of the film. The story behind it is uninteresting. This covers the government's "scarcity" investigation of such photographs and underground magazines. However, it's not just a matter of time to do more than just point to things that are pointed out, its difficulty, or relationships, or sexually and fifties. All this was really a pure black-and-white look, and sometimes it seemed as though some Harron black and white photographs were increasingly painted. If you are not very knowledgeable about Bette Page and it is likely that it will be a waiting look for fans.
