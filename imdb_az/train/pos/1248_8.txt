The "Golden Child" was his first film, Eddie Murphy's "Beverly Hills Cop". While this is not as good as the "Cop", this fun comic adventure. Murphy stars find the missing children who assign the most unusual thing. Her assignment: to find a child with the character of the hood, mystical powers. Part of this film plays like a Spilberg adventure like an Indiana Jones comedy because it could be titled "Beverly Hills Cop and Doom Temple". Comedy with fun, with special effect adventure. <br /> <br /> ***
