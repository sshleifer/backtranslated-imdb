Normally, I'm trying to avoid Sci-Fi movies because it's not really a genre. Stars, UFOs, aliens, when traveling ... often this is not something for me. Along with that, I will always give a place in my movie, and I remember Twelve Monkeys for the first time in this movie, but even now, I have seen a few times, still one of my greatest fans. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-family: color: red; "> population live. James Cole is one of them. He is a "voluntary" prisoner who will live in a small cage and be back in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it is spread by a mysterious group called The Twelve Monkeys, and scientists need a virus before the virus so they can learn it. But their traveling machines are not working perfectly well and are accidentally sent in 1990, where he meets with well-known scientist and virus expert Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist and Jeffrey Goine ... <br /> <br /> I think it's a lot like about this movie The thing is that you never know if everything you see is real. Is this a foolish illusion or a real illusion? Is it really coming from the future and can it really be time? Is the population really destroyed by a virus released by the Army Twelve Monkeys? All this is the questions you are wondering from beginning to end. If the creators of this film chose to make it clearer, I am sure that I would never love it at all. Only the mystery that keeps me from an exciting time. But this is not just a good thing about the movie. Acting is also wonderful. Normally, I'm not a very fond of Bruce Willis, but what you did in this movie was astonishing. <br /> <br /> After a few glances, I'm not even something, because together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt, he won several awards, because of the incredible story, the great admirer of this movie. Except for this movie, I saw another Terry Gilliam movie, and this was not a bad one, but I was not "convinced and harassed in Las Vegas". But this is really a movie that is waiting for me. I'll give it 9/10, maybe even 9.5 / 10.
