A great movie is really hard to really enjoy. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes here, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: If you leave someone you love, I say, "Farewell, I'm going". However, it is evident that the disappearance, hiding as a criminal. (Not watched with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> I think that's all. There are many tactics with Alexandre and others, but still everyone wants a bit more truth. However, knowing the truth can cause even more damage to Alexander's life. The general interpretation, by reflecting the undesirable effects of the film's part, criticizes only one possibility of "free love." It really shows this convincingly, but I appreciate it for a little deeper study of the reasons: free liberty is not love for love, but people (especially men) think that this is a realistic film, said he would be really worth watching.
