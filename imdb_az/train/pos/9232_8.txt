Numerous sources refer to the righteous rage that controls all attempts, along with the surface-like "nunsploitation" associated with the euro rubbish films in the 70s, based on a partial historical work of this thought-provoking drama. Perhaps, by accident, it was a single attempt by director Gianfranco Mingozzi to produce a narrative film outside of many good documentary films. FLAVIA, safely set up in a historic context, is frustrated by the Italian girl's (Florin Bolca's career performance, Lucio Fulci's terrible job, MEN'S DIFFICULT) in the early 15th century, with the help of her old father, locked in the attempt. When wondering why women have been abandoned in the best way of life as in the holy book, she is faced with ways in which men's domination can violate women's lives, semi-naked sister Agatha (accelerated by actress actress) Marcel Carne's LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS- from Maria Casar√®s) and with a more constructive - Muslim occupation. <br /> <br /> According to experts, Flavia faced disastrous consequences. <br /> <br /> Michelangelo Antonioni's ZABRISKIE POINT with Alfio Contini's breathtaking extensive screenplay, is a woman's fierce oppression against a patriarchal society, with no rights other than adoption and prostitution, as a fierce expression of a woman's Agatha , but the fraud of an extremely ineffective struggle. The fantasy sequence created by a long drug, Ken Russell, on the contrary, looks more lively than DEVILS, but the film emerges relatively mixed in the skin department, making something extraordinary for semi-porn images. This is a serious job worthy of restoring and rebuilding his reputation.
