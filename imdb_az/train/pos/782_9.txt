This is a 3-point animated picture with three best friends in a small English city. A young pianist instructor loves passion and finds a new beginning, tragedy strikes and hearts change forever. Of course, there is a box of film tissues! Strong work piece. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER! <br /> <br /> The main character is drawn with his young, beautiful piano instructor and passionate romantic blossom. His two jealous "friends" play a prank that can not quickly lead to tragedy. He loses his love and his friends at a foul end. In the end, an unexpected surprise brings them together (in my opinion, his forgiveness is not guaranteed)
