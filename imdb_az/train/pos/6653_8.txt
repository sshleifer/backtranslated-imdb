Aside from all political ideas, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's "Gandhi, My Father" is a good film by cleverly exploring a mixed family of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and fighting with his eldest son, Harilal Gandhi. the father of a bigger life, and most importantly, the demons. A parallel with the father of a nation Gandhi and struggles with every son's ancestors <br /> <br /> The act is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Hanna - this is a tough way - crying to be carved once and adds colors and trails to this heartbreaking fairy tale of Harilal, who flies with the finest finger touch. <br /> Ferrous Khan's direction and production canvas was abundant and attractive, but the scenario could have been tougher. I saw a pirate video type on DVD a couple of years ago (Mahatama vs Gandhi) and, of course, it was more of a catch. The sequence of the movie and the mom and son mom and son are just a bright treat. <br /> <br /> This film could have been great. This is the border. There is such a huge potential to be the only difference between a father and son or just Gandhi or both. <br /> <br /> <strong> Gobustan heroes have nothing to do with it. Of course, it is not an overall film like Kingsley's Gandhi, or a summary of Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram. The film tries to find its only foot; But one is wondering what "what's ...". 7.5 / 10
