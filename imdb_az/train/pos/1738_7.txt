This is a fun movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star that has signed a sponsorship agreement with Ned Beatty's Ticken Pit restaurants. The contract has all kinds of humiliating items, for example Burt is forced to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not very convincing) head mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yeah!) Is appointed by Beatty for Reynolds' honest and sincere compliance with the contract. This Burt is a funny movie that proves that he is not very proud. I like it!
