Every major gangster movie has a subtlety of human drama. Do not wait for the Scarface story of guilt, punishment, and despair. This is a story of miserable betrayal, corruption and power. <br /> <br /> Anyone who complains about this "cheesiness" film does not lose the point. Surface characters, cheerless music, and historical fashion are critical of this diabolical adult life. Nothing in the lives of these characters is really important, not human. <br /> <br /> This is not Brian DePalma's most powerful directing effort, but sometimes an excellent and good situation. (especially at the memorable finale), but are often washed to flatter and burn. Fortunately, he is supported by Oliver Stone, a very powerful script (probably a good therapy for her, taking into account the coke habit that he fought on time). Themes focus mainly on Tony Montana's life and the evolution of his character, as it is consumed with betrayal and power. The dialogue is also perfect, between the humor and the drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is something about the events in the Caucasus. One of his earlier delicate performances (which is more common today) is a completely different world than Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. However, it is also very entertaining (and deliberately overlapped), as always. It's hard to imagine Tony Montana after seeing this movie, perhaps in one of the most mimicked speeches. At first glance, Pfeiffer was boring and disturbed, but I understood how he would play a part of his rebellious little spouse. It's an exception, not an exception, an unfair wrong idea. Supporting players are very good, especially as Paul Senar suave Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Strong, sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking and persistent controversial. "Scarface" is one of the 80's films (no matter for you). A handy and accessible gangster crash and a pop-culture venue. 9/10
