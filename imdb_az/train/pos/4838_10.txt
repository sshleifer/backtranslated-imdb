This movie reminded me that some old black and white films are definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> At first I had some reservations, but I was captured by the end of the film. <br /> <br /> For some time, Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) was very impressed with drama, screaming and comedy. <br /> <br /> Absolutely add movie to movie night for some lightweight reliefs sometimes suffering from "very" strong or extreme "comic" movies.
