This movie was great! It was an excellent definition of an ancient myth. The animation was a bit strange, but there was nothing new to Disney. <br /> <br /> The Disney people had a different job, some of them were a small box, but they were made with this beauty and scene tree. Music was instrumental, but it was perfect for the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a great thing, it's 10 to 10.
