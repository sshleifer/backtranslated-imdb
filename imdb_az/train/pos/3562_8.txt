Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of New York's longest-established frog game and $ 1000 to provide a new place. Regardless of his bet, he plays with Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), the city's highest-ranking player, who can not win the groundless missionary Sarah Brown (Jan Simmons). "Children and Dolls (1955)" is a great music mix to mix styles and scenes. During a brighter sequence, the pedestrians are moving in the rhythm, standing and answering others. Even the walking actions themselves are stylized and angular, halfway between diving and walking. Mankiewicz's New York City is a glimpse of art deco colors and movements, a truly fantasy world that really erased the fact that underground gambling and criminal thuggery work seemed perfectly genial. <br /> <br /> When I wrote this research, I was saying that Jan Simmons died at the age of 80. It was the first time I saw it in an incredible movie, but it dazzled before me. Her idealist and sexually harassed Sarah comes out of her sheath, releasing her in a spirited binge in Havana, with a playful expression called "If I Were A Bell". Although both Simmons and Brando are non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn has decided not to hear his vocals, claiming, "Well, you're not sounding good, but at least you are." Even though Goldwyn's back is trustworthy, the couple also own all the music numbers themselves. Simmons offers the same vitality as Audrey Hepburn's role as a child, and Brando leaks such a self-confidence and charisma that it does not matter whether his voice is great.
