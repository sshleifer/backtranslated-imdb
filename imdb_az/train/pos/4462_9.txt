One of the best musicians, Anchors Aweigh, Jerry, Kelly Dance, 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Jason Iturbi, Sinatra, who played the pianos, holding Iturbi with Kathryn Grayson and more. Technicolor is perfect, like some innovative cameras, with a transparent button or Grayson to read, seeing a piano performed by finding another camera. The area is exquisite, but you are happy with Kelly & Sinatra's enthusiasm. Sailor falls in love with a boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra Aunt. To build with Aunt (Grayson), Kelly thinks Sinatra could get a vote with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra is very young and loyal in love with her words. When they try to contact Iturbi, who never existed, they begin to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly is now in love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is often commemorated for live action / cartoon sequences, often combined with Tom and Jerry, but here's more of a lot worth. While it was not as good as the best music, I would give these nine stars - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - Technicolor is one of the great production classes. Louis was the first) and is better than most others.
