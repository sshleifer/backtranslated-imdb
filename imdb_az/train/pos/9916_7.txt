Edwards Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who has produced art from at least "respectable" objects. Newspapers, boxes, metal containers, etc. Everyday things - most of us, who are considered as the best beneficiaries and absolutely disassociated from the aesthetic, have become outstanding objects by Burtynsky's camera. He achieves this by paying attention to the recurring colors and geometric patterns seen in the industrialized world. Compressed rubbish piles can be turned into beauty objects when seen in the Burtinsky lens (but do we know from Wall-E?). He is particularly interested in photographing areas such as mines and shipyards, showing that people are hitting nature - sometimes they are even part of their pictures (ie workers in the workplace) with uniform clothing and robotic movements, part of the art scene. <br /> <br /> Burtynsky's documentary, Documentary Landscape, has a great deal of "Koyaanisqatsi" feeling on this subject, because we have a lot of pictures and samples with the calidoscope. In fact, director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler are totally kinematic about the essence of the original photos, because their camera records are the Big Three Rivers Gorge Dam project on Burtinski and his assistant in a factory in China, a shipyard in Bangladesh, and a construction site in China. With the perfect camera work, the filmmakers meet the beauty of Burtyński's pictures with a point point. In fact, the film opens with a long track of eight minutes to a Chinese factory trying to remove hundreds of employees of the same dress with perfect symmetrical and colored coordinate lines. <br /> <br /> The film is seldom, sincere, confused, contradictory, and resolutely good half-baked when it comes to expressing "the subject" of Burtyński's work. But it is a purely aesthetic experience, with the most resonating images of "production scenes", emphasizing the look and shape. In Burtyński's work, perhaps a picture is worth a thousand words.
