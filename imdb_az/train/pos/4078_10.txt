This is one of my favorite films of all time, TERROR. I can not think of a movie that combines many fine film qualities like this. This flick story: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good and Poor, and even some Romantic Meetings (without such an innocent "gut" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheetan). Perhaps the best thing to do is to get it in Mensa and Miyazaki's other movies do not have to be enjoyed like you (I do not know about you, but watch movies, think). This is a flat-footed movie that everyone loves, so give yourself a blessing and buy it. Only source recording is American Dubbing. I just found Vander Geek to be heartfelt. But not all of them are lost, the original Japanese version is in two sets of discs and rocks! Who cares about you without understanding Japan? If you can read the second grade level, you can watch the original Japanese note with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
