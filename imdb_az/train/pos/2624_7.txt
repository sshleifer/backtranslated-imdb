It's a great opportunity to see what happens when Timon and Pumba are not shown in the movie - a lot! This film goes back even before presumbably born Simba and Kiara. <br /> <br /> The first film is "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3") funny, entertaining, exciting and surprising movie (or call it later). Timon and Pumbaa watch a movie (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa "The Lion King" will begin watching as they want to go when they want to return to Timon, Pumbaa and Pumbaa's start. <br /> <br /> Starts with Timo's first home ... <br /> <br /> For those who have a good sense of humor for anyone who loves life, watching their story is fairly fair. the first movies to be enjoyed by Lion King 1/2! :-)
