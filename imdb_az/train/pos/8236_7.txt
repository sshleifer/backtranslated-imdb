Unfortunately, Robinsons is the only family on their streets without any zombie; Their new neighbors, Altes, are six. So Robinsons zombie to catch Billy Connolly (like Fido). Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domestication Collar" is damaged by an old lady's wife and eats it; then infest the new and hungry zombies into the city. Meanwhile, young Ray Connolly (boy and his zombie TV, like "Timmy and Lassie") grew up, and finding it difficult to collaborate with the "Zomcom" authorities who control Robinson's family. <br /> <br /> Fido does not go well within the Wild Zone; but it's a colorful, stylish and entertaining satirical addition to zombie filmmaking.
