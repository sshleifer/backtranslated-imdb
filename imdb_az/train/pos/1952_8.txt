I was forced to see the film "In Fine Ice" on Indian television. It was necessary to say that the film really worked well and actually sent a cold from my back ... The main story thinks that certain steps will be taken. <br /> <br /> However, I felt that Diane Keaton was the best ... she began to scare her scene and her house for cocaine ... it was the best ... two boys are good and Lynda Boyd is also a good actress ... The scenario is well done in cinematography and direction ... <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch a movie .....
