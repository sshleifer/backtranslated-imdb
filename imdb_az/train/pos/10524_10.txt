Jane Austen has definitely confirmed this idea! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job dealing with Emma's attitude. It's funny, too silly, yet elegant. It's a very convincing English accent (I'm not English, maybe I'm not the best judge, but it's cheating on me ... It's good at Sliding Doors ... I've even forgotten America!). <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (sister and mother of Emma Thompson) are brilliant women of Bates. They're almost stealing the show ... and there's no line in the lady's law! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
