Resident Evil: code veronica is a great video game, it's great graphics, very comfortable controls, a great story and a great entertaining factor. This story is taken to an island to go to Claire Redfield's Umbrella squares and is in the main lab when searching for her brother. Code veronica graphics are very good, fire and rain effects are great. Controls are comfortable, but the button pattern is not yet compatible with the Dreamcast control, it's still a fun puzzle, entering an enriched place to use. Code: Veronica also has a bit of "Romantic" between the two main characters. You also reside from Resident Evil 1 Chris Redfield In this game, the sound is always better than ever, for example, when we hate the new feature, the ghost spiders crawl sounds and guns are more realistic when they crawl their feet. Veronica is a definite favorite: great graphics, superb story, relaxed control and realistic stic voice give the Resident Evil Code. I'll give him 10 to 10.
