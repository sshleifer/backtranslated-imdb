The British are an interesting film that works so well. Low budget, community-type roles, well-executed. The story is a little weaker, and recently widow Judi Dench has decided to make a decision about the girl's group, all the "golden bomb defects" in the war in London (almost all). the film allowed young people to see their feelings, love, and even lack of monopoly! "Older Thin" can also be a very good laugh. Judi Dench was just as strange as it was always David Jason was pretty much as a "transvestite" drummer, although David Jason was better off than Patrick and Ian Holm A cheerful movie worth a night with all the girls :)
