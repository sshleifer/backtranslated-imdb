I saw this movie on cables, this stereotype was really funny about this good comedy about a prototype car part of a police chief, stereotype big bad guys, jay leno and karate child star. I compare this movie to RUSH HOUR, where the local police should cooperate with Asian police officers to resolve a case. In the city's detroit, farmers return their traces of persecution through the market. Enjoyable soundtrack, good script, I give it 10/10.
