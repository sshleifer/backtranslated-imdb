Right Pill (Black Mask) I want to call ballet with fists and explosions. Initially, the plot was tested and heard (a biological warrior is part of the elite military force of the evidentiary) that killing and brutal force is a pacifist and a pacifist, but warns the librarian, but when he learns that he is trying to get an antidote the best friend is a police - a black mask). very entertaining, working and at least fun for me. I love a spectacular martial arts film. People fly faster than air, and after the impact, a second wound does not stop the recovery speed and movement. But this movie is not about anything but a showcase of what Jet Li is doing best, and at least a great indicator of his ability to say the upper hook. As with the fastest moving martial arts films. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung are now the first to show themselves in the provinces, with low levels in plot areas and higher than beautiful physicists. However, I also say that it's only in the apartment that it's good for your large holes in any area (for example, seeing how safe it is on the stage before 20 people, which is no more than 15 feet away from him). Ohh good I guess he believes), the movie remains interesting to me. The film feels like it can only be a little shorter than the last 20 minutes. But still a great high-paced motion film around.
