Sweet idea ... salesman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) takes over a small town of Lampidorra. She was the 49th country in North America ... (Of course, there were only 48 states in that period since 1952 ...) Linda inherited her country, and we have been in this strange country and even the quirky people we are trying to figure out what is going on. At one point, he sings a song claiming that he is Navajo from his people, and Donlun's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile can never be confused. There are other songs that have been scattered, as citizens have read to adopt a new prince. Here is the film in the glorious English version of the technician, or the equivalent of the film, Dirk Bogarde, the Briton subject, Tony Craig, a cheese salesman. Bogarde, after serving in the UK film industry, made a major breakthrough and even became a knight by QE II. Craig and the "new princess" hit each other and their exhibits become more and more nervous as Lampidorra's financial problems deteriorate ... The little Persian, entertaining along the line of Marx Brothers. Also note that Donlan is married to Val Guest, a writer and director of our small project, and has been married for 50 years now! The guest is well-known for writing and managing scientific conquests both in the UK and in the United States.
