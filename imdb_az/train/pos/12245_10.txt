In my opinion this is the best Emma. After reading the other version (1996), it's good, and when reading a book, I'm sure it's a true commentary and is the most loyal certainty of Jane Austen's kingdom. In 1996, G. Paltrow's film is also good, almost just as it is a completely different story. Very light and fluffy, you can not see the dark edges of the characters, and it would be good if you just wanted a nice movie, but the grace of a few basic points, such as Churchill / Fairfax nudity, was virtually nonexistent. But if you want a little, more realistic and multifunctional combination of characters, the 1996 TV version is superior. Emma is a remarkable person, but she's wrong. Kate Beckinsale is a master of the character of the character. You have seen some of Harriet Smith's simplest conversations, though he does not regret having violated Harriet's offer because it affects the marriage's happiness when it ends. You see his narcissism, and reflects Frank Corchill's harm to others in achieving their goals. For Emma, ​​he was playing a player who came out and became a new friend by extending his marriage after losing his marriage. For Frank Churchill, he promises to love the woman she loves while she is betraying her to hide her and others. In the book, he does all of these errors in a crushing awakening. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their repentance, but Beckinsale's waking is more real and serious, but Paltrow's more childhood and stagnation, and you see transition from selfish behavior to good and thought-provoking adolescents. Both versions are very good, but this is the choice.
