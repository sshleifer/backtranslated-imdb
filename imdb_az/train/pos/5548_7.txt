Star Pickford and director Tourneur, along with two favorite cameraman and assistant Clarence Brown, make this story a great beauty and intelligence - poor, isolated Scottish islands - Michael Powell's first big success after twenty years. <br /> <br /> The wind and wave images, the sunny silhouette of the lovers simply do not complete the story, the story of the struggle against difficulties. <br /> <br /> Actors play the dignity of those who are proud, and is brilliant as Pickford, whose character fights with comedy and thought, giving his church a cathedral to the islands with his father's whimper, and played with Matt, discussing his girlfriend, like Moore. <br /> <br /> I can choose the future star Leatrice Joy in the warehouse. I tried, but failed.
