In Barbourda and GEISHA, John Wayne plays the real representative of the United States, Townsend Harris, who is in charge of Japan's international relations in the late 1850's. Commodore Perry, in front of him, basically drove to Japan with an armed boat and signed a contract with Japan in 1853. A little later, Harris worked through details and helped ensure compatibility - the majority of Japanese people honored the first deal. All this is true and displayed in the movie. According to some sources, romance is a feature film between Harris and Japanese Geisha, and this romance is in the focus of this movie (hence the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction was to surprise when I saw this movie. John Wayne as a diplomat? When he is a diplomat in most movies, he asks for the humiliation and thank you! That's why it was really strange that a person would not act and play a man who could play a diplomatic game. Actually, in 1958, many actors who think that this role will be more unusual. By the way, I saw Harris's paintings, and Wayne had never looked at him in any way. <br /> <br /> However, despite the fact that, with truth and strange castles, there is a lot of freedom, the film is still very much anticipated. Colorful cinematography is beautiful, the film shows a range of beautiful ideas on Japanese literature and culture, and the player is not bad. PS - Read through the trivia for this movie. You can find more about the possible fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston), as well as the real-life characters where Wayne and I have beaten him up! Based on what I read about Huston and how the actors go, this is an event I believe. And John Wayne is a fine example of "diplomacy."
