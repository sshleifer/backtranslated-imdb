This movie is actually FUNNY! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, keep going and watching. It is called blond and blond, so I do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What is this movie, and enjoy all the stereotypes about two blondes. Pamela and Denise are still pretty hot shepherds at a time or a comfy company with a company (especially Lol when it's not too sober). It's wrong to rate this movie as a work of art. C'mon, this movie is about BLONDES! It needs to be light, comical and superficial. What's more, I do not think girls love and love this movie, but the guy will definitely be.
