The issue of life and the Death issue will carry out the genius and beauty of this film in the right way. Powell and Pressburger's vision dreams are boundless, with every frame full of fantastical compositions. The bold colors of the "real world" and the crosses between black and white black nets of paradise indicate how far they live their lives. The final court scene is also fantastic because judges and jurys are being lowered from the ladder to the court for the trial of Peter (David Niven). <br /> <br /> All the performances (in the eyes of Roger Livesey) and the romantic energy of the film are beautiful, at least not romantic. I have seen it). The issue of life and death are all about the power of love and the importance of life. And Jack Kardiff's cinematography is just enough to watch the movie, Kim Hunter's face lights make it even more beautiful, and even simple things like a table tennis game. And sound design is flawless; the way of silence in the vital points of his life was a premature decision <br /> <br /> This is a genuine classic that can be re-established by the film's first release and today's auditorium, a belief in someone's kin. My all-time favorite, so give this movie a 10/10 - Beautiful.
