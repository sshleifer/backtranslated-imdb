Although Ian Kershaw has dropped out of this project because of Hitler's life and misinterpretation, it has been dramatized but important. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler in the following years, in this documentary he has been separated from his childhood with Hitler and has been the German Chancellor, including the night of the long knives. This television movie (also a two-part mini series) tells how a number of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, such as the 1930 financial disaster. <br /> <br /> Serial Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaenglin are watching Hitler and a little bit other than his life. All of these should be oriented more intensely with more valuable and interesting players, but with stronger cinematography; Most actors (for me) are not kinematics, but are described in the form of half-a-body images. The tempo sometimes stretches to the top and it takes about 2.5 hours to film.
