This film is about styling, atmosphere and motion. True, I did not believe in the events in all areas, but it was unimportant - terrible action, wrapped in unexpected pitches, and the beautiful atmosphere saved me and went to my companion. great time. Kenneth Branag is not just a great actor, but rather a master and proves once again with the impeccable Georgian accent. She was simply exposed to me by supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Schindler's List Embeth Davidtz and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, and Robert Duvall). Recently I bought a copy of this movie and did not watch it. Only one of the best excitements of the year. If you have not seen this movie (and you have a chance), I suggest you check it out.
