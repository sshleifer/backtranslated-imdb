Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are couples who enter the car and look at each other for one or another need. Morgan Freeman, Paz Vega "10 Product or Less" behind the controller line, is a person with one another, and a whole person, while scaring customers and enjoying their minds. Together, they discover, explore, and learn. Of course, they are sensitive, they are interested in change, and there is both that there is a sense of humor. I wish that if this film was realistic, I would wish for a story to happen more frequently, so we must go to movies to understand that even if we are one of the most diverse immigrants, we can communicate with each other. The film's open goal is open-minded, and we are interested in the possibility of another world where we are facing each other - a world with a world of peace.
