The more I appreciate the sopranos, there are many reasons, one of the biggest victories is casting and character building. Each character is more in each row. There are also a number of different series along with a variety of "small time characters" each row. David, who was able to feel for a good example (only three episodes), played brilliantly by a computer player Robert Patrick. Every small detail builds the perfect TV series. The presentation division plays two roles as Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is trying to balance the two lives around him. The show is not afraid of its courage and strength through its dialogue and vision, and it also believes it. Brother Christopher (Michael imperioli) is looking for an incentive when working with Toni Capo Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant). In each episode, Tony's other family includes children and spouse carmela soprano (Edie Falco). At the beginning of these troubles, his uncle, Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese), is trying to get Tony out of work even though he is under house arrest. All acting players are strong and symbolic, but the most different ones; James Gandolfini, 'Tony Soprano'. Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, also represents the offense (20-30). If David Chase does not create this masterpiece, such a caliber may not exist as modern television dramas, The Wire and Dexter. Thus, Sopranos is definitely the TV's Hero, Goodfellas and Pulp
