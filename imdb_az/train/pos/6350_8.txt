I waited for the release of this movie and waited, trailers appeared for many years, it was worth it. I am not a great fan of watching movies again, but it is not possible to wait for all to buy! Jimin is not a great admirer, he has perfectly liked it, there is much to see and the 'good factor' is ideal for Christmas. I think Ron did a great job of transforming it into a movie, if you had not seen it, do it, if so, look again, I know what you want!
