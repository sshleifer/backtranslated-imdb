"Mystery Men" is one of the lowest levels in the history of comic books. This is a regular comic super hero movie! It is composed of Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shovels (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and Wave (Paul Reubens). Spoofs many aspects of superhero movies such as "Mystery Men," "SÃ¼derman" or "Batman", questions about strange words and confidential personalities. Most of the super heroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-colored species live in men's jobs and neurotic homes. Thus, director Kinka Usher makes heroes look something related to the mid-audience. I found the "Mystery Men" as visually impressive and very funny. Even if it's not a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!
