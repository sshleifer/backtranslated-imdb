In my opinion, this is a completely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the son-in-law (Lucille La Verne's voice) was truly devout. If you want to know why you need to see the movie. On the other hand, Cinderella (Ilene Stanley's voice) was a very nice lady, although she had done many household chores. For me, the decor was beautiful, the well was well chosen and the writing was strong. Here's what everyone in this movie did before doing this. Now, for all those who have not seen it, I present this completely romantic Disney masterpiece. You are going for a good time, so go to the video store, rent or buy, kick back with a friend and watch it.
