You spend most of this two-hour movie: "What's the story about what's going on?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The last 20-25 minutes you found and this one was a shocker .... but you knew something dramatic. Since then, Smith plays in a mysterious way, almost waiting for people. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he has a good reason to do so, but once we understand it, we will end it. <br /> <br /> All of these can be frustrated with some of the viewers by Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") or you may want to get out of this movie ... But the last long segment is not for putting together this puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour film and is not a typical moving package, it's Will Smith's movie. In fact, the most shocking aspect of this story can be seen by Smith's face, sad face. Even in some shooting, he does not even appear to him. He has lost weight and seems to be sick. <br /> <br /> Like a good movie, this movie will often leave you thinking over the recent credits.
