Madhur Bhandarkar sets out to touch taboo issues and gives the most realistic look of modern society. Even Satta and Chandni Bar are the director's impressions of their previous films. The issues listed in the last film are investigated and concentrated here. Casting is incredible, and in every scene, decisions can be seen in many ways. Basically, the film casts many facts around you. If you begin to find things, you end up being close to it, but you will not lose the mark on most stages. <br /> <br /> The actors are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarnini. Dialogs are well written, and you feel that you live in some of these people. There are some scenes that allow you to think deeper. Songs are time-consuming in the background and Lata's voice "Kitne Ajeeb" feels that you are alone in the middle of a community with a very meaningful song!
