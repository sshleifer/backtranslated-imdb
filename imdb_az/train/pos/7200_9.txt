Deathtrap gives you twist each time, in turn, in fact the biggest problem is the fact that you are not directed to the movie, and often surprise you, although they often catch. The story is very good, except it is so folded up. The scenario is very good with great dialogues and symbols, but you can not keep up with all the developments for splashes. The demonstrations, especially Caine, are incredible. Direction is very good, directs Sydney Lumet. Visual effects are fair, but most of them are in a game and fake. It takes a lot of traffic, but it still works and is worth seeing.
