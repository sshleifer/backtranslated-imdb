Tress's vocal performance was outstanding! When Richard was in the club, Tressa played the role of female singer. When I went to the stage for the first time and started to compress his works, my soul trembled. His voice is platinum. You need to create a CD. Then there are more fans. He liked the show, stopping his performance in five heart attacks, playing with Leon, who was only five years old. A little girl can have a big voice. It is really beautiful. Good sound Good Good Good Good voice sound excellent sound noise, back tone, tears cry, daylight noise. If you read this advice on Tressa, get advice and start typing a CD. Not just for love reading, but for fans. I believe you can actually do that. Others hit a studio singer, lol.
