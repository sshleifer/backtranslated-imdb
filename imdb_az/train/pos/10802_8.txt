<br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think it's supposed to be a straightforward result for The Jerk. That is, "The Jerk 2" is not titled, "The Jerk, Too" believes that although many of the characters are identical, they will return around a completely different person. /> <br /> Think about it: It has nothing to do with the previous movie; a completely different story; various castings; <br /> <br /> I'm going to give some credit to this movie. There is a lot of laughter inside him ... Mark Blankfield is in his head.
