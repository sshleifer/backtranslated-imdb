This independent, B & W, is constantly shocked, surprised, and rebuked by the creation of the most vulnerable situations and then giving them humor and interest. There are all fun and ridiculous things, but most part of the film should be absurd, there is a heart and reality that holds the film down, keeps the whole piece free from drifting, keeps it as a complete argument, and has a real message here. This film tells how the whole world is bare. It's the heart of this movie. Undoubtedly, things like crazy and wall, Leon, 30 years. old-fashioned heroine, trying to keep it together. <br /> <br /> A player working in the movie, like a child trying to catch the balloon, will work for the best of everything, but the exclusive casting actually keeps track of the piece. Van Meter, perhaps, is the best bull in his performance with light-absorbing illnesses. Just like the characters in the movie, we will not be angry anymore to see the real person underneath it. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. It takes the most ridiculous wrinkles and keeps them real. The script he wrote is a shot that helps keep everything. This is a true proof of Majkowski's skills, and all this will never get annoyed with the tempting plot and symbol. Majkowski pulled a film that could be abrasive and modest and was given a heart and humor. This is a unique film. Must not be missed. <br /> <br />
