Some of the information behind this story is very important, based on real-life events. <br /> <br /> The story combines some of Leopold's and Loeb's claims, starting with the two families (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds). courtroom The crowd is determined to hurt the body because their children are deprived of an unfair charge. <br /> <br /> Reynolds says they are going to a screaming car. When they come home, they start a dangerous phone call. Coast together and open the dance school. The dance school succeeds and is facing incredibly obedient parents who think that children are the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these deceased children is a multimillionaire with Reynolds, and they start dating. Life looks very good. But when the threatening phone call begins, Winters behaves like a psychotic break, and he responds to the fact that the listening is deepening and that he is almost always listening to 'Sister Alma'. Again, he sees Winters at the edge and results in very bad things! <br /> <br /> In many cases, this movie resembles the 1960s horror films like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. "Anything, Baby Jane", "Flat-Jacket" and "The Dad". None of them is a full-fledged intellectual expense, but at kitsch level, it's fun and entertaining. The writing is very good, and there are some nice twists close to the end, which is also very interesting. <br /> <br /> Winters are as fragile and bare as a lady, and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39s I've ever seen - plus she really can dance. <br /> <br /> In some films, it is possible to find Winters' hyper-piety in film as a cheap attack against Christianity. At first, I felt it, but when you met Sister Alma, she was sincere and mocked, and I took Winters' religious passion as a sign of madness - everything that was meant for that. / / <br /> By the way, this movie is a horror movie called "Shelley Winters" since 1971, "Who killed Auntie Roo?" packed with. Both are great fun ... pretty much overlapping!
