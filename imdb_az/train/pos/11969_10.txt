I grew up in this show and at the age of 19, I look at the DVD for the first season. What can I say? I grew up in a home full of home. I had one father, two siblings and a dog. But I did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend. I also grew up with my mother in my home. I do not know what to do on TV without a full home. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (Played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace) and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) is my favorite characters. I can belong to each of them, because I'm a middle-aged family like Steph, a young brother like Michelle, and I'm D.J. like an old brother. The show always looks like moral values ​​because O.C. I do not like any of these shows. I also love the comedy of the whole house. Jesse Uncle (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are surprisingly surprised by the uncle's cousins, father-friend, and father. After the mother's death, Danny's best friend Joey and her mother-in-law Jesse are moving to raise their children. Three people tried to encourage three young girls. Everyone in the house is full of heart, funny, and really convincing. Joey is a comedian with a heart and soul. Jesse is a motorcycle driver, softened by her three grandchildren and then softened by her husband Becky (Laurie Laughlin, Summerville). Both children and adults love this show. Guaranteed.
