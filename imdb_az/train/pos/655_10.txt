Unfortunately, Jean Eustache (1938-1981) is currently a hard-working filmmaker and has not been featured on international DVDs as numerous French filmmakers. Since we had a good old video store in Tucson, I had the chance to watch this 3 1/2 hour marathon work, which was not compressed for ten seconds. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned here, I always express one impression of one of the most controversial (and most controversial) films in the film, which is typical of Jacques Rivette or Alain Resnais' early 'Nouvelle Vague' It looks ridiculous. Dialogs are mostly monologues, mostly for the longest time Jean-Pierre Leaud speaks. The most characteristic feature is that the intersection of the two people's outputs is almost zero. LÃ©ud, or his character, Alexander speaks as much as he does, although he likes to talk more about himself. Therefore, talking about communication in this movie may be difficult. It is possible that the filmmaker has to take into account that once discussed political and sociological ideas, but the type of Alexander is always present, we find him at the "Satiricon" of Petron. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alexander is not just a thing, but he has developed a metaphysics, in turn, due to his lack of activity, responsibility towards the society that is part of it. In the morning, when she runs away, she is mocking at one of her girlfriends who lives in her last drink before going to bed in the apartment. Nietzsche can not speak a sentence referring to one of the leading thinkers between Berne and Bern. Sartre, often mentioned in the French author's cafe Aux Deux Magots, where Alexander sits all day, should serve as an excuse for Alexandre's and his colleagues' lifestyle, because they are exposed to the crisis of bourgeois intoxication. But Aleksandr's intellectual performances appear to be very ludicrous, and penalties and quips appear to be more quoted than the actual reading of relevant books. True: This film requires a broad knowledge of Europe, in particular the knowledge of the French existentialist philosophy and the results of 68 student revolutionary movements, but if you have this information, you can look at your life in 215 minutes. You are crying on television and laughter, probably you have not seen it for a long time.
