I wanted to see this movie with my brother and girlfriend. The place was pretty full, and we all laughed because we were so tough. It would be good if I knew I was looking, but it was more fun than I thought. Both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci liked it, as normal people seemed strange. I get sick of film showing young people who are like cookies like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... and so on. Both characters were unique, but still quite normal and normal enough to be related. I'll recommend this movie to all your friends and I am very excited to be on DVD, and watch this movie with friends who want to laugh at the funny parts of life! I would like to see the theater again and do not see more than once.
