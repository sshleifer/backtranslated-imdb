This unfounded movie is really entertaining for a young audience. Heroes are one-two dud detectives, their sophomoric attitudes lead them to a very horrible path. By asserting a big crime, you will see that these detectives will go all the way to sue. No nudity, many sexual effects, rifle silliness ... everything goes for adolescents. Low budget, but very entertaining. True cult classic potential.
