I always love versions of Shakespeare classics of Kenneth Branag, because he always does a very good job, but in this film is always a great player, Laurence Fishburne, who raises the whole film. Undoubtedly, he has made some bad choices in the movies, even though he is a great actor, but in fact this is really Othello: passion, jealousy intensifies along with the good paranoid of Fishburne, and besides, <strong> "Othello "was finally given a black othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think they can choose Othello better. Who else could give sympathy / antipathy, love / hatred, and forget these fiery eyes ...? Branagh is always as good as it is, but not at its peak, Irene Jacob is very good at desdemona, but it's a bit miserable, Laurence Fishburne really raises it and makes a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Watch it.
