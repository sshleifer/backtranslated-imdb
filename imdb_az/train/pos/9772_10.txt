Theodore Rex is probably the biggest cinematography experience of all time and, of course, is an event in human culture, culture and artistic expression! In this attractive intellectual work, Jonathan R. Betuel manifests itself as a great 20th-century filmmaker, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles, and Roman Polanski. Special effects are nothing less than breathing, and to show Spielberg's work as an arrogant and illustrative lesson. Theodore Rex was a revolutionary gem that film producers ever raised when they were released to the level expected by movie producers. Not only is it a movement showing a dinosaur, but with a moving, exciting detective novel, a heterosexual female police officer has changed over a "talking" dinosaur with a post-modern name like Theodore. As we know humanity. The world can never be the same after experiencing this beautiful beauty. Looking at Theodore Rex, they say, "You are the most loved of me" to look at God and to hear Him. It's just one of the few movies to focus on!
