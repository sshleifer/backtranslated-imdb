I'm a great Beatles fan. My favorite is Beatle Pauldur and at least I love John. I knew about the Beatles music and the truth behind the separation, as well as about things like John Lennon's family and Paul's Wings. <br /> <br /> Not satisfied with the success of this movie, it was interesting to see how this movie would be managed many years after it was overcome how much the relationship between John and Paul was over. Although the story itself was artistic, numerous references to two musicians were very clear. Among them, we will be with John in the place where Yoko Onon always goes, including the Wings song "Silly Love Songs" this year and "Let It Be" on the roof of Apple Studios. The actors are very good playing John and Paul they did work. The accents may have used a little more work, but they did so much as I read the two former Beatles. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <how did it really go in real life? They also feature a fantastic skateboard from Saturday Night Live, where they offer $ 3,000 for Beatles to perform at the show. (Because they offered them $ 220 million) In general, I'm not disappointed with this movie. It really gives you more feelings about why Beatles is broken and why you get back somewhere.
