Maybe before I finish watching this movie for the 7th or 8th, I took a night earlier in Blockbuster and I really liked it, so far I showed it to 4 and I'm very pleased. This independent film, produced by Paul F. Ryan, overwhelm all Hollywood glamor, special effects and stress on the "shock factor" and hit the head after the effects of traumatic events. After a secondary school, Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form two symbols of probability. Alicia, the stone-hearted girl, who has a bad attitude to her life, helps Deanna to overcome the problems of life and death. Meanwhile, Deanna helps Alicia re-see some of the softness and lights in the world. This film is separate because of the male relationship between those who do not stress the shocking incident of the shooting, but between the survivors. Despite having a small budget and a short film, this movie is unattractive. Ryan never tries to get into a state of unrest and human spirit. With an incredible and upcoming actress, Philipps adds the necessary playwrights to the dialogue and incorporates the overall sense of the movie, and Christensen helps the film to balance the horror and darkness. In general, I recommend this movie and enjoy the subject of school aggression and violence, and in 2004, the CBC's documentary, "The Girls World," featured social violence, Montreal, Quebec and Victoria, two other British comparing and surprisingly a girl group, a 14-year-old daughter of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a group of friends and acquaintances who were killed in a violent manner after the violence.
