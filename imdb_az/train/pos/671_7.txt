When I was released in the Palo Alto theater, I did not expect much. So is an Australian movie? But it finally came to me. There is a scene here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < who are you? "Are you the fish? Who are you, who are you? "<br /> <br /> Charlie's dark face is a stunning scene filled with Charlie's black, broad bearded, bearded appearance, all drawn nearby. <br /> <br /> Two children are different, and <br / <br /> <br /> This film is a story that Chamelbas accidentally has from his heart's mind is how Charlie's world is unexplained, almost unspoken, with its secretions. <br /> <br /> This is a apocalyptic fairy tale but it should be said that everyone who carries out research on Aboriginal Faith Systems in Australia should be A plus, pointing to a real parallel universe of sleep during sleep time. a noisy film. <br /> <br /> The world of Satan is simply for reasons that are not completely clear, Chamberl Ain's dreams begin to start. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the scenario, nothing is clear. Does the Chamberlain, which looks like an extraordinary link with the Aborigines in the last wave? Aborigines? Does Sidney have integrity? The main point is also a bit difficult, although it is a fantasy. Aborigines have the moral power that Americans give to American Indians, whereas the mythology is mythology and the mythology is still complicated, even though it is more elegant and beautiful, even though one is more complex or satisfying. they try to overcome the usual, demanding, and sometimes disappointing physical existence. Charlie's imagination is more convincing than Cesil B. DeMille's "Ten Commandments" than the miracles of Moses, but they are not under the skin of our brothers. When taken as a movie, it is very good and especially for the director's popularity, Peter Weir and the Australian film industry. It was a strange and dramatic film wave from antipodes, some of which were "Mad Max" and some "Lantana". I love the products of Weir that are similar to Nicholas Roegin's subliminal fears. Try the "Hanging Rock Horse Picnic" for an example of how to make a really stunning movie that does not have a drop of blood.
