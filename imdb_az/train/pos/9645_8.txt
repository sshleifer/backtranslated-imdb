"Presque rien" is a story of two young boys who fell in love at the seaside summer. It's not the most important thing about this movie, but I do not want to explain this project (but you can be sure it is interesting and original). The best part of the film is cinematography. The visual side of Presque rien deserves a very high price. <br /> <br /> As for the political sphere, it is presented in an unequal, very complicated way. Not a simple chronology, but answers to all the questions of the film. But this 'Presque rien' is even more interesting. The film's feature is very important for the film, and it comes to all people who will not be disappointed.
