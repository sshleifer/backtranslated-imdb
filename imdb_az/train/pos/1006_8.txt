Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel, Starship Troopers, has featured in recent years Paul Verhoeven's 1997 movie to the television series. However, none of these words really took on the spirit of the novel. Games are generally irrelevant, the television series was more spin and less about the Verhoeven movie. I know very little that in Japan, the cartoon adapted, left the year of Heinlein's death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the most clarifying events in this series is, despite this distinct, 6 series animated series, Heinlein's classic, powerful armor exoskeletons are something we are deprived of in Verhoeven. Although a series of books is a fair amount of money, the series focuses more on characters and their relationship than action and space travel. Although the events are different from the book, there is a sense of the plot. Rico and Carmen have a romantic twist, but less than a book. Some believe that dialogue and character interaction will fall slightly from the book (although it is a bit of anime treatment, but what are you waiting for?), But it's better than the movie. Heinlein's political views, on the contrary, were opposed to the film. The great gain of the array is Klendathu, a battle between soldiers and bugs / aliens. This is a kind of activity from the powerful armored suits we see in the movie version. In general, I liked this series because I was looking at a closer look at Heinlein. And I think they did something similar. If you find this series, take a look.
