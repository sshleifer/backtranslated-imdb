<br /> <br /> Fido is not a favorite comedy worthy of wider popularity, considering the major pain that it intends to entertain us lately. <br /> <br /> As it is already mentioned, this is not a difficult real zombie movie, but a sweet satire that works undead to mark your fingers. Although there are some bloody scenes, it is almost unfortunate that the film is not presented (story 50), and I can not imagine that Fido and his colleagues were scared or cut off. Although cast is generally good, Moss and Nelson have attracted the attention. This humor is not so much in your face that you are more unhappy; I pay close attention to the details and have smiled deeply along the entire movie. It is, of course, a work of cinema art, but it is not attracted - instead, Currie is able to win a black comedy that causes heart disease.
