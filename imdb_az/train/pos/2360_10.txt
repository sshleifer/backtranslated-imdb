This was a strong indication of what Jehovah's Witnesses were doing to protect America's freedom. The first generation witnessed the strong faith of the two families who were witnesses. I also appreciated how difficult it was for the Witness family to recognize that our family members were affected and that they did not celebrate their festivals, but only non-Witness families did not think about giving Witness gifts for family evenings or visits, for holidays and birthdays. When it comes to medical service, witnesses say that, despite the high standards of medical treatment and expectations, what people have forgotten is that blood transfusions provide unequal medical treatment and operations, and that non-bleach treatment leads to highly qualified and trained medical staff, treat your loved ones? I appreciate this video!
