The King of Mask (Bian Lian China) is a shockingly beautiful and deeply-rooted movie. This film, which has been awarded 16 awards all over the world, is a film based on the true story of Chinese Wang Bianlian in the 1930s. There's a lot of talent in the performance-changing masks, and nobody knows how to do it. She is desperate to be a grandson of her family who can be given only one male shepherd. Then we go to the streets and see that they sell their children, because they can not care for themselves, and some of them ask for their daughters to release because they are worthless in this society. Wang Bianlian's story extends from here. <br /> <br /> The film was very striking, the player was incredible and the issues were very heavy and good. There is a gender inequality and a tragic fact that no little girl in this age or place would want. It is interesting to note that a well-known opera singer, always known as a Bodhisattva and a woman, is dressed as a woman and a woman who admits her as a low, self-respectful and respected person. When we get closer to the film, we can face the problem of preventing human trafficking and its needs and therefore no solution, military and police brutality and corruption, the lack of power and power of any human being. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and actor Hu Zhu, who performs Wang Bianlian, offers a better performance. .
