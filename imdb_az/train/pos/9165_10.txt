This should be the best fit I've ever seen and I think it's very close to this book. Although it really is necessary to see it, but the two leading actors are spilling. Beautiful Timothy Dalton is the perfect combination of power, courage, embarrassment, and softness like Rochester Zelah Clarke, Jane. Story (as most people know) is young and straight, Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800s and presents her services as a director in newspapers. Mr. Rochester, the secret and respected owner of the youth hall of the Adele halls at Thornfield Hall, the great guest. As the months go by, she is in love with Jane and Jane is in a position to try and see if she has a girlfriend as she is. However, Thornfield Hall is still waiting to be discovered, and the effects are devastating. It is a moving and well-acting drama with beautiful places and beautiful suits. Moreover, as I said earlier, Zelah and Timothek were excellent.
