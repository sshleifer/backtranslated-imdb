I've been waiting for the ages before seeing all the reviews I've read, and I said it was terrible! the worst I've hired to rent and it's even worse than the best sandpaper movie out there! Sandler often talks with the camera and the movie itself does not take seriously, but it's all part of fun! A great way to spend a day, and even find yourself laughing twice! A good movie for rent!
