I admit that for the first time I even watched Cowgirls Blues watch, I did not think it was very memorable. Now, after looking at the 7th time, I admired a lot. Sissy, Ms Jellybean and Countessin are very glad. Romanticism between Sissy and Jellybean looks very sweet. Though the area is very weak, I think satirical humor is more than that. Then, the great talent K.D. Lang (reminds me a little Patsy Cline) in the best way. After a first impression of a dissatisfaction like Cowgirls do not think of any movie that "grew up in me".
