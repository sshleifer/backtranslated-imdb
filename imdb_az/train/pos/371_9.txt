I remember remembering that this film went to the Academy Awards and could not win any category. I do not remember what happened to my life, but one thing I can say is that it was one of the best films I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg was a director did not convince me a little. <br /> <br /> In fact, she is about the trials and difficulties of a black woman growing up from a girl to a woman. There are many disturbing and terrifying experiences, but all of them must see how happy this woman is. On the way, we see other women who want to pay their bills and walk with them. Whoopi Goldberg gives the best performance in this movie. Danny Glover was also nominated for this role in the film. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is that he looks at his subjects from a humane point of view. I encourage everyone to see this movie from any race. 9/10
