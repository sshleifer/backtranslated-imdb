This movie is one of the best shorts I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of things that I consider to be the "best" of the industry, because I'm the one to be at all major movie festivals. I am not Monagans admirer. His activity is generally worthwhile and not interesting to me, but his dignity is in Lost, so I'm generally trying to avoid his films. But I started seeing it a few years ago at a film festival and was completely excited. This director really knows what he's doing. Of course, you will get trolls (or ignorant people) who do not understand what a good movie they are doing and because they do not know what to include. But, fortunately, what I see is that when it comes to the boat, they are in minority. <br /> <br /> The film can not be used in any budget and can still use a few supporting actors, as this is certainly true. The cost of production is very small, but what can you expect for someone's first real movie yet at the high school? Prepare a budget that is not important. If you get too far from your crafting, the quality of the sound (in fact, if I did not blame the filmmaker, I saw it at a festival, and sound was good ... I guarantee the DVD's cracker), and what did you leave after mini-DV? <br /> <br /> Nanavati can tell a story. This is very clear. He can write more material than the majority of Hollywood, which can create an exciting list that can be perfectly praised and exciting and creative in this highly-paid budget. More experienced actors, better sound production and up to 35mm mini DVs, even trailers could not complain. This girl is incredible, and given that Insomniac has been well-prepared a few years ago, she has done a few wonderful things since. That shows a trailer for an Angel's Dreams and I can not wait to see the high-budget products out of her. 9/10 star, this movie is a hell of a hell film.
