This movie is a cold, bare truth. Often, "Oh no, this will not happen to me," we say. But it can do it. Narcotics smuggling is a great deal of money, and often people (or deceived) to do something for smugglers. The story of these two girls is a story of many young people who love them, only an exotic holiday - turned into a nightmare. People should know that such incidents are incredible or inflated - this is a big problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to the audience for the insight needed to really appreciate this film. It is very emotional and raw. It is worth watching and, of course, is in your memory.
