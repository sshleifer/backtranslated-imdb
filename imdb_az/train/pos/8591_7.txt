It was a pretty decent film. This movie is just a good place to sit and watch and entertain. It's just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie can never win an Oscar or something and I do not necessarily deserve one, but I think it is very good. This show, like 24, is put into movie format. If you love all this, we have to stop the terrorist's murder of the president's film. Personally, I believe that this story line has been set out, but Sentinel is a little slack in the Secret Service. All this, this film will not put your jaw or change your life, but who is the one who says such a thing for every movie to be good?
