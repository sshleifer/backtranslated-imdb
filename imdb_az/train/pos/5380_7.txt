This is probably the cross between the German Edgar Wallace's Crimean series, the traditional Mabuse movies, and the 60th episode of pop-ups from Batman and UNCLE. It repeats an extravagant film from an earlier film that cuts the victim's neck from the habit of a stylish monk and twisted the deadly whip. Those who are already elected by police officers who fill the hot-to-sad secretaries at an exciting girls' school and at any opportunity with middle-aged professors, of course, are a shock to these beautiful political-era times. A Wallace-based film, "Whatever Humans", is a perfect giallo, and girls have a connection with their elder (and corrupted) concerns. A master of foolish mind, who is well suited to the subject of leadership, uses indoors to use some of the death blows and keeps a captive dungeon to entertain captives. Alfred Vohrer was always the most entertaining and visually impressive of the series's directors, and here's the real star of the show, a colorful cinema. The Monk, appearing against intricate night backgrounds, appears in a naked red scarf and robe, creating tearfully white whip off the taste.
