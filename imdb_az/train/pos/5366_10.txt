I'm here in November 2006, and I still can not help rave about this movie. Arnold's best films cover about 4-5 years. Man, Predator and General Recall (1990). All 3 beautiful. In this film, a liners loved by Arnold will laugh more than once. Like Predator and Totall, I find the actress who is delighted by this film. As it should have happened in 2017, the scenes have done a great job while trying to futurist, but 80 men and women were unable to help hair loss and the Man Running studio, which we normally see on television monitors in 2006, is flat panel and HDTV exit on the way out. Also, the computer graphics of the "The Running Man" game will not appear in 2017. Still, the story line is absolutely fantastic. I did not want to come to the end because I did not stay in this movie for a while and often worked with this movie. Actually, Arnold's player is better than a loan given to him. Now, I have not chosen him as governor, but he's in California for you. Buzzsaw, Dinamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I do not try to overkill the manufacturers to fight scenes. When Stalker was killed, he died. Not every 20 minutes. Stalker scenes are quick and fun, but they do not try and overplay it. It's like giving 10/10 this movie and those who do not like many movies these days. If you get the right actors and the true story, futuristic graphics you see in 2006 are not important or important.
