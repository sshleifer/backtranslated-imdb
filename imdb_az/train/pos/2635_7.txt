Take My Take: Get a comic of a LIVE KING, and then positively. Surprisingly fun. Unfortunately, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another comic flat-to-video, the theater is worth the treatment. I do not see why Disney left this video, and we leave the angry movies, like The Chicken Little and Neverland Neverland. <br /> <br /> These movies look better than theaters rather than see theater posters, but in video stores (in the "new releases" section). <br /> <br /> This is just the first movie code. Timba (from Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (from Ernie Sabella) did not happen at Simba's Pride. We'll see what's happening in their first movie. From the first film, Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin, and Robert Guillaume, sounds from the first movie, when Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller gave Timon's mother and grumpy cousin a few comedy support. /> <br /> So it's not a funny thing. Maybe not for now, but watch out for yourself. He likes the fact that he is not serious about his plot. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <
