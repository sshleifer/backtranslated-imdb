I saw this movie with a special impression of Owen Alik Shahada. It's interesting where this guy came from. Now he is probably the main independent African director. I'm not talking about black filmmakers, but I'm talking about artists who are rooted in culture. It is an idea that proves the diversity and diversity of African film, 500 years later. However, the idea does not fit this mold. Show diversity diversity. The film is a whole African melody, but the theme is a subject of a human subject with many people. I just love the delicate comedy. And Tunde Jegede Kora is simply a beautiful, really home-made gem of an art.
