This is the original "reality TV", a fast paced and funny satire on the soap opera. The script prepared by the playwright Robert Harling is full of liners and ridiculous situations. The best of them is a live broadcast that is deteriorating with bad progress and brain transplantation. Kevin Cloe is not fun, because of killing the lines, not wearing glasses. "His brain is next to a later investigation in several homes." The glossy cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimi are all perfect. It's a treat to look at a tattoo as in the film. <br /> <br /> P.S. Alan Silvestri's account is an added bonus. It is suitable for soap operas with bright and melodrama air.
