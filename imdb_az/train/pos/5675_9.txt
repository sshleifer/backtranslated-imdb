Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series where people have heard the least - mostly the same as the second and fourth ones and have no revolution. But Wellington's Duke Duke and fatless fool, Dr. Johnson (author of the first English translation dictionary), is still great to count this series. There is still a much smile liner to be delivered to this series, and it delivers humor in a historically accurate and pleasant episode that is less known. The third trip of Blackadder is not the most famous and famous, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler for a stupid princess is funny and effective, and Hugh Laurie is the best in this series. Very Good! 9/10
