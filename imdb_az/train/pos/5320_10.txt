<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This movie started watching for nothing, watching only one movie, but from the first twenty minutes of art and the main character wise, not very talkative, I liked this movie very much, it was dark, it was fine and really touched. It's a bit slow, but the dip is complete. The director, Joey and his story, which led to his life in bars, were awesome. The music was really great and included in the scenes very well. It was unexpected with a twist that I did not see the end coming. Not the type of movie that we often see.
