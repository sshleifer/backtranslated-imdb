<br /> <br /> In 1970, after five years of disappearance, Kurosawa made the first film to be colorful. Lips' Ka-Den is a film that organizes centers around many nesting stories that go on a small Tokyo tip. <br /> <br /> Guidance, a mentally retarded boy,. We gradually know the people in the small community, because they are not happy with women because they are two drunk traders. An old man in the center of the city helps a thief who is trying to rob him. A very sad father and son, who can not afford a home, imagine themselves as a ghost. At the end of the film, stories come to all circles, some are happy, some are sad. <br /> <br /> As Kurosawa's first color film, we see that he uses his superiority and shows it. Perhaps a lot. It is difficult to go and enter the film in many different directions. But do not misunderstand me, Dodge Ka-Den can not be the best of Kurosawa, but the greatest director of all time is better than 99% of today's films.
