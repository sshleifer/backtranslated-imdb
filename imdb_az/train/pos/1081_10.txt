One of the classic comedies. Not a heavy drama, it's a slapstick comedy. A fun, satirical film, take note of the instructions for a buyer new home. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant is sure to be done for her fleece in a building of a sleeping house, sure to be filled with a huge symbol. <br /> <br /> A great view of the life of the 40s of the night. <br /> <br />
