EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a work that brings the alarm to the audience that came about a century ago with the birth of a feature film. This movie is truly unique and a great work. The camera and editing are shimmering and combine with the amazing tropics used in the film to create a magnificent and memorable cinematography experience. <br /> <br /> Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine's involvement in the shootings are two of the guilty pleasures to be enjoyed and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mammad Von Sydow, four stars (highest rating).
