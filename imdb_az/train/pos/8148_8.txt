I have zero interest rap and ghetto culture, I'm clever and like classical rock, it did not stop me from evaluating this fantastic comedy. Its pretty much the next film that Spinal Tap, the same movie, just about the sense of rap or rock. But this is not fun. There are many funny jokes, but they fall straight down to a little shock. The characters are very laughable and convincing. I just saw that I was laughing at 3 o'clock, and any movie that can do it provides at least one test exams. One of the reasons why these films are so funny is that the rap is fun. Rap is currently associated with something wrong and is made with studio noise and little talent. This movie comes with a time when rappers have more credit. Generally, a comic film with lots of jokes about racism, sex, and music is among the more humorous topics. This is highly recommended for any fan of the Spinal Tap. They are actually the same film, only different worlds, and yes, the same jokes are working on both films.
