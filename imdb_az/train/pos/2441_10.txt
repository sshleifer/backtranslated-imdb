It was never surprising to be surprised and surprised by the evil of the world in the name of religion, and the daggers of the Catholic Church in the 20th century had to have a slightly calming effect on the wisdom of history and modern times. <br /> <br /> A separated love is a story of a true family that fears everyone who is afraid of ignorant intolerance and in the name of the doctrine of a believer. At the start of the film, Sheila and Sean Cloney are offered a view of a buccolic life in a small Irish village, which is happily married to two young children. Sean Catholic and Sheila are Protestants, but their children are not raised as Catholics. In the village, there is no hostility between Catholics and Protestants. When peaceful and loving relationships are split up quickly, she says that when she and her elder children want to go to the Protestant school. The local priest took on himself to ban this "sin" and quickly turned Sheikh's husband and all the Catholic population of the village, as well as his father to the local dairy farmer. <br /> <br /> In a desperate act that kills and kills two daughters and runs away from the region. <br /> <br /> Make a special note of Orla Brady playing with Seylie. He demonstrated a very strong performance and made the impression that the viewer had suffered a loss that he decided to reject the desires of a beloved husband to express his desire to establish himself independently of the building pressure. Liam Cunningham, who plays Sean, gives a realistic portrait of a mixed man, alongside her husband, her love, and her husband's split-between her church and society's influence. <br /> <br /> In a feature film, this movie would be an interesting and interesting drama. True, this is a terrible tragedy. In real life, people and the village were not fully recovered from the events that took place there. Nearly half a century has passed since the Church has acknowledged the negative role of the events, and despite the fact that Sheila and Sean implemented their lives in this area, they were not fully recovered from the work done by religious leaders and their peers. <br /> <br /> Refusal of basic rights for election training, bringing them to buildings, capturing women, condemning all races, or making torture and murder clear, we can, of course, use religion as a strong negative force in our society.
