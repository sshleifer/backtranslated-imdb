I enjoyed this movie. Tobey Maguire gives a great performance like Jake. He was supposed to be one of the best actors I've ever seen. And I was surprised that there were so many humorous lines in the movie. I did not draw a funny line in front of him, though it was very good. The film links you with symbols and really surprises you with all this. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think you're doing a very good thing. Very interesting scenes. Completely a good picnic. I am completely an admirer of Maguire. See Cider House rules. It is always the best.
