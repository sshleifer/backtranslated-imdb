Oliver! Music is my favorite thing. Music, characters, story. Everything seems perfect. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Carol Reed, is a scene from the classic novel, bringing Broadway to the screen. <br /> <br /> Switching from music to movie is not easy. You need to have the right sound, right grip, right scripts and the right play. All the signs are yes for this game. It's written for this screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in old England. Here, a child named Oliver strives to get out of the orphanage. He set out from London to meet with a group of young people led by Dodger, a clever talk, a group of fifty-five pockets. The network leader is named Fagin, the seller of all stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But Bill Sixin plays Oliver Reed and is not good in London when his lover travels with her lover Nancy. Oliver, Fagin and his younger armies and law. What is a staggering fairy tale of love, love, and great music? <br /> <br /> If you do not love music, you will listen to these melodies and you will upset them all day long. Oliver! It is a triumph of the stage and it is a missing work during art.
