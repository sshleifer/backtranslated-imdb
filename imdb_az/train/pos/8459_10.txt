I'm not a big fan of anime, but Gundam Wing is really something else. The Gundam wing does not have any stereotypic melodrama that you can think of when you think anime, because the number of jokes within 17 hours would be only double, because Gundam Wing went to work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing, Large parts are not warfare but warfare. Although the war animation is not only extreme detail in the case of live pain, individual prayers between gundams are almost artistic compositions in terms of complex mechanics and animated use of fast movements. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this 49 episodes plus a movie series were selected by cartoon network in 2000, and then professionally named them. dubbing is simply flawless. Not only does it hear every word, but the characters that really use the voice are more convincing. many believe that it is best to watch anime in English, but simply do not have the strength to do so. <br /> <br /> Only the sounds are good, the score used in the series is quite impressive. I just slept in an empty space to find a sound. <br /> <br /> The essence of this series really closes the viewers, or you can not take as a major drama like Lost, which is for you to connect with each other. Strictly explains the area that has caused many spoilers, because many characters do not name the series up to several episodes. The arbitrary idea of ​​the array shows that the earth and its cosmic cosmic colonies now have difficulty maintaining peace. Thus, a war that has led to military coups and identifying diplomatic situations has begun. I think it will start giving you any details, which is important for the plot. <br /> <br /> I am here to say that this array is beautiful for anyone who loves anime, it's a tone for everyone who thinks ALL is a fool's (for that reason) and anime.
