This is one of the most neglected stones by Hollywood. An English fighter jet crashed into contact with a young American woman who comforted a brave pilot who was killed in a few minutes. For some reason, the dead man must be dead, and he will eventually learn that he is going to report to paradise. When a message is sent to ask the Pilot to accompany the paradise, the man refuses and demands his "court day". At the last moments of the man's life, he claimed that his condition had changed, and that he was another person deserving of his love and a chance to live for it. <br /> <br /> The "heavenly court" is kinematic pleasure! "Announcing the jury of employees" is of particular importance. The story is fantastic and attractive as it looks and will spellbound for about 2 hours of playing time. The final scene is simply beautiful, and most viewers are required to receive "Kleenex Treatments". This movie is my top 10 out of my best friends!
