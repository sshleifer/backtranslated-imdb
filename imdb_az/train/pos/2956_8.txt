Today there are very few singers who can draw me in just one movie. Some of these are Cudi Davis, he is very sensitive, but he succeeded in creating a heartwarming character. <br /> <br /> He plays a role that most other performers will treat melodramatic, and add feverish, deep emotional intensity, which attracts attention on the screen. <br /> <br /> His skills for the second time with High Tide director Gillian Armstrong gave Dave the first great success with My Brilliant Career. In that film, Davis played a young woman who decided to do this in the world, despite the drowning felt by her society and upbringing. The character of Davis, Lillie, is roughly the opposite of the "High Level": he refuses any hope for the future when he is young and works with his responsibilities after birth, and without life and direction. When he finally talks with his daughter after a while, his idea of ​​giving care to his child is terrible; <br /> <br /> Gillian Armstrong's films are related to stories that are usually characteristic of anyone who wants to communicate with heartfelt. others, but face obstacles created by your own personal habits and addictions. "Oscar and Lucinda", for example, were about a man and a woman who had a lot of love for each other, but with gambling addictions they were always blindfolded by chance. Here, we are immersed in the world of a broken, paralyzed mother, who is convinced that it is too late to change in a better way, but is unable to fight for survival and self-reliance. It's not just a movie with a great deal of work in the center, but also a rare success: a completely convincing story of disappearance.
