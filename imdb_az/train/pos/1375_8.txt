These swimming pools are water lilies and frogs. Frogs sit on the water lily. The frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship. Marie (Pauline Acquart) is a water lily, Floraine (Adele Haenel), a frog, is a synchronized swimmer team captain. The flora is dependent on its teammates because preternaturally curvy and well-proportioned blonde transmit the synchronized breast to a loose personality who betrays the character of discipline and discipline. Florain has a secret; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <strong> "Garabagh conflict" <br /> <br /> On the one hand, we see a double image of a sexual bomb that controls his makeup in the knife mirror. "Lolita" fata morgana. Marie gets acquainted with Floraine's pair, and the latter breaks the water lily's heart. When the frog decides to hold the flies to remember the appearance of the frog, it is ugly in the water lily when no one expects it. In the most striking scene of the film, the water lily agrees to give her hand to lose the ability to fertilize with the mechanical stimulus of the frog. Florain wants boys to love her, but she does not like boys, but as it seems, she is more important to the frog. When the water lily finally kisses the frog, the frog remains a frog. The frog can not be turned into a water lily or a prince, because the lily of the lily has lost the respect of the frog. After unlocking his lips, Floraine tells Marie, "Look, it's easy," she did not like to tell her a frog's kiss orgasm, without adding a friend to her. Florain's beauty is a burden. She carries a weight that meets the boy's expectations. <br /> <br /> Another water lily, other frog, Marie's best friend, Anne (Louise Blachere) and Floraine's frustrated boy toy, Francois (Warren Jacobs), like any water lily and frog, also has a parasitic relationship owner. When using Florain to love Marie, Francois uses Anne to sex. But this is life; It is a growing betrayal, and even if a friend allows a good pleasure, he will become a good friend. After a McDonalds, a water lily frog has a wide useg afterglow chastises other water lilies. Physical beauty is a currency. Mom is calling, because Anne is ugly, and has an overweight and unusual hairstyle. Anne tries to retreat using her heart as a large rebate (using the magnifying glass that has been accidentally commented on Marie's straight stomach), but she is surprised (Marie thinks that Anne is better than a good lily), her breasts are a side product. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <br /> <br /> <strong> The water lily has the potential to break in the near future, if not longer. Young girls can be harsh with each other so they can not accommodate any boy.
