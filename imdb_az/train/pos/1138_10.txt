When I was an 8-year-old boy, I did not always watch movies and television, and that was one of them. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it should be the most spectacular movie ever seen in my life, the perfect actor, and do not have comedy like these days. <br /> <br /> Really funny movies, and laughs without resorting to temptation, or movies that are not as unusual actors as Seth Rogen, as in body fluids that cause vomiting, as in those of the delayed Judd Apatow films. <br /> <br /> This film is actually classic with actors capable of moving and deserves praise.
