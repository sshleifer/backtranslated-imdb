<br /> <br /> One of Belgium's best artists (sings his songs), Tom Barman, debut movie. For a long-expected movie and for Flamand cinematography --- happy joy of joy - I really want value and a work piece! It leads us to the lives of eight main characters living on Friday and nights. <br /> <br /> At the start of the conversation, he says a lot about having time with us: we come to the party as they come to party on Friday night. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The rhythmic style is very thought out. Perfect use of music. Sometimes it takes pictures and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! Go! Party scene (20 minutes) is a fun visual experience as it's shot. <br /> <br /> Thank you for preparing this cool movie. Thank you very much. These, the weakness of the Flemish filmmaking, have been going on for several years now. You made my day!
