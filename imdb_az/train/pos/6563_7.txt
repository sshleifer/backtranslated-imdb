Jake Speed ​​is a movie that has nothing to do? a charismatic lead. Unfortunately, this is really a subtlety of the whole movie, and it's a shame that it's a fairly witty scenario and an exciting, if not exciting, action movie. Though this genesis, Indiana Jones can count on the success of the trilogy. The movie actually plays a bit more, like "Romancing Romance". This adventure of adventure in an adventure is an adventure adventure is one of its dragons, leading to an adventure fantasy character (occurring in its adventures) and a character leading to an ordinary woman's adventures. /> <br /> When a young woman disappears in Paris, her sister Margaret (run by attractive Karin Kopins) is the hero of the pulp Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) and his leather Dennis (Dennis Christopher) in the heart of the disintegrating African state, to be real and very defective individuals in an adventure involving two brothers, poor Sid (John Hurt), and his brother Maurice (Roy London) revolutionary camp. Is this plot available? It's not labyrinthine, and it's not difficult, but tells the story does not require great depth. <br /> <br /> We urge you to start with moves and fall into heroic trio, battles between government and rebel forces, or fall into a pit full of lions. And of course, there are many comic strips. However, the film is about to end and, unfortunately, struggles to find activity segments that are starting to move from place to place and very attractive to be extremely soft and irksual. However, if it is possible to love Jake Speed, it's hard to be more concerned with Wayne Crawford's performance, no matter what. He is now a producer and writer of the film, or I think he's not just a good actor (I have not seen him much) but actually does not agree with anything like Doc Savage, Indiana Jones and Jack Colton. <br /> <br /> Most of the other characters play their role well because this is shame? Karen Kopins is comic and convincing and his character is striking with Jake (unfortunately, it is never convincing). Perfect as part of Dennis Christopher's archetypal sidekick and John Hurt's camp taste? it was almost in the sixties of Batman. She continues on her few scenes of developing a ridiculous cockney accent, putting on a performance where she is in another film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <j> Jake would be good to watch some adventures and be better off with a television series. <br /> <br /> I did it for interest, but it's a bitter taste because most of the elements really do something good there was.
