Daniell Steel's Dad is a refreshing story. This film praised the importance of the family and the importance of the parents in the lives of their children. Is it rare? "There are two Mommies of Heather" (or no fill space) at this time is easier than why this theme is not for everyone. As the father's roles were outstanding, this would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How to understand the disappointment. Every character is important and their role. I would like to see the development of each character over the years. I like this movie very much, and I will challenge everything I play every time. Good story, good toy and I hope this is not a spoiler, but no sex or bad language. Yes, it touched my heart. Warning, prepare Kleenex. I find it sad that this part of family life today is rarely in our entertainment or on TV. Your movie. Daniell, if you listen, you go to the girl, give us more.
