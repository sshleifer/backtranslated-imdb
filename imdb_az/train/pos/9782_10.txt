Peach is a really good movie. I write this to avoid 'Auscrit' on this site. The first is Monahans' first film, 'Interview', which is a television idea. Here is a film that has just become one of the best Australian films ever praised worldwide. You deserve the best picture. Peach is a brave, brave and courageous move. It works for me at every level and now I've seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker with great skill and incredible sensitivity. "Auscrit" can not simply take the film to comment that it is another television movie and that Hugo's tissue is not good. Or he does not particularly want to get it. It is undoubtedly a comment that waits for any jealous or afflicted person, or a filmmaker from both of them. Or someone in the industry, distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. I found the middle pistol, so he does not comment. Based on the Sommersault movie, I differentiated other comments on the site. People are interested in what they think. Unfortunately, the SS in Australia was released, and if you did not like it, there was something wrong in the movie. This manipulation of the media is quite low. The reality is the sole resemblance between the two films, which are the rights of transition movies. Unfortunately, for me, SS is a movie about anything that can be explained within 15 minutes. I see it as a dimensional film about anxiety. It is a work that should compare peaches. Personally, I will not wait for Monahon to do anything because he is one of his contemporaries when he comes to film art. As a result, when the film can not win all of AFI and IF awards this year, it's a fake game. As for Auscrit, find something more constructive with your time
