In this film, the generation begins as a conflict, understands, ends with grace and grace. The film was stuck in a car of more than 3,000 miles with a father and a young son from Europe. Cramping forces collide with lifestyle, beliefs and life skills. There is definitely no winner. All of this is the experience, the experience of many layers of life. For those who want to understand Islam, this movie presents a generous and subtle outlook without being put on the agenda. This is a story about a young age that has become clarified to get more lifestyles for the young, old and disobedient nature.
