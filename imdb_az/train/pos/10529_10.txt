Not one of my favorite Austen novels and Paltrow is my favorite actress, but I found the movie totally delightful. Paltrow sees a good job, and one of Cummings, Stevenson and Miss Bates is absolutely terrifying. The details of the period are not alienated; The film's feelings are not true. But the real "find" is Jeremy Northam, as Mr. Knightley. Perfect cast, IMO could not be. In the novel, I hated Kerim, but I found him in a wonderful human and human film. Northam's good appearance and smiling eyes are no obstacle to enjoying! Be advised. AnaR
