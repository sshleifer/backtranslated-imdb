The mechanic visited the mechanic - "Is the piston short enough to run?" (which meant poorer sexual energy of his fianc√©). I love Meg Ryan and she's as sweet as this beautiful movie. He is very loving and very clever. His innocent angry expressions want him to be yours. The hero focuses on garage mechanics as a physicist. Einstein was romantic to his spirit? Puzzles and spectators gathered in front of the press was well spent. This is a very terrible and erroneous attempt to revive. The US GOVT loses one vote to enter into a very far-sighted theory that has not been bought. I do not see why he did not see the 20th romantic comedy of the century. Great movie, there's a presidential seal on it!
