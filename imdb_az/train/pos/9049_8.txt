There is an old saying about Joe Johnston's new film, something like this: "The person who thinks and the one who can not think of his hand will be right". <br /> <br /> It is reported about the "October Lake". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> October Sky is a self-proclaimed statement. Homer Hickam, a young man who grew up in a serious, traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves a small coal mine town, where nearly every man grows up as a miner. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell, think that after their high school, their lives will be like everyone else. Homer does not come out of this future. <br /> <br /> One night, while looking at heaven, everyone goes through a Russian craft called Sputnik. This is a new thing for Homer and he finds something spectacular and heavy. First, everyone tells the rocket scientist they want to work for the occupation. She is full of words she says, her family carries this idea over her head and continues with her husband as usual, but this idea may have some potential. <br /> <br /> Four friends began testing rocket models and began to squeeze a white picketer, what would it look like? they are afraid of a forest fire, they have to end their advancement. <br /> <br /> Speeches in this movie are beginning to end. All actors give their performances here as real mumbo jumbo. Looking at all the glory: Laura Dern is like Miss Riley. <br /> <br /> If judges can remember this movie by the beginning of the year, it may be very good for the Academy's rewarding material. <br /> <br /> The characters are also very well developed. Not just filmmakers, Homer has a clear cause in this regard, but they explain to audiences how to get the rocket. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film loses some impressions at the midpoint of foolishness, in particular, the motives and beliefs of each character, the romantic sub-plot that interests Homer's love and whose brother stole it from him. This film is so popular in high school movies that this film is aimed at high school students. Actors contradict each other. I did not complain about the Abbots' invention in 1997, but that's enough. <br /> <br /> But this is a minor complaint. At the end of the original film Oscar and real life clips, Homer and his dreams, especially Homer, are the first major film of 1999. <br /> <br />
