I bought this movie a month ago and now is a fanatical fan of Drew Barrymore. I love a happy ending, and this movie gives a brilliant look at the red Sox truths in place! This successful Lindsey (Drew) is a mathematics teacher who has received some promising children during a math trip to the company showing them some information. It happens after I (teacher) and Lindsey. It's not all simple when he admits he is a massive Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, everything is fine, but then his baseball lives in the life of Lindseys. In the end all was well and Drew made a shot to get running along the field! I bought it at Blockbusters for two cents, so I'm happy. If you love movies like this, I recommend Drew's Charlie's Angels and his 50 first dates or even Hugh Grant's new movie, Music and Lyrics.
