After 13 years as a pre-runner to the Great Run, this little English movie plays with no excitement and can not dare to very well. The first part of the film is the creation and subsequent escape of our heroes. Secondly, while trying to reach Sweden, the second run is conserved to survive. The film is based on pure heroes who have a simple, effective, and yes, convincing dialogue and performs these goals in a stylish manner. As part of an adventure story, it is perfectly functioning in the loyal, as the film's first turn may be a big head finger. <br /> </ b> 7/10
