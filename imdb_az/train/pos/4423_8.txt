GOJOE uses a bit, but the final result is very satisfying. The story is worth an hour, about the murder of Samurai, who is dangerous to an effeminate, but who is willing to pay for the dangerous samurai. There are many things to do, that physical survival is a delicate earning. <br /> <br /> Some time ago, the film might look like an other anime-inspired Samurai movie, but it later enters the more mature / adult area. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to pass. <br /> <br /> <strong> GOJOE <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > reviewing movies and other foreign movies)
