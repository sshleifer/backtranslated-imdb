Strangely, but emotionally disturbed by the medieval man (William R. H. Macy) who decided to abandon family business (murder for employership) driven by his father, Donald Sutherland, hates another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a big dilemma, but Panic is a top-tension that looks like "American Beauty". Macy and Sutherland are indicators here. The first debut for the writer / director Henri Bromell. I was surprised that this movie did not get the chance to stay in the theater for more than a few weeks.
