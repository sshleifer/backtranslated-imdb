This movie and later Barry Mckenzie takes on himself, two great comedies prepared. <br /> <br /> A great story of a young Aussie block goes on to claim England's inheritance and meets with his beloved and innocent friends like him. <br /> <br /> Can this be found somewhere else, as the dead are as dry as the one who needs a bad drink? big heroes, top-class players and more and more consumers consuming heilas and any other three movies are put together. Top notch. <br /> <br /> And you hear some funniest songs and it's full of great celebrities. I always do my two favorite movies, twice twice a week.
