As I am an admirer of Columbo, I was delighted with Corky Romano. Of course, though it was a funny movie, Falk's character was a far cry from the favorite lieutenant who played for many years, especially the language of attack. After Corky Romano, I was surprised and exaggerated about Mr Peter Falk. However, for the first time in a week, I have to say that 'John the Baptist does not find Christmas' and his predecessor 'a city without Christmas', in both films I have to say that Peter's Falk is a joyous character 'Max'. Certainly, it's as memorable as the 'Columbo'. Although some part of the film is predictable, such scenes make it a pleasure to see the story unfolded. I would like to point out both of these heartbreaking Christmas movies and I strongly recommend them to be a fan of Falk, a Christmas Eve, or a person who loves a good movie for a week's casual feel. This movie may be missing out on the holiday flowers prepared for television, so be sure to find John Christmas without delay.
