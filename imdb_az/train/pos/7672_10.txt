I have to admit that Holly is not on my list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. The art director of the festival decided to go to see this movie, especially after recommending a viewer to more than 200 people before the show of another film. Amazing! Wow! <br /> <br /> This film deals with a very difficult issue of child prostitution and does it without any compromise. I'm crying a few times in the movie and laughing at others. Emotional roller talking about the coaster. Chief actor Thuy Nguyen was a new Vietnamese player (only 14 during the filming) and had to fight this incredibly complicated and difficult role. He recalled Keisha Castle-Hughes from Whale Rider, but she is more demanding to play child prostitution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> He helped to help him After spending some time, she meets an American (playing a dramatic role that has not been used by Ron Livingston). At that time, he was resold and searched around Cambodia. The story turns and bends and the audience can never predict what happens next. <br /> <br /> The player was strong in a very interesting international game. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sexist), Virgine Ledoyen (referring to a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his latest films). <br /> <br /> The Asian boat was beautiful too. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is dealing with this challenging theme, it is able to explain this charming, powerful story. It was shot in Cambodia (several real-life scenes). Adds the feeling that you watched a documentary film. <br /> <br /> The DP has a lot of handheld cameras and an image that is approaching and you feel like it's part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the exams, the others left the audience and all were amazed. This is not an easy movie to watch and I welcome the filmmakers for not making Hollywood Films. <br /> <br /> This is the best film I've ever seen with the Edinburgh Film Festival. My opinion was shared by my husband and several other friends.
