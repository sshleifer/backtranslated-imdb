I'm the greatest admirer of everything, Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous (I am not great on Grandparents), so it is safe to say that Cameron Crowe is waiting for something he has named. I told Vanilla Sky that it was a very strange movie, and when I was expecting something similar to Crowe's other films, I told her I would not really want it. That is, when I see it, I say that the past is correct, and the latter could not be wrong. It's a strange movie, and nothing comes together to the end. Everyone who says he has seen half of the movie lying to you or can not keep their memory behind them. Anyway, the movie was perfect and I was waiting to get it after the DVD was released. I felt the movie was transposed and spent emotionally until the end. An experience that will capture the entire spectrum of the audience's sensitivity, if the viewer permits it. The movie I saw in the theater had more than a few people who lost track of the movie, and when they saw that they could not return to the plot, they got bored. I'm convinced that others do not just watch movies like this. I do not want to talk with silence, but some people are cut off for Seagal, Chan, Van Damme, and this is probably the type that will not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Comparing this movie to other Crowe films, this is very similar. This is very cerebral. At least one, in all Crowe films, the soundtrack is a character for himself. It is almost like Crowe's long-term relationship, almost like Almost Famous, and Heart Star Nancy Wilson's marriage. It was worthy to note that Tom Cruise, who was acquainted with everyone who saw Jerry Maguire, was a certain chemistry player and Crowe's director. In my opinion, this is not a bad thing. Anyway, if I compare this movie to another movie, I'd say: If you love the game David Fincher's The Game, you almost certainly become a fan of Vanilla Sky.
