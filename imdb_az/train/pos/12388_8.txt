I read the book and say that this film is shaped. I think psychological psychological excitement is the beginning. Cristina Raines performs perfectly in the lead, and Burgess Meredith delivers an excellent supportive act as the next goalkeeper. I've seen this movie at least twice and I think that I will take my book and movie for my collection. Tension only builds until the end of the climate, you will never see the arrival. If you love movies like Signals and Village, Sentinel will be a classic front word. Moreover, those interested in the film are interested - you do not know the credits, you do not know them. The late Jerry is as big as the commercial director of Orbach and Jeff Goldblum. There are also few, but it's great, Beverly D'Angelo.
