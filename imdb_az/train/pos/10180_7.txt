Indian leaders are in a difficult situation. They should compete with films like "Laggan". There are 11 people here, and Castro's men are protecting their villages, and half of them can be certified. "Devdas" is a strange red carpet and a living in the circus, with an unhappy, self-sacrificing disaster, the heroes who do not forget the feelings and emotions of anyone who works in infinite corridors. But in order to make a good movie, you need to walk a tight rope to suppress the frontbenchers, which are advantageous to Split skirts and Dishum-Dishum battles, preferably a marginally beautiful nitwit "Bollywood" lead actor. So, we can get in touch with a director who wants to tell Leonini's village "Defend Village", which is a violent film for a single male audience or too early. Nana Patekar (Narasimhan) has few people to deliver anger and pathology. Nana Patekar allows you in the yard and looks at Beret, and when her loyal fans exploded with laughter in her satirical word, when she came to the politician, her daughter was also batting her granddaughter. India. Nana Patekar is a key actor belonging to the oldest actor school that disappears in Indian films. The violence described is a challenging part of writing stories with Song & Dances, which does not sell movies, is loyal, but for those who are not in the real state of affairs. The faster this happens better for Bollywood. All this said and it's a good movie.
