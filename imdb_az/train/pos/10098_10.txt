Dominion Tank Police is, of course, not one of the most beautiful shows ever made, no doubt, not just in the animation field. The first part (Acts 1 and 2) often involves motion and entertainment, the second part is more serious, and the second part must not be treated the same way as the first. These subtleties are really outside of this world and are characterized by brilliance. An additional degree of intelligence is needed to measure the subtlety of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). Although I have some complaints. In the first part, Tank Bonaparte did not make any sense by jumping out of a full tank shell. Even in the wing of the helicopter bullet, Bonaparte may have a problem, even if the jump is free. Buaku rules.
