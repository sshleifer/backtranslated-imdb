I first saw this cable television on cable television in the 2000s. What a surprise and delight! Everyone is secretly armed in this movie! Dreyfuss plays "conscious" dress (do you remember the New York dress that has to be schizophrenia? Art life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are their most beautiful and entertaining! This proves that beauty and toughness are together! Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) have a great "bullshit" scene. They play here verbally "bullshit" from the world. This movie is both delicate and honey. It can be a very calm film for all shooting. And, you have a chance to get acquainted with the last or last role of several actors. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. Not a movie for everyone. But if you want to have a movie that has a lot of word games and everything in the eyes without kinking, it's a movie for you. Roger Ebert dropped this movie. He is wrong. This is a beautiful, beautiful movie! Maybe Ebert is not the only one. I regard it as a movie because it's so good and funny how the comedy is, but it's not a straightforward comedy. I love it because I bought it on DVD because it is not just shown on cable TV. All this is me now!
