<br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; As you can see, he did not know he hit him. Poor audiences; we have, in the first place, seen a really nice and romantic story to move towards the dark truth of misconception. These two children did not come together with a single encounter. After Mathieu and Cedric have sexually drawn each other, there is no deeper emotional shrinkage, and Mathieu is unable to find a way to share his life for an intellectual being and to find a person more sensitive to carnival festivities. beach. <br /> <br /> In a completely technical note, I liked the movement of the camera in this movie. The subtitles were completely unnecessary, even my French "presque rien". I can still watch it again and make it more without the annoying English translation. This is a polished, very professionally-made movie. Although many scenes appear to be more, I'm over nineteen.
