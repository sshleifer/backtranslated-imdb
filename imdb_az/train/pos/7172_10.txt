Gruveyman2 (Comment below) You are a complete immorality ... The city you are loyal to is corrupted by ignorance. His sad arrogance leaks on the SF you claim to mock, so it looks like a typical LA A ** hole! The only reason the movie feels for itself is congratulating SF because you are jealous. Of course you do not know it because you are so tired. Initially the movie was totally actual about a beautiful city; what is going on there and some of the more popular local folk films. He says something bad about LA; and these CEOs live in a beautiful city in Los Angeles. They understand that they are going to film school in LA and are proud of this fact. They know that SF is close to LA. The only negative thing that was said to be associated with LA was about studio leaders. The same studio leaders hated their children when they first saw it, but the same films became the world's largest grossing films. So why would they not be hostile to the studio executive and studio system? These are just "getting out of touch" and working for good reasons! Be so sensitive! Is Francis Ford Coppola a "San Francisco" director? How is it not considered? And who is the Father of God? Coppola did. The best picture was the look of the story on the screen that won the prize. Who gave him the job? He acknowledges that he did not want to make a movie in a documentary .... so what's your point? What happens if Sophia wants to live in LA? And how does this prove your opinion? And say that it's not really independent when you fund some of your movies. Movies that are now classics. And when they filmed studio funding, they came to LA and they said they wanted to do both of these pictures and used the money they had to pay for their money. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In this film. <br /> <br /> Hell's "suddenly" and "self-congratulating" can suddenly "air" to self-esteem ... if they go to LA again? What a stupid and meaningless statement! There are some great words out there ... and I do not know how to use them! By the way, they were never superior to LA and they claimed it! So if they give a LA boy in Los Angeles ... what hell is still there? If they go to LA or New York, are they hypocrites, preferring to live in the SF? <br /> <br /> San Francisco is proud of himself and his people, and what people are doing today. This film is directed only to one aspect ... filming. To prove bad reviews of the city (not a movie, the city), it's just what North California people hate about LA! THIS IS GREAT TOGETHER ... MORE ACTIVITY, FROM THE FISH INVOLVES ... THEREFORE, EVERYTHING IS PROVIDED.
