YETI deserves 8 star rating because it's one of the worst films ever. L.A. saw in the midnight movie and the people were amusing and buzzing - this movie is one of the cinematic exercises you can think of can not be any strange! The millionaire Chris Penn and John Goodman, the project financier to pay for the Yeti, were also poured into a bad fit - the scientist was one of the worst actors on the screen and yes, there was a silent voice. Boy (sorta looks like a girl) and kills her parents he is silent because he is rescued from a plane crash (hmmm - is he a child for therapy?). Then it's seen by the hottie Italian girl Yeti (once she gets whipped - FOREVER gets it) - and she's instantly love it - the most hysterical stuff about the movie is this giant Yeti, the "bedroom eyes" next to her - as a big Barry White trying to deceive a group. In fact, the big Yeti picked hottie and against his chest - once accidentally touched Yeti's breast and yes, it takes time to show the movie big gray breast GET HARD !!!! Yikes all Yikes! There is an Italian soldier who heard that he heard the American audience as dogs, and even though he tried to get Lassi, Yeti had a delicate scene of eating a huge fish - he kept a big boom and used it. "Gee, thank you Yeti - my hair is straight and you smell like dead trout, which is more than ever imagined by Ed Wood if you are an admirer of a classic cinema, remove this baby.
