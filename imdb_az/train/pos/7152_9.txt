'Holes' was a great movie. Disney made the right choice. Everyone I talked about was delighted with it. Everyone else was right for their part, and Shia Labeouf had a truly functioning future. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, and I guessed exactly how it was. I would recommend it to anyone who has never seen it, and I guarantee that you will be given the 'Dig it'.
