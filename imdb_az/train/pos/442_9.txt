Here's the growth movie. Each character is different and better than ever - a woman knows that the place she chooses is "loving". Josie Lawrence, also known as the best comedienne, is really a woman who brings these changes. Even men in this film have directed themselves to better men. The book is very accurate to a novel in my book, because I'm a librarian. Field breathe and message of love.
