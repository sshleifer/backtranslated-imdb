I first saw it on DVD in a hifi show on DVDs in London in November 2006 (I'm not a cream so far!). The high level of Arcam system was good with this DVD. and I will tell it to the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. Kremin's performance was just amazing, and the sound quality is the best I've heard on the music DVD. The type of music you want, this will surely grow on you. This will perform a repeat and repeat performance. Even new musicians, like those old rockers, do not cut their mustard in these days.
