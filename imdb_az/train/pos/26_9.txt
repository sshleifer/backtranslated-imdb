When I was a child, I was watching over this time and remembering that the song "Happy Cat" often sounds. All songs are great and really memorable, unlike many children's music, songs have no basis. Scenes and suits are very rich and the player has done very well, which is not surprising. Christopher Walken is very strange and does not need a stupid makeup or cat costume for the audience to believe that it is a cats that turn into a man. Jason Connery, the son of such a beautiful, shy and magnificent shaft, Corin, is in love with the beautiful and courageous Prince Vera. This is a fun, entertaining, long-lasting movie, unlike most fairy tales, characters are given identity. Some of my favorite parts claimed that Puss Corin had choked; When it comes to dancing in every country, it is collected as "anger outside"; When Walken is in the kitchen, dancing at the table (there is a very good dancer!); When Vera told him all the things he was when he was young, she was a daughter of a miller. I would recommend this movie to children and parents, lovers of magic and amazement. In fact, it's a movie you can watch together.
