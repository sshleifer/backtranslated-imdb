I liked it. Generally I'm not a comedy and comedian fan, but I love Whoopi. I'm partly going to Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur nudity. I read for pleasure, but if I feel very stressful or really mentally, watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex allowed it. This is a success in my eyes! Even when I was running, I did not go to do anything else. It does not matter to me whether it is considered "Good" or not. No, I'm not a teenager. I'm also a logic.
