There is something striking and strange about this episode. Since its inception, a certain planet has created a tension atmosphere with knowledge that will explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy residents have been dropped to evacuate, all of them apart from an older librarian, seemingly reserved for unknown parts. <br /> <br /> The members of the library, all three citizens of the library, were suddenly cut off by a crisis in the history of the planet. Kirk finds himself in a similar way to England in the 17th century, while Spock and McCoy remain stranded in frozen waste. <br /> <br /> The intersections between the two floors and the various hazardous situations the men find themselves, fall into the explosion of the planet, turning to an unknown lane for the day. <br /> <br /> Imagine this episode as a woman who has been frustrated and well-behaved, performing with Mariette Hartley as a woman driven to the Ice Age, and described as a library librarian for Ian Wolfe. This episode of the classic episode, a little reminiscent of City Forever's, is a series of storytelling and episode that ends with an episode. This should be one of the best in the entire series, especially in view of the generally lower quality of the third season.
