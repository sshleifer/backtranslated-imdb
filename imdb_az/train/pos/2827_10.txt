This is probably one of the worst films ever. This is horror. But it is very good! Probably the best, because you do not have to watch a waiting area and expect a fantastic smart and entertaining thing because you'll be disappointed. Nevertheless, you can see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair / bad English. The film further aggravates what you think, and if you are experiencing a competition that separates more space holes / screws, there are advanced entertainment times in this situation. I really recommend this film to the Smap fans who are bored or dying to die. And even then, the latter should be a little cautious, because Goro's Japanese supporters were a little unhappy about it and thought they were selling it. (He was not really, Johnny Kitagawa (who is the producer producer) can do it.
