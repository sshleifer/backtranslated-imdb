This is an exception to the rule that is worse than the original one. The best comedy. This movie is a quick action slapstick comedy that looks something every second. <br /> <br /> For more than once in the GÃ¶te Channel 2, the audience laughed loudly with a joke. <br /> <br /> Seeing the first film, there is the benefit of becoming a parody of television series in the reality of the past decades (expediton: Robinson in Sweden) This Swedish movie for the Swedish audience. If you are not familiar with Sweden or its language, do not do so. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
