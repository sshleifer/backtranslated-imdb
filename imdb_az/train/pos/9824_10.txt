This flick is a sterling example of the state of erotic B-films: bad pornography without heavy sex. Things in this situation are not so bad; a female lawyer who attempts to prove her innocence is the innocence of her lover's murderer. The rest of the film leaves nothing. Bad fun, bad aspect, bad looking women, bad kits, bad cinematography, bad sounds and bad sex scenes. Cinematographers should learn the differences between naked and erotic. <br /> <br /> There is really no such thing as to have Gabriela Hall naked or in a love scene. <br />
