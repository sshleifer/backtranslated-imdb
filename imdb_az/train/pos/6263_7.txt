The first collaboration with Schoedsack & Cooper is an attractive document for the relocation of the Persian Bakhtiar tribe. River and mountain passes twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals. When you try to walk the animals on ice and narrow mountain roads, you will feel like a weak feeling after watching the animals with ice cold water and going naked through the snow to cross the mountains.
