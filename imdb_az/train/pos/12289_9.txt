First of all, I would like to say that I have not read books, so I am disappointed in this regard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-size:" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the player, I think, was terrific, I do not have any experience in my work, and I still do not believe people can think that it is awful! Perhaps I only saw two films and the second was really good! <br /> <br / > I really liked Jeremy Irons and really understood its character, the social ladder is very hardworking and then struggles against those who can get it, but it only attracts this fight, because it does not bring it to the side and ends up being beaten, disappointed After the Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder, romantic young women who are drawn to revolutionary ideals by their lover (Banderas), have been so convinced that their iron was so convincing. it was a good part, I think) and Glenn Close was also very good.Meryl Streep had an average performance, not a player's standards, not bad. <br /> <br /> Unlike today's films, here's just comments, only people are important, at the same time, this is not an ambitious thing. The film tries to be very clever. The best evidence I love is 7 years later.
