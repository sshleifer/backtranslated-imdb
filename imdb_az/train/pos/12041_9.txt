This is a plain old anxious ghost story. I showed some of my friends at the movie club and they were written until they were done! No blood or protection - good old fashioned confusion. It begins and builds and builds. The last one is a real twist to me. <br /> <br /> Well-directed and well-functioning. An "epoch" of the 1920s was also added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I bought a book by Susan Hill from Amazon. The film follows closely. <br /> <br /> This is a shame that is not easily available on the DVD. My image is VHS. It's probably one of the best Ghost stories I've ever been to, along with the Haunted. Every day, if only a little creativity goes to show that your "face" is coming!
