In my opinion, Ealing is one of the best and best-selling movies of all time. The subject of the management of workers (a large number of professions and rights conversations) is still talked about, so there is not much discussion yet, but White Suit does not stop being a classic suspended demonstration. <br /> <br /> Writing about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric that ends in turning the natural industry into a mess is not exciting when it's written, but the movie blends the ultimate spark of the fantasy with the fact that it's a real Ealing comedy. The fabric protects the dirt and never fades! Alec Guinness's brand new white suit wearing a second half of Guinness has turned into a center for a few symbolic images and sequences that can use a handy rope to measure a transparent wall for several wallpapers like Guinness! The scenario itself is full of dry minds - "Is it well?" "Yes." "Open". - and the first degree of characterization. I always admire in these films beautifully. The comedies of the next era will have to accept the "camera point in the actors" and "Ealing" have always been interested in interesting lighting, angles and innovations, which is no exception. <br /> <br /> Of course, Alec Guinness is awesome when it comes to a story that is surprising, happy, and defeat.Stratton does not forget everything except his work, such as the insect character can be boring or annoying, but Guinness effort effortlessly tries to get out of Stratton, because the final stages create a real sense of excitement.Joan Greenwood plays a strong female role and is an absolute delight to watch as usual, like Cecil Parker and slim Michael Gough; Everyone laugh without even trying. <br /> <br / > "A man in a white suit" 81 min it has a great sparkle, a great structure, a great cast, sparkling mind, and a sincik healthy doll.
