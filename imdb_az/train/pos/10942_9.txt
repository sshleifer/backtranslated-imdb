I could give her this show on her, if this fart is not for jokes. Humans are so croaking sensitive, it's convincing! Despite the fact that the show and "jokes" look at the "racism" quickly, they are still ridiculous, pig-headed crap, "well, duh, some of these other shows are better than these jokes because at least they have their hot women." So it's disgusting. Are the jokes about abortion really great, because they really take abortions in any way? At least I am not a son of a boy. Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman join together to shoot a movie about their sisters to travel along the road. Talk about a movie of the year!
