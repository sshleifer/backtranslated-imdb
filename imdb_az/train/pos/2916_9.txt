All of the films I have seen and most of these are the best things about the US Navy (Blimpps) during the WW-II era. Yes, there are other good LTA movies, but most use a special effect than any real time weight. This man's Fleet is more real-time images and so on. Has Images. True, there are lots of corrupt dialog boxes, but today Hollywood movies are more interesting. P.S. From 1949 to 1959, I spend more than 10 years (more than 20) and over 5,000 hours at all Navy Airships. [DCT Scholars]
