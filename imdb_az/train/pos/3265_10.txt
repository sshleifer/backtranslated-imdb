I've always been a big Cybill Shepperd fan since I've seen her series a few years ago! This film certainly shows it to its best light yet! The movie came out and played so beautifully! Every now and again, he has left little movie lines to make this movie the best I've ever seen! Everyone really makes themselves! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd really made the movie! Also, Mavis has lost his fever and when he falls, he likes to die a little! This is the best film!
