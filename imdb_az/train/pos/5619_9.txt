I once lived with a housewife who initiated suicide and was in a building where you could get a fifty-dollar noise disturbance after midnight - almost with Polanski's "Tenant". <br /> <br /> But for the other reasons, the movie makes me happy. I am sure that he works - it looks very strange and strange, when the Polish character is rooted in paranoid and madness, last half an hour and so on. First, Ebert was completely non-specific and beat the film with a star star detail. But individual scenes and moments work fine, so even though I have not understood the whole movie, for example, what's in Egypt? - I still have a general positive impression. <br /> <br /> I love the surprising friend described by Bernard Fresson. How many times have I been settled because God is not a friend to stupid friends! I love the stage of the movie theater - I say the most strange thing in film history. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - this film is so foxy, it's almost unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Polansky is also a good actor; I do not agree with an occasional error comment on your performance here. His character is likely to be low-level and thought-provoking, so his low-level performance is appropriate. <br /> <br /> Yes, although I did not have a little bit of video when it started drifting because it was not dark, I understood it very well. And slow. But it does not take away the livelihood of housing, and it's something I've done quite a lot - I'm digging it. This is an all-purpose reference point you need for a funny and suddenly so strange movie like that! It is of course worth the pocket change on the DVD.
