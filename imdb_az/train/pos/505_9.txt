A very good start. I was a little surprised to find a lot of cars: it was to be bare to adapt to the original series. Although Vulcan's lady looks like a bit, casting is interesting. Spock needs a school, which is an example for the race. Too bad they could not have chosen Jeri Ryan. I like Madam Park, a Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has the capabilities. He did not distinguish other men, except the black boy. It's really gratifying. Bakula must find its place - its strong point in QL is its sense of humor and ready to try everything. Of course, it is big enough for the heroes and stronger. The pains were good, though I did not like their makeup.
