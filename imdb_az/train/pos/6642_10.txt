All the films shot before 1912 should really be watched with time and place. In 1894, the Lumiere family was owned and operated by the men [father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons of Auguste and Louis] photographed boards and paper producing plants. Not a small enterprise; There were more than 200 employees in the factory who received pensions and social security - at that time they were innovative. Located in Montplaisir, Lyon, France. What makes the Louis Lumieri interested in the construction of the cinema in 1894 remains open to speculation. My suggestion is the appearance of the peep-show machine in Paris in the autumn of 1894. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Edison's squad Dickson invented a motion camera in February 1893 in relation to the size of a patented piano. Electrically operated (using a heavy-duty battery, this mass machine has passed a lens of approximately 40 square / second (square) celluloid film strip in Black Mariya (mainly in the first movie studio). ) In 1894, Louis Lumiere introduced a motion picture camera, allowing Celluloid movie to be viewed at 16 fps even with the appearance of a human eye / brain, taking a normal action. the camera was a size of a large shoe box and was provided with a given movie magazine for enough film storage. <br /> <br /> Camera weight and lightweight (adding a printer or a projector), a light source enough to be taken somewhere to celebrate the event (if there is enough sunlight). In the spring of 1895, Louis drew a movie: some cavalry men plotted the trick; a fire burning house with a fire-proof building; and some other scenes around and around Lyon. Using a Molten lamp, he made the camera a projector and presented his films to scientists at the Revue Generales des Science's reception room. The images were projected on a five-meter screen away from the lens. The screen was lying in a door between two rooms. In the same year, photographers from Lui were photographed at the meeting of professional photographers and showed them the motion pictures of their arrival the same evening. <br /> <br /> A public exhibition of his invention until the end of the year, with applause from both science and photography communities. Each film will be about one minute long, and at least eleven films are needed to make a good presentation. One of these films, he set up the camera at the entrance to the factory and photographed his employees leaving their jobs. <br /> <br /> Public space chosen by Antoine, who introduced himself as "Fairground Barker," was a Grand Caf√© Salon Indien at the Boulevard des Capucines in Paris - a winter Saturday night on December 28, 1895 The first audience was presented with the exterior appearance of the Lumiere factory (with closed doors) because they were sitting in. Some of them, Lumiere's photos slide show, but the crank in the camera / projection turned into a crank, and it was a native to capture a moving picture. In the beginning, the door opens and people start to leave their jobs, in the middle, people approach each other - some try not to see the camera and look happy to leave behind the camera a business day. <br /> And this is the public brake is the first film for the first time.
