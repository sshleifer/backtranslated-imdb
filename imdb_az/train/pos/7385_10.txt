<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This thinking all yall 1. This was a dull telecast 2 Halle Berry and Denzel were not worthy of Washington Oscar. It was one of the best Academy awards. Because it was a moment in history. Yes, "Black Actress" has won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Many brothers and sisters have not been seen by the academy for many years. In order to be honest, I stopped my Academy's awards from winning, as well as between winning and candidates. It was a very white person who was behind me. The black actresses at the Academy had a great chance to vote, for example, Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jane Babtise, but 2.Call Berry deserves to be under pressure to vote for Oscar's competition academy. The majority of the Academy consists of white voters yes Yes Nicole the boy sang at a very respected muling rouge! However, at this time black people were placed in these awards. The academy for Mr Washington took a big debt after this unjust gain, for MalcomX. The second is that most of the most talented black actresses around the world are either white men, black women, or "Angela Basset", for anyone who thinks it's not a matter of "likely white people" in the movie industry. I did not expect that most white people would not understand it, because they never engaged in it. It is only those who give it to think
