It surprised me because I was often disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past, but when he gave greatness and real emotions, he escaped from the Persians and the Paths and made a perfect balance of performance. Always beautiful Julie Waters is here and everybody who is not in the stage with Rita Training in 1983 must immediately rent it (the perfect movie). The rest of the supporting heroes are eccentric in a very good way without overlapping. It's fun.
