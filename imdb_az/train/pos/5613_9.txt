When I'm 50-55 years old, every old freshman is a old old friend to remember Oreos and Coke whenever he is fresh. If I had set aside a bit, then magic was stripped to taste something today. This magical dressing would correct the nutrients to calculate, even physically and otherwise, for how I felt one of the expectations of a dynamic one. For half a century, they had to adjust as much as I could see that I put them aside. <br /> <br /> Now, eating is going to be a meaningful event that can create an event with a reward that is expected of itself and its past, story and future years. <br /> <br /> I'm fairly meaningful to do that with the original Coke. And I could not invade one of these magic psychological glasses? then not. But I did almost a good job. In the 70's, I really shattered Roman Polansky. It was a strange and exotic taste? You know, the films were abducted from the Soviet bloc. The movies that are susceptible to beauty after a few weeks. <br /> <br /> <strong> I took what I knew and put aside Polanski movie I liked . I have not watched it. I delayed until I thought I would be as big as I deserved. Over the years, I would like to try myself, to test the ability to cover the beauty, and to separate it from occupation. In Chopin's practice, there are a few Poland involved in this business. To work worthy of femininity when I see it. <br /> <br /> Recently, I've achieved something like this, it's time to shoot it. <br /> <br /> If you are talking about this innocent man, I already saw "9th door" and understood. the previous tenant (who was named the story) jumped out of the window and then visited this person (after playing by Polanski). It can be time, and this happens. We pray that we believe in evidence only. But it is not the way we follow him. What's important is that Polanki is the only thing that can only make edges and lonely. living in a living body of a mixed body. Both will not meet. There is a madness that can follow me over the next 30 years. In his opinion, there is no edge inside or outside. <br /> <br /> I know someone else who can do it, this sketch, which is a sketch, is a naturally fearsome occurrence. <br /> <br /> You need to know one of the greatest genius; "Rear window." Even the film is the concept of post-noir that shapes the camera into the world; the tracer creates a story. Roman captures this movie and transforms it into it. In the back window, the idea was that the audience (Jimmy Stewart) was anchor on the screen and everything else was artistic, as we looked at. Here, the protagonist of an apartment on the screen is a filmmaker. We know that. We know that everything we see is right, because it is narrator. We know that the organs are changing their identity and cause plasticization of the order. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the author will put us in an infinite horror that may affect us, but he never imagines us and allows us to imagine. Tate Assessment - From 4 to 3: Every filmmaker's identity should live up to this.
