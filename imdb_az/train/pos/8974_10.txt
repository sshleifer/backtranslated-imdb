Jiun Trnka's latest cartoon made an indictment of totalitarianism and made it difficult for her native Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, the symbolism is simple, and its trademark patterns are almost here, allowing the viewer to be worshiped. A man in a furnace is concerned with the buckwheat and the care of his only plant. But suddenly he entered a huge room and commanded his statue. The man abandons his hand and follows it. It is refreshing to watch a movie that is part of a technological pleasure these days, when the real fact is that the reality manifestation has been removed from the most animated attempts to replace the real world.
