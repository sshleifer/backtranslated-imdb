Matador is a coward, dark silver, and suspenseful melodrama, which rises above mediocrity, thanks to two enthusiastic and courageous performances from Pierce Brosnan, which has never been better, and since then has always played the best role, thanks to reliable Greg Kinnear, playing Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor As Well Plays. There is a big plus to the articles. Intelligent and sometimes very bad dialogue is given by gross in Brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different people is completely convincing. The story takes a few unexpected turns and predicts the audience to be constantly in the future. <br /> <br /> We do not know perfectly well using music, intelligent editing, and slightly unusual cinematography. The film's beautiful tone and how it is labeled for a long time. But thanks to a well-written script that keeps the viewer on the edge of the chair (which is already already).
