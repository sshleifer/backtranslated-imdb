The Flock is less maligned than the "Se7en" ripoff. <br /> <br /> There is really no reason to compare two exceptions to the last one. <br /> <br /> Now, what is my way out of the way? Often a full-blown film about a very careful public worker watching sex offenders is part of a drama. If you see his work from the beginning, his work is better. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> Gere is a very good thing. <P style = "text-align: justify;"> First, she interviewed a criminals and a woman can try and get it all, like the above social worker Errol Babbage. The way to accomplish his job is different from a police officer, he is carrying weapons and regularly checks the newspapers and informs the authorities if he is responsible for the "flock" for a bloody crime. He is also a person who does not lose all the happiness of life, and only his comfort requires his own dignity to be respected. <br /> <br /> For some time, once you smile at her, once she has been beaten her own flock, she is willing to apologize for her partner's treatment and the other. <br /> <br /> The Flock is a lucky sliding shift. <br /> <br /> Worldwide Floku is a tough drama about a man who performs a humane job and should work at the end. Unfortunately, it is to keep away from the cliff that covers it. The world we live in is a very ill place and can then be far from the happiest man. Flock takes this point in a beautiful way.
