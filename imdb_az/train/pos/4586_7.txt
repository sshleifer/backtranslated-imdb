Jackie Chan's classic director, POLICE STORY (1985), is one of the most impressive and top-of-the-day modern police officers to leave Hong Kong. Jackie just wanted to make a movie that featured the usual kung fu and also the charming guns and other popular "city" movements among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam. The police story mixes these two movements and styles, and the result is unified. <br /> <br /> Jackie, a police officer who recently protects an important witness (Brigitte Lin), is playing against a powerful gangster chief and his criminal actress, Chan Ka-Kui. Jackie's girlfriend, Johnnie To, Corey Yuen and David Lai, are played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung, showing that the Hero's Trio (and later) will be in the next roles. many of them. <br /> <br /> The structure of the Police Story is very simple, but what is this film originally designed for? <br /> <br /> Of course, Jackie made all her stunts of her character, and she was pretty bad at the scene, and when somebody finished Jackie's head (near the eye) with a sharp piece that looked too bad, there is. Also, Jackie's stunt team members killed themselves in the shootout. The incident that Jackie faced in a bus was really bad when the bus was broken from the windshield, the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen did not fly as needed. They had to fly in a car parked in front of the bus, but their flights were short and they hit the hospital with an injured asphalt. In the end, the credits are behind scenes and images of these traumatized actors, and all this is really bad and almost tasteless, but fortunately nobody was killed or injured too heavily. <br /> <br /> (Activity) is abundant and creative as expected by Chan. The scene of the legendary buses and the mall is now most likely to be among the wildest scenes that any action movie can offer. Jackie always tells how important the arrangement is (in truth), and shows that the movies are really ultra-kinetic compared to the Hollywood efforts, which are really moving scenes and time. <br /> <br /> But there is a negative point in HK action comedies that can not stand, which is something. comedy essence. The comedy was particularly erroneous and the amateur elements in the scenario did not crash, but the writer wanted to add them without realizing they were signs of a bad script and stupid dialogue. That is, the murderer screams, screams, wraps up and closes his faces, and I tell scenes like an attempt to commit a knife murder as a drunk clown from a nightmare nightmare and she has to kill her "daughter". Such behavior is foolish and unobtrusive, and I do not want to see a great movie in my turn. Symbols also speak about the symptoms of bad script, because these "high ideas" are simply meant to make things clear to respectable viewers, and thus to do things very simple and "light". <br /> <br /> Rashad Mammadov, wife of his wife and daughter Rashid Behbudov, has been killed. Come back to Hong Kong to make audiences and Jackie and more personal and inventive films, as the adventure from Hong Kong and Jackie's director, James Glickenhaus, are so sad because of the bad result produced in the United States because they do not have the same ideas about the movie. It is as it is today, as you have done and the result is as it was in the 80's. This is one of the most horrific action films and I would be perfectly up to the noise I mentioned. 7/10
