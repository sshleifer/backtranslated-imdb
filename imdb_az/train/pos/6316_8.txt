It is not "empty", but in 1958, Monicelli's "Toto", Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinal and Monicelli's classic "I Soliti Ignoti" are accurate and loyal. And the reason for this is good, all the comic characters and the plot <br /> <br /> Many times I watched the old version and knew all the gangs from the heart and came to an end, but I was also in detail (the photographer's local marketplace like the camera stolen), still enjoyed their "fresh air" and atmosphere, "Welcome to Collinwood." It is interesting to see how the lives and ways of small thieves in Italy in the 1950s fit into the United States in 2002. Things have not changed much. 8/10.
