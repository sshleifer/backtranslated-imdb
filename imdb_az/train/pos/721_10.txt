ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because he has met me with Ramones. The group lived more than in the mid-1970s, but I had a great admirer. I was fifteen years old, and in mid-80s I saw RNRHS on TV and laughed all the way. One year later or two years later I wrote the next episode of the movie and watched the Ramones concert series and said, "People, these guys are donkeys ! " Thinking about some of your albums! Twenty years later, Ramone LP / tape / CDs and three Ramone later show that they're still one of my favorite bands of all time, and RNRHS tells me whenever I look at them, and now Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny R.P.) have at least this movie and great music tones to remember them all.
