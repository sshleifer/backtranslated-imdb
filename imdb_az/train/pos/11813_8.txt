It's hard to find something that does not have a genre classic, adapting Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" to Chester Gould's famous comic strip of the 1990s. Superhero films have come out of the tree in recent years and will soon become a genre. <br /> <br /> Beatty's film, using all of Gould's source completely, has all six stripes <br /> <br /> It is possible to say that this film's strong aesthetic aesthetic continues for a very short time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ div> </ div> Caprice (Al Pacino, high-class Oscars nomination), Trcy, Tracy, Tess Worries for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), angered by his relationship with Trueheart (on the one hand, Name Glenne Headly) remains loyal to his supporters and eventually finds a father figure to look for a murder-busting hero. Tracy's Tess's loyalty is tested by the seductive development of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), the ultimate compression of Big Boy. <br /> <br /> As with Beatty's attention, all this is down, when a new criminal in the city comes up, everything is heated and everybody decides to play in the middle. <br /> <br /> It turns into a material center on tense and romantic relationships among each potential, concentrates on dotted movements and special effects. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" comic book is one of the best and most out of the film genre. I think if Chester Gould was still alive, he would have been proud of Warren Beatty's detective who was fighting for his favorite crimes. <br /> <br /> 8/10
