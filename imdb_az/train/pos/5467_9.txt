I think this should be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. He was one of the few cunning actors who could talk more and more about all the pages of the dialogue. I'm lucky enough to see an original and unmanageable movie, with additional 4 minutes of additions. The film is too small. Lily is a little young woman working for her father with her illegal speakeasy. His only good relationship with something was played by his best friend, Chico, Theresa Harris. Although Chico was an African American (and a white woman should be the best friend of the black women in the 1930s), it was as controversial as the subject of this film, and there is a special bond that Lily is not. And that's not sex. Only 2 women were left alone or shot. Lily's father said he had the power to go out and get what he wanted because he did not know what to do after his father died. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the whole point of the film. Then they had to go and destroy the last few minutes. So, the last few minutes of the movie, this beautiful movie and wish to watch. The "lesson" of the film is still as valid as it is today and I'm sure it will be 100 years later. Women are terrified of what Lily wants to do, but he works. Men, celebrate.
