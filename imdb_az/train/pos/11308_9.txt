TCM keeps me awake all the time ... they continue to come with movies ... I have not heard of you ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... A very early movie by Visconti! ... Wow ... The Postman Always Rings Twice Italian version ... bright! beautifully acted and directed ... The perfect ones have never heard of anything like Govana, such as Covana Calamai, especially Gino like Massimo Girotti ... what a sensitive person! In 1943, the screen was smoother and more attractive than anyone else! His appearance was predetermined ... Many men from the 1950s probably inspired ... he must be a great star of the world! The film is better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and the MGM version (which I really love) is less glossy. John Garfield and Lana Turner remember white dresses? forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realist and with a very different finish ... you can watch it ... I'll go to buy!
