Why did not he buy an Oscar-filled bag? This is an amazing interpretation of an int-filmed / out piece. The images are breathtaking (especially on a large screen ... pan & scan is actually killed by the beautiful cinematography and set of this movie). Each frame is a picture. Astounding. The game is almost completely damaged and the ambition of Bran is clear from the opening headlines. No Zefferelli here can tell just about the movie in a big way, but rarely. Jacobi, like Hamlet's deadly uncle, is a charming politician who does not play like a mustache bad villa, but only allows Hamlet to see why he is suspicious of a bad game. The branch also smashes the delicacy between Hamlet's false / real madness and revenge on it. And everyone from Billy Kristal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardieu and Charlton Heston is very surprised when I belong to the Branches' vision. An adorable piece.
