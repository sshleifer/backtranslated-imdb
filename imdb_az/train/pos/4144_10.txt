For a while, we have been trapped in a series of independent and foreign films and lying to my love. Oil Driving Bus is no exception. It is true. <br /> <br /> The "evil" of this film comes naturally. After half the devil's opening monologue, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. Glamorous Bridget is a witty man in a wig and savings dress. This was trying to kill each other to pull FOREVER down the stairs. <br /> <br /> But Fatty, in any case, gives the impression that someone has lost someone's identity to advise a big movie project. But the sincerity of how bad it is is so beautiful. <br /> <br /> I want you to know that this is a bad thing, but I will never force it. <br /> <br /> Never give up with the miracle, Fatty gives. Very striking.
