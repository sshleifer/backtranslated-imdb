The "kingdom" is increasingly bloody and more bent. I just saw half (I was exhausted and could not sit for 5 1/2 hours), but I liked what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoo ... it's all! <br /> <br /> <strong> It's up to you to be absolutely stomach and strange movies. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Also, you do not have to see Part 1 to understand it ... you will understand it! <Br> <br /> Does anyone know if DVDs are 1 or 2? It is tiresome to sit in a theater with these marathon films. Unfortunately, there will be no "3rd Kingdom" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after this film was shot. But you will never know!
