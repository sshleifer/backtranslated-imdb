This episode presented Holodeck to the world of TNG. There is a need to be in touch with Jarada and to convey accurate greetings or insult them. A tired Picard decides to make a trip to the Holodeck and begins a wonderful adventure. The settings are very nice and almost like a movie. Unfortunately, the Jarada probe shortly afterwards damages the cables and all safety devices stop working. Picard and now visitors should lower the mobsters of the 40s and return to Jarida. Picard meets Jarada properly and creates a new day between Humanity and Jarada. This episode of the first episode created a holodeck for many exciting and unusual adventures that can survive there.
