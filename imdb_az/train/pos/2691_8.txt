Perhaps the best achievement for Bigas Luna is an elegant balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The delicious Mathilda May, who enjoys most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the buffalos, is the goal of the young Biel Duran's pre-teen lust. Mamin's mouth can not get out of his mouth, and he wants them to breastfeed and feed his mother's breasts. The film is behind the May. Luna, Lulu, and Jamon! Jamon! As it works, the director brings a slightly unstable sexual sensitivity to his strange but beautiful tale. The ordinary suspects are frustrated, but those who are open minded will bring these sparkling erotic poems to the woman's breast. The photos of Jos√© Luis Alcaine are bright and Nicola Piovani's account is sweet and rich. Of course, the Spanish is a nice movie sweater with a beautiful anarchy sensitivity.
