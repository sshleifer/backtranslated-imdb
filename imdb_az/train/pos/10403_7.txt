This is an Eastern fantasy about incredible adventures about a triple and an Arabian night, fantasy witch and wizardry. Jaffar, imprinted by the magnificent magical faculties of Conrad Veidt, was arrested by prince Ahamad, Baghdad (attractive John Justin), who lost his throne, and then abducted by a thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). They come to Basora where they are in love with Ahamad and the prince (beautiful June Duprez). But the prince and thief Jaffar were mistaken, Ahamd turned into blindness, and Abu was a dog. Story, Sabuna, magic eyes, three magic, three magic, a few fantastic ingredients: Starring, flying mechanical horse, magic bow, flying carpet and, of course, this remarkable picture of all time one of the beautiful fantasy films. Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan, co-starred by London's Fim's Alexander Korda and combined with a striking scenario by Lajs Biro and Miles Malleson. The Second World War epidemic led to catastrophic shooting, and then the three Brothers and Sisters continued to shoot films in the US Grand Cannon Colorado. Technicolor's outstanding visual and glimpse Technicolor acquired three Oscars and Reception: the production design by William Cameron, Menzies and Vincent Korda, George Perally's Cinematography and Osmond Borradaile's special effects are still a remastering because colors are worn out today. It is also a nomination by evocative and oriental music by Miklos Rozsa. With a great imagination, this live tale resembles fantasy fans and movies as classic wonders
