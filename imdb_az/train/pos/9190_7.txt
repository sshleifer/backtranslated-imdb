Tony, a heavily wounded coma, has two things: Tony himself is a seller who lives in a business congress when his family and friends go through hell to cope with the possible loss of a great man. The imaginary sequence comes from the old TWILIGHT ZONE episode because Tony makes himself a middle-of-the-pen Joe who wants to deal with missing wallets and mixed IDs during a business trip. Intonation, like a blazer and a khaki-shaped snot, is more moderate in America and less than an Italian murder by Noo Joisey. A nice touch. Shocking long haired, hippy-dippy AJ (Paulie says "Van Helsing" at some point) has a beautiful scene with her comedian old. The best moment, with Tony, has great guys who are trying to talk about life, and this is instantaneous debate. Vito is likely to draw a line on the new dead Genin, who is in a clandestine position in the light of what we have learned about Vito.
