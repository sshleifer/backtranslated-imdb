I absolutely agree with other comments placed on this movie. For example, if the film stands on a book and is a gay character in the writer, how could he film a Hollywood movie with a gay character? Besides, there were two gay characters and I thought they were perfectly reflected in each other. One was normal, two were more feminine, but not above. Diane Keaton also performed well and was able to interact with the other characters of the film if the other reviewer was watching a real movie. For example, when Adam and Sarah look at a car that crashed into a baby, you saw his mother, and then you saw what you see in the movie, which was invincible. But if you think you're very upset about gay characters and defective characters, this movie is bad. However, if you are more open minded and do not know if there is really a good thing, you will enjoy this movie.
