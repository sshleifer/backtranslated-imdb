There are many comedies in this movie, not dark, and it's Gordon Liu. He was a very funny man who demonstrated his comic side and saw that he was defeated. His education is not "unusual" and can a knot be so deadly? Many great stunts and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mixture and show the ultimate result! Do not face Manchu tribes; relentless!
