It's really a strange movie - it's not a bad thing. It is a combination of a neo-realist film about homeless people and a fairy tale. I'm sure some of them might feel a bit strange, but I like it. Once again, this director brings together a beautiful cast of people (not actors) in the daytime and takes on a great performance of the ensemble. Despite the fact that Umberto D is not grief-stricken, both films come to a very similar point - this is very absurd. Cheesy did not see special effects - it was originally prepared in the 1950s and special effects are not necessarily important (or at least not in movies). Instead just sit back and enjoy a very strange and silly ride. <br /> <br /> Ever since I watched this movie for the first time, I've seen a DeSica director that I really need to see. CHILDREN are watching the US. A MILAN MAGAZINE is a great movie, even though it's not a fantasy or light.
