This film is a perfect illustration of The Nutcracker; <br /> <br /> Dancing is beautiful, the decor in the background was excellent and I LOVE EAT FROM LIVING. <br /> <br /> Oh, and suits ... I liked the Marzipan, Tutu was very nice. Special effects were very good (eg, trees, beds, etc.), and the rats liked it very much. I love how they do not scare them, but it's cute and huggable. <br /> <br /> If you have the identity of any person, you will not enjoy it, but this is a good movie that's good for all ages. <br /> <br /> But I have several complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why should they put Sugar Plum Fairy in these terrible bags? It would have been a little different if she was naked! And secondly, why did they have to make Cullkin's outfit in EARTH?
