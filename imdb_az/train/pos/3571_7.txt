I saw two of my young people who love this movie. This must be a cult fave! The best line, "Your clothes are deep cool!" The prince tells Cinderella. Kathleen Turner lights up like his stepfather. I also love cars and motorcycles of the 1950s. The angel prince is a great runner of typical smugglers. She tries to stay cool, but the tale does not conceal her princess-to-be love. His slipper is not a bottle (the original story is more accurate), but Cinderella is still losing, but from the heir to his throne. My only complaint is more and is almost impossible to get. Hopefully, Blockbuster or Amazon will soon be ready to start suddenly.
