Andy Goldsworthy, first of all, is a master of Taoist. Indeed, the time and the change are justified. A few years ago, I bought my first book and my family was surprised to do so many times. So it was a treat to get to know the artists personally, so there are some nice things that you can expect from a delicate and delicate, natural world, and the deepest of them is expressed by accidental dissatisfaction. It's like most guys who play things before scoop and sand, clay and snow, and only in open air (in most cases). Mr. Goldsworthy was given a gift and mission to expand such a game to create deeper visions of nature and to shine through our new, new ways. And always with respect, gratitude and the admiration of the miracle and the priestly admiration.
