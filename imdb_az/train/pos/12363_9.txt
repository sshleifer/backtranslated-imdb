The Italian-French edition of this same film in 1946 turned into an early era of 1986 and does not allow us to come to the air. This story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not keep his eyes on a mysterious, beautiful young woman living near the school (performed by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers). One day, he pursues him and pays his breath. There is only one problem: He may engage in a treacherous character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) or may have not committed a great deal of crime, and if he repents, he will be left with a slap in his hand. Also, the young woman is a little "laugh at her head" and confirms her when she finds out she is the father of a psychiatrist. The emotional instability of Giulia is only with his courageous sexual desires. Playing hot, hot, hot, with good results and a bombshell performance from Detmers, we play as yo-yo (like a guy) from a scene, up to and even then. R and X (!) Validated versions are available.
