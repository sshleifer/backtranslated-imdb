I did not read anything about the movie I accidentally watched last Saturday evening. Then, as I watched him, I felt the pain of Lena and Bochman's bones. The player I listened to, the sound and the shooting I was very surprised. When we got to bed, my husband fell asleep and I did not sleep because of the movie. I just want to wake him up to say, "I vote for the Oscar nomination, it would be for the two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Later on to read more about the film about IMDb and Mr Berry died before the release of the film and he was probably sad to learn that he had not seen the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I would still like to say that his film is a true independent film with its concept and spirit. Not only for the brilliant performances of actors but on the contrary, no brilliance that reflects the true image of human pressure should be praised for not showing any brightness. Sad, but surprising.
