I had the opportunity to watch several movies on BluRay and HD DVD. This movie is a wonderful story and a great story. This is not the case if you are looking for a perfect picture. It's easy to have this movie on DVD. I've always enjoyed a great deal of action and an excellent event that has not always come together. In general, this is a nice entertaining movie to watch. Now with Blu Ray Size. You can get two things in many Blu Ray movies. It's almost a crystal clear picture with no distortion or film in the form of a small HD. It was a disappointment when making my first blu ray movie. I almost began to think it was a blu ray standard. I know better after watching other movies. I do not believe that they spent a lot of time delivering this movie to HD. Generally, it is a problem with some movies. And you have to have the best shape for the Blu Ray gamers and Blue Ray Discs. I just consider this a valuable investment for people who have never seen this movie or bought a DVD version.
