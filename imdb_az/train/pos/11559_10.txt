Odd Couple is a funny ship. Never missed a funniest script that is loyal to cellulose - Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are the best friends: obsessive-compulsive Gilbert and ugly, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left her because she can not live because of her irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves her at the start of the film and moves with poker-friendly Oscar after suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> The whole script is packed with a stylish and gorgeous liner. Probably already "F.U." you will meet. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon is trying to clear his sin at night, and when Pigeon's sisters are very attractive by Matthau and Lemmon. completely removed from his element. This requires repeated viewing!
