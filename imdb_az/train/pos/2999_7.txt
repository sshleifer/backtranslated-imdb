There were times when this movie seemed to be something more complicated than it should be, but I think it's part of its charm. Detective Filo Vance's oversight capability appears to be far greater than all eastern accusations of the era when it comes to recent assessment of how crimes are committed. The dump of the dagger in the Chinese vase was a blow to me; Do not you mean that anyone can just fall? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had an early line on Archer Coe's 'psychological impossibility' to kill himself - I had to think about it for some time. In my opinion, does the fact that this concept actually does not study psychology actually has a scientific basis? <br /> <br /> I know that reminded me of what reminded me of the Star Trek doctor. McCoy said several times, "I'm not a doctor, I'm not a magician" and "I'm not a doctor, I'm not a detective." When DeForrest Kelley sees the movie, I can take the picture by saying 'I should use it suddenly'. <br /> <br /> The identity of the murderer does not seem to be such a great surprise after emergence, but the truth that everyone has predicted so far. But Archer and Brisbane Coe did not answer the key questions raised by the film, and who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's sharp Ghillie?
