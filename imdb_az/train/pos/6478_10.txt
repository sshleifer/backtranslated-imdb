Despite being explained in English terms, this is the best WW II documentary ever produced. Laurence Olivier's magnificent voice links the vast majority of eyewitnesses who are forced to experience the horrors of crushing (crushing) warfare episodes. Waiting for the look of DVDs on DVD. Europeans have been released on DVD this year.
