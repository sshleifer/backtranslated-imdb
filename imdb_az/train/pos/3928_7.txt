Surely well stuck and made, well stuck and prepared! But the story was very weak. The images of Lincol were even weaker. Henry Fonda was not the best, but the character he was playing was nothing. Do not say that Lincol is an intelligent donkey with a disadvantage of lack of respect for the law and the court. Who would I expect hell? Cousin Vinnie? So I came, "I'll just tell Jackass" ???? Ford's great comic hero was going to the boy but I understand it, but he really did not like it. He is making plans in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to want to sit in the courtroom. <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> So come! It was just stupid. The whole story seemed to have been thought of in her desires until she was 5 years old. By saying that he enjoyed me, it was very fun and made me laugh a few times, so I can not say a bad movie. In fact, I must say that it is good enough that nothing that makes me laugh and make me laugh is not bad, but this lively and stupid story was very funny, so I do not understand that everyone can not think so well. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this movie is historically accurate, but if there is any truth, I have to shake my head.
