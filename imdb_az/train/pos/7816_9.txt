Richard Attenborough is a director compared with the 'Gandhi' winning Academy Award, back to '83. I did not know anything about her before I first came to the release of Cry Freedom, released in 1987. Although not as popular as Gandhi, everything was out of place when the apartheid troops in South Africa had not yet been rescued. Even though most films on social issues were released after the incident, I was released during that time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real-life characters and events. The book was written by Donald Vuds, a journalist working in South Africa, until the late 1970s, by Kevin Klin. Denzel follows the origins of Woods friendship with charismatic black leader Steve Biko, beautifully described by Washington. I can not think of a better option for the role. <br /> <br /> Natural attraction and screen presence that demands Biko's character leak to Washington. First of all, Woods, as opposed to the black racism proposed by Biko, is one of his struggles and ideas that could not help pull off after meeting with a man. <br /> <br /> Relations between Biko and her family are getting stronger and more vulnerable to the situation of Biko's people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the tragedy strikes and Woods now publishes South Africa, and can get it to know what the outer world is. The second half of the film is a wonder that he and his family are getting rid of South Africa. <br /> <br /> There are also some extreme humorous dialogues. <br /> <br /> An example of the incident between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you support violence? Biko: I'm defending the opponent. Lawyer: Yes, this is not violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I now live in confrontation, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments that bring back the horrors that surround the country before it gets better. <br /> <br /> The scene where the army fired by the school's children is a bowel exacerbation and heart failure. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a must see. I suggest that those who do not know the work of Attenburton take time to do so. There are lots of money-making movies. And there are life-creating movies. I would like the last day of the day.
