It's a very fun fun with the charm of old movies. Tarzan, at the moment, wants to face the greatest dangers without hesitation, and we are in full success with him. For me, the most important thing for me is a person who has no special powers because of problems and destroys them with human capabilities (he was a great swimmer and a great scream)
