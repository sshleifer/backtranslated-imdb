The dehumanization of war is a very studied subject in films; military education is equally dehumanizing, but as potentially lifesaving, dehumanizing effects. Joel watches Schumacher's 'Tigerland' standard template, we see people who are as pure as dirt, but as a soldier, and judged that such an extreme process can be justified; they judge the essence of the war being taught (usually Vietnam, as here). But the 'Tigerland' account is a terrible opposition called Bozz (Mark Colin Farrell), who understands the power of the whole power and does not know the power of his brothers. A curriculum around this character has been built, and this is never a matter of departure from the United States (Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" went to Asia to name the same type of movie.) Although it's not a film of unique originality, This is a very good and attractive look among the director's best movie and best of the genre.
