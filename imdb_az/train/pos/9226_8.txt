For many years, I did not want to read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC, but when I went out of my head last year, I saw that I bought a movie for a binge and for some reason. <br /> <br /> This is a 15th century Italian It's a stunning movie that's built on it. A certain medieval period (though I do not think of any particular year). <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;">. She looks like a hot and interesting person, and she is taken with her immediately. His father, on the other hand, is a soldier of a family, almost immediately coming and killed by the eyes of the injured man. <br /> <br /> Therefore, she will continue to see her with her dreams. <br /> <br /> His father expels him to a temple that looks like an asylum in the open air - the inhabitants of medieval Christianity, slowly go crazy. Flavia comes from one of the nuts. But in a terrible world, it is just as foolish, and this sociologist is clearly aware of the vagueness surrounding him. <br /> <br /> Young people who live in their hometowns, and apparently, hit Flavia as a refuge, and begin to question everything about this world that has hurt itself. <br /> <br /> It is a picture of this world, showing many unpleasantness. When it comes to a father, he harms one of the lord's wives, giving the young man a religious torture. Thanks to all this, Flavia explains and questions, and finally, Christian dogma creates such paradoxicity that the film will gain some criticisms over the years as anachronistic. I do not agree with the criticism. Even though Flavia's thoughts were sometimes expressed in an indefinite fashion, for example, then a modern feminist interpretation (drawn in 1974) can return to really clear questions. Perhaps it is difficult to believe that in his own time there may be more fish than water, but this is a small point that does not come to the belabor. Flavia has been written in such a way as to consider the state of the people living in or on any era. <br /> <br /> According to experts, despite this issue will not lose forest for trees. <br /> <br /> While invading the villages, Muslims flock to Flavia and find a new version of the saints with their leaders. Islamist who is still visiting his dreams. Instantly hit with himself, he actually directed his army to turn into a Joan who came together in complete combat battles and to invaders down the Christian community and seek to take revenge on all the bad guys. /> <br /> Is he talking about a new and better world? He could have thought, but the Muslims of that era were not great in feminism because soon he learned the difficult paths. They say that you are familiar with the new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is really a street of some of the things that happened in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The film was terribly terrible and many terrible, endangered ends. Not a full audience movie, I'm sure. This is very good, though it does not belong to the nunsploitation meeting, which is often neglected. I think there is a lot of value in the last film and I'm glad I saw it.
