I just saw it at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2003 and it was funny as hell and somewhat surreal. It is located in the middle of a two-lane motorway system in Toronto, where it lives in a leaky home. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just as big as the two victims who desire the world. Acting, dialogue, and writing are very good and the whole movie looks great for such a low budget flicker. The director / writer Vincenzo Natali was involved in this scenario, and he seemed very smart and low-priced. This man is creative with these great stories, which work very well on small budgets, a huge budget embarrassing Hollywood resemblance!
