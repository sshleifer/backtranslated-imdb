"Matador" is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan, an elderly man in Mexico, who is friendly with a happy married American businessman (Greg Kinnear). Sardonic Julian (ironically "Noble") appears to be a "hard man" on the surface, but he is not actually a mass of neurosis and security but a person who understands that his chosen profession leaves him alone. world and friend. Hence, on his birthday, Danny is reaching a person who is strangely interested in his life and who is strangely interested in Julian's "unconventional" lifestyle. <br /> <br /> The filming will last a few days later. <br /> <br /> "The" and "Midnight Run" should feel completely new and original, "The Matador", however, earns points for the complexity and quality of its characters. Brosnan, aged and almost, uses his teeth as Julian in no way before. Plays a person who can not connect with the Constitution more seriously with another person, Brosnan flip and cavalier moment, then original and later sympathetic. He always keeps us out of balance because humor never gets gravely or old. Kinnear is as good as a regular businessman, Joe, who finds himself drawn to the Darkness because of his deepening relationship with Julian. Hope Davis does a good job like "Bean," as Danny is a loyal and loving wife who is interested in a world that is different from the mysterious and "dangerous" figure by his wife. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, "Matador" ourselves does not feel the depth and depth of its position and structure, keeping something of us. As a result, it feels a bit more light, and it is a bit uncertain to record the effect it needs. This may be because the writer / director Richard Chiffard's feature movie debut, and has not yet paced the movie. However, he does not always look straight, and evaluates to the fact that he is closely following two basic figures, which are rarely settled for a tall structure or easy laugh. <br /> <br /> Matador hopes Brosnan is a one-figure, but generally fun little comedy that will signal a new stage in his acting career.
