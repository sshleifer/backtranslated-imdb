The fantasy of this martial art filled with vision and Oriental philosophy is brought to you by the master director Tsui Hark, and some of the best films produced Hong Kong movie. Special effects are beautiful and creative. Although the plot is somewhat cerebral, it is a refreshing change from the films that viewers look like morons. At the same time, thinking is not your forte, it can be your movie. Maybe you should see the latest in any of the brain club in the Hollywood studio, but if you're looking for more, it's the place to find it.
