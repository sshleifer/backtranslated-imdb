This was last Friday at Laemlee's Beverly in Los Angeles Film Festival. This movie has welcomed most of the movies this evening. First of all, given the fact that two music videos were opened, I did not know what to expect from being too fast and attentive, and I was not sure I was ready for a short time. But I was very surprised that it was very pleasant. I thought that the main actor's demonster was really good. I'm very sorry for his performance. I was surprised to see that this is a Witchblade boy. Especially since then it's really good! Or he was given bad things, or he was pushed by the director shortly. The girl did a good job. In my opinion, it is difficult since its first performance and being young. Dad also did a good job. There were many really nice cg things that were both short and short in the "Mexican Hat", but I'm most glad because it had the deepest senses and really the characters. The other was a very simple event. The story was very clear and dark! He used to deal with real topics, using more fantasy as an approach to add people interested in me. I will not talk about the latest film in the block I have left. My only complaint is that I wish more and more of the devil's character and a little more, so I gave it to 10 out of 9. At the end, I thought the loans were going a little slower. Otherwise it was beautifully read, directed and edited. The text was very nice with a full change from MTV's adjustments to the present day. In the future, it will come much more than the director and actor. Now I'm not thinking of him as a Lost Actor of Sorrows, Witchblade is not a boy.
