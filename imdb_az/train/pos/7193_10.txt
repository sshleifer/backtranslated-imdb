God! Zorro is the subject of many films such as Tarzan, and probably there are many actors in the lead role. <br /> <br /> This Serial is one of my personal favorites and is one of the Top 5 Sound Series as mentioned earlier. Probably, this water is a product that has been watered up to 1939. * In 39 CE, Zorro was actually known as Pulp, literary and film character. The film opens with a little foot on the history of Mexico's European Monarchy, ie Spain's struggle for freedom. The story invites you to compare with the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the mythical San Mendelito province and its Council. It is due to Benito Juarez's attitude towards their new gold mine in Mexico. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <! <br /> <br /> <br /> Swordfighting from the Caucasian sword appears to be a sword fighter and after the engagement of the trademark, Z will send it to the Hereafter in the face of the wicked. Don Francisco is declaring his death breath that his cage Ramon (William Corson) is his nephew from the city of Zorro Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Diego: Tries to explain the true identity of Don Delo Oro, but ends before the statement is completed. <br /> Diego, Dixon's Ramonusisterini (also Don Francisco) with his frightening action. <br /> <br /> Then Diego and Ramon leave for volunteers to meet. "Who will handle us with Don Francisco?" When asked, Ramon declares, "Zorro, we are the leader of Zorro's struggle." Here is a great battle with the Legion, and now all of them are protecting the Gold Bull with silver, masks and hats. Then Zorro perished in an avalanche of a man intended for the convoy. You know the end of the first chapter of the avalanche. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for a chapter, but many other serials, such as openings, have a lot more space to build a longer storyline. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a bad leader who is concerned about the different groups. There are a few suspects behind the really "Don del Oro" mask. In a word, there is almost anything, and then almost every soldier, colorful nets, enemy Hindus, and the Legion existed on this series. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, what is the victory of "ZFL"? What's Different or Unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, in this game there are many complicated and exciting music accounts that dramatically and play on the screen. The opening theme is even shown at Cantina, 1st Class of Flamenco guitar. It's probably the only time that so many highly specialized innovations appear in the serial scenario. <br /> <br /> And still there is another feature that sets the Fighting Legion Saga before all others. That is, the film is not just about the theme of heroic music, but also sports Lyrics, yes, read Legionairres! We have heard their opening credits and reading in a few chapters! <br /> <br /> When the series was first shown on our local television (in 1955), the whole band immediately accepted Reed Hadley. Racket belongs to SQUAD, Captain Braddock from TV Series. Mr Hadley had a very different, deep voice. *** He also played a very good role. His costume and, in particular, the long distance looked good and very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a small slip. Some kind of small anachronism, by Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) who applied to the San Mendelito Council, Juarez was 18 years old (1824), and then, although he was the largest single figure in the history of Mexico, he had not yet gained such an advantage. <br /> <br /> This is not only my choice of the first 5 votes series, but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> We recalled the great product of the top flight films this year, with GONE WIND, MR.SMITH WASHINGTON, CITADEL, JUAREZ, For the first time ever, there was no national commitment to Juarez . 1850, about 25 years later. Also, the political sub-divisions are called "Regions". In fact, they are called 'States'. As we call the United States, the South of the Border also names its Repubhlic as the United States of America. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was outstanding in many "A" pictures whose rich tone sound was well exposed. Explain and listen to the 92nd street (1945) and the house of GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
