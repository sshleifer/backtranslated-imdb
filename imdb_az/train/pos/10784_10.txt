Despite all the film, Andy Griffith plays the best role in this film again on CBS. The plot is easy - the character of Griffiths is dying and his last dream is to place his wife and children his ashes (Mountains Somewhere). Television will never be seen and will never be filmed, though you will be able to watch it - IT USE.
