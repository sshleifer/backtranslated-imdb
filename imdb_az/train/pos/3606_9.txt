I really enjoyed the fight with the girl. Something I can look back on many times. The player was Fantastic and Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. I can say very convincing.

She really hated her, though she loved her. His mother died at a young age and was saddened by this role. The story of love is really a favorite part of the movie. I felt a passion for each other. She then sets up a drama again and then chooses her life with her lover. I thought it was right. For them, it was the end of your decision to decide what was going to happen in the future.
