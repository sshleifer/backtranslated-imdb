I love this movie. Bozz is not ultimately frightening to scare the soldiers who do not want to go to war. His identity, on the way to Yossarian on Cass-22, is similar to Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. But this film is not a war zone, but a pre-war combat training. This beautiful movie is a feeling of concern for men who want to sacrifice their cause because of the Vietnam War and their loss. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell was a true love and compassion of his colleague, despite the sadness and indifference of the body that was brilliant, self-killing. Bozz is completely cool and non-plussed, testing and tweaking the military superiors, getting goats on both occasions. <br /> <br /> He is Jesus Christ, with a degree in psychology. "Fellow" soldiers "to rescue" and show those who need it, do not get out of this man's army. <br /> <br /> Behavior and action are tense and convincing <br /> <br /> ALL STARS are the best choice. <br /> <br /> Together with Tigerland, Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket, she falls as one of the top three Vietnamese movies.
