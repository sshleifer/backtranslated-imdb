Ruth Gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers he never did with Columbo. And the plot is spectacular to everything around. This is one of the best Columbo episodes. The roles that Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin support are excellent. And with Peter Falk Gordon, it gives you a little extra on the scenes.
