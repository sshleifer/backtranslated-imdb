Steve Carrel is a great man in this beautiful, original, surprising air breath. <br /> <br /> In fact, the title of the film is all about this: a 40-year-old man working at the Andy Stitzer electronics store. She has a nerd and the largest collection of love for videogame and comics. Her peers who work with her store are aware that she is a virgin during a game full of sexual intercourse, and then Andy's brave sexual awakens should pass as funny as Odyessy, but always lead her down. <br /> <br /> Leave the little ones home, Pull your family to see this beautiful Romantic Mature Comedy. At the very beginning, you are crooked and cracked, and after the end, you wore extra lipstick. Something else I can only say about it is very bad Steve Carrel was not recognized as a person who has been separated 20 years ago. He will definitely get the best MTV movie awards in the coming years. <br /> <br /> I give it a perfect 10!
