At one level, this film can only bring a child who wants to throw just the chests and throw it back to throw in the air. Though deeper, it thoroughly explores the desire to rebuild with the land. <br /> <br /> I have treated your singer well. "I am here (only) for a long time, I feel unresponsive". <br /> <br /> I thought Andy Goldsworthy was one of the greatest contemporary artists. His works are mostly familiar with coffee table books and some art gallery installations. But it was a revelation to succeed in seeing the work of Riedelsheimer's lens. <br /> <br /> Goldsworthy's creativity, which has not been spilled in the future, comes alive, curled, flying, decisive, loud, crumbling. <br /> Creation and destruction process. Creation and disappearance. Getting out of the void and becoming a universe and coming back again. She has a shamanistic quality and looks at her madness. For us, fortunately for us, Goldsworthy knows that we have been able to do it, you feel his job, his art is a child for him, and if he does not do so, photography communicates his vision. Otherwise, there would be only one person, except for a few corpses and walls.
