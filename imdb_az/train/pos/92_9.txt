This is not a craft house movie, but a great entertainment. <br /> <br /> Please have good people, t & apos; and motion. I found it very entertaining. Not an intellectual stimulator, an entertaining movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are very entertaining, just thirsty. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I'd suggest checking out for a little Friday night with a boy or girl (if other girls want to see it!) <br /> <br /> Their spouses are very good. Vinnie, Corey Large, daughter of heroes. Very bad murders.
