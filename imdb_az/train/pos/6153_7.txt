Walt Disney's charming fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Clear parallels between Lewis Narnia Chronicles are quite clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Narnia Chronicles, To live in the country during the blitz. And these guys have to deal with the magic world. C.S. Unlike Lewis, Rawlins invades the children of the magical world and helps to defeat people who have been causing confusion here and so far. <br /> <br /> Pevensi will not be thrown into a fantasy kingdom as children. <br /> <br /> Here, there is no other grave philosophy than Walt Disney, and perhaps it's not a good thing to mix with her charmers, as Angela Lansbury attracts, like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury could not have been one of the top performers for anything. Disney has its own magic brand, which can not even come up with special effects boys. For this film he won the Oscars for the Magic King. <br /> <br /> The two singers split into Bedknob and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea has played the ultimate role in this film and has shot many films in the UK as one of the most loved music halls. <br /> <br /> Raqqsan Owen is known as a retired general who is in charge of the war and the Old Home Guard in the war. <br /> <br /> Writing accounts for Robert Sherman and Richard M. Mary Poppins, Sherman wrote a good and useful article here. Unbelievable Age was given an Oscar nomination, but lost to Shaft Theme. Personally, though, I long for David Tomlinson's most vivid London streets, Portabello's way. <br /> <br /> Bedknobs and Broomsticks are still a good betrayal 40 years later. Think about what happens with computer generated graphics.
