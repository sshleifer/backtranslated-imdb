Writers Perry and Randy Howze have made a very interesting little story about "Chances". <br /> <br /> A few years later, the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who will return to his ex-wife's home gets an unexpected, happy queue. <br /> <br /> Twenty-four-year-old Robert Downey, Jr. as a good friend, and is supported by Cybil Shepherd like Ryan O'Neal, enjoys a pleasant performance. <br /> <br /> This trio has an elegant style with one another, and there is only the right chemistry for this caper. I have watched this movie a few times in the movie, and every time I found it to be the happiest.
