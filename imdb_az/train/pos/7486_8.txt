I resemble a movie that I'm delaying for some reason, but I think people will not love me. First, there are people who just want to hate Tom Cruise. I really do not understand it. Secondly, I think the Cameron Crowe film succeeds in making two films. A casual, casual movie crew is confused when a movie that does not think to think too hard, takes up exactly 180 of the movie at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Crowe, while fully describing the mystery of one of its symbols, is deeply ingrained in the philosophical, mystery fans. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. Tom Cruise does a very good job. Even though I have not seen all the movies or most of them, it's probably the best I've ever seen. Supporting the handle is good. Penelope Cruz gave solid performance and Jason Lee was welcome. <br /> <br /> I love the story and I think Vanilla Sky is something more. It's a mystery, an adventure and a romantic comedy, but this is a very good story. And it has many philosophical weaknesses, and many similar ideas and stories take place in historical philosophy. David Aames is a man who has everything he wants, less or less, a second chance has been given for a return to return, and in the end despite the full scope of events with the devils and the happenings <br /> Many people choose Truth, Simplicity and Normality, so that at the end of Crowe can find something that has been disappointing that it has completely put the mystery. I think it's important. <br /> <br /> It was said that David was aware of his condition and wanted to be even stronger. <br /> <br /> The music in the movie is very good. Probably likes the movie as it is. Especially, "Njosnavelin", prepared by Sigur Ros, is an incredible song. <br /> <br /> Generally, I'll give it 3 out of 4. It's a movie for those who want to think about things and a great story for those who want to relax. This "mild approach" is probably because people do not like it, it's not a completely blown secret, or a horizontal love story. Mix and hear various elements and genres.
