The first tale of this strange horror series presents a woman killed by a group of murderers. Finally, she is a woman who has been tortured several days before she kills her. He was terribly beaten, bent in his chair infinitely, dropped his finger nails, dropped animal flaws into him, poured hot water into it, and finally his eyes were damaged by a needle (really ill and bad scene) .The creators of this unforgivable torture show It's the closest thing for a snuff movie you have ever tried to make real and for me this can get without having to commit a crime on a tape. Certainly some of the special effects are pretty poor, but making a snuff is terrific. I also "Flesh and Blood Flower" is more scary and sadistic, but less worried. Anyway, this is a must have for fans of fear!
