'Gray Gardens' (1975) is a strange documentary film by Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, the Brothers and Monsieur brothers, who lived as a pig in a 28-room palace in East Hampton, Long Island. Edie Bouvier Beale, 78, clever and dry, and many little cats and raccoons attic, living in isolation from the rest of the world, with a future promising future once called "Little Edie" Beale 56 (emotionally about 13). Enjoy themselves when listening to numbers or reading to each other (even if they do not own a television). They are good for learning to drop out of society, and viewers are involved in these two specific jobs, although people who do not work clearly have become one of the Better documents and today are also a classic of a cult.
