Many of the reviewers have pointed out that Pinar was different from the movements of filmmakers in Bollywood. While this is true, Bollywood films are generally directed to the audience and should be praised for that purpose. <br /> <br /> However, Pinjar is a perfect movie for those who want normal change. an equally-funded Bollywood movie. Pinar, who has been split between India and Pakistan, points out to Punjabi's daughter that she is a victim of social and cultural attitudes toward women's treatment. Hero Paro has to choose a life with a family returning home in Punjab, which reigns in India, and has a lifetime experience with a man with a keen sense of hope for a family life. More than just a problem with Hindus and Muslims, PÄ±narar plays a role as a mother in India in 1947 and as a mother in India and Pakistan. In contrast to typical Bollywood movies that are flying in nature, Pinjar is a film in the film and after the audience thinks about these issues.
