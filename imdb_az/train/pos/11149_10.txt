Joe Buck (Jon Voight) leaves his small life in Texas and decides to be great in the big city. Women have to ask, and men are mostly "tutti-fruttis". Wide-eyed, he comes to New York City, does not prepare a humiliating cheating series that is worse than others. <br /> <br /> In the midst of this chaos, Rico meets Ratzo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann) and is friendly. <br /> <br /> It looks like a homeless man living in a building that is being tried. <br /> <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY yalnız Şəhərdə Joe Buck-in işıqlandırıcıları deyil, keçmişinə qarşılıqlı keçmiş və keçmişinin şok kəsikləri və yarı psychedelic yuxu ardıcıllığı parçaları ilə göstərmək üçün hazırlanmış vignettes bir sıra kimi: onun uğursuz əlaqələr qardaşı təcavüz edən Annie (Jennifer Salt) was abolished by her mother's mother and made her miscarriage by her grandmother, who had the earnings of money.

In the center, the friendship between the two men struggles to express a meaning to their lives within the challenging comfort of a glorious life. Ratsonun party scene, Joe called to heal the work, and their last embrace, of course, it looks like - but it's actually a buddy film, and he managed to survive that, literally, to death, and Florida at the end of the many changes that appear old, brings a form of hope to clever Joe.
