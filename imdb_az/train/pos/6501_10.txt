If you want everything you want to know about WWII in just a few perspectives, this DVD is guaranteed to provide you with new things, so you will not need another documentary about the subject. Get it, look, learn from it. Good at school too. As a bonus, save on the epic of Ryan, Patton, a group of brothers, a long bridge, the longest day, and the Second World War era. The sounds of Sir Laurence Oliver are the overall atmosphere of each episode consisting of 26 parts. You will not find a better WWII documentary about a serious topic. PERFECT 10!
