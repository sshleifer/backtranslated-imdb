Before looking at Walter Jack Palance (Blackie), I think what viewers of the day think. Undoubtedly, it is like no other than a skull, a nose and a stretching body - even now it is not uncomfortable. And what could be better than getting out of this evil New Orleans slums, which looks like Blackie's disease? <br /> <br /> The film itself is very skillfully assembled. morgue brown humor, Vidmar-Douglas interactions, non-tourist places, fights among officers. All of this has turned into a real realistic thriller, unlike others. Widmond's local scenes, which puts an interested woman (Bel Geddes), are also driven to avoid much damage. <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ div> <div style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br> /> Widmark, But my money is one and only Zero Mostel. Is there a sweaty performer who is more likely to push the extravagant man (such as The Enforcer, 1950) or to push more into the environment? Palance deserves a dirty service because Mostel is trying to calm down every berserk pinball, with Mostel's defender Maxwell (Mostvale) defending his naked wife (Lisvud). Too bad, he lost blacklist for many years. <br /> <br /> But it's not just experts who add colors. Local population adds both character and originality, especially to two Asian children interviewed by police. The whole scene has an improvised air, as Kazan recognizes their potential and prepares a small scene on the spot. Also, a colorful rental room with all the deck hands is a pure inspiration. <br /> <br /> Whatever the film is still a well-staged, whipped tension with the apocalyptic air, which strangely proves the majority of today's maca. -hits.
