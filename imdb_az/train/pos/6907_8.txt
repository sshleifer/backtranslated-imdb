This movie is fun to watch. If you love Kevin Klein and Dave, you'll get a shot of it. Dreyfus, Deyfus, a player in his job, a hand-picked player chosen by Parador's secret police chief, abandoned South America to replace Alfons Simms's dictator Alfons Simmus. He suffered a heart attack and died. Noah, Raul, helps the former dictator's wife play the role of helping Julian's plans. Jonathan Winters also looks like a hearty American emigre, who has become CIA. He talks about Polly Holiday and Fernando Ray. The old dictator's body has a few absurd moments frozen for one year, and the final scene of the bee-maker Sonia Braga, who stabbed Dreyfus's bloody, bullet-bodied body, looks white, but only with a stain on the nerves. But all this is a great surprise.
