Streisand admirer who is just acquainted with his work from the FUNNY GIRL, needs to see how this show is seen by Streisand, a brilliant performer, before becoming a Movie Star. Never before has ever been a female singer like her, and never again (sorry, Celine - just in your dreams!) Never would be, Strelzand has never been alive, energy and, most importantly, ENTHUSIASM and only 2 or 3 after filming the Central Park, he filmed FUNNY GIRL in Hollywood and his performance was less spontaneous and more reserved, more coaching (and more rehearsed). more angry) - there is a wall between him and the audience. What really enjoyed the live performance - he knew he knew it in Hollywood and had seen this as little as possible so that he would not do it again (and oh, that's the fear of the legendary scene)! <br /> <br /> Here and his previous Judy Garland Show appearance is incredible: Streisand really could have re-sounded an old song, and the composers like Richard Rodgers and Harold Arlen loved him. But in the 1970s, Streisand tried to become a "rock" singer, his albums hit the young audience, shocked by songs that were not worth the effort or voice. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, he came back with this brilliant "Broadway Album", but why they were fighting, "how they said" and so on .. Oh, please - Someone in Striishen what did he say? She could have done all she could to do good, so she raised the audience to the level she thought they wanted. ("Back to Broadway" later, "Streisand" was not as good as it was supposed to do to improve the performance of other composers: if it were true, Richard Rodgers would have his "Some Magical Evening" "Rodgers, musicians who had to sing their songs, , of course, after Strishen's writing, also dubbed Michael Crawford on the CD in the Night of Music - No doubt, he remembers who has a CD because he repeats songs that sing and play with them, is singing as a duet? I suppose Judy Garland has thrown Streisand off and advised him not to give you what he has done, but Streisand has never lost his time, despite his objections, as always, his way or the way. - SHE Gives CBS the first television to the rice susi explained how to do - no guest, just HER. <br /> <br /> But nobody here can argue with such unprecedented results. PS - After reviewing last night (12/01), I was watching it - see yourself a brilliant music phenomenon before it's a legend! for many years - better than I remember! The 1st Act begins with "I'm late" and is called "Believe" and "The Taste of Wine" and Barbra's "I'm Fifteen" - Streisand Fully (and means FULL) will say "People" it was not yet bored with the song and though it's a slightly shorter comment, it's really up - compare it to a part of the "auto-pilot" versions. <br /> <br /> The second actor, Stryshand's "kooky" sketch-patter, has not changed much over the years, is a popular series of Depression songs created between Bergdorf-Gudman's passion. <br /> (although we do not see the audience who witnessed this historic event), they call it Striarchand, Orchestra and Presentation. Fearing and not being so fond of the audience, it could have been the most difficult part of her, but if not, she did not show her credit. "My Sweetheart Returns to Me" and "When It Comes Soon" (although I do not remember it), "Why did I chose Streisand performances?" And "FUNNY GIRL" (of course) "Do not Rain in My Parade" and my favorite song " "Fanny Brice made a song like that in 1922 and Broadway toast on it," Streisand then reads "My" and FUNNY GIRL (unlike the main difference here is black The carpet is gloved here - his suits are long sleeves and all the hands and faces we look at in black), but here the vocal is then accusing more of the immediate and later movie vocals, with Streisand and, of course, no song with Fanny Brice, like here or in the movie, see ALL ZIEGFIELD to see a more simple version of Brice.) Show S <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And he was THREE THREE KHOJALI! <br /> <br /> Therefore, he told his companion, "He has never done a better job!"
