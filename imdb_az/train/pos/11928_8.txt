This movie is still a great movie, though released by the MGM and seen by Janet Leigh in a film shot in 1951. Danny Glover brings one of his best performances, George Knox, to a successful baseball manager. Coming to this film, Christopher Lloyd (scene experiments and screen appearances, a beautiful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker (seductive Tony Danza (yes even better in this movie), Matthew McConaughey Adrien Brody (What I Say About Matthew McConaughey is the same as Adrien, except for Dazed and Confused), Taylor Negron (David), and Taylor Negron (David), who plays Dazed and Chashgin, An experienced veteran of Benjamin Johnson (California Angels owner Hank Murphy) and one of his last performances, Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O Sanders (Wilhelm Wilder), and Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) I do not think you're going to depression, and I love this movie as a child and bring back your memories of watching it today. I would recommend this to every parent and everyone looking for something that children do not see.
