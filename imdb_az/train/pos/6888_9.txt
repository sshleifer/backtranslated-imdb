I watch a movie to watch movies, and I choose the ones that are good for spreading ... I throw away those who do not. I can not say that I know more than anyone else, just because I came to watch "the gospel of Lou" ... Anyway ... A very bad movie is on my desk and I'm actually sitting with them all. In fact, I'm not watching everything, usually when I look at the cost of production, work, and how well the story is, I sometimes watch television. If something happens to me, I take the time to watch. "Lou" drew me in the first few minutes of my laptop and pulled my kresloumu to the audience, so I could completely adapt. I was amazed at the entire movie. The story is well-read, the characters are either lovable or surprising (of course, according to the actor and director's fairy tale) and are played very well. Sometimes we have made series amateur mistakes in the work and editing of the camera, but the emotional nature of the story makes it easy to eliminate these deficiencies. I heard other people's comments that sometimes brought tears from the eyes of the movie, and at other times they were moving too far ... I laughed for a moment and then wept next, and this movie was incredible. Unfortunately, I could not get it because I said it was a week late and a dollar short. Sometimes this is the way to go ... but at least I'm glad to see this one and can not wait to get the answer. Good luck and great fortune Bret Carr (if you read it) is undoubtedly talented to watch.
