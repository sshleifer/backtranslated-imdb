It's rare to find romantic comedies that are incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire film (such as the Big Fat Greek Me, Me, Myself & Irene). There were only a few unnecessary demented jokes in this movie, nothing was unpalatably puzzling. Around him was a lovely movie with lovely characters. I thought the end was a bit sharp. They feel like they end up in the world after they have ended. Those who were eager to imagine were a little willing, but with the tempo of the story. If I knew that there was a Farrelly Brotherhood movie, I would have decided to turn it into a garbage dump and not watch it, but in such a way, they could shoot a good movie by chance. They are good for them, I hope they pull back their way and start to win good films.
