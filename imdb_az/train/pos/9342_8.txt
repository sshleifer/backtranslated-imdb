Powerful movie. If you involve yourself in story, you will be caught on the line of death. A successful dentist Alan Johnson, his career and his family's balance, went into a real crisis. He sees the old college guest room Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. She finds out that Charlie, who lost her husband and her family in the 9-11 attacks to America, did not communicate with the truth ... she chose to attract her favorite music and video games from the past. Old hospitality revitalizes friendship and strengthens old relationships. Johnson has a friend, Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), who is trying to bring Charlie out of pain and bringing him out, but Alan is able to get out of the deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays Charlie's role as guardian / guardian. In the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell, and Robert Klein. <br /> <br /> Note: I have never been a fan of Sandler; but I did not see it in this role. In some scenes I thought loudly ... why would not Bob Dylan come to play in the biopic singer / songwriter Bob Dylan?
