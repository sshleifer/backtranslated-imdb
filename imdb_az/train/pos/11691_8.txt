Great movie when I see it. I have to say one of my favorite films of all time. I saw 8 times in the theater and bought a DVD. I saw that I was older and saw again that the movie was in the middle. Compared to movies that are familiar to ad comedies, this is nothing. I would like to say that Rock was stunning in the film, and the whole passage with foreigners broke a little barrier. It's also a good idea to think about how the movie goes. It looks like the film's most thought, it's a great touch. I generally love the movie ... <br /> <br /> It's still a good 7/10.
