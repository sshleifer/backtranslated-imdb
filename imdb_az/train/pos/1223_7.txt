about a year and a half ago, my dad spoke about the French gates. I was pretty curious about it, but I did not try to find it anywhere. About a year ago, I remembered the movie a year ago and thought, "Hey why not," and found it on the internet. After all, about a week later, I found in atomic films. I called my dad to the computer and I told him, "Hey, Dad, I found the creepy movie you told me before your age!" He smiled at me, turned off the lights, because the computer was a black pitch other than the screen, and he told me to watch it. I started working fine ... Then she started worrying about anything, and I was very upset. at last I pushed my head back and stood up ... jumped at me! P: I did not see this movie because it's worth it because I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> ALL MOVIE!
