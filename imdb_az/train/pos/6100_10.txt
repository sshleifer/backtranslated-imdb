This is really a funny (and sexy) movie - it's not just foolishness, it's a great move. This is an entertaining movie that feels like characters in the theater. I saw him at the Boston Film Festival and often laughed at everyone with a loud voice and moved to more serious parts of some films. It's a unique movie about two doctors, and I do not want to give anything, but there are some powerful scenes as well as really funny, and the dialogue is great. Harry's character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana and is funny and sexy in Brian White and Mya. If you have the chance to do this - get - you will not be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves the award.
