Maybe I'm talking about a movie that can only compete with the Opening Night and Bergman's Persona. Both films are simply stunning, they are rich in ideas that are hard to grasp at first glance. An actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), has a deep insight into the relationship between art and life, linking it to a scene that plays on more than one scene. One of his admirers, a young girl who declared his love for Myrtle, accidentally died, and then left a deep trace in the actress, shot by a car. He asks himself that his only solution is to ask him about the aging that begins to affect his spirits. But it does not help much, and Myrtle is a step full of madness. The scene that killed the dead (or not) soul of the deceased is one of the most exciting scenes I have ever seen in Cassavets. Myrtle ends up with a giant show on behalf of the film director in a theater scene where Gena Rowlands and Gena Rowlands make a scene because she is drunk at the opening night to perform her part exactly. This scene was shot by a spontaneous audience, with a live audience, laughter really chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands. If you love personality or are interested in a movie that offers important ideas, along with a great entertainment, this movie will be fine for you.
