Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful and real, but very entertaining. Leading actor John Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who continue to be an Oscar-winning actor, deliver splendid performances. Texas hustler, like Voight, is a hustler who migrated to a small city in Texasa, Texas, from Joe Buck, Texas. He does not apologize for his profession, but it's not easy. New York City is different from women in Cass Texas, played by women as a lady with Corcann Johnson and Oscar nominee Sylvia Miles. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape his past life in Texas. Grew up by Sally Buck, whose grandmother performed by Ruth White, a beautiful actress who died of cancer in 1969. Places in New York have become male friendships among the men who are related to Fatso, played by characters Hoffman and Buckin. These guys are struggling to live in New York without having to comply with the rules of real work. Because of the development of the film, Buck's past comes to the surface and is unhappy, but it's not clear. The film is not for kids, it can be more comfortable with Midnight Cowboy compared to today's movies and television programs. I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and an unforgettable side. It's also a tearjerker of the movie, so get your hankies too.
