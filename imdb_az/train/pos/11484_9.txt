I just came back from Zero Day Montreal premiere ... and I was as surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie. Basically it is an easy and overplayed social message about guilty Coccio ... well, Mr I'm-a-Review, it's an easy and overplayed critique of movies with a social payment. <br /> <br /> I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a school similar to that of children. Removes menus and ignorance. Well ... I understand how young children can handle this kind of horror. High schools have become the battlefields of matching. This is really an ugly sight. You have to fight your way to others. It is difficult to describe, many people do not understand that high schools have become cemeteries of human intelligence. At the same time, parents are blindfolded and laugh about how perfect their lives in comfortable living places. <br /> <br /> The true motive of the film is not something that drives them. It is like a death in a calm city and everybody tears their eyes and tries to create the atmosphere of a perfect city. Cal said this well. This corresponds to the call. Drama can come everywhere and every form. In this case, small dramas (like J. C Penny's shirt called Andre) make the city a worse nightmare. Andre and Cal took the most extreme way to express their pain. <br /> <br /> If some guys burn Andre and Cal's crosses, I especially love the last scenes. With their pain, Cal & Andre conveyed their wrath to their society, refusing to think about the causes of some acts. <br /> <br /> It might seem aggressive to the film, but Coccio thinks more than just whispering or informing. What Andre and Cal live in is a real thing ... and that's a scary thing to other kids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Graduation film ...
