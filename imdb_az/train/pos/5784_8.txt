I noticed that there were many people who sent me to Kerching. I hate this show, I really find it very striking. I think it's one of the best British children's shows. It is very ridiculous (sometimes a bit fresh) and has great symbols, because it is an endless shame. The main character, though a bit like Del Boy, is quite clever. She was trying to earn a million pounds by setting her online business with her two best friends and taking her nickname "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (likes to cook) and Danny (a simple-minded and funny relief character). Throughout the show, some heroes have left, and newcomers have come, but they are always entertaining and developing.
