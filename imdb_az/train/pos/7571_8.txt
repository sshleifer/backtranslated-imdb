This game is still up. I'll play mine on PS2, the graphics were really good. The voice was above the standard. The difficulty level is just right. Wesker must be the best symbol of the RE series in my opinion. The story surprised me and made a very different twist I did not expect. The only rating that this game deserves is great.
