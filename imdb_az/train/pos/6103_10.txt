During the Boston movie festival, I saw a movie recently. The movie was very entertaining and I believe in the world and the black America is something ready to see. Comedy, drama, noise is great. This is a good movie. Heroes are well-developed and featured in the film Wood Harris (Full Titans), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr. 3000) and beautiful Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean). The film fights in a very short time in today's society and deals with its class and grace. It's not just a story about life in the hospital, but it's a story about people and their personal travels to find out who they are or who they are.
