For some years, one of my favorite films was "The Last Hero"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to disrupt his entertainment with being a downpouring politician; <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < so I was delighted to find the DVD, so I could see these topics very well. <br /> <br /> This is not a motion movie in a "plot" surrounding white slavery during an African country's civil war. The film inside the plot is linked to a question that the film does not really intend to solve: Jake Speed ​​is a real person who helps the heroine's sister to rescue his sister from a white slave trafficker; or is the hero actually a character (includes a hero in some way in the universe existing in a few pulpa novels)? I know this is not clearly defined in this movie, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane know it well. The film thus becomes a presentation from any such fictional "adventure story" universe. This is actually a rich theme, and the potential weight is lightened by the movie's lovely and funny sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The film has weaknesses - the main cinematography of the film is to show that the film looks like television. <br /> <br /> But I love these characters very much and I like their adventure. And I'm interested in the idea that this adventure actually happened in a novel. <br /> <br /> Understand more than one wait - a good show!
