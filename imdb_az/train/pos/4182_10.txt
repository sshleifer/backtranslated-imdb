I've seen this Australian movie about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. The film shows the terrible horror of Hollywood as it often shines. The relationships between the soldiers of the two warring countries are marked by the differences in culture and, finally, the last information we do not really appreciate. You can find any copy of it - buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, you are just afraid.
