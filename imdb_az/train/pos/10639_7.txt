Dolph Lundgren's back! In about two years, the Detention follows Dolphs' first film and follows the Delayed Hidden Agenda. This film still shows that Jill Rips, Agent Red and Stormcatcher's cheapie trilogy are a good improvement for Dolph. But this movie is better than the standard of the Secret Agenda and is almost certainly better than every aspect. What is the grace of this movie from the previous trip to Dolphin? It's a cheerful feeling. <br /> <br /> Yunus has a big role in the film, and Dolph likes to see his stunts again. <br /> <br /> The story is a ridiculous and basic B-movie material. An old soldier now enters a Slovakian bad guy who seizes the school to use as a teacher and a captive class on the last day, to use it as a cover for a major drug deal. The film is not original, but it should have a fun feeling with all the clicks. If you take this very seriously, the audience will not be able to enjoy it. Thankfully, filmmakers do not accept very serious issues, and together with predictability, you can think of all the actions and this is a very bad film. <br /> <br /> The movie is allowed. uses a pretty decent budget down. 10 million budget expenditures have not been spent. There are all those on the screen with difficulties and big explosions, but there are many shots not imagined. Opening moves are complete, but then the good moments are less sparse. There are some good moments. For example, through the school corridors, the car's movement and the start of a decent shooting, destruction. The rest of the transfers are mechanically enough, but there are many things on the screen. <br /> <br /> When it comes to stone. The Secret Agenda showed that the best Dolphin has been working for centuries. There was a good standard actor for a DTV movie. However, there are problems. The majority of actors are bad. The bad guys are terrible, but the evil bad guy makes some good impression, because Alex Karsis works without any danger of laughing at the top and clean. The guys with the piece are really good, but they play the torn characters. They all hate each other and have bad habits of one another and of course, and of course they learn important life lessons in life, but they are generally worthwhile, and in particular, Chris Collins is also unpleasant. This movie is about Dolph though. The best of this film is nowhere in the worst place anywhere. There is a turning point in his career. Now it's in good shape, and the next film Direct Action will be a better form. Dolph looks bold here, it's all about making its own stunts, and it's good to see a movie re-type motion (slow-mo, a liners of explosions and big guns) as an adult, though it creates less of a longing and imagination than the Army Army . It's good to see that Dolph looks energetic. <br /> <br /> For the past eight years, Dolph has seen some of her films appear a bit tired, and using double (still in all battles)> Generally, this can be seen only for Dolph, with cheese worth and head spinning mode. There is no surprise, but there is a kind of ridiculous kind of charm. **
