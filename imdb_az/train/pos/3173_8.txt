It's a terrible thing to imagine ... especially talented actors. The writer / director never wastes the viewer with the hero Jones. <br /> <br /> Everyone who shares an apartment with a flat will cry with laughter. Everyone who comes to a ticket in front of a glass meter will only be crying straight. We want to rip a terrible toupee all over our head. It's also just a few pieces of what keeps you watching the "Cross Eyed" movie, both in front of and behind the camera, which must be a step stone for Jones and her heroic sense.
