This movie is just brilliant. Cinematography is good, the perfect player and the story is completely breathtaking. This is a white South African story by Donald Woods, who considers himself liberal until he find the apartheid reality. Kevin Kline is absolutely convincing - so when Donald Woods appeared on television a few years later, I knew him from the description of Clair. Dengel Washington is always making a high-end performance. <br /> <br /> I call you to watch this. It is worth the patience, because it speaks a long, but incredible story. Remember, nations, this really happened.
