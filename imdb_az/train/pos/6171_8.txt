For those who read Rohinton Mistry's esteemed novel, this movie will praise you because it's a glorious adaptation. Except for a small subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is almost a deadly rest of the book (up to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those who read the novel, this movie can be a bit challenging. This, of course, is not a great cinematography drama story. Instead, he had a strong element of realism, but he would have no other way. The best way to describe this long journey to the movie fans is that the Hindu version of Fiddler On The Roof is a small scale. Hero Gustad Noble was a banker in Mumbai during the Muslim / Indian war in Pakistan in the 1970s. He has many unexpected problems in his life, including a sick girl, a personal messenger, a long-time friend, some dirty money, and have to engage in an unhealthy neighborhood. The latter is not a happy or sad thing, but what is realism in reality. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a nice little movie, but if you want to see it, then you will succeed. Unlike Romance, very few releases were given.
