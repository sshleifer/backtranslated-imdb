I leased this movie to a film about sadness. Alan was holding back and cover ... I knew I'd read back or see if it was the best or worst movie i ever seen ... I think I'm lucky .. laughed at the end from the beginning. Alan Arkin brings a great character to this movie. I bought a rental copy used for my collection and always watched it .. I have recommended this movie to many people and like all of them I like it very much ... I see complaints about menus and DVDs .. but it does not get out of the movie .. disk, Blockbuster is written for exculsivley, so you did not allow the past to skip past the past. In addition, the DVD prevents you from watching the perfect movie.
