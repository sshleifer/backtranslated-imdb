There is one way that Shakespeare's works can be overdue. The language breaks the time barrier. <br /> <br /> After Romeo and Juliet (together with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio) disappointed, she began to shy away from another contemporary impression of Shakespeare. My surprise was great for Othello! <br /> <br /> Iago's character played well by Kenneth's fellow! even Yaco is really bad and dreamy, the character is played very well, hating the soul that is intended to be a spoil, is a delight to hate the audience. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, however, Fishburne's work is really good. <br /> I refuse to read it for the sophisticated scholars and lazy students.
