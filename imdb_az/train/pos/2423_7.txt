Once in life, a hoodlum is always a hoodlum, and no one will ever be able to enter "Life" or anywhere. In New York, hoodlums in the neighborhood sell drugs and fraud because they can not do it in the legal world, perhaps because they have a criminal record or narcotics habit or just lazy. This simple story resembles one another because of the loyalty and compassion associated with the characters that are similar to each other, and it is compassionate for the main players. The film is written, prepared and directed by Laurence Fishburne, 20/20 Mike (all hoodlums have nicknames) and based on his play "Riff Raff". In particular, the three main players feel like a game from the start to the longest scene on the square to decide who can rely on. Often cheerleaders are too fast, faster on the stage, and I think the film's biggest flaw. Throughout the movie, mixed, street poems, like a movie iambic pentameter rap, that movie is fierce and evocative to the world. The poet puts these people, those who kill, deceive, and betray each other, making these hoodlums difficult for us or our hatred. What is worrying about this movie, its realities do not show us how these people live, but how it affects us the same way. One is very stupid, the second is a drug addict, and the last one is suffering. However, in the middle of death, the spectator tells the jokes about the irony of hanging hangmen, even laughing.
