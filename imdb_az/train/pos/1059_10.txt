I'm sure to be winning this show, LOVE. Jessica Alba does a great job, and when we have a kick-ass girl who is not this cutesy type. The whole castle is beautiful and all episodes have good areas. Everything is put out well and I thought. They had to get together for a while because it was not a hurry to collapse. This is a great show.
