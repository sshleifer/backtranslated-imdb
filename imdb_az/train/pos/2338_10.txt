Many of the other viewers complained about the attempt of the story line. It may be, but you need to watch this show, as the narrator and Dr.Suess are added to the scenery. The adult, who has been acquainted with the childhood touch throughout the series, is both reminiscent and exciting. The show's part of the show is not something that drives the audience. The sprinkled plot and love lines scattered in this apparent paradise are something that loyal audiences return to. This is the success that ABC should never miss. Bravo ABC. LOST has gained an old time, a way to revive your head. 9 episodes before the writers hit more and more viewers.
