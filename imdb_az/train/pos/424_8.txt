I love this movie because I grew up in a trailer race. Pat Boone, behind her, reminds me of my father's pulling on the troters, as the normal height and weight of the men can be driven, unlike ordinary workers. <br /> Yes, in 1944, Home in Indiana is a better movie, but this is a very different movie. April Love is a lightweight and easy, good movie to watch. (Pat Boon's religious / spiritual looks prevent him from kissing her, but he has made a big change from today's standard tariff). In India, with Walter Brennan in the home (black and white, no one is bored with any songs) improves stress and struggle, thereby making the latest achievements more satisfactory, but requires a greater emotional investment.
