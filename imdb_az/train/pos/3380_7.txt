From the 70s I saw the tone of science fiction; some were horrendously filthy and others were provoking and really thinking of fear. Soylent Green is in the second category. Yes, sometimes there is a little campground, and yes, the furniture is a giggle or two good, but some of the movies look very scary. Here's a movie about Blade Runner 9 years ago, and it's a tendency to imagine future future as dark, intimidating, and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are better than those On Commandments and Robinson's suicide bomber. Some of the attitudes belong to each other (you can imagine a filmmaker, oh-so-politically-right in the 90's, the concept of "furniture like women"), but it's rare to find a movie from Him. I would like to see this on the big screen, because I do not think it would give the overall coverage of such a movie to a large screen presentation. Check it out.
