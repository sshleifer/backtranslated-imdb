Writer-director Brian De Palma is known for his well-known films, slightly unfair, "Hitchcock imitations". Contrary to rhetoric, De Palma does not compress Hitchcock; lends itself to a story or character that can be seen in a Hitchcock film and later broadens it in a fierce, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known to mix macabre humor with blood-filled death. <br /> <br /> Returning back in 1980, the "Kill Outfit" is likely to be De Palma's most famous Hitchcockian film, and perhaps the best of it. This story also includes a serial killer similar to one of a burnt housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street brothel (played by Nancy Allen). Yes, "Psycho", but De Palma's nakedness is technically very skillful and dark. The sequence of the museum is especially well-shot and straightforward; Elevator stab is one of the most unique shot films ever made in the movie. "Kill Outfit" can not be a complete original, but I will definitely value your time. R. was rated 105 minutes. 10 to 9 o'clock.
