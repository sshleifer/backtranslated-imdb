This little precious movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it again. Dreyfus and Braga are skillful, but Raul Julia throws the show! <br /> <br /> Generally, untrumped and unappreciated, Moon Over Parador is a glimpse, offensive humorous Gomez Addams, with just the right tone for this faithful parody. Join the reality and entertainment going on the screen. Two heads to finger!
