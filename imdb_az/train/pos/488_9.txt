The arbitrary part I received from this movie was more than just knowing that John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons to watch) played a part of the tour and engaged in chess. Everything before me was completely unexpected. That's why I will not give it again. It is enough to say that Turturroun is as spectacular as an excentric, obsessive and deeply chess genius, and Em takes steps as a strong-minded woman with him. It was more than complimentary on love and appetite than Valentine's and Toys games and gradually dropping me in the first half hour. I respect the fact that everyone will think for the second time.
