Butcher, Butch? As can be seen. After the severe start with Spike, Tom and Jerry stretch to each other, Butch calls for a stop and wants to know why. <br /> <br /> "Cats can be with dogs, or not?" Toma asks her head when she agrees. "Mice can be mixed with cats, or not?" <br /> <br /> <strong> Jerry says "no" and then sees that this is not the right answer. <br /> <br /> They include and Butch is a "Peace Treaty" (full of professional art!) and the majority of the rest of the animated film, the three are extremely beautiful, which is a refreshing change. I found fun to watch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A piece of big steak conquer the death of the "peace treaty" but the route was a wonderful change, and the usual Tom & Jerry had a clever humor.
