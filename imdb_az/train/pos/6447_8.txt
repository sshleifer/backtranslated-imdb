A famous orchestra conductor, Daniel Dareus, has a heart attack that ends up giving concerts. When we come to a small city that we left a few years ago, we watch it. She helps her to bring a new person to her after leaving her and renamed her. He bought an old school building he wanted to stay. The building needs a lot of work. <br /> <br /> It can be expected that a man with his spouse will have all the comforts of the world that he has left in his new place of residence, but in no way is Daniel in a harsh winter. <br /> <br /> Local pastor Stig, a small chamber of the church, does not care whether Daniel can help, but the conductor does not want to go back to music. Daniel begins to explore the new universe. The city's people leave it alone. Lena creates a fresh impression that she works at a local store where she goes to get her food supplies. Very few, he comes and decides to involve himself with the chorus. Lena will fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> Relations between Daniel and the chorus are not expected at first. When they are better acquainted with him, they come to accept him and turn him into one of them. His new job does not love her with a woman in charge. Spiders have sculptures, but they understand the difference that Daniel sings in different songs. <br /> <br /> Daniel's repertoire is contradictory to Stig itself. Vicar suddenly looks at Daniel in a new light; is a painful man who likes to read pornographic magazines before his wife likes Siva. As Siv shows him, controversy conflicts with dogma. <br /> <br /> Mr. Stig, fired as a head of the coronet under Done, tried to stop Daniel from thinking that he was in health. <br /> <br /> The choir invited to a competition goes to Austria. Daniel, now completely disfigured for Lena, gives her the chance to express her feelings for the first time in her life when she doubts her relationship. Late at his concert, Daniel announced that he heard unusual music, though not among them. <br /> <br /> The director of this very popular film, Kay Pollak, directed it. The story consists of a beginner to the story. Most of the film's success is accompanied by an ensemble. William Nykvist, who plays the lead role in the film, is the best excuse to watch the movie. Great job for Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk, Ylva Loof, Mr. Pollak. <br /> <br /> Stefan Nilsson talks about the great music. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography ensures better seating of the different seasons for the audience because of the beauty of the film.
