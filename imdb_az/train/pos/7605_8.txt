An extremely good television series about some missing people on a lost island. There are so many improvements and turns that you can decide when your favorite character is a minute, then he does something that he can do at that time, so he's done to do something good, finish the episode, noooooooooooooooooooo leave !!!!!! So look at many of the next episodes you'll have to wait a week, but you have to wait. Susse, action, romance, and humor are different from those that do not coincide, but it also means that the story can really be paid more attention, and what the story means. If you want a good story and something good is good, but I can say 24 is better. (I'll take a look at what you can do to check it out). because it is very unexpected, you will never know what happens next.
