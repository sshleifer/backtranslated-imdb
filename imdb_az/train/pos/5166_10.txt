Indian Spring! It was very nostalgic for me. I found this funny, heartfelt thing and I absolutely loved it! As a child we went to the camp, and everyone who is sometimes willing to return to the "good Ole" days should actually see it! A group of 20 years later, a group of old friends returns for a "merger". I will not comment on the plot that will cause you to see it for yourself. The actors were very good and include all star shooting. Everyone in it played a great role. You felt you were part of the movie. Alan Arkin was particularly good at the role of American Lou. He plays a man whom everyone wants in his life. This is a good family movie for most of them. I will not offer this one to anyone in a heartbeat! OFFERS
