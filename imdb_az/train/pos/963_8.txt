Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was afraid to make her a child film, because I hated to leave her favorite movies: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi Killer and Black Socioties Trilogy. Recently, she seems to explore a new area and, in my opinion, she succeeds. That was the first time I was watching for her, and I was so excited. <br /> <br /> The Great Jay War is a perfect baby movie and adults should love it. The whole movie reminded me of many of my favorite movies as a child: Never in the story, Labyrinth, Return to Self, etc. I did not love any of the movies because they did not see children as stupid, and that's it. There are leggings in the dark, but just like any child's movie, it's stupid. Personally, I'm not concerned with CGI and prosthesis. <br /> <br /> If you are a disaster-prone Tacashi Miike, you will not love it. But I suggest giving it a shot. This proves that Miike is different and talented as I suspect. <br /> <br /> For those who are new to Tacashi Miike and like something like this, they want something hearty or dramatic, and I offer them. other Miike films: 'Zebraman' Katakuris's Happiness 'Sabu' and 'Chinese Bird People'. <br /> <br /> Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
