This is a wonderful film about the struggle of the Mormons and their final settlement in Utah, Salt Lake. The start and ending is particularly strong, and all the message needs to be reminded - God does not talk, but we only listen. As I wrote it in the midst of horrors in New Orleans and surrounding Katrina, we were forced to abandon everything by Mormons and to act after the death of Joseph Smith. People came to this country to escape religious persecution and could not do it yet. The expulsion of the Mormons, their spending in life, the difficulties they face, are really awe-inspiring and demonstrate their great power. <br /> <br /> Despite the true beliefs of the Mormons, it is not too heavy and is marked by polygamy, but not the main points of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is top-of-the-line. we can tell you more about actual characters and how accurate the images are. <br /> <br /> Together with film shooting, actors such as Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell were all rewarded. <br /> <br /> Today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the castle to see a movie about the Mormons movie theater for filmmakers. Young strong as powerful Mormon, Darnell is not Mormon like Zina, but with his family after his father's death. There is not much to the end of the film, when power is on a big stage, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) is making a nice pair. Their fate is uncertain about its transformation, and in their case, it is surprising about polygamy. Also, do not beat for an eye glass.
