If prices go up and some data is turned into a history, any host who fights hostel problems should get rid of this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> Blandings, a executive head in New York, decided to take his family to places near Connecticut and build a beautiful home there. The mortgage turns into a hilarious lunge next to one another, because construction costs and plans go beyond control. I thought the Blandings were the funniest scenes that the contractor employed to dig a well for water. Hundreds of feet are thrown away, but they do not find water. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give incredible performances as a pair of mixed Blandings, who have never been able to imagine their difficulties. and Melvyn Douglas is better than Blanland's lawyer and family friend. <br /> <br /> Many social relationships have changed since 1948. Ms. Blandings are a little naive and can not lead to extra trouble as a dimbulb and have a black servant (horror!). So, do not watch this movie with the social lens of 2003, you will love it more. <br /> <br />
