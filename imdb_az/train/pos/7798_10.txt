I can not begin to describe how beautiful this movie is. When talking about fair or unusual things, this is a rented movie to put me in the right frame. Background music realizes the ease of existence and the greatest happiness of simplicity. The Indian girl playing is an example of a hard-hitting film in this movie and ultimately happy. Persifina, Ruby's (Ashley Judd) laundryman is something else - eyes and laughter can make the day of the hardest man. I'm watching this movie and I'm dreaming of a good conversation with good friends or with friends and I'm alone - Ruby is very often alone - not just. It is recommended for anyone with a thoughtful steering wheel of a movie.
