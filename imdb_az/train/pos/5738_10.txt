I just bought the DVD of this movie and looked at it. DVD transfer since last year, since 2001. This 1988 movie is really a great movie. Many people did not escape. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and loved it since then. I love Pittsburgh's opening shot (not as Baltimore but as another user's commentary). Pittsburgh appears to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And say that the garbage truck Pitts tour with Nicky is a very nice, interesting place! Tom Hulce gives a nice, beautiful outcome as everyone says. The DVD is a good transfer, with no extra but wide screen format. I recommend this to those who love the movie.
