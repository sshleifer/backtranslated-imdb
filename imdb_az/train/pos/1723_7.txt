Excellent P.O.W. The adventure that Eric Williams (a piece of paper that forms part of his father's body), inspired by real events, this can be the first movie and so is there a lot to answer? only ALBERT, R.N. On the other side of the Atlantic side, STALAG 17 (1953) and GREAT ESCAPE (1963), and on the other hand, high-level releases (1953, currently watching), COLDITZ Wisdom (1955) and DANGER WITHIN (1959). It is, then, strongly strengthened: British soldiers in a German camp, lenders borrowing a page from the Greek legend, preparing a running plan? under the horse horse used for physical exercises, and do not twist in full view! The film is actually divided into two halves: the first tunnel deals with the slow process of drilling, ends up running, and secondly, when the point in the stage is to drive to Sweden, at the next stages it describes the camp outside. These British films usually include stars such as Leo Genn, Anthony Steel, and up-and-coming stars (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson, and Bill Travers), countless trusted actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell). Three potentials / runs are Genn, Steel and Tomlinson: the latter looks the other, and the second is their way? just to escape to others to reach safety. As expected, this narrative is in great contention and excitement; most people-oriented P.O.W. At the sagas, women's interest is minimized. Director Lee did not have a long career? This and somewhat similar (regardless of the setting and change of viewpoint) is the most remarkable achievement of the BACK DOWN (1956)? but of course, in that case he was able to release every captive condition (even though it was a delayed release of the movie, despite the delay in the film, but with the task of shutting down the producer Ian Dalrymple in vain!). By the way, it is necessary to note, in particular, that incredible lighting (especially during day-time sequences).
