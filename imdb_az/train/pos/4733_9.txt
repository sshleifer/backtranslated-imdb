Once again, Jet Li brings his charismatic presence in the Black Mask movie. In this film, Li plays Tsui, who escapes from the program of a super-soldier who wants to get into the humanity away from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian to live a normal and peaceful life, but he needs the fate to cleanse the past before continuing to seek peace. Other members of the Super Soldier Program have fled simultaneously with Tsui, but they want to get along with the world apart from finding inner peace. Thus, Tsui is the only thing that can prevent the release of information from past teammates to end the lives of innocent people. This film screams at a strange pace and does not allow the audience to go. Martial art is incredible, but as it deserves the American audience, it can not be overlooked for using these wires. If you like an interesting story and action movies that you want, Black Mask is for you because they are dealing with psychological and physical conflicts. I'm delighted to see that some of Jet Li's video streaming finally gained basic freedom of movement in the United States and how the changes that this freedom required (such as dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the movie. This is one of Liin's best films, to go out and see him release on May 14 in America.
