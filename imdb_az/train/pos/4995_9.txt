I do not think most of us will be inclined to use the term "sight" in action movies, but I was very surprised to find out how good this film was, and deservedly received a "seal" stamp from me. Mandy is hired by a professional hijacker to shoot a diamond heist in a museum for a syndicate of syndicate, Mandy is played by Mandy Shannon Lee (daughter of late and great Bruce Lee and late Brandon Lee brother) earn an award. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> A little more thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovebirds), formerly Mandy and To get a fraudulent contract with Martin, it's exciting to see how to plan both of the thieves. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A nation living in the Caucasus has died <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, this is just but not romanticism and laughter (and I do not mean a typical liner that spreads on your motionless movies) <br /> <br /> It's not easy to root for bad guys, but we'll see the human side of those thieves and the one they developed. <br /> <br /> A great movie and not a single <br /> 10 to 9
