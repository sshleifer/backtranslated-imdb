Bill Paxton draws and manages this highly original film. It was so good I looked for the first time. The comments I heard were okay. As a result, I was expecting the most average tension .However, because of Paxtons' perfect directorship and filmmaking, it is deserving that you are a fanatic fan, especially a fear film. The film is also final credits. The strongest point in the film is that the story you have to say is very original and the same as before. Also, this mixture is well-prepared for two young potentials that perfectly convey the feelings of boys. I'm giving this movie 9/10 and I'm grateful that everybody keeps it.
