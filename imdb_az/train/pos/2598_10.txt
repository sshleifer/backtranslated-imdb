If we think that the film itself is not worth it, the novel is a great way to get a look like a pre-statement to read. In the summer of 1968, I saw a movie in NYC; I read for the first time at the graduation school. Some of the novels I read were memories of a very carefree movie. And better or worse - and now the novel has been read and taught over the past three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
