"Jag är nyfiken yellow" is a very fun thing. As I had at least one review, I was laughing repeatedly. Yellow is energetic, entertaining, self-knowing, exploring. Do not wait here for Bergman. This film reads controversy over the years since the mid-60s * in Sweden that has faced youth, nation, and world. Probably, Lena, who has spoken to yellow yellow people and politicians (for example, Olaf Palme), appears to be a serious socio-political document with the main character and others. In other times, Yellow gives parody to such a documentary. All this, Yellow, examines Lena's life, sees a personal documentary - his life, his love, his political views, his own look. Is he a complete person? complex, defective, contradictory, happy, sad, interesting. All of these are the bigger size of the director, Lena, who documented Sjöman and his crew. This really gives me yellow wings. Recognizing that this is a science fiction and craftsmanship, as well as the fact that some of them just do not appear in some funny ways and in some funny ways, their presence is another layer of the film; they shoot themselves. I remember the Bjork music video with the same quality? a video clip about making a music video, ad infinitum, go every iteration and more with cartoonish. I think it might be something like Sjöman. "Jag är nyfiken Sarı" everyone can not be tea tea, of course, smart, witty, refreshing, entertaining and original.
