Indeed, you remember what happened at some point when disaster or tragedy occurred. Moreover, it is a date that has changed the global view on terrorism in its fight against terrorism on 11 September 2001. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary is not related to the events that occurred in the 9th. / 11. On the contrary, filmmakers, brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet set out to shoot a documentary about the trials and challenges of the New York rescue team. They went to the academy and held some pullout exercises and chose proby firefighter markers to participate in Ladder 1 and Motor 7, a NY firehouse. <br /> <br /> <strong > 850 minutes local time from my father who gave me the above information. A few minutes later, he said he was someone else and that the WTC was under attack. When I came home, the upper towers of the towers were burned and they were in the smoke and an hour later they frightened me. The filmmakers ran to two cameras on that day, followed a recurring call for a group and immediately fled to the WTC, where they heard the plane crash. In the WTC1 lobby, which allowed us to be absolute, only firearms, paramedics and police first interventions forced them to understand what was happening and quickly develop their action plan. The other camera, organized by another brother, set out to search for WTC's spouse, and along the way, he had many expressions of New Yorkers and chaos around Manhatten and his surroundings. There are numerous conversations, miraculous, no injuries with the Pepper Ladder 1 and Motor 7 people throughout the documentary. But your salvation also led to psychological disturbances, as they were fighting for the event. <br /> <br /> In order to save lives, we talk about a strong friendship between these men who want to live and stop their work every day they live. <br /> <br /> The events of the day before the documentary film was completely overturned and kept by men who worked 24 hours a day in the understanding of steel structures that they had hoped to find survivors of the debris. This is not a fictional film, and it is not re-created in any other documentary film you see here (and not in the sky, for Hollywood blockbusters). <br /> <br /> On the 1st DVD, Ladder 1 and Engine 7 have separate 4-hour interviews with men. .
