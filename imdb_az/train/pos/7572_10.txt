I do not believe these games will be better, but they do it. Unfortunately, I have to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but if I still beat it, it's not possible to wait for PS2 to get it. This was a series of games that I had to beat them many times, even if I had them all. <br /> <br /> I hope this game will never end, even if the series has to end. <br /> <br />
