This game is beautiful. Indeed, if you do not, you must take it. Although it was an ancient one, it was fine now. I believe that this game will always be classic. It's as good or as Super Mario World. When I was young, my friend and I used to sit and play for the time we finally played this game. It's not nearly as advanced as the Super Mario Galaxy, but it's important if you are a supporter of Mario. Entertainment is entertaining and difficult. Except for a good graphic, everything you want from a fantasy game (well turned out in 1996). 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI ON ROCK! Nintendo is the best!
