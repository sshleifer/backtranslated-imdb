Water Water Lilies is the first well-prepared French film about young women's sexuality and friendship. Ssiamma works with special, less artificial materials that are somewhat similar to others because it's attractive to others. The film focuses on only three middle-class young girls. <br /> <br /> Their lives rotate around a large indoor swimming pool, where two of them are part of a synthetized water ballet team. <br /> <br /> Such defiance, such as parents, brothers, work, and school, has been neatly eradicated. Central sensitivity is attractive, but it is owned by skinny Marie (Pauline Acquart) who does not have a team, but she thinks she wants to be. Marie, Floriane (Adèle Haenel), worships a charming blonde and team show of who boys are. Marie, a former member of the oldest suite, is a member of the Water Ballet team, far from a full-fledged Anne (Louise Blachère). Being less exclusive is becoming really accessible to boys. Floriane, like this movie, is a bit more promising than she really is. Marie has a more important quality for a teenage girl: she's in pain. <br /> <br /> Besides the Mary Water Ballet, Floriane's admiration also strikes. Floriane uses this to make Marie the first to become a slave and a cover for his beginners, then another friend, his confidante is missing. All other girls think that Floriane is a prostitute, and she thinks that there is an illusion in men and boys who hurt themselves, because that leads them. She is frustrated with a woman's fate rather than a human being and she can not resist the validation of boys who want to kiss and bed, but she does not care about anyone and knows her relationships with them is a trap. Marie encouraged her to act as a dress, so that her (unseen) mother would not know that she had come out to meet the boys, and Marie took her to save her after the boys. First of all she looked at the opposite, but she needs Marie until Floriane Marie thinks she needs her. <br /> <br /> Anne is trying to say that her body is worse and more realistic than the other girls. <br /> <br /> While keeping the bay in all external contexts, Ssiamma's sensitive equation targets and interactions with three girls. On the other hand, the film's water crackers, including showering and spitting, are sometimes totally stuffy, and do not go so fast in 95 minutes. Fortunately, the film has a sense of humor and the trio sometimes forgets the present purpose and the escape, and only makes foolish, dull girls. Unusual moments that give life to film; very bad because it is not too bad. However, Ssiamma possesses the courage of his own obsessions, and what goes on in the theater is his personality and dynamics. Of course, we like to watch the swim and watch girls who love them. <br /> <br /> There is no great unit or drama on the way, but Marie is not only amazed, but it's a little more interesting when Floriane's desire and his jealousy are jealous - who always stands before Floriane goes all the way. Floriane really wants to get her first real relationship with Marie, but Marie is a person holding her because Floriane knows he knows it will not be important. her When it happens, it's a creepy, mechanical job. Meanwhile, Anne Francois (Warren Jacquin) has a great crush on a man's swimmer, but, of course, after Floriane. The boys are not an excluded element and always appear in the pool or on the dance floor, but they are only corpses and faces available studs.
