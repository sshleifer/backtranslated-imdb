Now I understand that I'm using IMDb and have never considered my favorite movie. What I love is not what I love so far, this means that this movie is never going to touch another animation experience so supernaturally perfect. Here, I'm not going to be a kid again; I saw this movie in the early 90s of ITV. I was 12 years old, and I was a male, a genus for this movie (most of Miyazaki's heroes are women). As a result, this film inspired my childhood psychology and I owe it to Carl Macek (sp?) Forever to prepare the English dubstick of this movie, even though it's a non-comedy Di Ney production - we can look at one - of course, subtitled, but in Macek version This version is very good (almost accurate voices of original Japanese actors) that are available on Japanese DVD! Not available in any language in English-language country. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > First, I would like to agree with those who say that you need 10 to 20 to review Miyazaki's films - they are in their league so they make almost the whole catalog of IMDb's association unimportant. <br /> <br /> An exciting story with this film is based on the village of Slag's Ravine (Pazu city area) in Miyazaki Welsh mining communities. After a major mine excavation, he traveled to Wales for several months in the early 80's (may be the end of the 70s). In the sixty years of student socialist movements they felt their position of envy. From the very beginning, the struggle between the urban and the bandits serves to show this torture by a man working. Especially in this film, the village and the clouds remind me of where I was born, because her film reflects the hinges of the slopes of the Midland British island. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story of Swift's genius satiric XVIII century novel, Swift, is on the island, intentional and ridiculous. In the sky, Miyazaki covers the myths of the Atlantis and the Babylonian tower. I think the architecture is based on the Peruvian remains, but I'm not sure, someone said that. <br /> <br /> Everyone who reads this study and who loves this film really wants to rely on Miyazaki's epic series, Mirai Shounen Conan - The Future Boy Conan - the "The Incredible Tide," the main purpose of Iskenderun. ). Conan is primarily a prototype for Laputan's Pazu and Shita. Additionally, you can see the previous work of Masterpiece Theater - some of its main frame animation. He also made the main frame for the Sherlock Hound - it also has some of the best backgrounds I've ever seen. Miyazaki and Takahata's Prince of the Sun (1968), his first feature film, are beautiful today. <br /> <br /> This film is such a gift, and I will not know what to do without all this. This is a similar story in the surroundings, it is like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-feeling!
