Finally, a movie that predicts what will happen at the end of the audience. Yes, we know all sorts of things that we can not go elsewhere, because we know that Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will have a downward spiral of the lives of their brothers, but how and when the movie ends. Hoffman is as superior to usual, and even because he can not think for himself, even deserves his younger brother who is acting on the government. The Falcon could have been a bit of his element, but he had played quite a bit. Add this blend played by Andy's wife, Marisa Tomei, in a deceptive way with Hank; Appropriation of the company's funds to pay for Andy's drug and sexual addictions; finally, a father who has discovered what happened on the day of robbery. This movie is thinking of you.
