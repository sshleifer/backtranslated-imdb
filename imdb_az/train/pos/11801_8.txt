I read several reviews of this TV movie that said the film lasted a long time and that it was basically just a funny thing. Perhaps I agree that the film will last for a while (2h30 enough ...), but of course, I do not think it's sensationalizing the topic. Jim Jones's vigorous trip and the slow pace of mental illness, paranoia and drug use are never voyeuristic. The film takes the time to show how Jones has been attracted to the audience (Brenda Vaccaro and Brad Dourif's character stand out in this regard), as well as an unusual change in Jones's reality adoption. It is not easy to see that a selfish, lonely, and compassionate publisher has become such a devastating and cruel dictator. Probably, the film does not look at Jones's motivation enough, which can make some difficulties sometimes a little bit (may be censorship) ... But the impressive performance of Powers Boothe does all this. I do not know the details of Real Jim Jones's life, but Boothe is convinced that the monster is convincing and realistic. Jones talks to Jones, Jones's Baba Divine (Remarquable James Earl Jones), congressman Leo Ryan (Ned Beatty) to Guyana camp and, of course, there are many powerful scenes among suicide bombers. That is, in the last moments, it's pretty dark. Madge Sinclair suddenly shines like a suspicious follower on this stage and when it comes to Veronica Cartwright (as Jones's spouse) and Brad Dourif, especially when they have to drink their deadly potion. The relative calmness, taste and the contrasting nature of the natural environment at the end of this scene can not be erased from one mind. Anxiety about human nature and its weaknesses. If we take into account one of the truly terrible events of the 20th century, we need to watch. Do not let it repeat again. Almost at the Jim Jones camp: "Those who do not have the past have to repeat that."
