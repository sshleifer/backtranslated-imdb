How can you assess this movie by 10/10? I do not want to say that this movie is very entertaining but the purpose is not a story, it does not mean history! This is the first film of the 'real' movie history ('le Prince de Galles' was originally, but not technically perfect) and undoubtedly has a great international value. Those who see their work day in the movie have been the first to have a chance to participate in a historic moment and make their own action! And a nice shot from all the strokes! When you think of the first people you see, it moves too much! A moment! The prehistoric date (for the first time the Lumiere brothers invented the cinematography for scientific reasons) and then for art. A dear movie!
