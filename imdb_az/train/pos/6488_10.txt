War is Hell. But the WWII documentary is paradise. <br /> <br /> Serial is not just a breathing, penetrating into the Second World War, but a clear and superior poem by Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary identifies the genre of the series. Undoubtedly, this is a long time, but you will enjoy it all and you will become even more. (I have a series on the DVD, and maybe we can watch the series three times a year). <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is a perfect part of the film. Apart from Olivier, the best part of the series tells veterans their stories; <br /> <br /> Finding a rabbit for snacks in the Caucasus or about a real battle <br /> <br /> I'll watch it now (again, my ... 11th time).
