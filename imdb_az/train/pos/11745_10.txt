If you have the chance to see this movie you will see it. you are very shocked at the parts and you really think about very important issues, but this is not didactic. in my opinion this is part of an art ... beautifully drawn, beautiful music in many styles, is an impressive level of behavior that you expect from the Dramatic Bible. Nathalie Press (billed as 'Natalie Press') is convincing in his role as a humble young man exploited by a classmate. Celia Imrie has a nice effect that sometimes ensures true stability and comfort of the viewer, where one is actually 'normal', but the real star is always one of the greatest players in our time!
