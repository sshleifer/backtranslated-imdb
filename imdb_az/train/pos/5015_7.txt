It's a tough king. Not well written. I'm not a good cinematography. This film was not too afraid, but it was not a good deal on the average. The main story dealing with immoral teenagers should be more focused on banned romance and why it really should have been included in it instead of clearing the surface because "it was said we would not know mother". Some parts must be completely reworked or reworked to give more importance to the condition of the two main characters. I wondered if the writer / director George Lucas was a fan of classic American Graffiti for several times. It's not wrong to be an admirer of this movie, but it comes to me to come up with your movie sometimes in such a way! The worst part of this was Madchen, such a small part of Amik, that is to say double! He was alone in one or two lines testing the southern accent. (Listen well, its character is from California! DOH!) Maybe if there was another star, others could follow, and we'll have a more accurate movie. Well, what you can do when you are a director, not just an artist, but a director. Very bad. In general, this is a B- and this is a little generous.
