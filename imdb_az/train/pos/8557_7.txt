I have to give it to the creative team behind these "American Pie" movies. "Direct to DVD" is typically inexpensive, inadequately filmed. Last year I was pleasantly surprised when I enjoyed the DVD "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to conquer. This year, the "Beta House" is followed. <br /> <br /> The Beta House is the first of several American Pie's "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> This is forbidden, tasty, funny loud fun. Of course, the story is a little subtle, but it's the beauty of everything. In the first 10 minutes, we have introduced all the main characters, new supportive characters, we have to get a few respected gags, welcome the oppressors, and build a common road. In all this way, the film gets no ride on any restrictions. Gags are plentiful and they do NOT keep this one back. I'm talking to male semen, urine, dildos, chick-dicks, sheep, sex orgasm spray and much more. <br /> <br /> John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley, and Eugene Levy (supporting the role of the last film like The Naked Mile). All cast is good work. Especially Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) has great energy and display. I predict good things for him. The film is also loaded with great movie reviews for those who open their eyes. The biggest smile for me was the "The Deerhunter" parody. Classic. <br /> <br /> If the bottom line is an admirer of the series, you will feel right at home with the Beta House. It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but in the end it's pretty damn.
