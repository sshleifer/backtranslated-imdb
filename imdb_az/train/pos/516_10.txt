One of the best films of all time. Black and White color change for Heaven and Earth Ranges was the superiority of the Director. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely clever, the full movie is abandoned by all human feelings and does not separate from a war movie. I have seen this movie more than once, and should never be tired of it. This is a film that asks your death and your faith to the events that follow after death.
