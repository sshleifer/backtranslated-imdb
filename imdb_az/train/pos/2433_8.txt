I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic Casper the Friendly Ghost animation. The Casperin * was an early period because it did not appear right, and Porky Pig did not appear right in the animated film * right * in the 1930s. But I respect ... <br /> <br /> In any case, this episode in the later life of a friendship dance friendships with a young fox called Todd Ferdie. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie have many fun. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie have many fun. even though no one else appears ... I hate to leave me with semi-spoiler, but the animated film is just seven minutes, so you really can not be very indefinitely. Moreover, anyone reading the cartoon IMDb can understand what happens ... <br /> <br /> The final result is a little heart failure. In fact, the most I've ever seen I watched a cartoon. But this only sent me, perhaps explaining why I wrote a comment about this animated film and many others. Or heck, in fact, I actually remember this animated movie, with a negative emotional negative effect - I have not seen since then. But the cartoon ends with a good note and pleased to see Casper and Ferdie be happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Only Warner Bros. The cartoon "Peace on Earth", this most animated was transferred in a short way.
