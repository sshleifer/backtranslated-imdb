I love this anime! I used to laugh at all with jokes and violent (mostly Aranane Ranman's reluctant, but short-lived "fianc√©e"), but he deserves to be praised, but Ranma corrects. The main character is Ranma going to China and becoming a girl who is just spinning with cold water to train to fall into the damned Jusenkko Spring. Then pure chaos after each other. Among the mules are Kuno and Kodachi, a sexy shampoo, a mixed brother and sister, facing the problem of Happosai, heroes and heroes. But Genma, who is guilty of Ranma's most of the time, is an unhappy father. If someone wants a funny anime, this is the one. Cuter with Japanese dub and is better.
