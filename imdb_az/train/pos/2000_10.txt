When I was in grade 8, I took part in a miniature miniature and my mother took the video for me. I liked it since. When I was younger, my favorite songs and great dances were, but since I've been since I was aged, I've been thinking of a fantastic player and character. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Sani Wallis' Nancy is the best character for me. He made a lot of effort for those boys, and I think that's a very strong character and the final scene ... Well, you know ... Always cries! Always the best music in my opinion. This has continued until now, and more years will come! 11/10 !!
