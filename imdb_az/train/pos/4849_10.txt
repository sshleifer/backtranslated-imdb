Ghost Train is a treat for those who appreciate the typical 1940's humor. The Second World War is divided into two parts, but it's not as I believed in before, and the characters are a unique blend of playing their role pretty well. <br /> <br /> Askey, who plays Teymur Gander, clarifies the story for parts that can be described as dull or "drag". <br /> <br /> The story of the wrong station is indeed even today's daytime standards. It's unique and communicating with each of the characters is fantastic to revive the mystery of the Ghost Train. Gander creates anxiety for all other members, and the rest are pretty good. He is always in the spotlight and can be "bored" but not appreciating the miracles of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; my idea.
