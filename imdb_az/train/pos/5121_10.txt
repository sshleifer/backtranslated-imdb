I'm a great admirer of the film, but I'm not the ordinary. I think Travolta and Winger were at a higher level than the average, I think they were places and time representatives, I liked the sound track and the Charlie Daniels Band. But I think the photo is beautiful! Perhaps 10 to 12 feet tall and smoke-filled roof smoked the bottom of the ceiling 2-4 feet below the ceiling, as the inner scenes were to be taken to the actual club and because of the low ceilings. The camera has attracted attention from smoke shots and balloons, bulls, bars, women, dances, and really low bars in the bar! What a wonderful job! There was no doubt that there was an auxiliary lighting, but to keep the atmosphere of the bar there should be low light. Ray Villalobos (Camera Operator) was outstanding! He has some shooting that is not hoping to achieve, and their effect has brought the film a sense of reality. Thanks, Ray - Great job!
