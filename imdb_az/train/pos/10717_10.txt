Excellent show. Instead of watching the same old-fashioned type of sitcom, just the different "stars", this refreshing show provides an incredibly entertaining look of office situations. We have been away from any TV show for 2 years and after all returns, we look forward to drawing this show on W. Shame Global in this show. I thought it would be a winner. Let's be realistic about things, you CAN do a lot of CAN CODES. Everyone I talk to is much more benefiting from this show and I believe it will go away from global foolishness. Instead of pushing a promising Canadian demonstration, they want to put on a regular US-style thinking. Do not get me wrong, I shoot a lot of shows on TV, but come to people, let's keep their diversity. This unique show has provided a very comedy appearance of a bit of exaggerated real-life side effects of office life and relationships, with unique characters you can not see today or any sitcom on the site. It was very bad that the global crisis was not so treacherous.
