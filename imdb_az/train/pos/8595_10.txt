I can admit that the screenwriter is not very good and has some slow parts, but all of you have to learn how fun to watch this movie. Most importantly, Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland, and Eva Longoria, Michael Douglas, and Kim Basinger have a very interesting character as their betrayer. Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria play a dynamic double, but also with their incredible talent add to the pot. Both of these are the most enjoyable films I've had in Theodore for years. Look at many fun, Sentinel.
