This is the first "Walking Tall" I've ever seen, a $ 2 movie theater in Hollywood Blvd. I did not refer to the first installment made by Joe Don Baker. I was shocked by the corruption system in McNairy and the brutality of "red gangs." I was also surprised that a person decided not to let the shift go and did something to do about it. Courageous? <br /> <br /> This film is a great event to deal with America's courage and to do something about a system that only serves its own interests. I'm pretty exaggerated about it, and I think it's one of the best films of the hero / anti-hero genre, which still contains the latest films like The Punisher. story. <br /> <br /> The last remake of the role of "rock" does not justify the real fires in Buford Pusser's story. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the "classic" will be resurrected in the future.
