Youth, leaders, excellent story about the "stars" of middle school football. How far you are to protect your friends? Lying, kill it? How much can you lose if you deal with an innocent girl? Can you overcome many resources? Can you defeat the dissatisfaction of the small townspeople? When your friend scores and "lost", do your best to pay for it, or are you a person in this regard and respect your choice? Do you harass her and show her a "problem" victory from your daughter? Can a person who is guilty of his own opinion be able to give his or her own judgment and decide for himself? I decided to think twice about who was right and decided to make a mistake, but one thing was certain - a movie and a subject which is usually very uncomfortable. Do not push!
