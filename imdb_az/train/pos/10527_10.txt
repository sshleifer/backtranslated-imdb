This is one of the best films I have ever seen! I am not an admirer of Gwyneth Paltrow, but is as good as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is beautiful as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister Sophie is hysterical as Miss Bates. Check out beautiful Jeremy Northam, like Mr. Knightley; what a gentleman! Who has never seen Emma in a film that says you should have sex and violence? <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie to watch the whole family or find a romantic for yourself, see this. Besides. Emma is this movie. With a beautiful miracle, a beautiful suit and an unforgettable tattoo (perfect talking about Jeremy Northam), Emma is a perfect moment!
