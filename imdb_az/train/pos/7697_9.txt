This is another great movie I've earned for a great deal of time to see for the first time on the big screen (Rick Baker, etc.). In the late 1980s, I was relatively new to the genre and it was just really great about three great JC, SH & YB. What could I expect when I did not pay my hard earned money to see it in the Old Scala's "Triple Classics Report"? It did not bother me, I was breathing this movie. If you are an admirer of the Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies, and if you have not seen this movie, DO NOT DO IT!
