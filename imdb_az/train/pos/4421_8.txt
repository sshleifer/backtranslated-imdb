Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, working on historical issues, taking many creative directors, editors, and photographs, calling Japan "numbers of the times." Gojoe is extremely creative in color, photography and editing. Perfect, even. A new wave of Japanese samurai films, of course, allows them to look at the traditional beliefs of Shamanism, the demons, and the secret forces, which are part of their ancient culture, but they are not really investigated in Cairo's samurai epics or in the Zaitochi series. A fine example of this genre is Onyyoji (2001). I think director Sogo Ichii is one of the most interesting and creative creators of the new wave Japanese directors. Other recent Japanese works include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shattera Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
