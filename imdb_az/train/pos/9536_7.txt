A graphic and hero hero film that has taken over a very small number of people and made them a necropolis-zombie machine - hitting one another and hacking each other so that the winner could eat them. In the middle of this case, a couple who are infected are infected. <br /> <br /> Technically a terrible comedy (?) for those with strong stomachs, such as blood and body parts. A good taste hinders me from explaining what happens here, but it can say that it is terrible. If you love something like that, take a few steps above the subtext and watch this movie. Personally, I normally do not enjoy such films, but how ill and bent they make. Here's something I really am interested in as I can really offer sad movies to those I know who knows. In addition, since I know what's going on, it's a movie that's going to be in my details that I want to see once again. When it comes to the end, I want to go back and see what I'm doing. <br /> <br /> These films have a unique internal logic. <br /> <br /> For those who are preparing blood and cutting their hands, from 10 to 7, work zero or more accurately and hides it for everyone.
