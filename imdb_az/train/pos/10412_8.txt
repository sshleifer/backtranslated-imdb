The thief in Baghdad is a treasure. First of all, a good story. Despite the fact that my four children have caused this tale, the most famous stories of the Arab Nights come from Disney Corporation, and the thieves of Baghdad have ended their interests. The story includes a twist or two that moves at a good pace and reduces predictability. Sabu, Abu, who plays a young thief, also appealed to any of today's young gamers, with my biggest daughter, "O cute!", Won the Oscar for film and special effects in 1940. Of course, but these are well suited to the story.The effects are more than 60 years old, and the effects are in line with the script, and what Buddhad thief has seen in the next twenty-five it's a very extreme state of the year, so you only have to compare the boot assembly from the 1967 Star Trek episode. <br /> <br /> This is a family movie, although there are several knives close to the end. <br /> <br /> A fun elephant, which is generally a dream to watch a fun party or a pure evening of fun or date m, it looks like those scenes.
