HELP! Wow. <br /> <br /> WRITES THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE. Before opening the open credits I was stuck to the screen. <br /> <br /> The Sci-Fi Thriller - AND the edge of your seat Whodunnit. <br /> <br /> I want that it will never end. <br /> <br /> The role of a throw in Lucy Liu. Everyone could play it. Chief actor Jeremy Northram was a perfect geeky man. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me who loves me with War Games, Sports and Down Track. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
