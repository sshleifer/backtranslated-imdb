I just watched this movie at Showtime. Actually an accident. If I had only 6 hours of sleep in the last two days, I would not have come home early. If I had not come home from work, I did not see this movie. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> It's almost played on the effects of Kevin Bacon. This is the reason and cause (so my verbiage above). No character is intertwined or intertwined. Activity, reaction, interaction, interaction. This movie is simply amazing. I have to find a copy to buy.
