Revenge, this Denzel Washington is a subject of cinematography, offers action, confusion, murder and deliberate bloodshed. In fact, the destruction of a mission, such as the search and destruction of a bodyguard, is a fact that young Dakota Fanning has been kidnapped from the school and hired to prevent Washington. The city of Mexico City, which moves towards the dead, fierce conclusion on the way to the story, is chaotic and creeps along the way. Former CIA Washington, facing a drinking problem, is well-acquainted with an old agent who has mobilized the organization's plan. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry among them, and after a difficult start, bodyguards and accusations are best friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke are a good shot to support the two stars.
