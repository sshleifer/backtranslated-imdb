Oh, real memories. At that time I lived in the Netherlands, and we looked at each Sunday evening and then on Tuesday. I've seen it at the age of 14-16. For me (in English - English) is very good because Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages ​​except children. So you've heard the original voices and the language. - The best series was the first three, and after the third series, a great character, such a mighty enemy, Nazi von Gelb, disappeared from the series (they really did not think they were captured, they always ran) in a subsequent story to put it in the room) obviously the series was distributed to Germany, and a fascist enemy would not go very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone made such a wonderful conviction that describes the clever natsist aristocrat, who made this decision, which was going to take revenge from England. It was really nice to see such a high quality performance in the youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good partner, and the young people were very normal. At that time it was very convincing for me, and then I was thinking of being part of those younger than four years older than me. It was a very interesting series for me and it was like a special show with the "Prisoner" in memory of that time. I hope we will publish good quality DVDs on the array. Bad backgrounds are still pleasant to watch. The next series is not good, has been filtered down and is not as entertaining as the first three. Hopefully, Von Gelb will also find other series of DVDs. Greetings from Canada.
