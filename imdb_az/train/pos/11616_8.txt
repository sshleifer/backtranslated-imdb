In this film, I read only the comments on the previous mine with great interest, and first of all, I state that I understand the point of view of the previous user: When I look at Israel, this film focuses on very sensitive issues and more or less direct Think of the importance of the smallest details for the disturbed audience. I would like to say that Distortion was awarded the Audience Prize at the Festival of Cinéma tout écran in Geneva in November 2005 ("Prix du public's French"). For me, I liked the job of the "nerve camera" of Mr. Bouzaglo, who portrayed the atmosphere of extreme tension and anxiety, and that's why the majority of Swiss people appreciated it. movie However, this perspective may seem like an "alien" for the Israeli watchman, but it is not surprising when it comes to Swiss audiences, because Switzerland is a country that has not been subjected to any terrorist attacks. That is why the audience in Geneva has evaluated this film in more "independent" perspective. Nevertheless, I would like to say that Mr. Bouzaglo will declare during the interview of Geneva newspaper (I translate from French): '' After 50 years here, and after all this violence, we can ask ourselves, can we still be normal? Sometimes it may be easier to commit suicide. In my movie, we are like "outside the edge" characters. This is because the film is the happiest character, because the private detective with 'voyeur' benefits the system because it uses the situation '' This is mainly my opinion, and in my opinion, the Swiss community is the main point I have shown in this movie and with the characters of the movie We have not paid attention to some discrepancies. So, different countries = different perspectives to summarize, but I think it's so nice because it relies on things that affect the future of cinema, meaning "no" formatted 'thinking style.
