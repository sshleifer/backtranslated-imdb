This adaptation of a short story by MR James's Witchcraft was first shown on the British television in 2005, BBC 4 on BBC 4, which was less watched. I saw it repeating on Bbc 4 and went on to recall her stories like The Whistle And You'll Come My Lad and The Signalman in the 1970s, another of the BBC's successful MR James story. <br /> <br /> A historian came to a small village village to look at a collection. the legendary collection of works in recent days. While in the village, he sees the abbey, which is in ruins for hundreds of years. But what about a terrible legend about an old binoculars and a terrible Gallows Hill? And what does the fate of the country know about the situation and the servant situation? Although I'm not afraid anyhow, I'm really excited about this small production, and over 40 minutes of lengthening could really be a great fit. <br /> <br /> Let's also mention that we can give 10 to 7 each.
