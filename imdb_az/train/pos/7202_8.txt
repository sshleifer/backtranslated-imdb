"Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years ago) was the first time I saw Deaththrap kissing twice on the screen before and obviously I was shocked. I understood it from the point of view and really did not break my sensibilities (not so much), but at least I was the first time I saw it in the "main movie". I thought it was a gutsy move for the time and in the middle of time like PG-rated Superman, especially Christopher Ryu, took the courage to try it. On the screen, male bisexuality could have come into action with "Brokeback," but it is interesting to note the very previous embodiment.
