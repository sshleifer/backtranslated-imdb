For the first time, Robert Culp is the first to release the story "Columbo", the first episode of a long series, as a guest on the "Kill a Book" series, and after falsifying the report, a rich, highly reputed businessman ( Patricia Crowley) has been involved in an incident after being found out to be playing a private detective body owner. The wife then rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in an angry state .... <br /> <br /> An episode that is very satisfying in many ways, especially the plot is so strongly established and later developed and is rarely a part of Columbo was killed without preventing the crime. Everything is getting stronger when using the killer to help the widow, Columbo. Especially when you are faced with three main characters and Columbo's very deceptive features make it easy to see many beautiful scenes that look beautiful. <br /> <br /> Well managed by Bernard L. Kowalski and performed at a high level, which actually set the tone for the full series (The Book of Crimes book ended badly). A column created by Columbo's creator, Richard Levinson and William Link, is well-structured and well thought out, and is supported by stable, productive tempo and meaningful sequences that exhibit the story's unexpectedness. Finally, in the final, Columbo always points out that the killer is a step. In general, this is a very good detective for Columbo, and strongly indicates that the production team works well and in a constructive way to prepare a polished Columbo story.
