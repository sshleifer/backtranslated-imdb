Why are not more movies (especially America) like a Koteft Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official on-line review and I was charged with "embarrassment" after being selected as the "Hot Dog Machine". <br /> <br /> This is being considered, so I'm going to try to remain loyal to the lack of tactile and tactile. <br /> <br /> Probably, this is a creative piece, though nowadays the classic TETSUO is inspired! What happens if it's not genuine? Although I have these films, and Tetsuo is a strange son of a fast, the Meatballs Machine is very high, and can be sold without the strong desire not to enjoy a dose of medication to clarify the importance of the film. The Fold Machine is as complicated as it is in the high flow of blood and protection. <br /> <br /> Just like watching the nightmare on Elm Street at the age of seven in my last 7 years, my preferences were horrific. In my dreams I could get a discount at the end of a week at the end of a phone call. This time (31) my dreams were a blessing. <br /> <br /> In this film human bodies, the only purpose of which is to test and fulfill the never-ending thirst for human flesh and blood. People eat cyborgs! There is more! Fight the scenes! Great Music! Great point view shooting! The woman is decent by Cyborg (at least it's better than her male). <br /> <br /> At the same time, I forgot that I remembered it as a love story! Wow, I hate your lovers, but it gets a sack! <br /> <br /> I will not wait for friends to watch this movie again to see their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because most of my friends and family do not understand the KÃ¼fte Machine. Finally, my husband went off watching the climate battle and was silent. Normally he says, "Why are you watching this lane?" He says something like that. This time he had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not the case. This is not just SPLATTER (splash bounce for splatter). These art friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CACHO
