Another attempt other than the modern Japanese managers to recognize the Chembar genre. <br /> <br /> The Buddhist monk has a vision of the killing of the legendary (and very active) demon of the Gojoe bridge to get clarity. Though Buddhist thought is not in the forefront, Kurosawa's "Ran" is in the heart of this film. Perhaps the film was most interesting to me, although it was near the Ran. <br /> <br /> Stylish visual orientation and perfect photography are of great interest in the two hours and eighteen minutes. Lead lead actors are straightforward. Music is really good. Two vulnerability stories and battle scenes. The film is drifted in the middle, which can be identified with some careful editing. And the fighting scenes are mostly drawn into fuzzy rapprochement. It works for most of the film, but it feels cheating to the finals. Another film, Tsui Hark's "Seven Swords", is a big movie, but the scenes of the fighting are frustrating. <br /> <br /> <strong> Asano does not act like a devil who really uses a sword, its toy is great, but would be added to the traditional trim fighting scene <br /> <br /> Good film, We look forward to traditional sword fights.
