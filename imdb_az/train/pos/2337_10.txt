This show is highly appreciated by critics and understands that there is no similarity between the "Daisies Pushing" style and the kidnapping of anyone. (Yes, I saw Amelie, "Daisies Pushing" is somewhat similar, but in fact it's quite different to be original). On the contrary, there is so little show on television that has such a quirky attraction. The biggest similarity is "Dead Me Myself", but "P.D" is similar to this: Bryan Fuller created both shows. <br /> <br /> This show has never been funny and appealing and always strange, but it has always been humane. <br /> <br /> Conventions of ongoing story lines. some people complained that this show did not have a spiritual center, because in the first (and several subsequent) episodes, Ned caused Chuck's father's death without any result. Above all, this should be a new definition of "without any result" because Ned was just a boy and he did not realize that Chuck's father was the cause of his death, but he understood what they were doing. In addition, Ned finally acknowledged on many episodes in the series that Chuck had given his father's death. Now, there is no reason to judge people who have killed a person who killed a man because no absolution and restoration issues should be taken without public administration. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck, <br /> <br /> However, this is a problem with story lines that continue on network dramas. I remember that David Caruso did something wrong with NYPD Blue, and he would come with him for one year - then he was forced to resign and leave the show (and left the show). Taking into account that the audience should learn now and should not think that a normal character is doing something wrong in a single episode, and is not kept in that episode, it is moving away from it. There are always weeks ahead - and maybe even next year.
