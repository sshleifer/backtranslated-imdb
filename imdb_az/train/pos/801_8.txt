Probably, JEDI is now a chronology, considered to be the "end" of the popular epic, and it's as good as many. After completing my career, I liked this direct sequence and I appreciated the competence of Luke Skywalker as a character (and Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing a lot of negative things about Ewoks, they were not bad. I loved the chase that excited the woods and felt that this chapter was a very good feeling. The latter (with some new additions I guess) all 6 chapters successfully touches a fantastic tale. I know that many true Star Wars guys have hated George Lucy for the changes he made to the original films, but I missed the 6 movies that were perfect as a whole being without delay, and without losing their time in the past without losing their lives. Oh, and, err - Carrie Fisher looked pretty tasty on her missing outfit.
