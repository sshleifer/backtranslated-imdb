Vins Lombardi High School has a new teacher - bad Ms. Togard (Mary Voronov). He intends to ban rock-and-roll music together. She shook her head with Raff Randall (P.J. Soles), a Ramone-loving. Also, the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can not seem to be related to any girl - favorite Kate Rambeau (Dey Young). <br /> <br /> The midnight movie. It was released freely and almost immediately bombarded - but it was a huge hit like the midnight movie and played in the 1980s. I am more than a few people in the college - it was like a party! <br /> <br /> People are laughing and generally entertaining with songs. <br /> Now, when I see an adult, I can not think of how much I love it. The scenario's answer is small and full of cynicisms that I believe in not hearing. The images are randomly changed and the movie jump to the whole place. It's really funny lines and beautiful performances by Soles and Woronov (really self-love). And everyone is full of energy and plays their roles on top (as they need it). As for Ramones ... I'm not a fan. I like the title tune, but the remaining songs really did not hold me. <br /> <br /> If you are a Ramones fanatic, you can give it a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is basically for kids (PG rating), it's probably silly but fun. Especially when the middle school exploded, I think they will end! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> So you look like you're in a mood for a late slumber film of the 1980s. Otherwise stay away. I'll give it 7.
