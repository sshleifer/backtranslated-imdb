After 1990, I did not like many television shows, but the 70S SHOW is so great. I did not see that I did not see him in the first period, thinking of an illogical time, I made a mistake! I started watching more and more, and I loved it more! <br /> <br /> Although some of the style, relationships, music and tastes of the 70s of the 1970s have been imbued, we have embarked on a decade with a referendum and the 70's appearance. It is a very funny, virtuous and honest dialogue that is given by the main castle, with confidence and reliability, that it only surpasses the clich√©s of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Spouse, what is the permanence of the student? <br /> <br /> In a hilarious sitcom, no matter what time, who scored 70 of his irony to show the loneliness of working in his favor. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the show, all of these topics (family problems, teenage problems, marriage problems, peer pressure) focuses on. an Eric Forman (played by the Superher Topher Grace, who is definitely a comic perfect player). Eric is super-skinny, geeky-looking, non-athletic teenager and is still super cool because of Grace's characteristic brilliant self-assertion. Eric, Laura Prepon, Danny Masterson, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and Wilmer Valderama), Donna, Hyde, Kelso, Jackie and Fez (5 players). We would like to see these 6 teenagers living in Point Place, Wisconsin, and we are gaining a lot to see! Donna, the feminist who thinks ahead, the purpose of Eric's love, and the show's key connections. After the show starts, they soon become a couple and they are never a boring couple. The majority of EPS ends with dozens of meaningful conversations about them and their future, and works as a great textbook that works in the past as an unpleasant perfect counter. Hyde is Eric's best friend, and her mother moves with the Forman soon as she leaves her; Hyde team, elegant, rich, cool and simply sits back in a group, having fun with friends, watching and tidy with aplomb. Kelso is a group's calmness and Kutcher is playing absolutely hilt, explaining some of the most baseless hilarious thoughts and stories, along with this wonderful physical comedy! Jackie, Kelki's girlfriend, is a verbose, self-absorbed debutante cheerleader, and is originally regarded as part of the Kelso group b / c, but she must accept all of them. to him And finally, Fez! Fez, a foreign currency student from an unknown country (we do not know where we are exactly) and stealing the scene! "Good day, I said!" "You son of a bastard!" Valderama is the only foreign accent, because it is, in fact, has always been nature's most unique characters ever seen, and I Creates one. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> The bell has repeatedly been in trouble (most purpose). They always play Point Place residents and gags to each other. <br /> <br /> Ericin parents, terrible, who hated commie-red and happy, joyous Ericin parents. -This is a happy Kitty (played by Memphis by Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp). These 2 adults show a very handy point of view on the show, and always recommend the 6 ne'er do-burners. Red and Kitty are supported by Donna's parents, buffoonish Bob (beautifully played for Don Stark's complete job) and blonde bimbo daft Midge (super-sexy Tanya Roberts in the show for nearly half). In addition, for Ericin's courageous three full season, his sister from Laurie (played by the legendary Farrah-Fawcett-looking Lisa Robin Kelly) struggled against the shenanigants of the 6th and Eric and her parents were parties! Kelly came back as a guest for a few episodes 5 eps. However, unfortunately, Kelly's personal problems led him to substitute for a terrifying new actress on Season 6. The new did not end, it was lucky, and after a few seasons passed 6 eps! Unfortunately, Season 7, Topher Grace (Eric) and Season 8 before Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) left the show and did not seem to be the end of the season. Grace and Kutcher returned to the final of the series, although the show was a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Many great supporting and adding characters from Cameo will help keep a fresh show through nostalgia and humor. The top notch supporting players are endless high Leo (played hilt by Tommy Chong), Pastor Dave, Roy (awesome comic Jim Gaffigan), Big Rhonda, Mitch, Earl and others. They also legends Marion Ross (HAPPY DAYS) and Betty White (MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW), respectively, to play Red and Kittynin mother. From Charlion Jones (PARTRIDGE FAMILY) to Pamela Sue Martine (NANCY DREW), Charo's Ted Nugent has come up with many popular conversations to K.S. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is a 70s SHOW TV classic with 70s generation and references, funny conversations and shortcomings, comic stories!
