This movement actually jumped from my chair waiting for the actors to do! It was the best of action, Farrah won this Oscar because it was great. James Russso hated me, he was a liar and played a great game. There are not many movies that connect me like this. It was a huge Alfie, looking at the shock as it was seen as a victim of Farrah's four-eyed eyes, and he lived his horror as he passed. Farrah felt like you and felt the same anguish that he wanted to hurt himself, but you knew it was wrong. The film went on a roller coaster and went upstairs in every scene.
