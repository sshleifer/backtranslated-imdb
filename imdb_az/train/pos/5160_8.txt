Dr. When McCoy and Mr Spock are stranded in a past glacial planet, Capt Kirk is in the colonial era of the same planet. But the old couple when they work the most. There is a third calm, beautiful and very sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley), except for the ice cream heat and the cave found only in the caves. Spock, having spent more time in this period, slowly returns to his father's morals and feels a natural attraction to Zarabeth, throwing "the wind to the wind", which never leaves. Only by Dr McCoy's constant "reminders", Spoka continues to clarify the truth. <br /> <br /> A few "emotions" of the character and "Nimoy" (Spok) are coming from the body of Kelly (McCoy), playing tricks. <br /> <br /> The long-term "old" Ian Wolfe recommends the role of Mr. Atoz that Captain Kirk (William Shatner), who is striking in the previous section, is a librarian responsible for sending the Trinity to the past.
