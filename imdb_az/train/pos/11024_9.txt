This movie is just great. This is fun, and you'll always be on the edge of the entire movie. In my opinion, this film is highly appreciated by critics. <br /> <br /> Well-designed mountain firefighter is perfectly suited to Gabe Walker's role. Together with him, Michael Rooker gives a great look like Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've ever seen him become a villain. <br /> <br /> And 75% of the film is a lot of bad happening on a mountain with many kids! <br /> <br /> Bright film!
