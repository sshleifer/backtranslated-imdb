It's a joy to watch this interesting project. Such a refresher and educator. <br /> Only 5 minutes is not just a movie that can learn what can be achieved on-screen, but also as an audience that can not be so ready for so long. <br /> <br /> 20 short films about love in Paris are all unique, but some are different as expected. <br /> <br /> <strong> I thought it was the best part of the Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman), although the mimes smiled the same way. <br /> <br /> I am spoiler enough to read "spoilers" against this research bus. Just watch out. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
