Immediately after Elizabeth's death (Dame Judy Dench) returned to her musical hobby, the widow, the tennis tenor saxophone player was twisted. George is now dead, and Elizabeth is no longer in the role of playing saxophone in the attic. Elizabeth is remembering the "The Blonde Bombshells", a 15-year-old member of the jazz swing band, who is more than happy to play openly: probably all WWII band's talented jazz swing musicians. <br /> <br /> At the same time, one of the members of the "Sara Bombshells" band, Elizabeth was a femininity, cross drum, Patrick (Ian Holm) with a friend. <br /> <br /> Patrick & Elizabeth's 12-year-old granddaughter Joanna (Millie Findlay), Elizabeth, rounded up and reunited old group members; this time as a group sexagenarians. Finding among members of the group (still foxy!) Madeleine (Leslie Caron); Dinah (Olympia Dukakis), a wealthy (old) marriage in Craigievar Scottish castle, is a gambler-playing, alcoholic and open-ended, divorc√©e & widow collecting money; Gwen, (real life, US jazz singer, Clio Laine), vocals; Annie, (June Whitfield), as Liberation Army trombone player; <br /> <br /> Elizabeth, Patrick & Joanna, told members of the 1940 group that they were following the world and trying to convince them. Elizabeth learns more than just what she wants to know about her elderly life with her elderly, while experiencing an explosion of extreme music with the last of her living creatures. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, neutrality, historical, sunny, multifunctional entertaining fun. The actors give wonderful performances. Regardless of their age, Bombshell audiences still show a great show. (DVDs are owned and deserved due to excess bonus features and Dolby Digital sounds). Of course, VHS collector item as an admirer of each of these horrific actors.
