It looks like one of the better movies and I've never been disappointed. The camera work was also exquisitely handmade by sound. Without a doubt, it will not be able to hold a movie as well as an incredible belief, but I felt the rhythm of this picture and time was excellent. Dakota Fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in a film that requires a child with an old soul, and he has never disappointed me with his talent. Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken, they also overcome the difficulty of showing the darkest sides of humanity, who are trying to get into the light.
