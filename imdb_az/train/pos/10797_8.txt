Compatible, jokesome Carol (by beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her beautiful husband Eddie (beloved David Houseman), Carol's best-selling, pal pal Anna (written with tasteful comic puzzles by lovely Chris Jordan) and Anna, a beloved American Pete (usually beautiful Eric Edwards) is often a quartet that ensures freedom of group sexual intercourse. Carol's unusual, but still brave widow, Jennifer (a very nice actor, by his favorite Jennifer Welles), has broken their usual rank. Soon Jennifer is emptied and a swinger in Swingers's unpleasant and unpleasant lifestyle, except for Carol, who wants to deceive her. Writer / director Joe Sarno examines the limitations of the suburban ancestry and all of wildn'easy 70's sexual revolution in a sharp, subtle and sensitive way; Sarno converts the traditional middle class bears to the beginning and other spices with the subtle and subtle substance of the mother / daughter of the brave. In addition, Sarno ranks first in the bang-up game: Welles and Brooke Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue, a stunning New Age Sex Therapist like Shandara and Erica Eaton. Fields. Better still, all women are very warm and attractive; Welles, especially with the delicate funny figure and erotic presence, toughen the screen. Sexual scenes are really scratchy and fair, but they are never soft and tiring. The bright, polished cinematography of Stephen Colwell and the bouncy, melodic acoustic folk of Jack Justis both on the money and on the money. Suggestions for fans of Sarno.
