It was a beautiful movie. A real good movie when you need it. The story is lightning (it is not Gone with the Wind), and sometimes there is a need for such a field. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also shown on TV) is proud of this role. He is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A beautiful blend of contemporary and Indian melodies. <br /> <br /> I dance throughout most of the film. <br /> <br /> If you need a fun movie, consult a high level.
