I'm from Belgium and therefore my English language is poor enough, and I'm sorry for that. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films on television that seems to be just like the usual weather. <br /> <br /> While browsing my old VHS Video collection and coming to this title, I looked and got more than 7/10 IMDb points, which was pretty decent. <br /> <br /> I confessed that I put the film in a very good way and I was surprised. Is this the only film directed by ...? How many films did he have after a good movie ...? Anyone with any potential must be forced to shoot another, yes ;-) Anyway, I would really like to see that he has taken his action and took a good movie like this. .....?
