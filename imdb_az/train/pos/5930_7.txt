Terrible mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) endanger the lives of girls, and their newest target is only Tanya (Maden Amik). But these monsters are allergic to cat scratching ... I have never been an admirer of numerous bestsellerists such as the King, Kointz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr. Dung, really is. Yes, sometimes the jaw is incredibly strange, but in fact there are striking impressions: good old cemetery, eerie soundtrack and candlelit-gothic-house scene, mirror showing terrible form of oppressors, and so on. Of course, the film is humiliated by all the tactical and toilet seats to insult Mr. Dung's intricate dialogue and fat traffickers, causing the aggressive teacher a totally meaningless sublet, but there are flowers among fertilizers.
