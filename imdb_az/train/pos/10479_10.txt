This is really a movie recommended by my dentist and I'm glad to do it! A mixture of English humor (should I say, Humor?) And a missing, middle-aged widow was trying to save her life. Add to this reality the reality of what really needs to be gained (plants under herbaceas would not do without the TLC they bought) and really a fun, yet touched movie. I always see the vision of all the bar bosses sitting on the meadow with sunglasses to calculate the lights! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but the English have definitely got this right! 10/10
