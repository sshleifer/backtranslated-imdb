It's not the Masterpiece Theater. You do not have to wait. This girl is a pure girl FUN with the most fantastic arm of women. Here, it's supposed to be a Baby Mama movie, like someone else. The only thing I look at in this film is that Tina Fey was not there - besides, the most intelligent and brilliant girl on the planet. There is pure silliness on the surface of the film but, in fact, you have many messages that you know and have a deep sense that they can come back. PURE FUN and 84 MINUTES come for everyone looking for a great run.
