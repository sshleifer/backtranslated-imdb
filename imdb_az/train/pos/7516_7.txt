The first two thirds of this biopic of Betty Page is a fascist model. Betty is an unpleasant, indoctrable thing, as described by Gretchen Mol. He has never seen anything wrong (and of course, nothing is wrong). Marie Harron, director of "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", reconstructs Betty's America by mixing old black and white photos with new, distorted, black and white images. Once Betty entered the Florida lands and began to work with Bunny Yeager, the color was presented. Betty's consciousness is the result of most of his work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, a great performance and Chris Bauer) and John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes that Harron recreates Betty's captivity photography sessions are being executed with appealing and fair. The early designers of the fetish material are not perfectly described, and we feel that this nation is part of a "dense" society. Betty did not have many problems with his fame, though his reputation prevented him from gaining the legitimacy of the world in the right way. Since the film's third movement is virtually non-existent, we watch a feature-length documentary, not a structured drama on Betty's page. On the one hand, defects are a valuable film to capture, and the producer represents another beautiful feather in the title of Christine Wagon.
