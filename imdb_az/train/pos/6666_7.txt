I can not say that this movie is close to the amount of vitriol collected by some reviewers. Yes, it is a matter of extreme padded work, correction and special effects of the king's cheese. And a comedy should sit from a moderate audience member to examine its course rather than the majority of the energy course. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's also a bit funny-loud lines, talented and attractive casting, and classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller, and Azaria are bright as the "main" team, and Garofalo and Studi get a great deal of teamwork by adding conflict and diversity. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell add a lot to the film, there are a few chances that each of them will shine. <br /> <br /> As I said, assassination is your classic "deceit-good-good" stuff. There is no surprise, because they know they will win. What makes it valuable, absurd, hero hero and trickery, not to interact with dialogue and symbols. Under all this, these people are children in their hearts, they just want to do the right thing. The best scenes in the film give this movie a sensuous foundation. Look at Azari's relationship with her longevity mother; If he does not want Macy to accept the Cap, innocence. Amazing hidden personality; Stiller's anger (a strange, spazzy child you know in a toy that has been intolerant, poorly developed at one time); Garofalo's desire to revenge his father. This childhood belief that the sense of justice and goodness will always give the world a better place is the true appeal of the comics of super heroes; <br /> <br /> Under the parody outfit of "Mystery Men," this hackneyed comic book shows why it is very important to trops. <br /> <br /> Many half-baked subplots (romanticism, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main area is such a luxurious entertainment. If some reviewers are thinking of being good and unusual, there are some reviewers here, so I'll give you a warning: if there's a type of spectator who's ruined by a strange and scary cartoon, it's unrecognizable and illogical ("I believe it's kind of. . * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone? ") is very similar to this movie and you are not humorous. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
