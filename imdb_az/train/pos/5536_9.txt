I really enjoyed this show. Even as young people, I was interested in all sports and I also participated in horse racing. It will always be difficult to prepare a competitive team and at the same time get permission from the race track to shoot a film about this controversial topic. One episode is especially memorable that it is expected to win a big race overlooking the horse. A syringe was found on the stable floor and everybody was thinking of it, but nothing happened in blood tests. Not long ago, they realized that the horse was not a staircase, but that the knee cartilage was lifted. The horse was destroyed by catastrophic consequences, such as kidnapping a car and seizing the engine.
