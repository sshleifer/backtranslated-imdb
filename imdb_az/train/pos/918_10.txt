If anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of this movie, USE THIS DESCRIPTION: On November 30, 2003, John Christmas, the first television channel for CBS, prepared for TV, was a city without previous Christmas, Peter Falk reiterated his role as a multilateral guardian angel. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen Mcallister, a divorced street city nurse since depression ... Photos of a newspaper photographed by Noah after her forced her to pay due to her debt of $ 100,000 were canceled by Greeley (David Cubitt). The picture left a mysterious city 25 years ago and is a courageous move by Noah's fireman's brother, Hank (William Russ), who has not been seen since. Hank sought to return quietly to the city of despair, but it was impossible for Noah's newspaper to recognize Hannah as "John Christmas" for $ 50,000. And there is a lot more interesting than this photo: It also shows a Santa Claus suit, which appears in a non-invasive midair. This challenging "Santa", of course, shares the music duet with Melek Max and even Kathleen's talented daughter, Socrro (Jennifer Pisana), now popping up in a variety of sources to tackle problems, to give advice, to free up space. <br /> <br /> COPY LOST: HERE WRITE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
