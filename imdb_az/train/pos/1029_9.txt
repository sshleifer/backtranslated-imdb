For the final part of the 10th part of the season, I would rate the perfect 10 series for the perfect and lasting high quality story and character development of the series! <br /> <br /> The last episode of the 10th season was "Unending," where Asgard fled in a very unceremonious, unreasonable and often unceremonious way (of course), and he abandoned me! <br /> <br /> Most of the events that occur in the sequence after the series's fledgling series are scheduled to take place at least one season. I think they have speeded up these two stories. <br /> <br /> If the Asgard is not returned in the next SG-1 movie, place the Stargate SG-1 franchise for two upcoming direct DVDs. <br /> <br /> <strong> Unusual science-fantasy series!
