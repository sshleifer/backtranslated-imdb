I always loved Pokemon movies. Yes, I know that all of them are mediocre in many areas, and should be sure that despite the fact that they have grown up in some areas, "Hey, light up, this is a kid's movie", but all this is a fun thing is not it? In my opinion, they are so and I love it. It's as good as the previous three and a strange cuter. Since the introduction of the lovely, fresh Pokemon Chalabi, there are really sweet and touching moments. It's not the best Pokemon movie, but I like the third payment, although the third is not bad, and the whole series is fun and harmless, fun for the popcorn family, and nothing should be considered less. It's still unpleasant and humorous, though, like all the installments and symbols, especially when it was a bit worse than the previous one and especially the previous one. These films are criticized for their lowest rank and four feature-length adaptations, and that's not worth it.
