Since I heard the version of Ralph Bakshi "The Lord of the Rings" I wondered: What is hell's 'rotoscope' animation? Well ... I finally learned ... I saw this movie three years ago that there was no idea I did not know who Ralph Bakshi was ... And I liked it ... a very good story line ... even a great cartoon there is a character development ... If you're bored with modern animation .... Do not get me wrong ... I just say a beautiful cartoon ... There's a very good movie ...
