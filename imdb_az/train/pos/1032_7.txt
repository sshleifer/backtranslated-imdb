A message movie, but a very good one. Outstanding cast, from top to bottom. Bette is interested in Davis's art line, in fact it's back! Extremely negative interpretations (a screenwriter / playwriter's name, in this way linking Angles with America with extremely negative comments) is against the film, which is very important in Germany's Second World War. Gosh, this is a bit more sophisticated sense of morality for me. <br /> <br /> Theater and filmmaking and moving styles change over time, and of course after 70 years, this is a special movie. Yes, Casablanca is a better movie (I think), but in the same year, though, and although both have the Nazis, Casablanca is basically a love story. The love story in this movie is the second seat on the spy field - a tension too. Both have very few good habits and good character actors. The kids were a bit tedious and could be edited
