Sitting to watch the "Midnight Cowboy" thinking that it would be another overrated '60s / 70s movie. Some of my favorite films come from the 70s, as well as "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver", "Forest Streets", "Panic in the Needle Park" etc.). Naturally, among the critics, groundbreaking reasons have gained a strong reputation - unfortunately, most of them do not continue today. I feel like this about "Easy Rider". <br /> <br /> So, I did not expect much from Midnight Cowboy, but I got back a bit. It's an inextricable story, well-designed and well-spoken of some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico "Ratzo" Rizzo, gives one of the best - sometimes a little funny (he speaks as a cartoon character when talking about Lenny / "Simpsons" connection), but Hoffman is absolutely convincing. Half of the film's budget goes only to Hollywood, despite being a big star in Hollywood. In front of him, John Voight, who was the "cowboy" who traveled to the North Big Apple in the hope of becoming a prostitute, was second Bill John. <br /> <br /> His sad ways make it difficult, and he's joining the crippled artisan called Ratso, which suggests Joe's "manager" for a certain profit. <br /> Two hours, but it really does not look too long. Some films, especially some of the 1970s, may be inclined to retreat, as the directors were the stars of the 1970s, and sometimes they were infatuated with many materials, too long research characters / scenes / etc. is not important. The only scene I just felt was a bit of a pharmacy and it was an unnecessary drug party - this movie (like "Easy Rider" drug odysseys) looks very outdated and does not need it because its flow really damages it. /> <br /> Besides, 'Midnight Cowboy' is almost an impeccable act. I was pleasantly surprised. The Midnight Cowboy is a really great move, which can handle its shortcomings (flashbacks are a bit tacky and can be used both as well) and some of the scenes are a little worried (eg, gay movie theaters sequence) is a flawless investigation of life in the streets' 60s / early 70s. Here's a film in the body, yes and today's standards are "life-scary and so on." From a liberal point of view, it may seem a bit obsolete and hard ... but I still love it and it's a long, long time, especially with an extremely effective end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70s. (I'm technically discharged in 1969, but still classified as a 1970s movie), the best picture won Oscars and the first and only X colorful film R to make it.) <Br / > 4.5 / 5
