I have to warn you, there are some spoilers there. But to get started, I bought the Spanish Judges in February. They reminded me of the last copy, but I did not order it back as I was seeing. But there are both ways. I thought it was good. Although I wanted to see this major actor, Matthew Lillard (scrutinizing the reviews I'm not surprised at) is that if the movie is low enough to earn enough money to make the cost worth it. <br /> <strong> </ em> </ strong> <strong> If you do not know what the Spanish Judges are or do not see the trailers for that, If this is the first look you read, I can not even say what they are. I do not know, I did not know what it was. He hires a curve that goes to Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as the Piece name (Mark Boone Junior) to scams. According to her, she has a girlfriend who will not name everyone on Mars. So they (mostly Jack) call Mars Girl. Everything starts out fine, but then turns into a great game. a game that involves a lust, lie and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Some of these activities (Mat and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). There are some scenes that they have done better and score better. Some accounts were really good. It was my idea that it was a good song selection that started and ended (before credits). At the end of the fight, the scene might have been a little bit longer and a little bit fierce, but what can you do? Mat more comment. Damn, I know this review <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to this site, he has been active to me since 1983 and hopes others, including Charlie Sheen, also known as "Hot Shots!" movies. But a good review. <br /> <br /> Although I'm one of the rare films I've seen (which I gave up to 10 stars above) and this is really good, <br, I will give you a grade of what I thought. <br /> 8 / 10
