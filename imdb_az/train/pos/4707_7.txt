"Johnny Dangerously" - a kind of hit and miss that comedy, it laughs and has "huh". But I suggest giving it a chance. I think that is more than that. Many people do not give this movie a chance. Works. Just think of the Goodfellas parody. Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And it does well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He continues his journey from his great companion to a fine spouse. Of course, like many movies, someone wants to kill him. 90% of jokes make you laugh. Like, I said, give it a chance. Just pull out the favort gangster movies and mix it with comedy. There's Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> 7/10
