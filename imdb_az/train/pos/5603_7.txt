Here is an example of a film that is not well received when prepared, but whose position is rising in time. The "renter" is an interesting job by one of the first Polish prisoners, Polanski. It is built in Paris and, as in many other shooter films, the city, the street, the city of Seine and the building is a particularly important part. Only Polanski chooses a pole like himself, while his main character is not American (for example, "Frantic"). In fact, this film has many individual comments that describe what happened during the crisis in the director's life and may seem like some (and skillfully) deciding whether to play a leading role. <br /> <br /> There is a round story. Trekkovski's hero rents an apartment in Paris where he lives, seemingly a good group of old or just ridiculous neighbors. The previous renter tried to commit suicide by jumping from the window of the apartment and to Trekkovsky's coming to the hospital before his death, and his young and wonderful friend Stella (first in the role of prominent Isabelle Adjani), Truffaut's 'L'histoire d'Adele H.' (after his book). Soon neighbors do not look like themselves, they are a conspiracy to crack or get into the life and role of the dead girl. He fights, tries to escape, enters the game and slowly turns into a circle. <br /> <br /> This is not the most convincing story we have seen or heard, but the strength of the film is not in the story, but in the constant balance between the psychic state of the hero, the reality and the deception of the hero in slowly degrading the details of psychology. It's a classic "Water Knife" reminiscent of what is happening on the screen, not how it happens, to some extent, over ten years before the Polanski era. There are many details that have never been disclosed, but how should this mystery be, and what is sometimes the way life is. The feeling of clustrofobia slowly contaminates the viewer. Unfortunately, some of the graphic information in the last part of the film has not been performed very well and neutralizes the general atmosphere of conversations (in English) spoken in English. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < is an important step in the career building.
