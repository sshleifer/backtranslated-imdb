Before the war, a Chinese scientist who was harshly criticized by the arrogant nationalist ruling clash around Japan's emperor was accused of being a "communist" and being imprisoned for life. Her dear companion, who is completely supportive of her husband and her thoughts, remains alone to save her family from starvation. This film is a great monument praising the role of mother in human history. Sayuri Yosinaga is no less important and was a monumental scandal that did not take the Asian Oscars for the role of the best woman in 2009. She was sent to a young girl with very limited potential. <br /> <br /> This deeply moving and most 'human' feature is a must for all "true children" on earth.
