This is a short, daring series written by David Lynch (as it was in the beginning), and this is a misuse of a great man and a miscarriage of a spouse who has a stressful life and survival. Both of these elements are often subjected to a short episode, and there is no real space to be seen. <br /> <br /> I've taken the DVD with Eraserhead, and you think it's a strange, lightweight Looney Tunes with more unhappiness, blasphemy, bloody violence and strange moments. previously seen in Eraserhead. If you want a work of art, do not look at this series - it's nothing. In fact, as we have seen, a rough statement of almost such a thing appears as if the rough stance in the face of the animation convention is exhausted. Lynch says, "If it were funny, it's just ridiculous, because we all see it absurd."
