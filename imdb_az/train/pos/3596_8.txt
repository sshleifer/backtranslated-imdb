Finally I sat down and saw this movie all the way and I must say that I was very sorry. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses - it can be that it can not only move but it is more important than the first thing that looks and chooses the roles that suit her. I read a few comments stating that I was not thinking of this terrible feminist thing as I thought before, but I did not agree. Diana is a feminist. He watches his dreams and thinks of everyone who thinks about himself (his brother Tiny and his trainer and manager Hector, who proves that he is more than a father figure than his real parent). These are the words "feminism". It is good to see these films showing the true side of feminism - they are not obstacles that do not lose each other - but they have dreams and they can do everything. Diana is still self-righteous, and she and Adrian have something more realistic, more complicated than something that works more generously. Girlfight is the true taste of truth and puts some beliefs in my perception. Thank you, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - It's a very important movie, just about young women, but everyone who wants to go to their lives.
