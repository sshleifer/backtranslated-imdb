I liked the DVD and the novel at the same time. <br /> <br /> Probably, Frederick Lawrence (who was performed by James Purefoy), who spent several times more time. At the start of the film, Gilbert Markham was incredibly "at it". <br /> <br /> Rupert Graves was like Arthur Huntingdon, who was amazed at the shock and excitement and wonder of me. I love her in the Forsyte Saga and something else I've seen her. But she leaves her alone like Arthur. In my crazy dreams, she could not describe her as demented psycho as Arthur Huntingdon. But it does. And I love it. And I love it.
