Although I could not claim to be a funny book fanatic, I read my story, so I'm one of the audience and I'm not even imagined. It's full of ideas, endless with the end of the steam, and one of my favorite actresses, Lena Olin, was in the cutting room. Also, Hank Azaria's Blue Raja may go a bit. It's easy to forgive all these mistakes when you're still so funny. The role of all actors, especially William H. Macy, plays a straight axis Shoveler and Janeane Garofalo plays Bowler. Unlike some, I found the city's design to make fun even funnier. And I was the music of bad guys. in a way, seemed fit.
