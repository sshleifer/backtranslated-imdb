4 years ago (maybe 5) I started watching Apprentice and really liked it. The first thing that hits you in this regard is that it's still a very entertaining fader format, though it's like many other reality shows. Donald Trump is also home to hosts and as the main referee of the show. With the clever people, the casting shaft is selected as a good-looking opponent. The best part of the show is the city of New York. Mark Burnett could have turned into a lot of shit at the time, but cinematography management is nicer than NYC itself. <br /> <br /> Jazz music combines with a few great camera cases and brings a spectacular view of New York. <br /> <br /> The Lair will easily make the best three reality shows of all time (The Amazing Race is No. 1). But as an incredible race, this show is always good. If you look at it for a while, your originality is rapidly worn (same as TAR) .Star World, the publishers in this country, have done something to show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, followed by two years after the next two seasons, which kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> As a result, you will see this show, especially the first two seasons. However, if you continue the show continuously, then the charm will be eroded and FAST will be.
