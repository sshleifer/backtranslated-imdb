I'm so surprised to say that we are talking about this movie after all these years! Of course, this movie is not bad, or people will not be able to talk about it anymore. Personally I liked this movie very much and still! In my opinion, this film has been touched by many, but not for everyone. <br /> <br /> As for those who think this movie is "overrated" or "over-hyped" ... well, thank you for the film just for the movie! lol * As you can see, the film is not the TRAINING / BROADCASTING writers who make the film "ALL" or "HIT" with the public filmmaker. HUMAN movie is a great success. Everyone in the Titanic was in fear. Nevertheless, such a film has never been. At least it really sank, not really the type of special effects needed to capture the essence of the ship. This film is so clear that even in 1912, James Cameron gave the real time to sail with the REAL movie on the fateful day. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a kid a break! Critics have thought that this movie will be a great time out! When this movie went out and everyone started to hear it as a good / decent movie that they thought was a good (worthy of advertising), then everyone flocked to the tempting theaters to see this movie ... not twice, but twice maybe 3 times and more! So, really, I do not want to say that this movie is "overhyped" ... at least it's not like a MATRIX reconstruction or HULK's "overshadowed" structure. yeah! Critics did not think that Titanic would earn enough money to pay for the Cameron's huge budget, which required the mammoth of the movie. However, the movies drew 200 million budgets and more! <br /> <br /> I personally love this movie. But this movie can not be for everyone. Do not tell the movie because it's romantic! It's the sexiest thing I've ever heard! Not just a movie because it's just a romance! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's see ... The REAL star of the movie is not Leo or Kate ... it was GIGANTIC Ship! I think all actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, are doing a wonderful job. This is not the best job (both have seen more BETTER work) but it's not the worst I've ever seen on the screen. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
