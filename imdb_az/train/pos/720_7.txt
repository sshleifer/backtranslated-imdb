Imagine what a school is going to be like in a world like this: children are a group that really tastes music and unite against bad administrators and teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" goes to the world. It looks like the Ramones record. All the heroes are foolish, innocent and charming as Ramone's songs, and the music itself is fantastic. Licensed comedies, if you compare a movie like the classic American Pie in the late 1970s, no unpleasant sex jokes are produced in any way. Perhaps there is a change in the works of works, probably the original charm will disappear along the way, and Bill Hicks will replace the vulgar, semi-funny joke jokes he uses to call them. However, the main problem can be Ramone can not be replaced. It was a perfect band for the film, and nobody could approach it. Thus, the best thing is to abandon dependence on yourself and leave it as tempting. Gabba-gabba hey!
