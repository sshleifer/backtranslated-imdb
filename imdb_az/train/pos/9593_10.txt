At first I was a mosquito, straight white man. But even with this handicap, I like this movie. It's about real people. Real time and place. And of course, in the 80's in New York City. I had many gay friends who grew up in New York in the eighties and were always amazed at everything about them and were brave enough to live their lives as they wanted to live. Whatever the outcome. It's brave. You must love it. This is a great movie, and take what you want to be a luxurious African American or Spanish Gay man in New York City in the '80s. This is a real life. The lower line is a real life.
