A beautiful movie, I saw a few fools, then grabbed me and came in again, in the case of Thief, the impression is actually better than time.

Favorite bits: Ahmed's imagination in a sunny garden when he puts himself and romantic songs of Adelaide Hall; Stunning colors in Legend Land of tent? In fact, stunning colors; But it is still a conscious final that Sabu and Rosa won. Conrad Veidt played this badly in two of Casablanca's most incredible movie romance and then died. <br /> <br /> <div> class = "justify" <br /> <br /> <strong> There are many gruesome pictures, but I'm convinced that this is a glorious experience with a 100% positive message that little kids are sorry for watching porn instead of your chosen days. Can not offer so much to one of my Top 10 movies? Can be displayed up to the end of time.
