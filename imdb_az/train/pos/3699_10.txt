"Who loves the sun?" He works with some prickly theme with enough reason and grace to keep his story, not just by drawing, but often cheerful. It has been a while since I found this comprehensive touch film, a thoroughly enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful with beautiful views and quiet scenes. The manifestations of peace are striking by the tension between the many people, the most flawed and still loved characters. Thanks to the excellent players, the beauty and dynamism of five major players are very high. <br /> <br /> "Who loves the sun?" This is what we look at, and we are looking at the painful, but equally rewarding, forgiving process that we can give each other.
