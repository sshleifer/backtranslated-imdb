Cure uses a voice to create an intense mood. For all the lines of the film, VO believes that it is incredibly staggering from the visual story. The use of many movie stocks adds a lot of tissues to the story. The selection of B & W and color combinations worked well to improve leaps over time. Though you wait for the end result, you will skip. Especially I liked the excitement of the movie excitement. Relatives of the love area are also beautiful and reflect a delightful look. This piece is pretty short, but it provides much. Intensive editing can help you really see what a short film can do. Wait more than once!
