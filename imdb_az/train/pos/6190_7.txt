Fay Grim is a continuation of a story that began ten years ago with Hartley's Henry Fool. I have not seen the previous movie and do not know if it's a good thing. I can now evaluate the current film for its essence. <br /> <br /> Do you like or do not like Hal Hartley's style of filmmaking for many people? Its combination of action, drama, absurdity, and dry, humorous humor really resonates with me and Fay Grim is no exception. The Melbourne International Film Festival has a splendid, parody of parody written by the audience with a loud smile, writing for itself and many others. For the first half of the film it was ruthless and fatal. <br/> <br /> <br /> In the second half of the film, the film's morphs begin as subtle. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the film, the film's morphs begin finely. turned into an international spy / conspiracy thriller. It is not clear whether this Hartle should know the intentions or ideas, but a bit of editing and rewriting the movie to make a fifteen minute cut would protect the film's original strength. The performances were very good, especially when Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum appeared on the screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wsensohn played a good role. The film's visually impeccable (New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (by Hartley) were good without interference. The film was written very well and I liked it very much. If you love Hartley's previous work, you will probably love it.
