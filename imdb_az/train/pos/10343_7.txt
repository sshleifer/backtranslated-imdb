"Amazing Mr. Williams" stars Melvyn Douglas, five films shot in 1939, and one was Ninochko with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), ALSO drew five films in that year, and met them! Douglas Lt Williams and her and her collaborators are boldly presented dead and must understand what they really are. Viewers will recognize his employees - actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) are always in power ... senators, bank managers, and police. This murder has a comedy ability - the police always stick together, even Williams and her girlfriends are fighting. Some entertainments - Williams even takes his lover on a date with his girlfriend. There are so many fun things to do, so go slowly and then wait for fun things. I do not want to give any spoiler, so you need to catch Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall founded a comedy and was told that he was busy with Lucy at a time.
