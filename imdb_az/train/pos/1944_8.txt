This is a great movie about adult swimming classes, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. <br /> <br /> Eating coach is almost an Olympic player, reduced to teaching major classes for adults, and often a horndogging target for girls. <br /> <br /> The pupils' symbols are the main Americans in the US; teachers, police, college students and retired people did not learn to swim for any reason. The film covers relationships, including crossing the classroom, including friends, relatives, and romantic conquests. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the one to watch when you're in mood for a romantic drama with the advantage of the truth.
