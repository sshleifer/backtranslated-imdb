Victor McLaglen is the best actor Oscar for this movie with three track pieces among Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone's Bounty-led Allies in the same film. But Informer is still a good movie because John Ford was not the first best director to win the Oscars. <br /> <br /> The film, produced by Liam O'Flaherty, said that a man named Gypo Nolan, a member of the Irish Republic, was poorly disadvantaged. . She earned money for some imbecilic stunt she did not want to be pulled back and pulled back. He has recently become modest and returning to return to America. There is a twenty-pound prize for information that has led to the arrest of a former spouse named Frankie McPhillip, played by Wallace Ford. At the moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan concepts and gives information about McPillip. <br /> <br /> IRA is extremely uncomfortable to find out who is closing McPillip and believe they are McLaglen. Indeed, it is not a mind that covers its own paths. Donald Meek makes a poor effort to expose a man named Peter Mulligan. <br /> <br /> In 1922, in Dublin, from about six days in the evening, to the next day. It protects against the need and shadows, perhaps it is the first nirr triller. <br /> <br /> If he was informed after the Second World War, a great noir like Odd Man Out or Third Man was classically sorted. <br /> <br /> John Ford recognized this world very well. He took some time during the rebellion and was in Ireland and was a brother in Iraq. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays Dan Gallagher in the IRA command. In the book, Gallagher is a harder and more common man, because Foster is here. To my guess, John Ford wanted him to be a sympathetic character to show off the cinema. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Foster will disclose information because Black and Tans will capture him and get out a bit more and threaten the entire organization. <br /> <br /> The IRA's trial scene is highlighted by the movie. When Foster asked Donald Meek whether he knew his or her jurisdiction, Meek did not have a single word. The king's justice and writing do not work here. <br /> <br /> Of course, as the Informer newspaper writes, John Ford touches, but less. than you expect. <br /> <br /> Although McLaglen is spending his money drunkenly, IRAs are always watching her and counting every headlights in the shadows. <br /> <br /> Informer explained Ireland in a very terrible time.
