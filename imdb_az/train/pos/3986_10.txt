I am a college student who is studying at a level and I need help and comment from anyone who has ideas about the subject of the mother movie. If you do not want to go through something like that, or if you help me explore more about this movie, then any comment should be highly appreciated. Comments will only be used for exam purposes and will be included in the written test. So if you have any ideas, im sure I can use them and can help me get an A! I'm learning about "About a Child" and "Tadpole," so if you see these movies, you can write a comment on that page. Thank you very much.
