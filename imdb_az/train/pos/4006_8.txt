[WARNING: WILL USE ADMINISTRATIONS] <br /> <br /> I have this mature friend who has an understanding of sex with my parents. It came to mind when the audience was reflected in the "Mother" reaction. <br /> <br /> Mine (Anne Reid) was sleeping when she saw sexually explicit images of a young European lover Darren (Daniel Craig) or May. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundrette", "My Beautiful Laundrette", "My Beautiful Laundrette", "My Beautiful Laundrette", "The Last The Fanatic") is one of the most miserable stories ever on the Atlantic It's not easy to accept his story, this deliberate family drama, raw material, complex, and often worry us because it's not a movie that you can claim to enjoy watching. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (doing everything on the Notting Hill) creates a casual, buzzing and superior portrait of an elderly woman, in which she can and will enjoy the pleasures of all life. <br /> <br /> Therefore, <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves the Oscars nomination for May, a fine epiphanoic moment, when she does not ask for difficulty. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves the Oscar nomination for May, t, strong and sad, often at the same time when Can Reid, Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) observe a passionate valve appearing in the bar. Otherwise, Paula calls for the opening of the door after a disastrous date. Reid's eye and face reveal all the care and hope of the mines. In the most terrifying moment of the film, he wanted to kneel before Darren, who wanted to do something, only wanted him to be good. <br /> <br /> Michel's use of natural sound, especially when May and Toots were on Bobby's place for the first time. <br /> <br /> This film sometimes reminded Mike Leigh's honesty and rawness, The, The, and Theots. the decision to give the scene a sense of sensitivity. The lovers are left out of focus, and the white curtain breeze flashes in the foreground. <br /> <br /> The problem of Michel's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely suppress the role of Darren, are scattered in these roles with courage. hiding their characters from the audience is unfair. <br /> <br /> There is not a pretty bad character in this movie. We are happy since May, but it also causes her daughter's suffering. But I mean Kureishi people with their favorite story. In his opinion, it was to shake a family that had already reached the moment when emotional disasters took place. It is sincere and eventually unforgettable.
