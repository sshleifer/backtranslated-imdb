This movie is fantastic. Finally, you can love all the good characters well and the bad. Pierce Brosnan, hysterically emerged in this changing role. I think it's the best thing she's done. He fulfilled other roles that demonstrated the shadow of being worthy of such a full-fledged job, but this role finally gave him the room to work with him. She died almost in the hotel lobby in her underwear and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis have a couple to succeed, but also to be aspired to the actors. Kinnear is ultimately likable, most likely, that his turn is really happy. Try to play well with good players, and they give us something back.
