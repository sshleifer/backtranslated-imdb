This movie is very entertaining. Actors really should go in the distance despite the film. Without leaving the field, I would describe her as a new Princess bride who loved her as a cult, which should put her on time test. In this film, you need to see a different side for Robert DeNiro! <br /> <br /> People of all ages will be pleased. <br /> <br /> All the elements are put on romanticism by romance and comedy. (My family did it!) Good special effects can be scary for the little ones. Good history film. <br /> <br /> It's great for some refugees. <br /> <br /> Deserves one (Good at Cassette)
