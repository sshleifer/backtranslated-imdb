How does Marquis de Sade relate to Egyptian archeology and mermaid worshipers? Tobe Hooper is trying to answer these questions with a strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Gin is a young canvas who visits his nerdy archeological father in the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Genie is captured by a mysterious prostitute (and neglected lesbian) who serves her father. Dad is sent back to where he opened a tomb that looks like a mermaid. Genie Marquis de Sade meets a descendant and falls for a ovky Egypt (providing hot scenes of the movie). Finally, Gin is a sacrifice and goes to a stretching and bloody peak. In the Marquis de Sade prison surrounded by this story, he talks to a portrait of a genius. <br /> Robert Englund is both Marquis and his descendants. Her acting abilities have always been with her make-up demands, so she is allowed to shine. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that, most of the rest, including the "Young Cinema," are quite medium to high. But the script is problematic. Soon you'll find out that Marquis scenes are not unnecessary, and maybe the filmmakers are cool. Finally, the cult of the mermaid that rescues Genie has no meaning. The mermaid will not be explained to anyone and its connection to Christianity (sensitive throughout the film) is nothing. As an archaeologist is a Bible writer, the film is not local anti-Christian, but likes to be liked by a local prostitute. There are many aspects of violence and violence, but Hooper did not know what the scenarioists wanted. <br /> <br /> Why would I recommend this movie? It's strange. She has a sex scene for a long time. For ladies, the brave Egyptian horse is entirely false. Englund is beautiful. Do you like snakes? This movie is packed with them. It's like Roger Corman with a bigger budget. Hooper is quite sad when he gets to know "Timsox" somehow. <br /> <br /> It was assessed for physical violence, some sexual violence, darkness, blasphemy, feminine nakedness, male nakedness, and sexual intercourse (R). content, sexual orientation, and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
