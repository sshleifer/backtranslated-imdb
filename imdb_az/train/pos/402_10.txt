Earlier Zu: I saw the Warriors from Magic Mountain. In the film, this setting occurs in the Chinese mountains, the legend of Zu looks like another dimension! Thanks to Tsui Hark for extensive use of CGI effects. <br /> <br /> He shows the vision of the mountains floating over the clouds, the space where the creatures fly freely, and the forces extending from the sloping sharp knives, split swords and ultra-cool Moon Orb. <br /> <br /> These are many characters, focus mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The film is romantic, though it seems darker than the film's predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and his presence on the screen is capable of watching this movie. At first, I think it looks like Countess (Zu Warriors) and she's playing with Enigma, despite her past life. Oh, by the way, did I tell Cecilia that she was very attractive? <br /> <br /> In fact, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements, and since 1983 his special effects were limited. Tsui Hark leads a new level and puts a new standard in cinema.
