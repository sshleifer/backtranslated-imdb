I thought this action was very good. There was a great little thing, but I was very surprised at all. At the end of the scene in the courtroom was a little real, but real enough to be entertaining. In the film, I stated that I was having difficulties with military education and sacrifices. Being a military pilot could have been a part of many of these parts.
