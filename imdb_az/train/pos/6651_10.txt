Gandhi Great: <br /> <br /> The greatness of the world is connected with the great people like Alexanader, adults Ashoka, whose magnitude is more honor than people. Gandhi is really big, not big, so much more people are called because I believe that we are the ones to reveal our humanity. Because of the greatness of humanity. Gandhi was a man like humanity and a man prepared for humanity ready to sacrifice himself, not to fight for humanity, but to his enemies. <br /> <br /> My father is not a film about Gandhi, but his son Harild Gandhi. The director of a son whose father is one of the greatest people to go to this world describes this story. The film succeeds in explaining the story of an inaccurate son of a father who heads a great nation. Gandhi, who criticized Gandhi's father as a son of her son, said he was sacrificing his son's father as a father of a nation. <br /> <br /> The essence of this film is not only in India but also in the Gandian lands, but with the hearts of all peoples of the world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi is a true man. Jaihind.
