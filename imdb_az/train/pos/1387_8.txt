A little slow (somehow like the Sofia Coppola movie), but still a very attractive movie about the discovery of sex by three teenage girls. The magic of the film is capable of bringing back many memories of their age. Confusion and insults are described in a very simple way, but true for life. Music is perfect and the player is incredible. The camera works fine. When I discover our sexual desires and desires, I strongly recommend those who are not afraid to look at this particular period of life. I also say that this is a great movie for young people who have passed through this period. Many films about adolescence have been filmed, but in fact, the true essence of romance is to discover the adult world and its complexity.
