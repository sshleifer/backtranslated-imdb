There's a man in New York City who is superior to all other people, perhaps immortal Dr. Anton Mordrid. Mordrid is a lying defender against humanity, using his magical powers to guarantee his brother and his rival, Kabal, to protect human heritage. Yes, do not you know? A prophecy is realized and Kabbal is free and collects elements (including platinum and uranium) for his alchemy tests. Can Mordried be able to defeat his bad brother by the help of a police woman named Sam? "Dr. Mordrid," says Charles Bend, in the collection of the Arsiv collection of the full collection. I did not hear it, it is a bit strange that Jeffrey Combs (Mordrid) is a great admirer, and the film is not so old. But now it's me, and I can repeat it. The film, of course, is fun in the classic full moon style. Richard Band's music (which does not differ from all other scores) and Brian Thompson plays the evil Kabal. We even animated the dinosaur bones! What else do you want? Of course, the cheese factors are high. Most of the film, Dr was part of a strange comic book. And the blue pantsuit was foolish. Rear spaces are everywhere (I can list at least five, but why worry). And why does the ancient symbol of Mordidius and Kabale appear suspicious of a hammer and a sickle? Combs has never been a strong actor, so it is compatible with cheese. These are not complaints. Full Moon fans have come to expect these things and burn them like a cracked grape nuts. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're not a full-fledged fan, or if you're fond of Jeffrey Combs ... you can look elsewhere. But in the early 1990s, if you love filmmaking and haircut, you will eat so much. Stallone and Schwarzenegger supporters may seem blameworthy, never seeing Brian Thompson as an accusation, leaving the English language third class. I did. I would like to say that there was "Mordrid II", but it's past (Almost Necessity Is It Gingerdead Man 3)?
