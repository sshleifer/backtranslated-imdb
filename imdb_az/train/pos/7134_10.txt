John Thaw is an excellent player. <br /> <br /> I also note that I'm impressed by the strange old curmudgeon who did not want to evacuate from the streets of London (World War II). The film is also good. A very moving story that ends up in the doyen. Some heroes have developed a bit less (especially school teachers), but none of them are important to this area. Basically, the story is about the old man and boy, the film is almost in need.
