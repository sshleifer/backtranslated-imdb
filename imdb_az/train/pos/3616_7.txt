Michelle Rodriguez, known as Diana, was a horrific hit. He is perfect. His failure to act is really in his favor. We have never seen him, so he really feels like his story. It also brings the original toughness. However, we will never doubt it. You will not love his victory because he does not oppose any warrior, because he does not think he can defeat him. It did not succeed as a boxing film. <br /> <br /> Then it is not a boxing film again. Are you a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer without a boxer? You are not. But Karyn Kusama is still there. Like many indie films, "Girlfight" is opposed to classifications or genres and stands for itself as a folklore, which can take place in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is doing bad at school. He tears off unpleasant people (for example, all other girls in their school). It is not appropriate. His father is forced to learn from his child's brother Tiny's ability to defend himself in a difficult situation. He gives Tiny money to his boxing sessions and tells Diana that there is no need for self defense or anything to value her life. He wants to go to the Little Craft School (cliche, yuck), so he really does cancel boxing expenses for Diana, who needs a box. When Diana falls to another boxer Adrian (producer Santiago Douglas), things get worse. <br /> <br /> <strong> There is something about the events in the Caucasus. All this is just a little convincing. Children living in harsh urban areas are returning to sports. Many professional boxers have risen from these conditions. Gentle and physical endurance should require this training to lend a game of boxing that you are furious with yourself. So this time a girl. Great deal. <br /> <br /> Or there is another situation: finally a boxing movie about a girl. Women boxing is a long time ago. The cruelty we see in boxing films here discusses the lives and emotions of people. The whole battlefield is used as a platform to capture a larger image. Respect. Elimination of damage. Do not disclose yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dialogue never stops the quality of the soap opera, but the story itself has actually changed my mind about some things. Yes, the world seems to be a better place now. It's a movie. <br /> Level: B-
