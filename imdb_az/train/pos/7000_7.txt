Promotes suicide in the film; <br /> <br /> It is full of symbolism everywhere, with a clever mind-boggling look and a driving explanation of driving a drive. very meaningful and deeply thought-out nature. The most prominent theme that hit me was to give physically the greatest gift, not just heart and heart to a girl who loves metaphorical love.
