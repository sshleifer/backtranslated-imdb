I saw Marion Davies in several films and did not actually understand his appeal. He could not dance for peanut but he tried to read and when it came to his activity, he appeared in a trance. But I did not see his silent comedies and this movie was very nice. Instead of deceiving his appearance here, I was shown a satirical Gloria Swanson, which started in slapstick comedies, entered a very emotional woman's image and married a Count. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hollywood, daughter of Peggy (Marion Davies) is determined to prove to be the biggest star. Their hopes are diminished and when they meet with Billy Boone (William Haines) in slapstick studios, they promise Peggy to find a job. Peggy thinks he's going to be a dramatic actress, but he thinks the studio is fantastic funny. She was pleased to shoot the film and she was a great success in the preview. Charlie Chaplin asks his own signature, but recognizes him and looks at him badly. "Who was the little man short" - when he found faints! Peggy and Billy get a call from the High Art Studio, but Peggy just wants and suddenly on their way. <br /> <br /> She finally gets the chance to become a dramatic actress - but she can not cry! "says Marion Davies. !! The director tries to do everything to make him cry, and when he succeeds, he can not stand! His new leader, Andre (Paul Ralli), gives him confidence to forget about the past and make the comedy history eloquent - even a new name - Patricia Pepoire! He also forgot Billy and his dad - he developed the STAR identity! When Slapstick was chosen to be in the same position as Patricia's, Billy was excited to see him, but was not ready for his snobby attitude. When she said that she was a cheap clown, she once knew that she was not a girl. <br /> <br /> After a meal in a studio (a magnificent splash throw in one of the greatest stars of the day), Patricia calls Boss. Apparently, his films are a flop and no theater does not want to order them - the public is tired of his behavior and wants the old Peggyi back. When he and Andre decided to marry, Billy Andre was imagining to use a cafe to serve the spaghetti in the city center and to be countess, though not much. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < On his wedding day, Billy finds out that Billy is the only one to visit and fight with a funny punch. John Gilbert MGM Lew Cody is talking to Elinor Glynn, not just "This", but a few romantic romances that have been translated into MGM movies. William Haines, one of the movies in the cafeteria area, was another actor who wanted to see the movie. Harry Gribbon was as stupid as the comedy director - there were very funny scenes in this movie, and Marion was all with them - I'll give 10 to 10 of this movie. High, Recommended.
