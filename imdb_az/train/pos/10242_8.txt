For the first time, I saw this when my brother received a gift and I was probably 12 ... The films that appeared to me were a lack of films. The main characters are confused, because when it comes time to explain themselves, I say one of the clever minds that does not mean something that screams on the screen, but the whole agreement. In this regard, I really like the movie that I think the main characters do not do things to one another ... they are not fragmented and do not look just like each other. The film goes on. <br /> <br /> These two children are united and, first of all, appear on the opposite sides of the road, but do not differ. Loui was a middle-aged child who really needed to understand how fortunate he was to have a family of Valentines, and Cecelia was a high-class child who needed to prove to his family that he had been abducted and abandoned himself. Anyway, I've put this movie in Hulu and have to watch again ... Probably, there are gaps in analyzing the scenario, or Woog and Dweeb should not eat dogs because they are actually herbaceous plants. br> <br /> Now, what is the film's unexpected fear? Children under 5 years are probably afraid of scenes with Dr. Screweyes. And half of the film (although obviously clear on the first scene that will give a look) is very additive ... maybe it should be a look that has shown its show before, to show it is not scary without a dinosaur. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> Taking into account the target audience associated with me, the first half of the movie There is no real threat for the country. I am sure that such animation and dialogue problems will never be weakened ... I think that I will give a link to these factors and I am very pleased with the story. This is a great hug for your child and you remain in your mind ... you think how you behave and think, and I think every 10 years should be reviewed again.
