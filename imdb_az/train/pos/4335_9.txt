Oscar-caliber performance by Peter Falk in Oscar-caliber articles. I liked the rarity, balanced intelligence of a long-term marriage - how is it that the film's boy and girl usually end up being together? This is a movie for adults, with the eyes of all parties - husband, wife and son - a complex look, taking into account how each one is in the past, and grows in the story. Moreover, I gave 10 laughs to the abdomen, and the rest of the audience is usually unamused when laughing. This was one of the really funny movies I've ever seen. Great, original jokes.
