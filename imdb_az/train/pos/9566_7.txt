Pou-Soi Cheang, director of Home Sweet Home Ultra-ignorant criminal drama. Although tonight reminds Billy Tangin of "Run and Kill", it's not polished like this. Nonetheless, this is a charming, defective one about the Pang (Edison Chen), who came to Hong Kong to kill a lawyer of a Cambodian loner. When he escaped from the scene, he was killing his partner, Sam Vay, who was involved in dealing with an immortal father to add insult to the injury, as an argument for Sam Pang, obsessive manhunt, and as a result many dead bodies and aggressive violence. Recently, there must be something in the air, as I have not seen many people beat the pulp as it has been recently. It's trivial and bad, so I'm not partial and I welcome it's low noise. Vision and sound design are very unique. Dramatically, every spiral is downward until each character finds him or her in the world of screaming pain. A Subpot covering Pang's commitment to a sexually explicit girl raises the depth of story and exposes the fourth surprise, and this is a wonderful operation of a strange operation.
