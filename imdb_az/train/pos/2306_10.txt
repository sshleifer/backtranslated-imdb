The man on the moon did not hear until they saw it yesterday evening in the HDTV channel. Look, my tastes are eclectic, like any other. Dr. Mavi Velvet Strangelove-a Ghost and Mrs Muir, Oz and The Loved One, Eraserhead, repo guy and The Spy for me. <br /> <br /> The man in the moon is a perfectly prepared, subtle hearted, joyful and tragic movie, beautifully drawn, where actresses do not really function at the moment. This sweet fairy tale will soon be available in our dedicated library. <br /> <br /> This beautiful life story in Lisbon, just like the peasant Louisiana, brings you to the idolatrous space. <br /> <br /> In the final moments of the film, especially when a young girl is older, it is hard for her to remain stoic and relieve her sister from the individual pain and forgive them all. <br /> <br /> Instead of being overwhelmed by the grace of my genius, or endorsing those who have this heartfelt movie, this proposal will end. <br /> <br /> If you do not buy any other movies, buy the man on the moon. This moving story will be relaxed once and for all. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 5, 2009
