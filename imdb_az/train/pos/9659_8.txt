Presque Rien is a beautiful portrait of a young French homosexual experience. A beautiful natural film, moving from both stereotypes and propaganda, made a perfect move, was shot in a portrait of a maritime settlement, which was no movement, but rather melodramatic, often a painful reality. If anything, this is almost realistic. But the lack of ordinary dramatic tension can be such a delicate world. 'Presque Rien' can not be the most exciting movie ever made; but simple humanistness is a good service compared to pre-made holidays or rooted views, often with natural treatments on this subject. We need an hour.
