I'm 14 years old and I love this animated film. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise are a great pair. This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are "You Can not Keep A Good Dog" and a song about sharing, "What is yours?" I think. It was the latest film with Judith Barsy, who sang Anne-Marie's voices. My favorite character is Charlie, but it's nice to hear a strange voice. Some scenes are scary, though I have difficulty watching Charlie's dream and Carface misses me. Other symbols like King Gator were really funny. The end was very nice and actually saddened, she cried a bit. I give this movie 7/10.
