Winchester'73 is a great story and I like it. It is not your daily western - your hands use a rifle that passes through different symbols - it's like a mechanism to tell the story of people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian master, Jimmy Stewart plays a great lead man with his heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a single game to cope with the reality of her husband and the eastern western. It is important to note that politically correct types - they kill many Hindus in this film without killing them. According to today's standards, it is still very severe. But this is a great story and worth a look. Enjoy!
