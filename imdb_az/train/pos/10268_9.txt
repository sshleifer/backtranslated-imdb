This typical Mamet movie gives you a quiet, equally thought-provoking idea of ​​the good man (Joe Mantegna). When a prominent psychologist, Lindsay Crouse, has been examined as a psychological research, it slowly leads to the world with bad results. Casting is part of a series of Mamet films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy) and they do their best. I liked Lindsay Crouse in this film and often wondered why he was not becoming a more marked player than he has been. Perhaps I'm not looking at the right places! <br /> <br /> The film continues at a slow pace, continues with a straight-line dialogue, but still maintains a tension level that is unintentional causing the bang-up to end. Would you please wait for your life to end, but I found it encouraging and satisfying. I love this movie!
