I took the time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a kid, I truly think of Michael Myers, the Return of the sequels, which I really think is the best Halloween continuation. But I thought the first was slow, and I spent a lot of time to come to the point. I have recently watched a few times and now I know I'm wrong. Today, I really understand the film, its meaning, and the whole feeling of this fear. It's not blood and stomach. Not naked naked and naked jokes. Laurie Strode is about the worst night in her short life. Demented brother coming home to finish the job he started 15 years ago about the night. This movie is intended to be frightening and I understand it very well. This is one of the first slasher films ever to be loved in a horror subtitle. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors like Jamie Lee Curtis in the first role. Can I say more? Anyone who has never seen, a fan of fears or no one, should do the cinematic homework now. Very striking!
