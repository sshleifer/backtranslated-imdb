Romy Schneider is one of his first 18-year-old daughter, England's young queen, to learn how to handle the trickery of politicians and eventually marries romans and Saxon Prince Albert. Kitschy and campy (although strikingly loyal to the truth), this romantic piece is irresistible. Seeing this film about the English roots they speak in German adds to his strange charm. Why an Austrian film on the front has a wonder about the English queen; but in 1954, Austria remembers the fact that under the occupation of allied forces, including the British. Perhaps this was one reason for the existence of this film.
