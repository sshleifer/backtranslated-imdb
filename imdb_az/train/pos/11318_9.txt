This charming, powerful, powerful Italian effect James M. Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice is directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that it transmits all sorts of material to be tougher and more original (the exciting Camus is also the main inspiration of his work novel, The Stranger, the Qaining novel). The film has a stronger and intensified than the novel, because Visconti can create kinematic equivalent of the canvas structure, but sex offers a more complex research. Cain's many American novels longed for the whistle-blowing structure (the main character, Cora, was afraid of being identified as a Mexican immigrant and a treacherous Greek migrant), this visconti has nothing to do with the Italian village context. This is a passionate, allowing the center stage and dance between the convict's love affair. This movie is a complex, exciting, rewarding experience.
