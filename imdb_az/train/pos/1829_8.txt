What a fun movie about St Ives. Reminiscent of the film of the 40s. The classic story is related to a plot of heroes and dramatic or obviously uncomplicated. In fact, it's not about anything. Robert Lewis Stevenson's story - adapted to the screen here - reads as Jane Austen for men. We get a romantic miracle in our hearts, but we have so much fun: fighting scenes (species), escaping from jail, wrong identities, swords and the most funny line I've heard for years: "Only Scottish guests would announce their masked balls." <br /> <br / > St Ives has difficulty finding a family going to war and going back to life, and has some heart failure. Jean-Marc Barr has been perfectly in the lead role, as Anna Friel moves closer to the film, like Flora and Miranda Richardson, a fresh delight, as her wise and secular it's been there - seen all the Aunt Susan. <br /> <br /> This is not the biggest movie ever seen by anyone, but its charm does not cause any doubts and the whole film is fragile with an energy created by life.
