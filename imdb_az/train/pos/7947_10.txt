I watched this movie many times with my child, so far, I can still look at the entire dialogue. Now, when I look at it, it just makes me happy and laughs still strangely. I think they were able to play the main role of the feature film, especially to bring cat animals to the extent they can play. However, while watching it, unfortunately, I once thought that it was not a masterpiece. But when I was watching on my first TV channel on VHS, I used to recall how I felt that the picture would be from a yellow cloud. And considering that it's a children's movie, I'm still going to give it 10/10.
