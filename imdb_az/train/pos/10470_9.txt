I'll give you a story of the summer of 1994. A friend and I attended a Canadian concert in Barrie and this was one of the best Canadian groups in the age. There were about 4am, we were expecting most of the morning, and when we opened the doors in the 9th, we were the first in the gates. Then we waited in the warm sun and waited, slowly missed, but we were not interested in the fact that others were among our favorites. At one point, in the afternoon, I sat down and looked at the barrier. I was awoken by shock and horror by a sad girl wearing a rheostatics t-shirt. So far I hated Rheostatica. There is nothing reasonable or tasteful, nor is there anything except fandom. My dissatisfaction, is not it? So I disassociated myself from the group's dissatisfaction with Whale Music. <br /> <br /> Desmond Howl was all there. It is difficult to say what he has lost because he lives in a fantastic palace dating back to the ocean and the mountains (a breathtakingly BC bassoon). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ STRONG> </ how many problems are caused. In general, lack of money and lack of support (any feature is Canadian) leads to lower production values ​​compared to American or English films, and most people do not want to watch something, but sounds like an American movie. Later on, Canadian scenarists are often surprised to see how they can not explain such a story and speak well. Thirdly, they seem to think of an unmatched nudity (often frontal) fiction. Everyone who has been watching quite a few Canadian films, especially I'm talking about everything I talked about at CBC. <br /> <br /> Some films in the 90s and 90s (for example, in the United States) have violated this pattern of several films (eg, Bruce McDonald's work and the brilliant CRAZY) While looking at stories, he managed to save them from Canada. Whale is a movie on the music surface. It is deeper than Canadian islands, a deeply moving story of a person who is in love with gratitude and sadness and has lost his hold on music. And it repeats these repetitions. :)
