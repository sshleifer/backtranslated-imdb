** Caution! <br /> <br /> This short "Morris" consists of two parts that describe the matrix as "The Matrix". As we know the story, the plot is not a surprise; and is not as entertaining as short informative. However, it is presented as a file in historical archives. The images are better than the average, and generally the cold color supports a shorter purpose. <br /> <br /> A few problems. The tale of a fairy tale is somewhat undisputed and occasionally merged with a political corrective dose (UN scenes), a brief narrative. <br /> <br /> Animatrix's concept is brilliant and, despite some issues, this short-term goal still exists. The original film would not be appropriate in style, content and flow. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to find history. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: good information. It was a little better, but it is still 10 to 10 strong.
