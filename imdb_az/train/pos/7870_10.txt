The film is a real show, which has become a negative and unhappy society. There are many characters and each character represents a different category. No character is 100% good and morally unlike all the typical Indian movies, and no character is 100% bad, all of these are just different. The film is a perfect mix of emotion, drama and entertainment. First, I liked a movie that raised some social questions. I advise everyone to see the film. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist covering hip-hopping parties called Bollywood on page 3, but this is the story of a newspaper reporter. But it's not all, but it shows how insulting her voice is when she does not stay alive and help save some innocent children. Even dismissed. Then the criminal reporter could not find a job and was forced to repeat. Not only him but many characters touch the movie and make a different feeling while watching the movie. I congratulate the director for making such a big movie. Please do not miss it.
