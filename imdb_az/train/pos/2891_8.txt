We watched the ABC "Disney's Fine World" last night, and everything should be more intense in the Mouse than normal. <br /> <br /> This movie is just about 74 minutes away and has been forced to spill up to 2 hours of television broadcast, and it's six to seven minutes. <br /> <br /> <strong> There was another "television show" hosted by oh-so-annoying Kelly Rippa, who announced the magic miracles of Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True. <br /> <br /> After repeated and defeat, Disney took us a real film to tell us a regular audience, we needed to get a copy of it. <br /> <br /> In any case, this commercial and cash register has become a difficult task. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a genuine movie because after the end of the ads, the story has been forgotten. Of course, the original Cinderella still holds magic, the story is still good, though we've all seen it all the time. It has to cheapen it with all marketing for something that seems to be a complete pursuit.
