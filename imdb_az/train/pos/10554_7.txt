NOTHING (3+ outta 5 stars) is a strange premise that is the director of "Cube". Meanwhile, there are two main characters that move themselves and their homes into a mysterious white space. Nothing is said except for a small two-story house. Of course you are curious, but I did not think that the sound of the comedy, which has been created for this movie, was extremely bad. Certainly, there must be some humor ... and, ultimately, I have no problem with the humor that comes from the condition of our two heroes (their "conclusion" is definitely something) ... but I really think the film would have been better if it initially had more roots in the truth . After watching the movie, I was watching the "Making" function on the DVD and eventually dropping a short trailer, completely missing from the "sillier" comedic aspects ... it looks like a completely different (and better) movie. The last half-hour of the movie has really started to come together ... The last movie is like "Primer". Actors are good when they do not miss the comedy punch. They are quite convincing in most "normal" moments. Probably, I am ready to write this movie as an unsuccessful attempt at midway point ... but it won me until the end. (And keep watching past the credit for the final scene ... just do not want to tell me.)
