this film is so complicated that any image can be given and still travels with it. You have a dangerous, uncomfortable and exciting mother trapped between two (three, three) women (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud). we are listening to his social, philosophical and moral features in monologues, and we see his magic around the three women he loves. it may be crucial to a bird movie that is full of harsh, cold, unkind commentaries. yet the director Jean Eustache keeps fresh, ironic and witty. As long as he remembers a cheerful line from a movie, Jean-Pierre Léud, who speaks politically for 2 hours, laughs suddenly in the phone. such situations are completely cinematic and can not be completely restored in one statement. nor Francoise Lebrou's tragic and painful monologue can be restored to the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and every minute value.
