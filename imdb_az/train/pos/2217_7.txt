I'm afraid to watch films based on novels or mini-series because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (the writer was a writer and a writer?) <br /> <br /> It's a nice round. <br /> <br /> I saw so many actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Richard and Bianca Lawson). What I saw on the screen was a bit different to see the houses and cottages I imagined in my mind. But it was not enough for me to dislike the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend this for everyone who reads a novel: if not, you will not dream. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars!
