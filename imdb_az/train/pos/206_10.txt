I am 14 years old, probably I have never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone else. The boy is wrong. I heard that George Burns is in this movie, and I won an Oscar for it. I am a supporter of George Burns since I was 10. Film Oh, God saw recently and loved it. It was awesome too. George Burns did a great job. Walter Matthau (this is the first time I've never seen him). Though they are really small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen have done a good job. Indeed, filmmakers were special. Let me tell you, if you are an admirer of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should immediately see this movie!
