For the first time, I was watching this movie when I was a child and it was the only time in my life that I remember my face and my eyes with horror at a special scene. I again remember my friends again with a disscusion and immediately add it to them (I was surprised to find it only when I found out in the United States when I was in the UK) with the video I took. When I look at it again I react, and my surprise is almost the same fear and fear, and my heart has never been beaten. This, in my opinion, is a compilation of "SCARIEST", a Hollywood soundtrack, a little Pony and Trap (crap), forgive the penguin. No matter how strange it is, I'm in the power of this movie and watching about it with about twenty friends, and I've never heard a lot of screams, blocks! Even the appearance of the video brings fear to God with a sense of fear and left me feeling alone in the dark !!!!
