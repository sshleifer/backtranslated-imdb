"Slaughter High" - this is a totally funny flushing flick about a high school Martini, always pranksters. Satan is going wrong and he burns and burns. After FIVE years, his crusaders are united - just some of them and of course, Marty will kill them one after another. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") as a hero it will die anyway!). Many strange death scenes to enter into a sexual partner: a boy's stomach explosion, another female victim, gets an acidic bath, a pair of electrocuted boys in the bed, crushed by a tractor, a girl drowned, and a doctor was in the eye hyperthermia takes a needle. The killer wears a masquerade and setting (a beautiful old English castle), a decent and very creepy gesture. Indeed, the dream final is completely miserable. All of this is true, "Slaughter High" is a garbage dump, but I'm just really slasher for flicks fans.
