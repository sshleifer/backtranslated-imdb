This film is worth seeing, despite some weaknesses. I opted for the cast, and I applaud Bonham Carter and Brana to choose different roles in the past. Both describe very entertaining people, full of warts, but make them happy for humanity. The story touches, but it's rising speeches. Bonham Carter's "Jane", I did not think of my eyes to look for romanticism, but opened up to the symptoms of disability, but for other reasons. I felt that the film had come to an end, but I felt better than emotional manipulation (see Stepmom). The real English setting to my truth - England in the 90s, both urban and peasant,.
