Interesting symbols, too much tension. It is black and white, without black and white. I am calm, like a calm, deaf secretary, supposedly a sympathetic main character, annihilation of colleagues, breaking off the path of crime, and finally joining with a heist and desperation to go to him. Instead of portraying their opponents torn apart by touching others for their injuries, let's just downgrade some other good quality movies to describe the offender imaginably. The film does not really know who is in the money, or what happens to the innocent spouse that is using the sweet bar secretary? Too bad, the film could have been great.
