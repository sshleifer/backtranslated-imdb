I saw this movie in the theater and I was very surprised. When Claire Danes is a good actress later, she's a stupid, arrogant, bitter bitter-looking Hollywood. In any case, this movie really made me one of the more sophisticated, realistic, beautiful friendly movies. How far you are for your best friend? I eventually moved to tears, and now when I look, it rattles me (I own it). When I left the theater, I recalled that I called my best friend and gave him the enthusiasm for how I loved him. This is a beautiful movie to watch with your best girlfriend. But after you get back to yours, you say you can prepare for a specific conversation and do something for her ....
