I've watched this movie a bit and still is on the list of my favorite movies. It is strangely assembled, and indeed, the film's detailed tidal bits (like Cafe Bustelo coffee breasts are used as a cup to wash your hair) because these people are NOT FILM THAT YOU SPREAD. This is one of the most culturally specific and featured films. Please, do not talk about the basics of this movie, if you have no prior knowledge. I've seen the writer / director go for it completely and hit the target perfectly! This movie deserves a better rating.
