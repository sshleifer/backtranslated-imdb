Barman wanted to shoot a movie just because he wanted it. It was so simple and he succeeded. Not just his goal, but a beautiful film, especially in a visual way. Pan, slow motion sequences, tracking shots, crane shots, etc. He knows how to use it in a beautiful, smooth manner. <br /> <br /> This movie has a very comfortable feeling. <br /> <br /> The story relates to the lives of eight different characters, something other than nothing else: the turning point of this film. The beauty of this picture is that the characters do not affect one another (of course, compared to a good movie like Magnolia). I do not think it's just Barman's idea. Beauty lies in the various experiences of people who have settled their lives or ruined their lives. The barman is very successful in describing these small stories that describe small practices. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very good, but we know Barman is a very successful songwriter and musician with dEUS. Music is sometimes warm and at the same time relaxing, feeling the sunny, smooth feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> We hear the funky pop / rock melodies that give us the power needed for some scenes. <br /> <br /> There is only one defect in the last half hour. Was it time to break me? Or was there no final scenes that were more striking and accurate than ever before? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it still creates a new breeze that will make you comfortable in an intense party, when someone opens a door, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br />
