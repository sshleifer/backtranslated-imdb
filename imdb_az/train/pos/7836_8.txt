Canto 1: Kriemhild is strangely over Siegfried and how did Ancient King Attila shake it? Kriemhild (Margarete Schön) through Ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlarn: his beloved Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow), King Gunther (Theodor Loos), denied his request. When the King of Huns, Attila, built Kriemhild through Ambassador Rudiger von Bechler, he said no one would make him a guilty one. Hagen Tronje hides the Nibelungen treasure at the bottom of a lake. Kanton 2: Kriemhild knows how he came from the Homeland and how he was taken by King Attila: Kriemhild brings Siegfried together from where he was killed and <br /> <br /> Kanto 3: How King Attila Rome and Kriemhild Brothers called ? Kriemhild: When his father swore to defend himself, Attila returns to his field and asks him if he wants most of Kriemhild to be satisfied. Kriemhild admits his brothers: Kriemhild insists that Hagen is the president of Tronje, but his brothers are faithful to their friends. Kanton 5: Celebrating Summer Day with Nibelungen: Kriemhild asks Atilla to kill Hagen Tronje, but refuses according to the laws of the desert. the guest is considered sacred. Kriemhild offers Hums gold for the head of Hagen Tronje. There is a war and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. Canto 6: Nibelungen's Horror: The Huns lose their battle against Nibelungen, but they keep the siege in Atila's castle. Kriemhild promises to save his life in case of delivery of Hagen Tronje, but his brother Günter says he is loyal to the German people's friends. Canto 7: The end of Nibelungen: After the death of Rudiger von Bechlarn, Giselher and Gernot, Hagen Tronje and Guhther were finally captured. Kriemhild ended his revenge with the destruction of Nibelungen and killed Hagen Tronje. <br /> <br /> The ending of Siegfried's poetry story through the "Revenge of Kriemhild" has been described with seven dramatic cantos. The nature of the first part is a spectacular story of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; The second part is a dramatic story of hatred, revenge, and loyalty. With the perfect development of heroes, a brilliant screenwriter, a perfect episode of pen, and an awesome episode from Fritz Langin's awesome direction. Margaret Shon is discreet and impartial with a woman who is intent on revenge, with a different woman. Kriemhild suits are also very impressive, and his player is based on his face and appearance. After the death of his only son, I was a little disappointed with the reaction, because I found it to be very passive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Qafqazinfo.az </ span> <span style = "color: red ; ">
