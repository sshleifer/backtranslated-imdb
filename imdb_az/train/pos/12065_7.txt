"The negligence" is far from the scene played by Nic Roeg. In the scheme of Roeg films, this is more than the level of the "Now Bach", which is explained by the advantageous use of Theresa Russell as a leading actress from the majority of posters. It's really good here, and it's far from the problem in other Roeg movies, like "Old Schedule" and "Cold Heaven." As "Actress" by Marilyn Monroe, Russell describes him as a depressed, but loved one, very effectively. He plays with Michael Emily as Einstein, who is best to say the least. He looks at an astonishing part and Theresa Russell is quite attractive enough to ensure that the piece is realistic when it is not exactly invisible to Monroe. Other players are sufficient if they are in prison like Emil and Russell. A very affordable, intelligent article is well-directed by Roeg, but it's not as bright as "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other Roeg films, he tries to rely heavily on indefinite, inaccurate flashbacks that add too little to the movie. The film would have worked much faster in many ways (ie, 60 minutes), a more modest piece. It's still a pretty, passive movie. At times it's pretty good, but not quite as general. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
