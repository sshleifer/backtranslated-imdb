this is a beautiful film, makes the 1950's beautiful look elegant. Kim Novak is a modern magician with a foot in Manhattan and interesting and interesting in the infinite nature of each other. All supporting performances, from Jacky Lemmon to Nicky to Ernie Kovacs, is a magical job in Manghattan, like the approach of a magic writer who works until Elsa Lanchester, as a terrible Aunt Queenie. And then there is a cat - along with me, many witches called it Pyowacket, but they offered a million. Jess Stewart looks from the ground, but it's something in his strange subconscious magic and magic, his symbol. Perfect. And this is a perfect romantic happy ending, believing that the grape's films have that happy ending. Gillian and Shep, of course, have the chance to be happy as Rose and Charlie Allnut in the Queen of Africa (another great movie)
