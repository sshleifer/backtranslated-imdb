This film may be a suspicious breeder that prepares for television, but it's one of the best films I've ever seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It's strange, attractive, and it's almost as full. If the stories of the murder of the murderer in Russia on the iron curtain were a feature of a story ready to endanger their careers to try to save the lives of future victims, it would have been a charming story - but that is a true truth. I highly recommend this.
