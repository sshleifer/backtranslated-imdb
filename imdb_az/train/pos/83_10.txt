A few years ago, I wrote to IMDB on Real McCoys TV series. <br /> <br /> Recently, on DVD we have looked at four old episodes PLUS combining with Richard Crenna and Kathy in 2000. Later I said it was a charming, funny, and entertaining show that I recited. Nolan and Tony Martinez. As a writer we have mentioned here, Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) have not been cited, but may be viewed through SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The show was good and gave us a lot of insights into the show. Kathy Nolan did not admit that she regretted leaving the show in an unpleasant contract dispute that was "widowed" in the past year. Nolan went to WW II to bomb a comedy called "Broadside" on Pacific women's nurses. Get it? BROADside? No, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Now, unlike the fighter on television, the truthful and fierce TRASH, Real McCoys, which violates our values, has fun with decent values ​​and wonderful people. And thank all the participants for bringing me to my family, including my creator, Irving Pinkus. We never left it.
