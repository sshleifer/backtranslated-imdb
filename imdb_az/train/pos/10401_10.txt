Words can hardly describe, and I will be short. "The Buddhist Thief" was my favorite movie, and it surprised me and frustrated me. I loved the first moment I saw this movie when I was one of the six children who started reading The Arabian Nights. <br/> <br /> <br /> Remember that Sabuhi entered the TV room in the middle of the battle with a giant spider. <br /> <br /> Rarely there are so many beauty, magic, and miracles. Sabu and John Justin are as superior as the naked spiders, Conrad Veidt creates a good impression of the evil immoral Jaffar, and Rex is the joy of watching the Englishman as a sardonic genie. Georges Perinal's photography is best used by Technicolor. One of the three directors, Michael Powell, has been rightly criticized by critics, but "Life and Death" (aka "Paradise Stairway") and "Red Shoes." <br /> <br /> Like all major artworks , As well as the beauty of "Buddhist Thief", he is one of the true masters of the camera with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles. It lies in details. Each frame has its own magic charm. The story is never delayed and symbols and their actions are always involved. There's a film that's not age here.
