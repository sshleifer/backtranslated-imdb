I am not resolute in the target audiences of this film. Only about 50 people have escaped to the world of independent films recently. This happened accidentally by a discovery of the newspaper late at night. I saw the first two things about this movie: 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliantly. I read an interview with the director in the local newspaper, and when I was told that one of her impressions was Clark, I began to be interested. His main effect was The Station Agent, a movie I saw on DVD for a week, decided I decided to go and examine it. The result can be described in the same line as the Clark, though the two films are not equally wise. Both films suffer from incredible technical difficulties. Employers are a day in the life of a person who has nothing in life, and when he is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation, "I resemble him," he says that he is always a person who is forced to engage himself in a life full of small things, will never engage with you. The theme and ideas of this film are strong and lifeless. When I look at how much has not changed since I grew up, I can say that young people have always had the same problems. The writer buys these problems and the theme with contemporary native artists, with beautifully-arranged characters and makes them absolutely certain. If the film is now filmed, it may not be perfect from the technical point of view, but the art is closer to something.
