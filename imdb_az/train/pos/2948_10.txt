Eddie Murphy must be against the law to avoid showing a very funny stand. <br /> <br /> Murphy is about 70 minutes for many famous people, including his "family", dicks, pussy, breasts and leaks. Among the people acquired by Murphy: Elvis, TT, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I have not seriously laughed at the difficulty of anything in my life. That is, when a man does not know who T is, Murphy still laughs like Mr T, there's something about it. I saw the show and I could not remember who Mr. T was, but he still laughed. Now I know who he is, and it's much more funny. Because Eddie does so - he can make impressions so good that those who try to commit hell are not important, yet funny. Moreover, we learn that Murphy is really a very good singer. Please wait ..
