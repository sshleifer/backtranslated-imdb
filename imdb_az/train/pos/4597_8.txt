By winning a reputation as Drunken Master, Jackie Chan drew attention once more with a 1983 A Project, a gratifying pirate flick that rebuilt as a great star. When Police Story was released two years later, an unusual gearbox around Jackie reached the zenith, and numerous stunts, wild battle scenes, and suspicious comedy flocked to the crowd to see this crazy blend. <br /> <br /> There are many identity cards with a spouse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Jackie's performance is also very strong, and she's often bent on the running comedy; the effect of the film is slightly smaller, with her trumpet carrying it. In addition, Jackie played a gamble while giving her heroism as a boundless psychopath to endanger others ... although nobody had ever noticed! Praising Police Story as a simple "good and evil" warriors, critics of the war have reversed the film's uncertainty, and when the Garadard brothers described this uncertainty, the film has shown a significant and glorious transition from conventional ideas. In short, this is a quality "popcorn" movie (although many villains have been buried in glass bottles on the final stage of the film, or you can wade away from your head) - a powerful, exciting entertaining motion picture sorted by the best of the times .
