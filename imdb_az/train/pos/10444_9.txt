Sweet and charming, funny and tough, consistent, but meaningful, "Before Sunrise" (1995), Richard Linklater hopes to find the third movie, in love, in love, or never in love. It is one of the rare films, which is equally interesting for teens, parents and even grandparents. It looks like a very simple little movie without spectacular visual effects, car chase and long and steam sex scenes. At the beginning of the 20s, two young students and two college students (an American tourist coming home after summer in Europe, Ethan Hawke and French student Julie Delpy, who went to Paris to attend the Sorbonne classes). They are immediately attracted to each other before they start talking, hoping to go around the vicinity of Vienna, which explores the whole night. They talk and fall in love. This is the film. It could be boring and foolish, but instead, it's just a lovely, incredible, intelligent, and romantic romance that gets better at every review (at least for the audience). High praise and sincere gratitude goes to the director and writers to bring two charming characters, perfect writing, always interesting and intelligent dialogues, two magical performances and a magical atmosphere of love. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli angel, is an intelligent, independent and incredibly charming young woman.
