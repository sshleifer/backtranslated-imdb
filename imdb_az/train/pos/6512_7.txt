My baby sitter was a fan, but I saw many of the old episodes while growing up. I'm not an admirer of Scooby Doo, because I'm not sure why I left after watching this show. I was surprised that I liked it. * Shaggy and Scooby were just interesting characters * Dodges tomatoes from other admirers * I like that they just focus on those two. However, this can lead to hatred by original fans. Especially I love the voice of Phinius Phibes. I loved listening to him before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. Jim Meskimen, like Robi, sings for me, really enjoys her job as an actor. I can also get a blow from the techniques of delusional autistic personalities and their desire to play their ancestors or the Star Wars (not the names shown on the stage).
