Of course, this was a very sensitive one, but I can not help but think before. Recalls another VCA movie I saw in Poitier: "RUBY RAE OTHER DAYS". Also, "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay also had spots. Which do not want to say that they are not trivial references ... just feel very modern and very fashionable ... it makes me feel like that of the ad (style and story approach) <br /> <br /> The art of cinema it's just perfect for me. For my liking, many coral filters (or coal) ... very rear frame 12mm. So all the impression made me a little far away - avoid the art of self-proclaiming! The French (they are a conservative gang), but as a jury ... but interested in what has happened over the past few years, the Cannes short film selection is conservative compared to its feature choice.
