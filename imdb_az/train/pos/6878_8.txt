The 35 year old Groove Tube looks much like actual TV today! Custom niche networks (naked sports), a television show on Stoner drug dealers, vendors (ala Weeds, and even Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke in 1978), strange beer ads (Butz Beer, less bizarre than Bud Bowls ) One night before the live night of 1975, a year ago, Koko (Pee Wee Hermann's shades) and even Chevy Chase made a rifle humor (a fierce sarthex vocal duet) a year ago. Thanks to the sad turnaround, which won the Groove Tribu with the first X rating, I still did not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move Up On". Naked dance otogol hippies without thinking ---- Like TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on Mood, Monty Python's Fringes, Dinamit Chickens and Firesign Theater for similar sketch-style movies Everything is Wrong.
