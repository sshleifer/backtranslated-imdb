Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to see this movie (so it's really not really spoiler). I saw this movie released and still can remember parts. What is left in a small city or in the whole west of the city. It looks like a ghost town with less inhabitants. There are several pairs, especially between them. He ensures the death of a man at the end of the movie and leaves the city, but it must spend the field. We never know what happens after his death, but before we take him to the dead and give him deliberately and instead of water. He knows that soon he will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a few bad guys in a funny manor - but this is another story I do not remember very well. The rest of the film is the first time I've seen a really bad woman in the film, but it's a bad thing - Snowwhite can not be compared to the witch, because it's easy to learn. There are several key characters with very dense western and still absorbed.
