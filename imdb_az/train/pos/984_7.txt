I started and thought that I was in "Bait" one night, "Well, why not?" I'm glad I gave you a chance. <br /> <br /> Feed is not perfect. It is unnecessarily exposed to light and consistent shaking. But in general, this film worked. All the elements were made to the right and could have been a very ugly film. <br /> <br /> Therefore, in my opinion, Jamie Foxx. I do not know whom Foxx handed over, but who made a great grace to this movie. Reverend and strangely loved, Foxx slips out of the film, lighter than lip and is fun. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, despite the killing of Foxx, he is committed to doing so. . <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <strong> Maybe I'm taking this action right overnight or vice versa, but I'll give it 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
