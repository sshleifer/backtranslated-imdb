I want to warn you that this statement has very little quality. <br /> <br /> After seeing the film, this interpretation will be even more meaningful. <br /> <br /> Even though the film is in a bad mood, this movie is similar to my life, which is true. scary <br /> <br /> Some films will never be able to describe how those who act like this in the film and react to their subsequent lives. <br /> <br /> It could not have been a work of art; <br /> <br /> Although it's one of the best films I've ever seen, I'm watching my life. <br /> <br /> But as a chance to join the spirit of another person, I wholeheartedly confirm. Silver was such a painful experience depicted on the screen. it will probably never be experienced beforehand or ever again. I know that it is a truth, because it is my soul.
