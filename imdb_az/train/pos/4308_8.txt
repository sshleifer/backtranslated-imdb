Before crash, there was an interesting movie called Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon, about 14 years before the old film, was a film about two men who had come together as a lifelong comrade. <br /> <br /> The US Secretary of State in Los Angeles, Mack (Kevin Kline), is in the worst case of a car in the city. He is calling a pickup truck and is forced to wait for a while, but soon threatens a group of dangerous people who want a car. Soon the truck driver came up perfectly and removed Simon (Danny Glover). Both are threatened, but Simon keeps himself, Mack, and the car in a difficult position. From here, Simon said that he had developed a friendship between two men for a lifetime with Mack, who helped Simon help him in a more dangerous situation. Simon's brother, Deborah (Tina Lifford), lives in a dangerous neighborhood with two children and is afraid of his eldest son, who is walking with some bad guys on the night streets. Mack offers them a better place, but at the same time, Simon is shooting with his secretary's friend Jane (Alfre Vudard). <br /> <br /> The main area of ​​this film, but also other smaller areas, is Mary Louise Parker, and her son Roberto (Jeremy Sisto in the first film) has long been abandoned after leaving for the summer camp Mackin's wife (Mary McDonnel), who discovered a baby, is soon moving on to her life. Details of all these areas are brought to a complicated film that uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and uses it as a bridge connecting all the different scenes. <br /> <br /> This simple plot device works very well and helps with story flow. <br /> <br /> The Big Chill director, Lawrence Kasdan, created a great movie here. The cast is very good, and most of the ideas are well thought out, but, unfortunately, some points that make the movie even stronger are shiny. The story covering the episode is one, and the second is Simon's nephew. These scenes should have been different from the whole story, and maybe Lutsen's thoughts in the upper and lower classes would not be a good one, but a great one. Still, Grand Canyon's expectations have been overturned, and you'll see the look of the canyon given in the name of this movie. For Steve Martin, there is a small role, like Davis, who offers his own ideas about life and is a small part of playing the movie's ideas, making fierce films.
