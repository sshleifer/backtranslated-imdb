It is a strong film from history and epic. The story is simple and straightforward, though it is simple and straightforward. <br /> <br /> In fact, the honor of a dignified, honorable person is a standard story that conflicts with more educated and rich people of the time. <br /> <br /> Poor and rich, glorious, immoral, classic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <strong> :)
