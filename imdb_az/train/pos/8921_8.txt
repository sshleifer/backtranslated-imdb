I look at this page and it seems to me that I did not accept me to listen to something and come across a true classic. Of course, I agree with everyone expressing their opinions, but here I have: <br /> <br /> This movie should not be missed by any classic fearsman, and should look at many random audiences around the world. Of course, this has lost strength and power over the CGI effect, some of which has been affected by CGI effects a few years ago. <br /> <br /> You should love it because it is actually a scary movie for even today's standards. This is usually a ickyness that you will squeeze so much up to the original audience, so do not wipe a classic you do not give a chance. Follow, but not critical. Look at the fun, how it was originally meant.
