James Cagney is known for his most challenging characters and gangsters, but he also played a very "soft" character in his career. <br /> <br /> Cagney has several songs in this movie, as well as many dances. And this is not bad at all. He plays a very trusting role. Before she started to spend a lot of time in the actor's career, she had had some dance in her previous life, so it's not a strange thing to play some musician in her career. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, perhaps the best and most successful director in the genre. . His first "30" musical genres were quite numerous, and he was responsible for the genre films like The 42nd Street. Musicals were always light and entertaining to watch, and more comedy than anything else. <br /> <br /> <strong> The music of the 30s is never related to singing songs. It was music that began in the 40s and later at the studio of MGM. As usual, the music world is, of course, predictable and progressive. However, it's just a fun and simple story to watch funny movies. Symbols and actors that describe them should also do so. <br /> <br /> In the last part of the film, the film's general plot line is drawn, the movie consists of only musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of the movie, I'm also entertaining and doing good. Music numbers are once again young Billy Barty. often, a year ago, film music was played early in the career of a small boy / babies / mice and more, including the "Golden Pole of 1933". <br /> <br /> Recommended early genre movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
