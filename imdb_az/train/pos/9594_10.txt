Unfortunately, despite the fact that many of them have passed, the appearance of the ballet is still very vivid and their legacy. Some are still very lively and pretty good, the Octavia is brilliant and beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very successful, and it provides great support to the gay community as a whole, and Pepper Labeija just went through the natural cause last year, if it were in peace. After the passage of Anji, Carmen Xtravaganza (who was on the beach scene) became the mother of his house, and he is also looking great. Some balls have categories dedicated to the past, even if they are in peace. Currently, "How do I look?" A project called www.howdoilooknyc.org can be checked.
