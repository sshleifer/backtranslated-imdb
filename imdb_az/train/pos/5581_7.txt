This picture was banned from American cinema in 1930 due to nudity by Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann), which caused all kinds of problems among women in 1930, but not for the male population. This story is about a young woman named Eva Hermann, who is married to an old man, and is married on the wedding night and will never marry and worries about all kinds of small things as her shoes and kills them. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On Hot Summer Day, Eva makes a ride to her horse and decides to go to a naked swim in a lake in the woods. The horse runs away and it runs behind him and is seen by a young man who finds his clothes and returns to Eva. These two men are very familiar and have romanticism that starts blooming. There are more interesting issues that arise as seen in the end of this movie. Enjoy a great classic movie, a Shocker movie in 1933. Enjoy it.
