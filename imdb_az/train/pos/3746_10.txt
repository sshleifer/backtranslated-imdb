I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is beautiful! My favorite parts are the French song and the Spatula soldier's "BIG!" I'm breaking every time. I recommend this movie to fans of Knox Klaymation and other people who enjoy Jason Steele's films. Its animation style is very original. Gives a few ideas to consider certain backgrounds. His humor is also joyful and not something you have heard before. Like Max's deformed Spatula, its vivid sound and light system, he invites colorful lights and happy music while talking about his magnificent life. A beautiful animation to watch anytime anywhere.
