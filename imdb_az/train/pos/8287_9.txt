Kim (Patricia Clarkson), George (Jake Weber) and his son Miles (Erik Per Sullivan) are sent off to Manhattan's lighted metropolis for relaxation in the winter weekend. On the way, they hit an ant and stayed in the snow. A group hunter following Bucki comes. Instead of helping Otis (John Speredakos), at least one of the hunters, is angry because the crash broke the money. George, Kim and Miles Otis are worried and worse, we learn quickly where Otis learns where they are. Meanwhile, Milesa is given a miracle in a wandigo (a Hindu-shaped spirit / monster) in India where only one marriage is seen. Is Otis a psychologist to get our heroes? In the woods are wendigos? <br /> <br /> I can see where Wendigoun has some of the challenges inherent in the audience. Fewer low budget movies with frequent technical limitations. Most of the film, perhaps all of them, is not true about the titular creatures. And maybe a fatal blow to many people, with a number of questions unanswered, has a very uncertain end. <br /> <br /> If you avoid such endings, and if you are thinking of what you are thinking and everything, give yourself a blessing and avoid Wendigo. <br /> Personally I like movies like this. I usually prefer some uncertainties. Wendigo marketing has been targeted by those who want to end a great deal of battle with some supernatural monster that has been defeated and that everything is woken up for Wendigo 2: Monster returns, but this is not what it is. Wendigo will offer this idea for many thoughtful and poetic people more than the surface of a live flick. Heck, writer / director Larry Fessenden, is characterized by Robert Frost's reading. George's statement that Frost's poem and Frost seem to create a complex image and atmosphere from simple things are the key to the film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is its complexity. In a way, there are also four different films that occur at the same time, each subject is a subject. In George's case, he is not the happiest or most beloved boy in the world, and he has problems with adolescence. For this reason, film's life is a real and terrible basis for evil, evil and evil. In Patricia, he is looking for the rejuvenation of his life and his family. He is a psychologist, and most of them denied the problems around him, and they hope they are getting better. In Otis's work, he was more lucky to have George and George's life came to symbolize the last crack in his psychological armor. The film's most important film, Miles, is a great poem because of life, young innocence, and descriptions of the world. But this one-hearted story is generally a hopeful one, but the story of the movie gives Miles a poignant interpretation of the poetry. Still, when everything is said and done, it looks like the only person who is dependent on himself for his poetic appearance. <br /> <br /> Although the movie has low budget, very good work is done with high budget ambitions. Fessenden and photographer Terry Stacey finds some great shots in beautiful places and has created some interesting slideshows (such as cards or books from India), such as montage. There are even more traditional assemblies like Miles' Nightmare. Wendigo is well-drawn and straightforward than huge budget movies. <br /> <br /> Other technical features are good for the budget. In the end, the appearance of the "Wendigo" worked for me and, accordingly, was uncertain. The lighting was very good - a few times dark scenes were not as clear as they could be, but the film's shareholder (instead of digitally) could be seen as a problem of transfer. I thought the performances were much better and more realistic than most films (if it were worth it). <br /> <br /> Generally, Wendigo is a very good film, which is worth watching without any critical ideas. When you do not have to think about the movies you watch.
