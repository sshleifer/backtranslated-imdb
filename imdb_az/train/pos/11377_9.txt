Let's remind, that X. explains the story of Andrey Cicatillo, Rostov Ripper, of 52 people, mostly women and children, for eight years. It shows how the investigation has been violated by the Soviet bureaucracy, and it was difficult to investigate crimes. It performs this work so brilliantly that it will not touch anyone. At first it maybe a little slower temp, but it really keeps you as the story unfolds. I can only say that besides the "Lamb's Silence", this is the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to say which actor stands on the rest of the film. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as an inexperienced court expert responsible for the investigation. The ghost advantage of Donald Sutherland and the only person who wants to help him in the Russian government is surprising, as Rea. And what about Jeffrey DuMann? DuMann created a character that inspired empathy more than brilliance and hatred. <br /> <br /> Yes, he is a monster, but he is a treacherous and mocking betrayal by his wife, chief, and colleague ... He is tortured, embarrassed, and very bad. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a well-prepared documentary drama, where actors are still more important than special effects. If you ask me at least 9/10, maybe worth it.
