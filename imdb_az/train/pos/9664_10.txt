Bette Midler demonstrates her talents and beauty at Diva Las Vegas. I'm thrilled to touch it and can look when I want it. He has the audience to capture captives. His voice is as beautiful as ever, and will really make you happy. In 1979, he featured the song "Stay with Me" from the "The Rose". You can feel the emotions in the melody and end with the goose bumps. The show, Bette Midler will leave you with the desire to rent a movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler albums.
