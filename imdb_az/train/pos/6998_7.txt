I'm thinking of seeing the Pound, but I'm not sure what to think because there's a lot to be done to understand what the film really is. So, in the first 20 minutes or totally lost in the plot, you will not know what's happening, and Tim, who claims to be, is a great evil. All of this ends in the last minute of the film, which means "wrapped up". Primarily Tim (hardworking) suffered and survived with a major accident that led to the end of the seven lives of the people. <br /> <br /> This film is great, because I feel that whatever happens I'll smoke. Part of it creates impression. Rosario Dawson, I think it's one of his best films, I'm out of the eagle's eye. He is a little good, but he is in this movie. Other actors, such as Wooden Harrelson, have very small roles and do not play a major role in understanding the character. <br /> <br /> Film shooting is still good. <br /> <br /> This film was not my expectation, of course, a very slow pace I hope. The film was still pretty good. The last 5 minutes of the movie, and nothing falls on the ground when everything falls to the ground. Until then, it seems like only a trivial story of love. Final thoughts seven pounds = Seven Stars.
