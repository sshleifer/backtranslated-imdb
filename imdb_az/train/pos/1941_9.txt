I really thought it was a comedy, and I was looking forward to smiling. Soon it's not a comedy, or at least a 'Jim Carrey' type. The characters we are watching - the film begins with one of the main fears - fearful of the fear of water, the fear of swimming, and with people who are terribly alarmed, to worry about. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it looks darker than the truth, and brings some light sooner than the chain of events. <br /> <br /> I will not be able to look at some of the movies. <br /> <br /> Therefore, many films prevent the escape of people in the western world, which shows how people can help each other and help each other. <br /> <br /> Peace and love <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
