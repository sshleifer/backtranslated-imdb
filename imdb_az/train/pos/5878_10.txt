Garam Masala is one of the most exciting films I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is also excellent as a woman who works with three girls at the same time. John Abraham is sometimes entertaining and is one of the best things ever to date. Paresh Rawail is as superior as most of the movies. Director Priyadarshan gave great films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are the best. Garam Masala is the most funny movie ever. The average of three new players. Rimi is not very rich in this movie. I'm also surprised to find out that Priyadarsha is filming a simple story about a girl with three girls at the same time. All three girls will be resting the same day one day and end up in the same house. Filled with lots of fun, this is a Non-Stop Entertainment.
