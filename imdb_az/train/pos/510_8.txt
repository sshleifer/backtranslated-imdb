I just watched it for the first time for a long time - I had forgotten how creative the pictures were and how wretched the movie was. <br /> <br /> The opening scenes that took place in the Candlelight Club at Waterloo Bridge, one of the most romantic films when it came to my wife, was not forgotten. <br /> <br /> Everyone who is interested in politics or history loves off-the-shelf references - <br /> <br /> My favorite movie is also the recently released Odd Man Out, but it's with romance will be pleased by the Hunter-Niven action of everyone who is interested, and the world's image of anyone who loves visual images. that's fine. <br /> <br />
