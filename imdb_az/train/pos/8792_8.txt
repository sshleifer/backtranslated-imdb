An entertaining kung fu movie, a cut on top of a socky wand with players, plot and fighting scenes. The whole cast is gratifying characters and experienced martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng proto-Jackie Chan comedy antics watch is entertaining and shows his particularly impressive skills in his lover. For me, the film's only distinctive defect is the size of the pile - sometimes changes between movie shootings and various subplots are a bit mixed, and some characters are not exactly fleshed-out as required. <br /> <br /> But a kung fu film first Shaolin Temple will definitely provide this number. The film is a high-level struggle that allows each character to demonstrate their skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> Generally, Shaolin Temple is a fun low-budget kung fu film. Not a good Jet Li movie quality, but worthy of a charming party. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Separate notes: I saw the 1987 Warner Home Video release (nearly) badly named and has never been full cast and crew loans.
