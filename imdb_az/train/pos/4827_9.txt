For this reason, history / biographical films are important to all of us, and when doing so well! <br /> <br /> Before seeing "Young Victoria", Queen Victoria, but eventually I got more information about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just as great as Victoria (who will guess!) and she will probably be nominated for Oscar this year. Personally, I'm opposed to it ... <br /> <br /> A very beautiful art for technical issues that is a beautiful art direction / Set Decoration and, of course, a Great Periodic Costume Design! <br /> <br /> It's a disadvantage that I want to learn more about this fascinating queen and want to know more, but first incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 10 out of 9!
