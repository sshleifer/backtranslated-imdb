When I hear that Hartley has been continuing for Henry Fool, I'm thrilled to be thrilled when you hear that something is terrorism - something exciting (this is a personal favorite for a few years). Although, despite being a completely different film than Henry Fool, I was surprised to find out that he was working. Both the dead and the actor were perfect in writing and direction ... the private judging, actually, to Henry, who was only the fourth in the original, went to Hartley to reconnect almost all boats. I said that this film is very different from the first, but it works: it's been 10 years and I've come to terms with the tone and theme after the characters have been found in quite different ways. his first film was over. In this case, an unexpected adventure emerges ... and I'll give it all ... you really need to see it again and to see who has just gone to two. Hartley is now third-party and seems to remain hanging on the film, although it's definitely one of the better films I've seen for a while, although suffers from many sequels with the ending. In 2017, I am sure that I will receive the 3rd party (Henry Grim) tickets.
