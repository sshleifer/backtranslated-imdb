As you can see, Ruggero Deodato first understood that his story would not work when he approached very seriously, so he decided to go to the camp. As a result, there is a horrible sword and magic epic or very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. Short-term moments have done a good job, Paul Brothers's open outfit (bumps on one scene!) Is clearly mocked and has a charming, inspirational, kindling performance by Eva La Rue. who is the author of "boys". Do you see the inside of a dashboard like another disco? (***)
