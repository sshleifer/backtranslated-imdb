When I saw this and the DVDs scary red queen sculpture, I thought I was in a big disappointment, but I was surprised, surprised. Of course, it is not necessary to avoid the point of being able to read the applause of such a complicated charge, of course, to give a ridiculous explanation. However, films are a dream. The beautiful dresses on the magnificent devices are accompanied by excellent dresses and all the things that go on the move and the wonderful Bruno Nicolai score. It can not be Morricon, but it can be so light. Very colorful, multi-sex desires, a killing of some and a minimal police intervention. Super.
