This is a very memorable spaghetti west. There is a great story, interesting characters and especially good players from Rosalba Neri. In this film, the role of bad villainess is really classic. Even though he stole every stage and does not talk, he often expresses his face and eyes. His performance is very convincing. He does not have to be above it, but he is capable of being superior (there is no problem with superiority). Mark Damon is also a surprising thing in this film. <br /> <br /> Music score is excellent and the theme song is kind of playing for a few days after you see the movie. or not. There are several fun things to do. Especially I like the part of Rosalba Neri's parchment. <br /> <br /> If this film was not for two or eight stars, it would probably be a movie. The first is the case of a terrible bar room that took place in about 25 minutes. This is one of the most funny scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed and resembles a better dance than any real fight. Though there was a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, it was a much more serious westerner, and the barrier needed to be really realistic. Another thing worrying me about this movie was Yuma's terrible Mexican sidekick. In my opinion, it should have been a comic relief or something, but the character was simply foolish and unnecessary in such a film and it was not funny. Can I tell Tuco where I need it? <br /> <br /> All of the above have told me that, despite the mistakes I call Johnny Yuma, Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western and all fans of this genre need to see this movie.
