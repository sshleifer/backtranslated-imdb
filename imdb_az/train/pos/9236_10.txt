Think of people, leave the bad word of the original, because the original Battlestar series was even a masterpiece with all the stars, story lines and art. Lorne Greene was as brilliant as Starbuck as Adam and Richard Hatch's Apollo and Dirk Benedict, but I'm not as cool as Starbuck as Katee. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with Pegasus and congratulations from the ground were good. John Calicos knew Baltar, the War of the Gods was the best practice in Terra, I thought he would wait for Hell, then Battlestar women, and did not compare them, as Tricia was as beautiful as Number, but could not be compared with the beauty of Jane Seymour. Loerrta Spang like Cassiopea was a single sheep .He was the beauty to be embarrassed by a rainbow. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> :) Thank you for listening.
