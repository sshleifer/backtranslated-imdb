One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think he has seen such a thing for a long time in the network or cable television. Watching this show, the television program was like a fresh air filled with reality shows and filled with dull work. <br /> <br /> I say that I had what I said. As a result, critics were almost unanimous when the consciousness was crying and the show diminished. However, half an hour is over (probably for NBC, thank you for the commercial free demonstration), I felt instant love, love at first glance, a sense of true love that it feels like. Everything about this show shouted prizes. <br /> <br /> In this show graphics were as good as at least finding Nemo and Shrek. <br /> <br /> Taking into account these films, my little work has been developed for many years. <br /> <br /> The change was striking. I feel the voice of John Goodman, but the rest of the team, of course, was with John. Special note: guest of Lisa Kudrow. He was on the game, creating a neurotic, naked and lovely panda with the Jewish strip. <br /> <br /> <strong> According to the events in the Caucasus, not all parents are mentioned: this is not for children. This show has not been announced in such a way and has a certain reason for 8PM, not 9PM. So, if you want to complain about the "negative context", rescue your breath. The adults deserve only a comedy given to them and are the father of pride. <br /> <br /> Everything is not perfect. I was a little surprised by the characters of Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel "stereotypes" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are cunning. Yes, they speak German accent. But yesterday's news. Give something new, something fresh, funny. Putting old jokes on a new show is an absolutely wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show want to use the "star energy" of these children. This is good for me. But do not stand on anything that everyone can know wholeheartedly. Hopefully, the rest of the show will repeat the same old record. <br /> <br /> Generally, the show is Must-See-TV. Here and there are a few unexpected twists, funny, clever, no good comedy since Seinfeld. Of course, we look forward to the next episode.
