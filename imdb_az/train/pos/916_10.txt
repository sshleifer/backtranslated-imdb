My comments to VIVAH: - The story of a charming, idealistic love story played by witness Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film comes to us and returns to little tastes like bridegroom families lying in place, playing games together, slogans of friendship and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sacredness of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals. Yes, central romanticism is displayed simply. However, the stubborn resistance against the hidden romantic moments and modern-day toy games between married couples ends up being idealistic. The film is about to end with wedding and grooming on the night of marriage, tells the new bride, who is suffering from burning injuries at wedding night: <br /> <br /> VIVAH - exhibits very good things - the beauty of the wedding, the beauty of Indian culture, the beauty of the last, but a couple of pairs waiting to be married to a beautiful IDEALISM ... play with the rules! Simple yet Beautiful; Such a simple story .... no plot ... no soul - it's like most Sooraj Barjata movies. TRYING returned to work at BEST. Designed by FULL CONVICTION His very sweet movie is a great many good things he has learned from the present generation. It is a Family Marriage and 2 Families Association. AMRITA RAO - looks very good and I think it is very good. He has the best scenes - despite my last half-hour experience, Though the Thoughts of the Captain give him a very limited limited performance. I liked the behavior of others as before. Choti, Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Witness's brother and daughter. It seemed to be almost real and well-known. Sooraj secretary, Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain, gave a nice family movie loan. <br /> <br /> Chemistry is a mix between Martyr & Amrita. <br /> <br /> Sacrifice in marriage, attitudes, mutual respect, caregivers and spouses, marrying "officially" to marry, Prayer / Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more were featured in Vivah. There are still some good audiences who are browsing and enjoying this movie. Some folks / audience are thrilled after they see that they are planning to marry you :) If you ask me you will succeed. AMRITA RAO - Our Actress-to-Vivah (Good Outcome)} was awarded the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE Award for 2006! Despite the fact that Vivah, Shahid or Amrita did not receive anything from filmmaking and other awards, Chalo's hats for this success; @ az is the news about CHEERE !! AMRITA RAO's delight is that the Indian bride is in the best shape and best way to show Barclays Suala for a look! :) Shudn't Shevn't VIVAH sweet and legendary today! Imagine that sharing the same win as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... Not to succeed! I congratulate Amrita Rao - to award Carrier to another level with this award .... I personally feel it - just shoot a movie with Witness Capour! They are cute pairs and reminds me of their screen chemistry {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ... <br /> <br /> Some points I look at are some of the elements: - # 1 If you were in the spotlight, Amrita Rao looks very good, because shes always wears traditional dresses. In this film, the Indian woman gives every bit of woman! Perfect Fit # 2 Witness Captain is not ready for the most marriages or early marriages ... but PREM listens carefully to the step-by-step discussion of the DAD, which is fully convinced of Anupam Kher. As a result, "Honesty" and "Trust" are keywords that reflect the first meeting with Amrita. It is not enough for many to judge a person that such a first meeting would be limited to a general strangeness. But as I have seen in this movie, there is a feeling that two similar people can be joined together, it is possible! # 3 The whole film shows that the Witness & Amrita are together or together, mostly consisting of 4 or 5 titles. Hero and protagonist always read / dance or these days - things are different from other romantic / wedding-based movies. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences is: - Density, innocence, and other respects are characterized! # 4 I really liked the relationship between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These films should show indifference to girls / girls in some places in India. # 5 Successful romance scenes among lead couples - no cheap scenes, songs are beautiful! "Jal", "praarthana" e.t.c. there will be noisy words for all the girls who love this movie :) Personally I really love many dialogs in this movie. # 6 The latest, but at least - The whole hospital scene, where Sindhu or Amrita had put Sindhuor to fight for life. The dialogues between these couples are so touched and I feel love / I-cant-do-without-U; His Hats-Off feeling! <br /> <br /> In many ways, VIVAH reminded me that Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - For LEAD pair / chemistry on display:) *** IF IF ASK ME: VIVAH is among the best films ever made in 2006, along with films such as Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express. FIDE - Vivah is better than seeing / looking at Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all this time switching / fuzzy / styles / crap movies!
