I bought the first Bill and Ted for Christmas and when I saw it in a store, I had to get the second one. This was one of the first (I think) but it was funny as many wierder stories. It was funny how they had their own private hell and how to play death. I smile, he played a foolish little game like a clue. What I changed was to be in Station and Death, but it was very good.
