An American in Paris has had many artworks and Hollywood music. When the powers of the MGM are raised as a musician, the film has memorable music from the Gershins, the 20th-century Beethoven and Mozart names. <br /> <br /> Geni Kelly was in charge of this film, though it was just a warm up for the best work in the Rain, called Singin (1952). These two films are really tightly closed. In addition to Arthur Freed, the Broadway Melody band is part of the "Rain" in this movie, with the presence of incredible America with the Paris Ballet series. This is the only time in which the dance number of the movie's special credits is marked. <br /> <br /> Filming is definitely perfect. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Gene deserves to be able to show Kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer. Leslie Caron shows his talent, which he has been filming for years, by making an incredible movie. His introductive dance sequence, and then his work at Ballet, provides some striking sexy moments in the MGM Musicals competing with Justin's work in Cyd Charisse's Rain and Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is not as hilarious as Kelly's stoic friend, two of the best moments of the film: the last party (I will not give it to everyone who does not see the movie) and one of the most memorable musical numbers of the movie <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Undefeated by Georges Guette, Kelly's romantic opponent, though he emphasizes several tracks, and Leslie Caron's romantic opponent Nina Foch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Behind May, <br /> <br /> There are several elements in the movie. It is less satisfying than Singin in the rain. Although the ballet is genuine and well-prepared, it does not really fit the rest of the movie. Without leaving the field, the ballet can only be without a real boat or cause. And, unlike the Broadway Melody sequence, there is really nothing in this area - and in the best music, songs are always raison d'etre. <br /> <br /> Making things even worse, is the ending of the film, which immediately follows the ballet. Although the end is not a surprise (this is not a MGM music), I hope for a bit more after the ballet's end. The script writer, Vincente Minnelli, thinks the ballet can not look at anything else. The film made me angry. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the worst American Hollywood music in Paris. In the rain, Singin does not reach the heights but approaches, and presents Gene Kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
