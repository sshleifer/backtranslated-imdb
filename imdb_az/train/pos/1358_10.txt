Season after season, players or characters participating in this show seem to be the ones who absolutely hate it. Is this show so fake or alike? Each episode does not hurt a single person and ends without being killed. Though they are totally wrong and sick, you enjoy their curl. You enjoy the rest of the fun, tearing, dirty, returning, escaping, and finally thrown by Trump. <br /> <br /> In recent years, the rewards of humiliation and suffering have also dropped dramatically. In the new chapters you ask him, "Who are you talking about hives, who will talk about uvw?" Who is the betrayer? Are the heroes surprised, collective and individual, as they are paid actors? <br /> <br /> Be careful and protect your conscience. These are the people on the fire line.
