I just want all of the fans of this documentary, Martin Torgof is uncle and I'm proud of him. This mini-series, released on VH1, looks at the culture of the last 30 years and my uncle worked hard. The amount of time I spent watching and the amount of effort put on this documentary and the book that started all over ("Do not find my home") makes it even better to watch on television. I know he does what he does and works well. His freedoms are reflected in the interviews he or she made and the remarkable additions he made in his commentary. From music to video and everything, it really is a great document that shows the experience of the culture of the drug with someone who lives with it. I would like to hear from any of those who are grateful (or not) and fans of any of these comments! Three Glad to Martin's Uncle!
