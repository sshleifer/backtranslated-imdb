<br /> <br /> I found this movie to be extremely unpleasant, but also easily accessible to my eyes, humor and works from the supporting player really made me laugh <br /> It sounds loud a few times. <br /> Yes, this is projected and yes, this is a romantic comedy for a clich√©. <br /> <br /> The purpose of the conversation is a sweet story. <br /> <br /> The message about finding the true love together is often sounded right. <br /> <br /> This dialogue is dead and the game is well done in all parts. above the funny effect. The bulgari scene is worth the weight of the gold, the actress deserves the glorious words! For those who are forbidden to be predicted - if you want a twist and a rotating movie, you want ... a tension. This romantic comedy ... touched my heart and realized it was a lucky enough to find my true love in life and deserved every effort on the way. <br /> <br /> Great history film, a great movie for a happy scream ...
