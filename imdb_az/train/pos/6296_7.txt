Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is still an aspiring writer looking for a great break. Meanwhile, Manhattan works as a telephone consultant on the hot line. Unfortunately, his apartment building is burned one day. Parker and his cat are alive, but now they have been squeezed by the difficult task of finding a suitable home in Big Apple. In short, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a guest room, but only one gay person will accept it. Parker is straight, but claims that he is gay, because the price is right. Samantha likes him from the beginning and accepts him as a new cohabit. But poor Parker. Sam is cute, clever and very desirable. Will he be unable to control his true nature? In addition, does Sam have a successful businesswoman-lover? It's a sweet, unpleasant and humorous movie with two attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, plot, how can we keep these "ruse" scenes? When Sam asked Parker for a sweet shampoo, she showered with her to sleep in the bed when she received bad news. Also, Parker needs to prepare when he asks for his "false" gay friend, Boris, a man she knows. Hopefully, the gay community will not find this insult because most viewers think it is sensitive and sensitive. For a small movie, suits, sets, and camera work were also great. Therefore, if you love these funny tales of lovers, buy this one soon. You know what you love, I know.
