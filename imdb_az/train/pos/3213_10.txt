Kurt Russell (Sgt Todd) has only 72 lines and 104 words. What is it? As in the form of black and white, the eyes of mind combine all the hollows, facial expressions, physical drama, and sensual action, making a stronger impact. This is one of the top 5 films I can not live without, with classics like Road Warrior. If you like it, Mel Gibson plays Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior and Braveheart. Also in Gladiator with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen in Soldier. Antonio Banderas and Harrison Ford's "Blade Runner", "The Thirteenth Warrior".
