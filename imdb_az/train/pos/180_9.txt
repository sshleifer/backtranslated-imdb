When Gundam0079 turned into a movie trilogy, most of us are very familiar, many things were completely transparent and fewer. This is exactly the opposite of OVA. Although only half a dozen episodes, these are not emotionally charged with action. In addition, two major business segments are sufficient to provide me. After seeing a lot of gundam series, movies, and OVAs, I was totally ready for a civilian film. This movie did a wonderful job. What distinguishes this film shows that both sides of the war are good and evil people. The Zeons are more like human beings than the original films they describe as the second rise of the evil Nazi. Many people who do not like the anime I have to watch for this movie (lol) liked it. So, I would recommend only a few people to the anti-war story. If you are a fan of Gundam and you have not seen it, you do not have to read it; now you have to watch it now.
