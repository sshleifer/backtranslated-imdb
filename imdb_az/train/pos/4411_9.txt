We will continue to admire 10-9 of a film that she leads. But we look forward to this movie. Ang Lee looks at a relatively unexpected aspect of the civil war. The whole film is a good thing about the movie, it's not a "side" with its symbols. It creates characters, embodies life, problems and uncertainties ... and provides them with a reality that brings many people closer to home than comfort. There is a movement in this film, but it's not a lover of action since it's deeply disturbed by violence and from a distant place ... that is, it's a reality. As you might expect in one of the most terrible wars of humanity, violence is terrible. <br /> <br /> However, this is a study of the great human uncertainty in the civil war. Has there been a war on slavery and abolition? Lee seems very eager to disguise his popularity so popular in the lines of Blue and Gray. Neither did idealism nor wind. It's about your freedom, your desire for something and the desire to fight for it. While watching the characters, "How can you fight to protect slavery?" You will ask. In fact, I do not think they really are, and the film shows why a large number of people have been gathered during the Civil War. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characters we learn are struggling with the feeling of loyalty to the "home", although they regard what is represented in the home or their truths. The letter scenes are very moving and subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty that extend to restrictions. <br /> <br /> All of this is blended with Lee's beautiful engagement with the humanity's environment and its beautiful combination. frames. In his "art" of Europe, he has a style that unites Europe (a slow camera, unrushed) in his epic tale and in the development of his story, and can be easily and easily acquired for North Americans. /> <br /> Relax, what is a civil war, what is a "western" genre, what a war movie should be and how fragile a Angry world so <br /> So Lee, continues his work. Still, the film is a slow paced and clear "orientation" ... It's a sign that Lee can directly direct himself without the "story" on the story or on the screen. <br /> <br /> A movie for lovers of the film and for movie lovers, Jewel (yes, singer), has brought an actress who has made an incredible performance so far. standard Hollywood epics.
