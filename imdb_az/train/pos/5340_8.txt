Clara Lago is as beautiful as the title character of the film, a film about a Spanish / American girl traveling to Spain with her mother during the Spanish Civil War. Apparently, the mother is dying to go home, and she remains with her father. It also creates friendships and experiences in the short run. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is primarily concerned about her and then gets closer. The film is beautifully drawn, but on the contrary, it is washed in soft colors. Carol, you can feel the joy and love poem for a father who is a pilot in battle. Although the war itself is a rear seat in this movie, it puts the character's life to a dead end. I think you love it. Look especially for Clara Lago, who works like Carol. He is definitely watching.
