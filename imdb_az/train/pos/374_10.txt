Rating "10/10" Master piece <br /> <br /> Several years ago, I heard Spielberg repeat the movie and if it had a chance, he would do it again. Yes, Mr. Spielberg, I'm not perfect, but this movie - along with the Schindler list - is the best. Even Oprah is doing well in this business! <br /> <br /> What's happening to me is the reality of the story and drama. Things like this have happened and still happen in the world.
