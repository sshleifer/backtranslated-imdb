I'm sorry that nobody thinks about making a movie as before. As a rule, fear is often effective when using something unpleasant in real life. No one likes to go to a dentist (except for Steve Marty's Horror Store). <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, before using a dentist (see, for example, Marafan Mana), it brings terror to the suburbs. <br /> <br /> Lifestyle dentist Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) is mad. Now a dear doctor did not play with a full deck to get us started, but after jealousy and obsessive-compulsive illness, he was in danger to others. <br /> <br /> It is said that doctors who are dealing with mental illness believe that Michel Douglas is close to what we see in Falling Down. <br /> <br /> Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, who wrote and directed horror, are a great stream. <br /> <br /> Now I believe that this film will not work without Corbin Bernsen's fantastic performance. <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <BR> <br /> </ font> <br /> Bottomline of the TCC - An entertaining movie, which is a scene that can be shaken with Bernsen's great performance.
