I lost the number of research I wrote to Slaughter High. I have read a lot of bad and I'm going to say it's a fantastic movie now. Simon Scuddamore made his fame very soon for his well-known suicide, and although it was his only film, he made the movie so beautiful. At first I did not know anything about Simon, I read a suicide story. Then he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon was the most depraved character known to man, but his real life was strong and weak in his determination. He has done a good job, and who can be satisfied? I always wondered how it feels to be naked in the movie. To say the least it should have been quite embarrassing. I first saw this movie in the 6th grade at age 12. I agree with a number of indicators that the girl she was killed would not go into the bathroom, and there are no hammam baths in these schools! In my opinion, the 36-year-old Carolina Munro was another star of any glorious player and, unfortunately, did not create future films after Simon's death. The cause of his suicide is secret and hopes he will be discovered in the near future. While doing math on his web page, he tells Slaughter High at age 29. He seemed like a teenager. I gave this movie two thumbs up the best horror movie. Probably because of their terrible behavior, others could not win the film business. -Jacob Young
