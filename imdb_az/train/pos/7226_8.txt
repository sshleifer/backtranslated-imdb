There is some kind of cinematography from this era. It is clear that for the first time he would come to this world, but still a very good movie from start to finish. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York make the stage performance performable for both the silver screen and both. There is very little on the way to the story and this kind of off-beat character can be put on a little by the not familiar with the learning. Despite all this, Peter O'Toole and Susannah York drew a very good film.
