When I see this movie, I have not gone too fast for four hours. This film has always meant Hamleta to restore power and art. Even oh-such popular performances are carried out by new and inventive methods. And cast is incredible, Brannagh's most brilliant star. It is a movie that directs the character, strength and role of the film. Complete full and full version, fills a large number of holes, and allows for a new assessment of the tragedy despite the length. If you have to wait for a dark, caring castle, we invite you to a luxurious party for the eyes. Only darkness comes from Hamlet when it is needed. Allow four hours for your time.
