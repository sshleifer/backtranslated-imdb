<br/> <br/> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> This is a flat movie; They love everything that is given to one given animated film. It was a great shock that I liked that some parts (even fart jokes) were laughing loudly, there were many creative geniuses with their first movie, and even some jokes you needed. <br /> <br /> Simply, without bribes ["I'm paying for something?"]). <br /> <br /> There was a special note in the fart jokes, the jokes were only toilet sounds (in fact there were almost no noise / no images, the references were really incredibly), there was actually an installation / punchline and it was as if a good taste. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that my kids are more humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is so beautiful. <br /> What is Hmm? Music was not as creative as it was in the first or second movie, it was great fun for the children. There is no painful moment in blessing for me. It's a bit of a move but not a very scary thing (NIMH secrets gave me a smile for my kids, not sure that a G rating was appropriate for that) <br /> Generally, this is a movie for children of all ages, It's safe to watch% (I'm not trying to be too sensitive, but I had to squeeze and extinguish the television during a few movies with less than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room right now. I would like to say stick around in any case, you'll also find that you enjoy too :)
