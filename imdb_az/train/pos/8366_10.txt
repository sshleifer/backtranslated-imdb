From the very beginning, I knew that I would be in the best movie I've ever seen. The idea of ​​the giant robots of the two worlds controlled by brilliant people was a fight against each other in the world's control, the most intense and good idea of ​​the plot I live in. I can not begin to describe perfect actors and well-written scripts. We can only say that the bride combines the images of the Lord of the Rings. The Academy had great control over not celebrating joy ..... ROBOT JOX.
