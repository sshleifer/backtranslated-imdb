EXTREMITIES is still a riveting screen version of William Mastriosimone (adapting his own play to the screen) about a woman who was attacked by an attacker on his car in the night. he understood that he had taken his purse and knew where he lived. After staying at home the next day after leaving the room, the boy appears in his home and tries to harass him. At one point in the story, a woman gets a stunning twist when her tables are turned over and can be reversed; but when he realizes that it is impossible to put an end to the aggression and when a person is arrested, he will only be released and decide to keep him in prison until he can not confess himself. Flipped? Can be. Anxiety? Of course, there is a middle class claustrophobic feeling about this movie, especially with the woman and her aggressors. At the same time, you will not feel what you are feeling. I did not see the Broadway game, but I would like to imagine a piece of it, but it does not make a film that is less percussive. Farrah Fawcett, one of the latest Broadway actors, was rewarded with the role of Marjorie in the movie version and offers a feeling of being a victim and a profound move. Many critics have found Fawcett's performance a sign, but for me, Marjorie is a woman who completed her work and that performance was working for me. James Russo, in his career, is as vulnerable as the attacker who finds Marjorie more likely to be a problem than he or she thinks is. Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid co-star as Marjorie's roommates who came to her home after Marjorie's disappearance, and filled the fireplace that they closed after arriving. And because she did not see what Marjorie crossed, she came up with an unexpected level of story to come from her roommates and therefore she had to call the police and let the guy manage. Not for the sake of the weakness of the soul, but if you can stop it, you are experiencing a mysterious film that is surprised by the performance of an incredible lead.
