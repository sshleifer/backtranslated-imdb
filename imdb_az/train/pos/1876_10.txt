Adapting the book Finding Fish. This story is about a tough young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who describes the painful story of his past for psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Derek Luka's brilliant startup performance and Denzel Washington's always a striking performance. <br /> <br /> This movie was incredible at a very high level and I was disappointed that I did not win the Oscars, so I think it was released in a bad time, so it was ignored. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone, you will be touched by his story and really make the audience look sober with this young man, Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you want true stories inspiring, follow Antwone Fisher. <br /> Thank you
