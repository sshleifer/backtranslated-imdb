I like the movie. I love the two families who have historic ways. The only question is, if Sam is killed, how is his family line up? Did he not mention any other child that he should be related to Zeroni's son and Zero? Hmmmmmmmmm. Have you ever said no other child or spouse before the conversation with a teacher or love? Maybe Kate Bandit had a child before kissing? Even with the mistakes in the film. Just loved it. The player was very nice. The story is not where it is with Mr. Sir, where Marion is a woman, but his character is even funnier. Other "counseler" were a concern for the children, but of course not so much. The Poor Guard he had a very sad childhood to become so meaningful as he grew up.
