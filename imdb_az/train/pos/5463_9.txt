Very refreshing, very Pre-Hays Code and still very sassy. Even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck, I recommend watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a dosie in a rising floozy in the world, perfectly described by a bank building, she's funny, she's sexy, she's got a lot of work. John Wayne (in a suit) plays one of his first conquest. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a disappointment, but sets, lines, dresses are added to a heap of a film that rises horizontally.
