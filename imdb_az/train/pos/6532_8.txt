In my opinion, this is part of the film ... and actually targeting all Nancy Drew PC players. Recently, there were many movies based on video games, and I'm thinking of one of them. <br /> Thus, this movie does not follow any book. But some of the games are watching. I buy and play after every Nancy Drew game. And games are for HerInteractive and for girls who are not afraid of a mouse! And some of these games won Parents' Choice Gold Award. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> 10 years. playing a game of Nancy Drew the day before to see the old film, and playing the game I was delighted with was also very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I just did not like this movie, but I will not wait to go home again to finish the first game. <br /> <br /> My other step daughter is only 7, and she likes the movie still playing a little bit for the youth, but she's watching her sister play to see what's happening. <br /> Games are based on children aged 10 and above. . All games are usually classified as highly guaranteed and adventurous games. For more information about games, just look at HerInterative Nancy Drew games. Personally, I thought the movie was pretty good and when I got out on DVD I would buy it.
