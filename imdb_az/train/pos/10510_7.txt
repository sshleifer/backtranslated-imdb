This is OK compatibility, but not as good as the TV version. Actors are generally good, but I've seen Jeremy Northam be more moist as compared to Mark Strong, especially as the television version of Mr Knightley. Gwyneth Paltrow is good and his English accent is pretty good, but I still chose Emma Kate Beckinsale. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson have excellent support. <br /> <br /> Comedy often sounds for laughs, although the book is a comedy, <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scene. It's very funny. England has never been. It looks like a chocolate box. <br /> <br /> Despite these criticisms, I'm very pleased with this movie, but I recommend the adaptation of the TV much more.
