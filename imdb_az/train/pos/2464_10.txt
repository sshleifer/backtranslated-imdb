One of the best movie dramas I've ever seen. We have many activities in the church and can be used as a resource that emphasizes all the good things that can be done by actors. Especially for those who are interested in actors, I recommend that you "see it". The recording has several scenes. The first was Hamlet Yorick's good relationship with the cemetery scene and skull where everyone faced with the scene. The logic used in this scene was enormous - I'm telling more than anything else about Sacharpara. For the second time, I love the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and Robin Williams have discussed the future duel of the character he plays.
