This is one of the best films I've ever seen. I feel very interconnected with the topic that is going to convey the film. A sentence from my mind, "history itself is repeated." Life is shown in the film: when people are young, they do not understand their parents and their spouse; People give every pretext that their dear days are not too late with their children; People always have to work hard to support the whole family, but they are indifferent to the subtle feelings of their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; People can always be pardoned when love for their hearts is full; There is nothing more important in this world of blood between people, and it will never be late for people to talk about what they feel at the bottom of their heart to achieve a better understanding among themselves. To end a day, people should not feel sad and regret because they keep their words, and always have hope - a new life. Actors and actresses are fantastic. They understood the director's intention. The charm of the film is that it affects the audience, bringing spectacular and beautiful mergers and tears.
