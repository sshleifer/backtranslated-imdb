Perfect. Initially I thought Amrita Pritam's communist infamy and Dr Dwivedi's nationalism would be more affectionate than the novel, but when I read the novel I was surprised to find it. <br /> <br /> Marita Prudama is the lack of a Kudos nickname and Dr. Dwivedi's objective. This film is sensitive to a sensitive topic. As some poets say, no war is a woman, and this film exposes her. It's a sad comment about Hindu psyche, because they can not stand up for their daughters kidnapped or Hindus, who can only burn their land. On the other hand, economic divorce behind the division or, in fact, why girls are abducted primarily. When the kidnapped were kidnapped, I thought that they would be the legal owners of the houses and thus become the new power. will not want them to return from their homes. This separation is a risk of every hit you are trying to come back after the two girls of the unmindful two worlds of unmindful girls around the world and insulted, so that Cubo and his Bhabhi characters dare courage. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <strong>
