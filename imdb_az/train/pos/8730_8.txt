Many of the American people would say ... to my opening statement. Yes, in my opinion, there is no doubt about the insult of Master Akira Kurosawa fans, but if you analyze it, I have a good idea. There is a peasant to the city looking for help against the grasshoppers who want to steal the village's product. The big difference is the way the story takes. Like their own samurai orchestra, circus demonstrators are a very complex mix of personalities, but ultimately the needs of the village, HEROES. Please find a movie that is trying to get the same magical effect from this amazing movie (The Seven Samurai, obviously) and watch the story and Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece. The 13th Warrior with a type Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton, copied the story to record the best seller, but he did not find the third leg of the cat.
