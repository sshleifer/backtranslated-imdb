I saw the perfect boy three times. I do not see this movie as a gay movie, even gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a gay character, so why not make sure every movie with a gay movie should be a gay movie. I find the film's death to be sympathetic to the death of someone who is close to you. Naturally, Theo quickly turns his life away from his rehabilitation and expects his brother to die before re-evaluating his life. Theo, Ryan, said he would be a very active father, at the scene, I found the dialogue. Ryan said he should not know what to see or share with anyone. Terrible and sad? I love the movie.
