Let us know that Gordon Gekko has been using Wall Street for the past 19 years. Now, Michael Douglas gets GG persona and secret service agent, Pete Garrison, morphs it. Why? Works! This is a solid political upheaval that protects me. It was interesting for the President and the First Lady to have a detailed study of the SS's security measures. All potentials were pretty good, but I can not try to think of Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. Jodie Foster just denied you, and if you really think that FBI agent Starling's "Lambs Silence", you will not feel the same as Longoria. Nevertheless, this is a fun movie, escapist fun with Beltway as a trash.
