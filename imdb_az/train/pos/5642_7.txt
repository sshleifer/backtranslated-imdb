(THE FIRST PARAGRAPH ADMINISTRATION) The idea of ​​this movie against Germany is now painful, but this is a striking example of a great propaganda during the great war. Cecil B. DeMille was withdrawn when he was still a great director. (Despite the Academy Award for Best Picture, he did not have a very good soundtrack). In this film, most of Pickford's other films have no comedy, and this is actually the film of DeMille, not Pickford. The deception of the Germans could be compared to the Patriot of 2000. The only good film in the film was a rebellious murderer who had received the ironic name of Austreheim. They even made a bad trip on a luxury ship, torpedoed by a Pickford German submarine. So will the Americans bring more war? Is it likened to the sinking of Lucia, or to America's favorite Canadian imports? Throughout the film, the hero of DeMille turns into a kind of terrible disaster, but goes to the right place to keep death from hypothermia, immorality, aggression, execution and explosion. The way to get rid of a shooting team is not as convincing as the people in Jurassic Park are eventually getting rid of the velociraptors. If I was more convinced of such propaganda, I would punish them for having German fathers, who are part of myself. <br /> <br /> Is there a good movie? Apart from a secret run on Americans living abroad, are they inviolable? Perhaps then was a joke? you can not have fun. You can find a little melodramatic and obviously one-sided, but the first thing that comes to mind is the propagandistic potential of the film, along with the movie language, before the misinterpretation of Potemkin's slaughter imagination. It surprised me: What happened to Cecil B. DeMille? With his voice coming out, he lost his longing for somewhere between the "greatest show on earth." Ben Hur looked expensive, but he was very ambitious. This movie in one sentence is 1) Movie History, 2) Silent Movie Buffs, 3) Mary Pickford fans, or 4) DeMille fans, if any.
