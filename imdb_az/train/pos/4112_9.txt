The heading is onomatopoe, a tram-raising sound on rails. It is metaphorical for everything that people in the pouring can not do. It explains the suffering of these people by the tram that represents the relatively poor life of the middle class. The tiny touch of a small child and his beloved but sad paternal father's path. It was the first color film of Kurosawa, and he used only beautiful shocking colors in the dreams. The film is superior to reality and beauty. Compassion for humanity is unfounded, but as always, Kurosawa is focused on the beauty of the film. This movie is a genius masterwork.
