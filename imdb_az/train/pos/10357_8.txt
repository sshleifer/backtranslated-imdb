It's hard for anyone to love this movie. Medium heroes, Lindy and Michael Couberlen, her daughter's Australian outback, are not bad guys during a night, but then, of course, the scores of people we've seen throughout this film would be worse, even worse. If the film wants to get rid of Chamberlains's innocence and guilty after the tragic anger of his life, there is little or too much of a sociological perspective related to film, gossip, newsletters, mobs, and assumptions. It is not a film about Australian degeneration society, especially; This is simply an account of the actual story that happened. <br /> <br /> People living in the Caucasus have a dog mixed with each other, though their lives do not grow stronger due to the majority of magazines, newspapers, and television programs, it turns the truth into a drama that causes consumers' anger, no sign of empathy or an outsider, a feeling of unknowingly affects the right and left, with the strongest hearings and vibes of those who cover life. <br /> <br /> The arguments against Lindy Chumbler were basically justified by his virtue. For the people's eyes, the baby's daughter's death did not seem to be confused enough. Why did he like to go head-to-head on television and the press? How could it prevent the downward spiral if it had more impact on public interest in the media? The greatest actress today, Meryl Streep, can not perform a distinctive performance, and there is no other actor or movie maker. But he and the screenwriters do not understand Lindy. What is confusing is that it is not difficult. Apparently, he is inclined to show the public's feelings in a natural way. <br /> <br /> When facing a spouse, he naturally has to show kindness to his condition. <br /> <br /> Sophie's choice is just as pleasing, or Satan is a victory in Prada, in America, in angels or in other things. When you intentionally deny yourself, it makes the audience more difficult. We do not know what his or her thoughts or feelings are, because it makes us angry. <br /> <br /> He married a clergyman and practiced a religion in both religions. a small minority and hence the most misleading definition. Initially, as they disappeared, they began to talk about murdering a daughter's daughter as part of the will of God. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are always on the screen, and they're all about the same thing, but the Australian public plays a real potential here. As a predefined spot for each area, director Fred Schepisi extends from the restaurant to the tennis chair up to the lounge to the party and the Lindy people get their passionate prognosis. <br /> <br /> This Golan -Globus docudrama is not particularly memorable. The atmosphere of the setting does not give rise to any unpleasant compensation for the performance of the product or the penis. But it is very successful as the indictment of collective consciousness of the public.
