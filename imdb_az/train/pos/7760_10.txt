Director Douglas Circus is still the father of all non-functional family films. This flattering, trashy epic is a work that perfectly integrates all elements of the Circus Prize and strategically places them in a movie. <br /> <br /> The "Wind" written by Dallas and Dynasty in the 1980s had a great impact because it was a long-term version of soaps at night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall plays New York City Secretary Lucy Moore, a beautiful and delicate, married oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is unaware of both, but is also fond of a quiet but sexy secretary. They all go back to Texas's Kyle family home, where they meet with white sisters Marylee (Dorothy Malone, Oscars winning turn). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly - from romance to shouting, this is a journey. Mitch does not just have the love of Mateus alone, as he struggles with his best friend's wife's feelings, because Marylee is trying to lie down with everyone. <br /> <br /> Kyle learns that she is not that powerful, but Lucy is pregnant. <br /> <br /> It's pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How do you like it? This film is one of Universal's most popular films and director Sirkin points out one of his best works. Some of the dialogue will be completely washed and visual metaphor is thrown in every way - the subject of the wind is great. Although Bacall Hudson is behind the top billing, it is great, though not completely utilized. Stack's Oscar loss reported that she had fallen. He considered this the best performance and was not happy to lose anything with his appearance. And as if he had a great performance like alcohol. What a stunning movie! This movie proves what I have been thinking for centuries - Circus is the master of classical melodrama. <br /> Where is Oscar? <br /> <br />
