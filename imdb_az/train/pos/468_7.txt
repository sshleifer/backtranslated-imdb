Vladimir Navokov's literary genius is still being screened and will be warned in many cultures. The director puts us in a survey of a censorship independent of the absorptive chaplinesque, the wife of Inspection by the story of Alexander. Nastasya is on a holiday in a marble colonnaded resort where a chess championship is hosted. He meets with Iskander, taking a queen piece falling from his coat pocket. The magnet charm that he proposed one day ago is evolving, and his mother's telegraphs alarmed her husband. When he came and asked Alexander Alexander, we can get this fadesi in the past. He is being wounded by school teachers and earns more than 10 years. Thinking Alexander reached the summit, abandoned him, but became a legend. Former teacher, trying to win the old opponent of Iskenderar, harms. In a serious chess game where the victory of the world chess champion is a way of immortality, the chess clock is tense and the match ends with the next day. That day Nastasian's wedding, the old teacher interrupts and Iskander is sent with a nervous breakdown. Nastasya finds strategies for the match and follows the movements by grooming his stomach and looking at her lover's clothes. Unfortunately, although the movie is shifted from Russian roots, its low-backed dresses are beautiful, and Alexander sublimely plays his role. The director appreciates the audience, and we are hardly starting to play, and the only sign of Luzin's Defense is isolation after the queen trade. Your opponents, 3 pedestrians and King King, sacrifice the castle for the mate. Nastasya is a great match, but I feel the result is more intense, but the emotions in chess checks were more known to her. Luzin's defense gracefully gives Navokov's pride, the complexity of his work in his paintings is a world event that should not be missed.
