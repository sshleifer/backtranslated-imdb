A very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. Very dark tension / Who really was seen - it was recommended by Stephen King. Thurman is a strong, well-thought-out horror about a devout person in Texas, but a demented man, who continues to kill the devil to try to control mankind after God's commandments. Evaluates your coins in several consecutive curls and over-finals. <br /> <br /> Chief Paxton, the unhappy man, is the Hand of God's Clay. Matthew McConaughey is equally influenced by this story as the eldest son of a demented man who ends up telling a Dallas FBI Agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as usual, is solid and flawless. Suspense white knuckler! Be advised.
