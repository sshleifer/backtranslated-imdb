"Broken Bow" returns us to the place where it started again. 150 years in our future, Kirk, Spock and McCoy 100 years ago. This part of the Star Trek franchise is my first stoppage from TOS for returning the feelings of excitement, excitement and excitement of "no one's going to the place before". Scott Bakula acts as the premier first "Star Ship Enterprise" captain, Jonathan Archer. He and all the railways truly show genuine respect for the Star Trek heritage. John Billingsley, alien Dr. Brilliant as Phlox, Jolene Blalock is just as charming, but unreasonable as Vulcan scientist T'Pol. Broken Bow is in my opinion Treks is the best starting episode of any of them, and I believe Gene Roddenberry will definitely be proud of it.
