This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film that describes Muslims as PEOPLE, there is no stereotype here. This movie is directed by the story, acting and, first of all, cultural approval and discovery. They may seem like clich√©s, but at least in this movie. The Mecca's largest mosque is rich, and a part of the Muslim world is unclear to the audience, rarely in the West. Here people care, supportive, devout, tolerant and respect each other. They are delighted with the usual negative images of the Arabs and have passed through them without delay. Outstanding movie.
