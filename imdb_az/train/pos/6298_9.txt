Great fun. I went with eight friends on the sneak preview of this movie. We came to see a different meeting, but after 10 minutes, we were wondering what we came up to this time, the jokes were funny and funny throughout the movie. In the first part, they only ask themselves "malinski" and "bellini" (they have more examples of this lingo) and repeat the same joke (with different turns), they are entertaining and entertaining. All the main characters searched for this malinski are even more sensitive to each other. Unfortunately, we did not know the name of this movie because half of the movie was over because we did not have any opening credits and we went to a secret eye, but we were confident that we had a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think half of them did not like it, and the other part loved the movie. If you love strange comic movies with great dialogue, you will love it. Apart from Clooney, this movie is better than the 5.6 IMDB rating I've written, but I'm sure it will go so much more when I see more ppl. 7.0 is acceptable, I'll give it from about 10 to 8 (10 to 10 after a few chess) <br />
