For me, this particular Christmas is something I like very much. In 1989, I managed to get two CDs that I found in my music album, gave it to one of my sisters and kept each other for myself. <br /> <br /> This is part of my family's Christmas tradition and, as I listened to, it's really possible to see the show again. </ P> <p> Other locations have been featured in the Muppet Show and come together in a very special way. A good connection between Denver and her fool's comrades, a good, attractive and entertaining show for all ages is here.
