Laputa: a bomb in the sky. How good would it be to write new posts and more like clean, fantastic and flying pirates! The art is absolutely beautiful and the soundtrack, which is repeatedly used again (I'm not sure I heard it), and it matches me with the most emotional response to any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, in this film, the woman leadership is absolutely awesome and Boy Pazu is a great role model - she lives! Area classic Miyazaki. I will not give it up, but the last is really great. I sort it out with Nausicaa and Spirited Away, Miyazaki's best three. Also, you may want to check out Howl's Moving Fortress (hopefully once in a year). If you like Miyazaki, check this out easily in America. Enjoy, Piper A
