From the beginning you see that it's a big comedy called "Open to the Scratches" on the right. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are such a comic team! The songs they sing together are pure fun. Kathryn Grayson is brilliant and really cute. Dean Stokwell is the smallest kid I've ever seen. If you love piano, you will be surprised by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first film to unite the animation with real actors and made a wonderful thing in an unforgettable dance. It's undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies.
