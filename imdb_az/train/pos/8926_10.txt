Terrence Malik and perhaps everyone except Tran Anh Hung is a cleaner movie than Claire Denis. As he said, I do not like my newest movie, Trouble Every Day, 2001, and it's one of my favorite films. The only thing here is here is little elliptic. Do not get me wrong, it's one of the best things to do with this movie, but Denis thinks it takes about a degree to get it, and as a result, the film is a misunderstanding and some basic point points should be clarified (the main character Not to go to South Korea to get a heart transplant, but to find out where he was, or why he was not there anywhere). Some of the other symbols seemed to be unnecessary and just as excuses to use as Denis still loved (Beatrice Dalle's character is a bit distracting for what you expect because you expect it to have a particular significance). Still, the movie is incredibly swallowed and cinematography is not amazing. This is definitely a masterpiece in his own way. At least Denis is "not better", and is even better, like Beau Travail. Claire Denis should be my favorite French director at this point, even better than Leos Carax. Also, I have to admit that South Korea is really a good thing to do with the movie "I'm missing it" (and, unlike some movies, I'm a big fan of this movie).
