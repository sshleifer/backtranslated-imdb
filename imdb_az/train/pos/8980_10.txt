I have to admit that I am a great admirer of Dandy Warhols, and that is why I watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Not only is this movie unusual compared to other modern touches, but it's about a page of the group's history (like Wilco's "I'm trying to break your heart"), but it's a long history of group history. In this film producer / producer Ondi Timoner has been closely following Brian Johnestown Massacre (BJM) and Dandy Warhols (DW) for over 8 years (1995-2003) and captures more than 1,500 hours of video, with 1:45 hours (future DVD broadcast is original more material than the film). The result is surprising - there is no fill - the film is 100% pure and true archive images that feel like moving through the bands all over the years. <br /> <br /> Both bands promised to "revolutionize" their musical structure at the start of their career and not sell their promises to the devil of the "record industry." The Dandy Warhols has signed a contract with the Capitol Records and has been relatively popular (especially in Europe) after an album, forgot Brian Jonestown Mass (along with self-destructing leader, Anton Newcombe) (at least as described in the movie). <br /> <br /> The first film, Anton Newcombe (for example, pleased by explaining the story of Anton Newcombe), follows the fall of Brian Jonestown Massacre. Danny Warhol's leader, Courtney Taylor, but after some ideas, I realized that something was wrong with this movie. <br /> First, Anton acts as a Newcombe missing person. The project began in 1995 as a documentary about a number of promising emerging groups. Here, Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (which did not have direct access to both sides in those years). It was Anton Newcombe, who drafted Dandy Warhol. Finally, she was dismissed as if she did not completely ignore her. Everyone talks about BJM, but does not participate in the discussion. I do not know when the last edit process of the group was started. There are both sides of the story, and we only have one here. Of course, Anton does not endorse the final result, and sees this movie as an act of betrayal with his old friends. <br /> <Second, the film is very biased by Dandy Warhols. Undoubtedly, the victory takes all this, but Courtney Taylor (DW leader) presents it (although it's a good choice - the view is closer) and the bands' past history is represented in an unequal way (BJM). Thirdly, the film is somewhat incomplete, what does it teach us? A critic said: "The film explores old questions: how much is it compatible with the genius of the world? Can it develop and can cope with it or self - <br /> <br /> No matter, it does not answer these questions! <br /> <br /> As long as it is a brighter, yet successful, self-confidence and a story of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician, The movie was entertaining - it's raw, it's fresh, it's stylish, it's just ... funny god damn, for at least DW or BJM fans. For the remainder of the rest - I do not know ...
