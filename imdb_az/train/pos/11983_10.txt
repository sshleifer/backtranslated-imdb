This show has a great story! This is very convincing! A man dies, and he alone does not care for his children; he calls his brother the best friend of the law, and many come later on the show. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, you can learn for yourself like a comedy, Nikki and Alex (I do not want to spoil you) and Mr. Kimmy Gibler! (DJ sidekick), but the kids are very nice. It took Mary Kate and Ashley first! And you also know Candace Cameron Burei from Stevens Punky Brewster demonstrations and it's so crooked! Jodie Sweetin plays her feelings as her boyfriend leaves middle-aged Stefi. Indeed, this is a very good show!
