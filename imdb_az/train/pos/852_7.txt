The MATADOR hit-man movie lite is .... if you can tell about a hit-man movie. Violence is never really shown, but often presented. First of all, I was glad when I realized that in the mid 90's I was afraid of another retread of the gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy, but that was just a sweet and joking story about friendship. This movie does not have much to do, but every bit is looking at me. Three potentials have been the best chemistry presented by the big screen in recent years, and they appear to have taken a great time by bringing this movie together. Even though we feel that scenario is adapted from the scene play because of certain dialog scenes, the writing is very sharp. Perhaps I do not remember it for a long time, but it's a good movie that thinks it's full of joy. Good movie.
