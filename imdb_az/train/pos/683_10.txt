I love Ghost stories. Bumps in the night, good ghost stories, unexplained voices. Now I've seen many of them. As special efx, as writers and directors have to use their heads to create really good ghost stories, when you have to turn the clock back to find a real gem several times, as it is more involved in daytime movies. Now, this is a very rare, pilot episode for Ghost Story, the TV series "Next Home", one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972 ... I was only 9. With all the remake happening in Hollywood, some have to do "like" the original with the special efx. This episode was as creepy as hell. Finally I am very lucky to find DVD today and it is very rare and hard to find. Even the only 2 Ghost Stories for the approach were ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott "The Changling". No one would have made more fantasy stories like this.
