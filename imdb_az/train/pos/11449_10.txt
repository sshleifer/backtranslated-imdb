It has been one of the most beautiful portraits of a man I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is an inexhaustible man. he looks at the earth and nature with surprise and respectfully in a good sense. its blandness, honesty and kindness, and watch it with its unique, realistic art. I was impressed with patience, how they created their works, and patiently accepted their endings. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish humor insightfully fills his frustration. The film is filmed with jokes and is in the same flow of Goldsworthy art. combines nature and art with as little as it can. Fred Frithin's account mixes everything together without interfering with the natural sound, and is quite a member. this is generally a great piece of work in all respects. There is no limit to age.
