My 3 year old loved him. I loved it, my spouse loved it. So 10 to 10 of our family. When it comes to the level of violence? Indeed, this is not a violent act, often a slippery stick. <br /> <br /> This movie should really accept the views of CG films, because it's really good for kids. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics do not try to do with the depth, depth and depth, but create an artistic integrity. <br /> <br /> Unlike most modern CG movies, characteristic modeling is not recurring, but sweet. artistic whole. Faces may seem less drunk than some other movies, but characters are more like a puppet. <br /> <br /> The spouse or the son has no identity card. . Celebrate Lian-Chu's start-ups when fighting a giant slug; <br /> <br /> Gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and they all have a wide range of clothing that can stop the film to admire me. <br /> <br /> Setting. It is far from automobiles and even from Wallen. Space has been done many times, but Dragon Hunters's fantasy is compared with some scenes in the never-ending Story and Lord of the Rings, yet it is an artistic whole and is thrown out of very good ideas. When you look at all the gates or walls through the magnificent vistas as the scene in Monsters Inc., when you see huge garbage towers in this movie, everything is great but never lives; this whole way is just the background! Places to go in the break. Chinese wall, floating islands in the sky. Brokoli in the sky? <br /> <br /> I believe that CG believes in going, doing something breathing, and repeating it. <br /> <br /> Sound is good, music is diverse, not just epic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the feature films, Sometimes it is not realistic, but 3D models are also not realistic. <br /> <br /> Characterization is also good. Elegant and uncertain giant Lian-Chu gradually relies on smaller Zoenin's attention. <br /> <br /> If Zoe really does not change, Lian-Chu's smart manager Gvizdo wants to sell himself, but at least he wants to change this cute boy anyway? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br / > <br /> This story basically reminds the never-ending Heka, especially the world. Monsters are pretty standard tariffs, with the exception of speedy arrivals. Wall E, which is a really powerful part of the film, has no emotional effect, but it's a more fun picnic and repeats the scene of a tremendous music scene in the previous class and moves on the first stage. This movie is an entertaining and exciting time you want to watch. <br /> <br /> The whole movie talked about a vision that seems to have been persecuted all over the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, this situation is more than ready for adventures, and I can hope for that. <br /> <br /> Let's note on the one hand that Lian-Chu and French actor Jean Reno sounded a bit. First, but not my darling, though it's one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I did not hear the sound of this new to hear it. <br /> <br /> I value it to a maximum extent; I was surprised at the average and low rates of some; I tried to solve some of the concerns that the two assessments have voted for at least. Take this movie as an adventure and a different European movie, not against Hollywood.
