It's always sad when films like "Fringe" are inevitable by most filmmaking. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, as Alex, is convincing, as always. This beautiful player seems to have a special ability to drive the characters, despite their flaws, and we have not always considered the lifestyle of the heroes we play, but we are afraid of the confusion and confusion The episode, Panic, is primarily paradoxical and does not mean that there is no open emotion.Someone says Alex is rarely frustrated with a doctor, but when this story emerges, it is not the power and indifference behind the existence of man, anger and hopelessness are increasingly clear. <br /> <br /> A few other times, Fargo reminds us of another powerful film based on both the "Fargo" and the "Panic" as an average man, he was able to unite with the rest of his life <br /> <br /> <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> </ span> <br /> < Alex Alex - office. Naturally, this union is less coincidental, more destiny. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < Sar> Waiting for such films is an elegant and convincing way to respond to critics who question Neve Campbell's abilities. Often, she is the characters she has performed, her weaknesses do not have the depth to knock Campbell's acting muscles. <br /> <br /> In the world of a perfect movie, there will be no more movies like Panik, but will be accepted and appreciated by them. wider audience. If you watch movies for the sake of depth and characteristic, not just the most modern special effects, you can not accept the "Panic" for you. A +.
