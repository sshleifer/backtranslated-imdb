I read the majority of what is written here and I can say that most of these posters cause great problems in their lives. This show was fun to play, unlike most games. Mr. Shatner, ALL the glass he has given to everyone has hit the show again. It is a bubbly personality that shines like a beacon that goes no further. She is entertaining and smiling, and the show is exactly what it is. Dancers and questions are only added to round-trips about fashion. Although it's a great deal to call, it's fun. There are many stress-free pressures available here. Several people posting complaints have complained about how long they have been waiting for dancers and chosen questions, and & c, Millionaire does not have the time to spend. All of us can say that most have missed the whole concept. Here is the idea FUN and provide yourself. There is something for everyone. Shocking, shrill to test your knowledge, eye desserts (dancers), nice funny personalities of Mr. Shatner ... well, then I feel bad for you; and if this is not enough, it will be Rich! I do not really care about the show. I hate the show, because it's NOT ALL in any of the games and is sincere, it really liked it and really missed it myself. The only game I did not like was Match Game.
