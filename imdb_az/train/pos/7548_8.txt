Short but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild trip to watch. One day, I was just looking at the anime section from my On-demand list and I met her and decided to follow her. I spent all the time sitting mainly with jaw agape. All the time I was thinking was empty, or "HELP!" He shouted. But I did not. <br /> <br /> According to some information, it is very artistic, singular and dark. <br /> <br /> A young boy - a good cats - is a man who goes to seek out the soul of his brother. In the first part, the patient lies in the bed and will soon visit some kind of ugly rim. His spirit is divided into half. <br /> <br /> Some of the films were a little bit defeat for me. Waiting for my return, and maybe their world is slowly falling apart? Perhaps his lack of heart is the answer behind it because the rest of the film contains various stages of the world. First, there is a huge flood, then dries out in a bare outdoors, and then everything is frozen. See what God or destiny is. Then I believe that his brother's spirit is in orange flower. The whole world will then disappear. Haha, I could not get it completely, but it always sends me down to the waist. <br /> <br /> Despite the seemingly occasional scenes, I am convinced that there is a deep message behind it, and some studies are enough to watch it. Personally, I like things like this and I would like to spend time understanding it. For some people, it's probably not their cup of tea. It's pretty worrying, so if you want a straight forward anime, this is not a movie for you. But if you have an open mind, I love this movie.
