The Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen meet with the demons in the '70s' of the 60s / early morning, most of the troupe 'The Sentinel'. Of course, it's good (despite ). As a rule, it combines the best elements of these films and is a good measure for Polanski's "Tenant" (coming out of the same year) on a single tap. A model of a New York model lawyer who is unable to commit a spouse remains in a mossy home that looks like a perfect place first and foremost; a neighbor's old shirt (gorgeous Burgess Meredith), plus other central tenants. When awakened from his apartment, he soon discovered that he was a deaf priest and that he was the only resident of a non-inhabited building. From there, director Michael Winner ("Deathly Asked") has started to gear this supernatural tuneup and has a devilish glimpse against his hallucinogenic tortures. The help of a brilliant ensemble, a delicate story and the perfect makeup made by Dick Smith, supported by the FX ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a real creepy horror.
