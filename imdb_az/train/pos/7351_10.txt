This is one of my favorite Govinda films and is the best film of 1994. David Dhawan is doing a great job in managing this movie, he is funny and adds family drama. Govinda is as beautiful as Raja Babu and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor hates an actress, this film is a bit frustrating, but still shattered in some scenes. Kader Khan is a maestro in the actor and still gives a great performance. Aroona gives Iran a wonderful and excellent performance as a mother. Shakti Kapoor, Nandu shine as sidekick. This movie has comedy, action, family drama, and romantic audience.
