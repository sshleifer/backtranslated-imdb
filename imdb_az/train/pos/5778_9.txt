Despite budget constraints, this is a great movie, effort and imagination can result in lack of cash. The opening, a beautiful red sweater, shows how some dinosaurs in the cave paintings survive at least the age of a person. After that, a meteor is dropped into a lake and creates heat, causing insects of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps cave images show that this is not the case before). When the historic animal is seen, Plesiosaur, mobilized in a good way, is soon to be lost in the local area. Alright, namely Jurassic Park, but still the original entertainment for fans of monster movies.
