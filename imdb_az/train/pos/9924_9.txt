Ah, Domino is actually a fresh air in the world of cinema. Due to the complicated structure, different characters and intense camera effects, I was very pleased with the movie. I have seen some complaints about camera work, and in fact, for the creator themselves, naked and wild shoots were all the mistakes made over time. Everything you see was the desired effect. Perhaps some people complain because something like this has never been done before, though this is separate. What you are looking at is a deeper look, he says, that he sees Domino's eyes in his eyes and thinks about it. <br /> <br /> As for the story, I do not see anything bad about it. For some, this "messi" is, in fact, a quick form of writing stories, despite nature. Indeed, the plot is not true, if you pay attention to what really happened. Maybe it's just me, because I like film, cinematography and so on. I look at many different aspects. I'm not just a translator or anything else but movies. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; I believe that the pencil is good, all of them are beautiful works that effectively describe their characters, a movie creates ladies and gentlemen, all heroes are very unique and witness to a small part of them, <br /> <br /> Those who want to burn and burn this movie may not see it as it is or just do not refer to it, no matter what, it's a great movie, of course, this is a great movie era.
