Acidic, unremitting and beautiful, John Schlesinger's masterpiece 35 years ago, American life was much more dissatisfied. The film has probably resulted in many events that took place in the late 1960s: the end of the Greater West, the intensification of war in Vietnam, and the collision of social ideals. 'Midnight Cowboy' is known as the Oscar-winning film to win the 'X' rating, but there's more behind her fame; as well as a work of art. This film (from James Leo Herlihy's novel) tells much about the erosion of American life and goes beyond the policy of the 60s who are dealing with hidden friendships and dealing with issues that are familiar to people at all times. <br /> <br /> A 28-year-old man who was the focus of the Midnight Cowboy, Joe Buck, was a physically active Texas native who played by Jon Voight. In the opening scenes, we watch Joe's bus trip to New York City. Here he is planning to use one of his few talents - the ability to make women happy and to win his wealth as a hustler. At the time of her arrival, Joe was a laughing figure in sex trafficking. Cowboy duck was thrown out and the young Texan, who was declared as "one hell of hell," made early recommendations before co-operating with Enrico Ratzo 'Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a sick man and small thief. Ratso, short, tender and tender, shows little money for Joe. They quickly run away from the money, and when life is getting worse in the winter, Joe and Ratso are shaking in their flats in Manhattan, charged with a dollar or square meal. <br /> <br /> In the film, Joe has developed strong friendships in the previous years, including Texasa, relying on one another despite her life. Granny Sally (Ruth White), who serves as a trustee; his "Crazy" Annie (Jennifer Salt), a relationship with a notorious local girl; and a traumatic event that has been attacked by the people of the city who want to disrupt the love affair of Joe and Annie. Often, 'Midnight Cowboy' poems combine direct flashbacks, imaginary followers, and psychedelic imagery to illuminate key characters while distracting followers. There are more questions about Joe and Ratso's life to get their insight into their lives. Both do not cause doubts; Ratso does not have the clear direction until the disease gets tired, and Joe finally feels that he has the goal of being alive. <br /> <br /> Although Joe and Ratso need some luck, the direction of John Schlesinger is explicitly described and used impeccably. Waldo Salt's scenario that allows Voight and Hoffman to develop. Their mutual relationships are extremely natural, and the supporting castle, Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro and Andy Warhol, members of the clause, presents itself as a key part of the story. <br /> <br /> The flashback sequence associated with VOICE, Ruth White, and Jennifer Salt is particularly effective in dealing with the loss of time. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in the Psychedelic era is advised to watch this movie. Adam Holens' perfect kinematography (Fly, Fly, Duman) by Hugh Robertson ('Shaft') and edited. Midnight Cowboy's visuals work with his soundtrack (John Barry), which has the ability to feature music videos over the past few years, sometimes as a single unit. The part of the device is used by Nilsson as a temporary way of editing, in fact. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Two disk collections called "Midnight Cowboy" have features and comments spread by MGM / UA. Also available is the 1998 DVD disc (available for viewing at this time), which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound enhancement; three-language subtitles and closed header; French 'dubbed'; a theater re-launched trailer (not as "original" as advertising); and an eight-page production guide. Both DVDs reflect their original glow, along with the 25th anniversary of the movie. Three Oscins (Best Picture, Schlesinger, Waldo Salt) and additional candidates (Voight, Hoffman, Sylvia Miles, Hugh Robertson) will maintain their place in the list of immortal classics worthy of 'Midnight Cowboy'. 4 ½ ½
