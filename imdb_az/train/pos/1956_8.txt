Indeed, I think that this movie is a really easy target than a really bad film. In fact, the film is performed in a very good way and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit complicated, but it's a genre. The film has a noiric atmosphere centered around femme fatale. As with all the old noir classics, this has always been a rooted scenario, so you do not always know how to understand it, and if you are deeply thought and lengthened it may be a stretch. put all the pieces together. This is a genre. Generally, the scenario has quite a few surprises and does not want the audience to anticipate and, unfortunately, surprise the audience. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. <br /> <br /> The truth looks so beautiful, and he speaks in such a way as to put an end to the mysterious, sexy, and entertaining conversation of his dual friends. <br /> - He has to catch an interesting audience, "or is not it?" Two-hour question. In addition to a funny sketch and a fun performance by Dash, it is also effectively carried out from the creation of a dark and very striking and modern shooting atmosphere, along with straight lines of stone Stone's sexual curves. <br /> <br /> This film builds on something that is gimmicks in the first movie and makes it a bit more real. especially gender. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" where there is more physical treatment and is often used to make a better impact on the film's sexuality. It's still bouncing, but as it's first seen, shocking is not easy for the value and the buzz. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this movie is expected to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is also a fun movie. It can be an easy target, but why do you follow it: a nigir, femme-fatale, reptile, sexy, did-she-ya-didn't-o-dunnit, this (no purpose).
