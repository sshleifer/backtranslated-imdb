A fine storehouse in London, a millionaire, was put out of the owner's feet and soon married and lived in a villa in Clayton, England. Based on Robert Standish's book, this first settles the head of the executive head of the House of Homes and (almost instantly) with his brother, Ms. Elizabeth Taylor, who remembers Hitchhock's "Rebecca". his late, but under the thumb of his father's father. Taylor's last-minute replacement for patient Vivien Leigh looks gorgeous in his high fashion wardrobe and his performance is quite powerful; However, once Peter Finch began to give him a hard and crooked order. It is devoted to him, on the contrary, masochistic (it ends up feeling). Still, the movie offers many places for soap wonders for romantic drama, many travel, interpretive dance, elephant breaks and a perfect episode of tuberculosis! From ****
