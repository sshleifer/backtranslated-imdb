I'm an admirer of animal films. If you get a plot and put the animals as the main actors, you'll usually win me. Homeward Bound just did it. They took over a new spin in time. That was a complete success. It is an archetypal film. The clever and ridiculous group (shadow) is obi-wan, you have a pretty, but ambitious and invaluable chance to pampered and praised prissy prince. These three personalities are very good. I also like how Chance and Sassy brought such dynamic characters and did not delay it. Many say that they can not be a good movie because they have a lot of children's films. But forgetfulness should be a child's movie, and that's not the only thing that has to do with the emergency film. This is a good movie to watch when you're bored and just wants to watch a movie. This is a Disney movie that does not have an air budu movie that is a better area without these cartoons. Without a doubt, I would advise you to follow it.
