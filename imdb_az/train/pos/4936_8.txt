When it comes to an intense pneumonia (a variant of Bubonic TB), the US Public Security Service spokesman, Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), is well aware of the fact that she is in the immediate vicinity of the body. Unfortunately, it has been a tough one with killing, and there is a good chance that the killer will begin to spread, which leads to an epidemic. <br /> <br /> Catholic Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) has been listed as a murderer as soon as possible and protected from possible national disasters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite being a panic quality film on the Streets, <br /> <br /> This is not the best film director Elia Caza's, but a little embarrassing, saying that the genre from his non-gangster pushes medical disasters, police procedures, thieves, and even romance. Kazan is responsible for masterpieces such as Desire in Tram (1951), The Waterfront (1954) and East of East (1955). This film puts them ahead, but Kazan said he was already "untethered" by the studio. This can be very far from freedom, reporting for partial sprawl. The film is based in New Orleans, New York City, where the Boat is "a good city used to walk around day and night." He asked for the use of the environment. <br /> <br /> The boiler picks up Panik's genres well in the streets, but they can join each other. better. The film used only one or two moods. In terms of adjustment, sprawl was still working. Part of the dilemma was Panic writers Edna and Edwards Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Cold like some". <br /> <br /> A gangster outfit that's going to end up in the tension zone with an extended chase scene close to the end of the film is likely to be emphasized. The boiler is not surprising that I do not believe that the oppressors are "more colorful" - there is no love for good guys at all, and I do not like the dangers. "A second, the only thing that draws close to the" panic "of the title is obla detection and watching, Although there are many tensions during these two "moods," most of the film is a simplest drama with a more typical pacing than this genre. <br /> <br /> All dialogue is very good. The difference in styles can hardly be expressed in a more precise way: it is intelligent, quick and well characterized by every character, conflict is not created by intelligent movements, but by actions such as actions and symbols, more than chess. <br /> <br /> When he / she has an unusual position that stops the arrest of newspapers such as Reed, he / she discusses other symbols <br /> <br /> In this regard, Kazan's "Alleviation, religion, ethics and middle class are killing us". This idea goes through the changes that are made to the film or with the commitments made by the heroes. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film, for example, include Blackie (Jack Palance, the first film), the "Be released free" card. beautiful, nothing is exceptional, but the real reasons for watching are scenes, interesting scenarios and a well-written dialogue.
