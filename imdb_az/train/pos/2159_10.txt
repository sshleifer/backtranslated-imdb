First, it is impossible for evolution to be good, because the Japanese society is very different from us and plays a major role in this film, as explained in the opening story. It adds humor to the film's warmth. There are different supporting characters / identities. Each of them has a good part of this movie. This film is full of rude comedy, like most of today's "gross-out comedies". But you still laugh with a loud voice. Reality, real life, who you work with or go to school, and so on. This movie really emphasizes and shows that people's natural benefits can overcome the minor differences. It should be noted that this is a great sub-plot and for many humor. This is actually a story about a story and dance that is a good thing. There are several backgrounds in the story, but in fact we support the main story. Truly a well-written movie. Dance is very great. In this aspect, I've been an admirer of any movie with any dance. However, this movie goes beyond the dance, in fact, this is a story and only about dance in society in Japan. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10.
