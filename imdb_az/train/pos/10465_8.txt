Even so early in his career, Capra was quite successful with the camera's work and time. It's a gentle story and sometimes pretty predictable - but it's a very good speeches and there are many complicated camera movements that attract the audience. <br /> <br /> However, since he is a good player, the first part is like a Cinderella story, although everyone with a brainchild will be able to get rich, "princess" and fast pace, easy to keep in clich√©s. Once you find a way to get married couple married, the movie becomes even more original. The latter is very much anticipated, but satisfactory. I also wish to write: very clever and entertaining.
