This is not an invisible look at the Holocaust, but a sincere event in a small street in Berlin and some of the events that took place. This film begins with the death of Ruth Weinstein's (Jutta Lampe) spouse and family members in New York City. Ruth's daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader), slowly learns to grow up in a woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), and she goes to Germany to find out about the 90-year-old Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lena was talking about Berlin in 1943, where she would capture all her Jewish spouses in a building on the Gestapo Rosenstrasse street Immigration to marry Aryan and within a few days she was shouting for a group of women outside and waiting for her release. Eight-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) waits for her mother to go out and has no place to go, but meets with 33-year-old Lena (Katja Riemann). Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Feifel) is also inside and works in the end <br /> <br /> This film focuses on Margarethe von Trotta, who has been filming his first feature film for almost a decade after working on television. one of its more provocative efforts remains one of Europe's most prominent directors. We see some serious treatments, but instead we think that there is something more about a small incident involving the lives and deaths of the population, it's not one of the filmmakers who see terrible actions against an unusual Jew. This film does not try to shock or shake the door, but just what it wants to light up a small, but real life event that occurs in a historic era. Part of the film's power comes from actors, and there are good performances that glimmering by Riemann and the young Lohde, and it's good to have Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) a key role. This is not something that will change your perspective on a major movie or World War II, but I believe that it is the cause of the death of innocent people because of the events that took place, and this is just enough to repeat this true story.
