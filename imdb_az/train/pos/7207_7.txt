I went to Deaththrap, waiting for a good entrepreneur and interesting thriller; and what this movie is about; I can not help but think that it is betrayal of a poor man. In 1972, the classic film is an inspiration for this film; in particular, not in terms of plot, but definitely in its implementation. Michael Caine's central role in justifying her is justified. The film is based on a play of Ira Levin, previously written by Rosemary's Baby and Stepford Women and focused on Sydney Bruhl; one of the best days behind a playwright. After the last game bombs Sydney feels down; This is not done during a game called Deaththrap; He was taught by an amateur and came to his door. Deaththrap is a guaranteed trade success, and Sydney soon begins to open its own area; <br /> <br /> <strong> The railroad as its job, invites an amateur writer, kills him, and then spends his time. Deatthrap falls down a key element and these characters. The film did not provide just one unpleasant character, and it is difficult to pay attention to the story, despite the fact that you are rooted in any of the players. This does not help the player. Michael Caine shows a good and entertaining performance as you expect, but no one is proud of it. Christopher Reeve is not unusual in his role, Dyan Cannon is distorted by a skilful, irritating irritating performance of a reputable character. The story is lucky because it's good; and is good enough to keep the movie. The plot has abundance and shifts; in some cases it is better than others, but always enough to ensure that the film is interesting. Director Sydney Lumet is also worthy of some credits because the style of the film is another great plus. The center is interesting and cinematography is well suited to the film. In general, I must admit that I use this movie; but it would be much better.
