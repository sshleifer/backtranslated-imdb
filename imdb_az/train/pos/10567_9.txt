A miracle. One of the best music. The three Busby Berkely numbers are amazing, but this movie is incredible, like a non-stop patter and a natural player of Cagney and Blondell. (Even if Keeler is not a great actress). Despite the fact that the structure of the film's prologue is quite historic, there is a freshness in the movie you have not seen today, usually less in stilted 30s.
