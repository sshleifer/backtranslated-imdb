VAN is a simple teensploitation, which gives you plenty of opportunities to laugh and cry for friends, especially for driving comfort. Danny Devito has a small and yet a lot of roles as a car wash manager, and the show almost steal! All the potential is good, the character complex and the picture is quite authoritative. A Crown International Release.
