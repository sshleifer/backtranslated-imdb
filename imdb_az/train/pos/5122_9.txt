Young Con dance to the discotheque, rock-n-roll and country in the trilogy of Travolta's triangle. Leads Houston to find work and love. It's Gilley's hot spot and it's time for mechanical bullshit. I would spend a bull in a Nashville club to get out. I recently saw this nearly forgotten movie on television and recalled how good it was in 1980. Like Travolta, I also wore a black cowboy hat. Debra Winger was at her head. It looks stunning on its red. There are many charisma. Bud and Sissy seem to be ideal couples even if they are refugees. They are divided because they feel good about each other. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. We hear Lyin 'Eyes by Eagles and watch for Love by Johnny Lee.
