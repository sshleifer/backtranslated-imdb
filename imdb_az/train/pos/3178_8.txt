Adam Jones's "Cross-eyed" movie, the main hero has taken control of the wheel and puts his life in order, the audience comes to a flock of firefighters. Adam Jones found a creative and fresh way to strengthen his character and make the most important thing happen. These truths make it clear that both the heroes and the viewers laugh and lend to them. Simple yet attractive settings \ costumes predict what you will see next. You can not help the smile and laugh at the antics in this movie. It is impossible to wait for his second-class effort. Jones is just one issue before rebounding. Bravo!
