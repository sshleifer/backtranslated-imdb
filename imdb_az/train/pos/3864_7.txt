This pretty badly-named western series won Emmy for the best syndicated software and, of course, an interesting set. It was made by the republican studio, which works better than anyone, and put all this in its hands. Each episode is built around the true history of the ancient western. Together with pirates of the 1920s and 1930s, a railroad detector called Matt Clark, later known as Elliot Ness, was able to deal with almost every single western intent between the mid-1800's and the WWI. The best act of the series was Jim Davis. Davis, a high, solid, healthy-looking, head-shaped figure, with great western vector and moving scenes, was a winter western hero. In the first season, two favorite and active co-stars, such as Mary Castle, Frankie, and the second one, like Christine Miller, "Jonesy". They worked well with Davis. <br /> <br /> He drew this show from his contemporaries, and most of the people later emptied into action scenes. Ace Movement Director William Witney directed 30 episodes. Franklin Adreon's rest. Both drew their eyebrows with lacquer. In order to issue orders, Series series and B stock charts have been widely maintained. The level of individual episodes has risen or diminished with the quality of the guests brought to the upgraded games. The best of them were Marie Windsor, Belle Starr, Jesse James like Lee Van Cleef, Frit Parker Grat Dalton, Jean Parker Cattle Kate, Joe Sawyer and Slim Pickins Butch Cassady and The Smilin Kid. Visitors coming from the West, Pickins, Parker, Denver Pyle, James Best and Richard Jaeckel did not miss their craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the second season, spectacular figures have turned into a dark darkness for everyone with the philosophy of history most dedicated. Nevertheless, some of the subsequent demonstrations were a match for the guests. Henri Brandon, the rustler Nate Champion and former Republican Don Barry, was a prominent small smuggler Milt Sharp. <br /> <br /> Western fans or historical buffs want to see it.
