The title has come to my attention, and since then I've seen a lot of super-human films since then, and wondered what will happen in the trick ... in fact I liked it because some unusual comic scenes I did not expect. Uma Thurman acted as G-Girl on average. Surprisingly, I could still watch her feet on the widescreen (like Kill Bill's). Luke Wilson played a fool of a rude person who was acquainted with a great woman, and I could really get into the situation. If you want a slight touch of fun, watch out for G-Girl and Mid Matt's adventures, especially to praise your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
