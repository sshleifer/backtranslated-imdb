There are a number of difficulties in the trial. <br /> <br /> The end of John Ford shows again in The Lady Eve in 1965. <br /> <br /> John Ford's end is on a hill in Henry Fonda and a great storm that is a symbol of the Civil War at a distance. It is moving towards history. The film is a feature film, but the idea of ​​Lincolna is very big. It's worth seeing again.
