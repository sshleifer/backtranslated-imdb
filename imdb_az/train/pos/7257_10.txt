This is because I know little about writing the screenplay and wanting to see the movie. Some manufacturers sold me without telling me. Since Alan Dobie is a friend of mine, I have not heard about it. I just wrote a project, so when I heard that it came to the ground, I realized. I asked Peter Collinson, my agent, to prepare another project. I also asked if I had lost my original script. It's too late for me. So, what can I do in my circumstances? I did not know what they did in the scenario. Then I was invited to see the movie. I was very sorry to be able to return my name quickly. A very humble draft of the first project has a beautifully prepared piece, I have been asking for more work; Maybe if that was not so good for me. If anyone knows where they are, would I want to see my original script again? I would like to see the movie again, just once I saw at a small theater theater in Soho.
