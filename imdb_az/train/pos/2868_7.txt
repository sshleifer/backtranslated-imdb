First of all, I do not spend the time watching Portuguese and Portuguese films, probably every year or even none ... <br /> <br /> And this is because the Portuguese people are terrifying national pictures, almost generalized idea of ​​approaching the worst! But in the last decade, Leão da Estrela and Costa do Castelo were one of the best in the world, with films like Pulsação Zero, or Pulsação Zero, Sorte Nula, and Fernando Fragata, as well as some actors and overall music. <br /> <br /> This is not the same as it is not a real comedy; In fact, there is an official drama, a drama of drama, some unexpected funny pieces, cartoon causes or hilarious happenings, just like a hypothetical journey to the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us a few times; actors are good, points like regular points; but it's true that all of this is meaningless, and we can think of it as a great act for national cinema, which seems to be beginning ashes from phoenix. <br /> <br /> The Portuguese movie, of course, can make a better choice, but a stills to measure.
