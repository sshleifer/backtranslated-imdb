This film would usually classify the worst movie production ever. Ever. But in my opinion, this is most interesting. Horrible scenes and scenarios make this movie priceless. The DVDs I bought were filmed in my local pyramid store. Some of my friends and some friends were watching this because they were so drunk. Soon it turned out to be a normal movie. Probably the last film of James Cahill is a priceless mold. At first we were shocked and screamed for DVDs, but in our abnormal situation, no one can be bothered. Instead, we watched the film on the right. Finally, when we're laughing for all wrong reasons soon, we've found that we can imagine a few laughs every few hours. Soon we showed all our other friends and they agreed, this is not a horrible film. It was really a movie that made you laugh. It was a movie that everyone could do. This was genius.
