The late, great Robert Bloch (PSYCHO author, for those who are not discriminated) has written this terrorist act, and this is one of the most scary movies I have ever seen as a child. (I was just walking to MILES to see a movie, and when I left the theater it was generally dark, a horror movie was always worrying, but especially when it was done). it's an opportunity to see a few years ago in a video clip (this should always be the latest breakthrough), and I was amazed at how good it was. Take the terrorist test: explain the night one by one, and then I'm not scared ...
