Reese Witherspooon's first film. I loved it. The area and the player were top hooks. You are emotionally involved with the characters. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you can see how successful Reese Witherspoo's actuarial career is. <br /> <br /> Other cast members also do great work. <br /> <br /> The film runs very well. There is no dull moment in all things. The man with the length of the moon is straight. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I think this movie is great. I've seen it many times and enjoyed it at every turn.
