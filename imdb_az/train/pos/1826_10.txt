I liked this movie when I was little. Today is one of my all-time favorite cartoons on 17th. Beautiful animation and seductive characters are just two of the favorite things about this movie. While many people do not like some of the songs, many have done well and have to go along with the story. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Charlie, who can not seem difficult to others, but ultimately will win you, is paying attention to the wonderful German compassion. <br /> <br /> Kiddie is not a movie. Often it is very dark and in fear. A treat for Don Blut supporters and animation enthusiasts. However, hold the required tissue. ADGTH cries me and will not do the same for movie sensitive ones. Temporarily one of the greatest Disney animated films of all time. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: It is a heavenly work.
