This show is awesome. Paul's two episodes were very sad; We actually cried. But other shows were awesome; Kerry was my favorite character as he was on the "dark side." I also thought that Bridget was laughable, because he was inclined to everything. And I thought that the guy playing Kyle was really cute. Kerry liked her when making sarcastic words about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute and Paul was really funny when he played John Ritter. All this full television show is laughable, and I wish to show it on television. They showed on television, though they watched it every time. Next time, I'll show it again and again.
