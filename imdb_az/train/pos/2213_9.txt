Wow, this movie was absolutely charming, and I started to delay watching it, but I'm still in the last vicinity, I did not see that there were a lot of good players, even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many more the actor and actress was more than at first glance at the other part of a society that did not know people and was not embarrassed to speak. I have never heard of any books or movies about this before and this is a matter where black history is never repeated, because they are an individual and mixed race, I love this movie
