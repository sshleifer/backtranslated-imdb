I'll be back to watch "Read My Lips" before me. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is the secretary of a company that is preparing large construction projects. He has, in fact, many important tasks, which are often not secretive, and he is skillful and ambitious. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Ex- con and general-layout Paul (Vincent Cassel). He is lying about his skills and can not actually demand any legal entity. After Paul's first serious misconceptions about Carla's self-interest, both become allies. A quirky friendship begins. The real Carla was breaking down his own selfish camp, which was under the weakness of Paul, in a great deal of contingent. <br /> <br /> Snow is almost deaf, without hearing aid. It is almost normal with him. He closes the hearing instrument to isolate unpleasant voices and teasing people. He is also very wrong. A heroic makeup effort was made to look straight, but she is really beautiful. No one has a friend. He expects a friend to get in touch (this is a French movie). In a worse and disgraceful way, he argues with a brother that he remains in a place where he and his wife are bound by a paramour on Carla's bed. Not nice. <br /> <br /> When Carla and Paul know each other better, the fascinous side is not the old felon, but the drowning in trouble. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that Polan has a relationship with his postponement officer who completes the basic plan correctly and has a great surprise ending. <br /> <br /> "Read my lips?" The famous Paul understands that Carla's lips are much more than just an entertaining hall, which seems to be the first time she has the ability to read. <br /> <br /> There is a caper developing. Good enough. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are the rogue couples of the real crime. He wants love, but he will accept it. He wants it, but business should come before erotic trauma. Together, Cassel and Devos are incredibly credible actors who demand an extraordinary offense. <br /> <br /> Sell or buy it, but if you use a good criminal wisdom, read "Read My Lips." <br /> <br /> 9/10
