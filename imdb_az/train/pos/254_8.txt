I am convinced that many people in Australia have never heard of Ned Kelly's legend. Once I saw a documentary about this man, but it's the only time I've ever seen or heard about him. And this can be the biggest problem facing the film. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Ned Kelly's life. An Irish immigrant lived in the north-west throughout his entire life, but never enjoyed by the authorities. The police always blame her for what she can think of and her family is surprised. When Kelly is fed up with everything, she and her brother are together with two men. They start to rob banks and even run the whole city for 3 days. All this violence leads to a human trafficking by police and is illegal when killing three policemen. Finally, they take a pub at Glenrowan, they have a party of all visitors, waiting for a full poetry of the police to get out of the part that police have broken down. But as someone warns himself, train is able to stand on time and what happens? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think that nobody really knows, because there will always be two camps for telling the truth: a camp is a hero, some are Robin Hood, and others are a common criminal, killer and thief. <br /> <br /> It really did not say which of them was true, maybe there are two, but I can tell you that the facts in the film were the same documentary. <br /> <br /> Once the movie I saw was a nice addition to the documentary, and I really liked the performances of all actors. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush are all very well-known actors, but even less-known actors also show that everyone knows how to look good. I really enjoyed this movie and I gave it 7.5 / 10
