This movie was very good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but it's love, determination, heart, and so on. It's a movie made to help you understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. brought with different talented actors and sports concepts. The area was incredible and I love the message. William Aziz and children put a big movie. <br /> <br /> Many sports movies take place around true stories or events and often do not work well. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has minor errors at 10 and 10, it is about 10 perfectly perfect. <br /> <br /> 10/10
