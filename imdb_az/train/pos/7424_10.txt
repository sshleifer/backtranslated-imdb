When I first saw the movie, I was 16 and always been my favorite. Of course, you can not deny Christofferson's appeal in the movie - HOW FINE IS THIS MAN! ???????????? Sheesh. It is still. She is a bad guy who wants to hide every woman. His actions are flawless. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ P> <p> In the GREAT and later years, I thought Steve was not the right person for physical beauty, although in most women, men have more problems for viewers. Our gals only look at Chris - of course, the children are interested in women's interests - my husband can not watch his b / c - he does not like his appearance. But it was so good that I just sat on the red Ferrari scene on the road that the camera work was perfect and I was totally spoiled by music, with my 50 "plasma - WOW !!!! And finally, the transfer quality was great movie - anamorphic wide screen and really great, with the exception of dark areas that are normally normal for all colorful films. <br /> <br /> I brought back some of my mother's great memories, and I love this movie for her Christmas, <br /> <br /> I tried to sit on the original with Judy Garland, but at first I guess that this one was visible and I could not go in the previous period, and it's time to watch the whole concert in version 76. <br /> < I work for comments by Br /> Streisand, but he himself and ongs, so far he has told about the scenes from Chris or the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Wendy
