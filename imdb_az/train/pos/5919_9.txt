Street Fight is a brilliant piece of bright satirical. This is not just a movie for entertainment. Although some funny noisy moments, it's not a casual experience. <br /> <br /> You just have to overcome this movie to avoid racism. This is not a single line of Paradise, but a surprising explanation of the prejudices of the Americans as well as the public. Each ethnic group depicted in the film is shown as funny cartoons of its stereotypes, which, in its turn, are dark caricatures of real people. <br /> <br /> With this magnificent exaggeration, the filmmaker shows how he really deceives these strongly convinced beliefs. <br /> <br /> If the American culture is still a person who is ready to accept the ugliness of the widespread prejudices, and if you are not afraid to look at your prejudices, this movie may be for you.
