Many films can be watched nearly 60 years later, and still work so hard. Technological advances do not come up with this classic love story. The special effects used for the 1946 film are remarkable. Acting is superior. David Niven, Kim Hunter and Roger Livesey, in particular, do a great job. Black and White / Color adds to the creative character of the movie. He has not been on TV for over 20 years, and he is aware of a small number of human beings. My favorite movie of all time. She has been waiting for the DVD's for many years and hopes for her, "Life and Death".
