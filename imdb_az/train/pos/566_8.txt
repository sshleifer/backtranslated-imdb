Strangely-interesting West, from a small number of filmmakers. As in the other Anthony Mann pictures, Far Country mixes a story of a deep boiling story, knowing an effective scene. Both of Mann's pekcadillas play honor, integrity, betrayal, and, of course, death! Story, Fortune hunting partners Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) are traveling with a herd of livestock in Oregon. They know the golden boom, they are planning to sell livestock in Klondike. As for the Skagway, the appointed referee, Mr. John McIntire, has prepared Webster's account to count Webster, for all the ways to be honest. In prison, Gannon takes the herd of his partners, but they return and take Dawson-Gannon and his men in hot pursuit to the Canadian border. Here beautiful women, a gentle and illegal city, will fill the fate of all the participants. <br /> <br /> From the start, it is interesting that the Far Country is in the tranquility of the characters waiting for the appearance of James Stewart and Mann's harsh Borden Chase script. William H. Daniels's cinematography is extremely superior, does not bring any benefits with current DVD pressures, and the film has a few surprises and "is it not?" Implementation of interactive audiences. Anthony Mann and James Stewart are an important consideration for the first timers entering the beautiful, but darker West world by giving dividends for the fans of the condensed genre. 8/10
