One of the latest musical music of the 60s. I was 7 years old when I first saw this movie and since then has always been a favorite. Music numbers are stunning. People who were filmed in the 1960s actually had musical talent (unlike the CERTAIN Academy award, located in a large city in the middle and middle east). All of the main roles are drawn in a beautiful way ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, Shani Wallis like Nani. Oliver Reed, the terrible Bill Sikes (thankfully, no music numbers, lol) and Dodger as Mark Lester Oliver and Jack Wild were also very large. Mark Lester comes across as Dickens's innocent waist when writing his book! Of course, there are many dancers who have children, "think about yourself", "I'll do something", "Who will buy" and "I'll be back too much"! This is a great show for the whole family.
