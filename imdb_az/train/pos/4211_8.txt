I watched this night on television (HBO). I must admit that the tension in this film has not been different from the films of the other FN era. I liked the chip for a moment, and the way to break the next moment. It was classic. Ahh yes. The dames, villians, cigars and thuggish cops! They all have. This movie gave me all the stuff. In particular, I liked the mixing of communism, which is quite common for this period of the film. In those days black list was popular, though very popular. I appreciate this movie as one of the best I've ever seen in FN!
