I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it is not a big hit in theaters. "October Sky" feels and looks oh familiar. And that's it. Controversies and emotions in all other fields and perhaps even better were studied. Despite the familiarity and resistance to Hollywood's all formulas, this movie is won every turn. <br /> Sputnik inspires this journey of your heart, soul and spirit. Steven Sondheim's music, MERRILY We WANT TO ROLL'S symbols, as they claim to start with their new generation ("What do you say? Do you say this a miracle"), and the Sputnik has a similar effect on young people. this is a real fairy tale of rocket boys. <br /> <br /> When the strange townspeople in the 1950s did not abolish the incident, Homer Hickham saw Sputnik as a ticket to life in the mines. <br /> <br /> Superior direction and cast rocket boy Homer and the pals are fresh and new. Specifically, Homer is a relatively young school teacher. Significant restriction reflects their sensitive relationships. The grandfather of the father / son, who made the film anchor, is also remarkable. We played a perfect place. Even Homer's mother takes the time without clich√© or intervention. Her husband is also good and resolute to her husband. Says Myrtle Beach. <br /> <br /> In the main hate that I hate, there's a movie next to this movie, so you'll love this movie or get your money back. Once, I agree with them. <br /> <br /> You will not see the October sky again. <br /> <br />
