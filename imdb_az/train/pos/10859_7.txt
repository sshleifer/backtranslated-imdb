This is a stylized look in Hong Kong's triad gangs so that the same name is not mixed with Resse Witherspoon high school. A new leader or 'chairman' has been elected for two years because of being elected by ancient traditions. Two candidates are tense to say the least of the bribes and latest scrap recordings through their position and ego. Without being overtaken by the story, and with all its brutal fame, it has been focused on a large cast without turning it into a turret. This is not the Asian cross, but in the gangster genre, it is a fun tension in the space that will put you on the edge of the seat and hit the violent. Subtitled volume 1 It is safe to say that when we go deeper into the dark world of the triangle and all of its low and unhealthy business opportunities, it will be there with other parts. In either case, this is a good start and a great movie, even if no sequel.
