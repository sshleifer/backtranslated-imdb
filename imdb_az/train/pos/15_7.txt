I think if a movie is magic, it does not need to be liquid or flawless. It can skip background information, go somewhere very fast, slow to others, etc. Magical in this movie: scene in the library. There are many small flaws in Stanley & Iris, but still do not reduce the overall positive effect of watching people help each other in the most seemingly lifeless areas of life. Both characters are smart. However, Stanley can not function enough to avoid reading; She can not read because she has exhibited so much in childhood. Iris, though well-educated, did not have enough adventure, and thus, he did not understand how to cross the past. Both their defects, their forces, and symbols praise each other. There may be an extension to accept that some years will work on a factory every year or that it will not hide enough illiteracy to work in a Stanley construction or that there is no better paid job. When they describe these "secrets" during the story, their journey seems somewhat thin. I think that no one has taken the time to reconsider the scenario. Do you even have a good movie? Just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton will do on the screen!
