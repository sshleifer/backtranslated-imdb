After seeing this movie, I feel a little more knowing about the United States. David Lynch is strangely shocked by the value and strangeness, and really these elements are not missing from Straight Story. But I did not witness Lynch before. We start with a simple family living in a calm, but we end with many absurdly interesting characters that are deep in their lives, which can not be understood by their application. How did it affect the bar scene and their present life and emotions, with two WWII veterans, especially about the events that took place fifty years ago? Do not look here if you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune. But if you are looking for real people with real stories, this is a movie for you.
