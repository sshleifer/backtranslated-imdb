This is one of those movies you watch after watching it and thinking it over and over in a few months. The player is great for playing two kids (usually I hate movies that are playing with sad kids). Bill Paxton is awesome, the most memorable line in his directing debut, "The game is over, man! The game is over!" Better than expected from the actor.

I'll wait for more movies "I'm sure for love!
