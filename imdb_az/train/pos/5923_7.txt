A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) has moved to a small town and a great mystery to a secondary schoolteacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationships, their lovely daughter (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and a paradise. <br /> <br /> Ok, technically, this is a "bad movie". But who cares? It is very entertaining! <br /> <br /> If possible, with corn cats, people are saddened by cat cats, have a bad linen, and lots of cheese to handle! <br /> So yes. You will enjoy it. Many. It will not bring you action, it will not touch you, scare you, or excite you in any way, but it will entertain you and laugh.
