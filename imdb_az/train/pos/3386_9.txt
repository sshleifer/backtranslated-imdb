Is this awaited for us? Hell, a multitude of ruthless outdoors, unwanted existence? <br /> <br /> The film is back twice in the 1973 issue, and it's a matter of time. Hopefully this world will not end ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie I love very much. Very unpleasant characters, a semi-apocalyptic imagination, an attractive and thoughtful story, and there was a mao-est match: Charlton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant, dirty feeling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is something in the hearts of heroes. One of my favorite actors is Charlton Heston IS Thorn. Man created the role of badass, but it was a difficult man. Undoubtedly, I could imagine myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is not right, and everyone around it does not hear it (rather than listening) or dead. Edward G. Robinson (in the latter film, RP) plays the beloved Sol Left that has this bad place. Everyone is something else, especially Leigh Taylor-Young, like Shirl, who is part of a "furniture" that comes to his apartment. <br /> <br /> Even 1973 is particularly effective. Soylent Green factory, futuristic flats, and especially the "spoons" (bulldozers that save people) were excellent. It looks disgusting and very bad outside contaminated air. <br /> <br /> One last note ends, even now that I'm shocked. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is a very uneasy feeling.
