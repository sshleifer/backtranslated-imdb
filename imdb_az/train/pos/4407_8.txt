For those who commented on the Patriot as accurately (mainly English), it was interesting to see this movie. According to all calculations, this was the bloody war that Americans never had, and they are a single nation. It was very striking to see something similar to the historic truth that the Atlantic did not portray as the city or the savior on that side. Despite all this, when the film is brought home, the real horrors of any conflict and how to deal with the war create only worse offenses that result in the sufferings of innocent people. It was not a surprise to anyone, but to both envy and hate it.
