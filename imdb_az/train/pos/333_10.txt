In all honesty, this series is a classic of true poem as well as for world literature (television). <br /> <br /> According to some information, this is a beautiful and respectful manifestation of one of the definitive texts of western culture. <br /> <br /> I was aggravated by Odysseus and his followers; The drama of the fall of Trojan (felt but invisible) touched; the gods were interested in the fate of death. (As you can see, the gods appear here are not ridiculous CGI creatures around wings of their ankle wing or bad fashion in bikinis, as they did in Homer's case, or they are rarely represented by classic sculptures). <br /> <br /> Not available on the DVD, taking into account the extremely low and surprising adaptations of the Odyssey DVDs.
