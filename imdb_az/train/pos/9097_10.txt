I made this movie a great constellation because it was really cute, it was really funny, it was all unpretentious. I saw this movie while playing in Philly, and it was the main purpose of a great night with friends. The film is well-written and well-behaved and is a film that does not go away from the movie, though it feels a bit like a sitcom. Now you do not find such comedies, it is not shocking to be funny for people here. The film is centered around a Ukrainian worker working for a young couple in need of help. Although initially helped, adds more madness to their lives soon, then bargained for couples. Things you need to see more and more come out of control! After leaving the theater, such a sadness laughed at me. This movie has made me a good mood. I will not wait for it to be released, because this movie should be in my collection.
