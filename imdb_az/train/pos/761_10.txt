I just like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin, Style Wars and so on. Among all the classic hip-hop movies I've seen ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best amongst others. When I ask other people what to do, BEAT STREET sounds most. But still its lowest rankings. 4.3 is a blow to "under the belt" (almost 5 points). I love music performance, breakdancing wants to spin me, RAMO wants to throw me a piece ... c'mon, its classic !!!
