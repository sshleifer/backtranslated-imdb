This film is surrounded by all the usual items of Dawid Dhawan comedy - heroes heroes, buffoonish-supporting characters, babies prepared for heroes, bad villains, wisecracks, sound soundtrack + choreography and all the non-continuous laughing circles. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both play a double role in the police and labor war. Policeman Amitabh's hero, Ramya Krishnan and Raveena against the police in Govinda. Heroes, as usual, are simply rouge-smothered requisites. Conmen has no heroes. Paresh Rawal goes on to DAUD (He played Don similar to KOOOOÅžURAT). Asrani lightly shines. <br /> <br /> Govinda is taken back to the famous Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer, as usual, flawless, elegant, a good police officer Pyaare Mohan and conservative Chhote Miyaan. In India, the Bihari style speaks with delightful results. Amitabh Bachchan, who believes or does not believe, is in the puddle. But the EU is still good. Madhuri Dixit is a community like himself in Mahna's song. He dances like a wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Sahin's music is awesome. <br /> <br /> Check out "Person Disco Mein Jaayen", "Mahna" and headline trail. <br /> <br /> Because it's a comedy, it's not a good idea to go for any LOGIC and to enjoy the scenario. Just enjoy yourself.
