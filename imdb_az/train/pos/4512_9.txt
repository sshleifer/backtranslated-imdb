Today I saw this movie and I should say that it was much better than it was expected a few hours before seeing it. Personally, I've been preoccupied with his language, but he has completely changed my mind. The film was often surprisingly good with great actor and actress performances. It was a story about a boy who made a dream and did everything to reach it. It really touched me as a movie based on a true story. A young, acquainted with a new school, a psychologist, and a new teacher, is something different and uncompromising to fight for things like that. He showed that he could make very little changes in some things and sometimes could affect difficult situations. And I think they've made the actor's choices perfect. In fact, someone was watching episodes like an outsider when it happened. Before praising this film, he did not seem to be invisible and real, there were some things and situations. The school principal fought with Fritsa aka. Martin, in front of the class, at the end of the movie. She was really badly beaten, but the only thing she brought to her was the blood flowing from her nose when she had some seams when Frits had some stitches ... Every movie had its own mistakes .. One day I could shop somewhere If I find this DVD, I'm sure I'm taking it with me.
