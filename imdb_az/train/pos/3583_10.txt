It was a great movie, but the worst I've ever seen! The actors were great and demonstrated beautiful talent. The whole story was wrapped and noticeable, which was fun. As the film is the best, it is judged as soon as the whole movie is over, which is terrible! Maybe it will eventually remove this bad end.
