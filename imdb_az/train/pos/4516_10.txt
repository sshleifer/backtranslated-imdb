Since Rita's Education, Julie Walters has been one of my role models and, as a woman helping her loved one, her essay is synonymous with her femininity. I would never believe his character in the hands of a small actress, but Walters brings it out with gusto and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance on the tip of the day.
