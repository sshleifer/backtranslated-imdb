When I first saw "a pain in the darkness," I did not know what my motive was. But when I saw it, I was shocked to describe it. When I was second in the Australian Cinema class, I had a second impression: communication issues. When a dingo caught a boy from Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), he and his wife, Michael Neal, could not understand how terrified they were. Like the Adventists of the Seven Days, they believed that God had deceived them and could not cry. <br /> <br /> <strong> Lindy himself believed he did not do it. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Carefully, the wrong message has been delivered to the public and people are against Lindsay. Although it was a pure accident, it still happened. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, it can be one of the biggest disasters in the media, regardless of political views of any media. <br /> <br /> As for the hints, Streep works very well with the Australian accent (not surprise), and Sam Neill is equal. Perhaps you will explode with what you see here. Surely one of the best films of Fred Schepisi.
