Kill Outfit (1980) is a mystery horror movie by Brian De Palma and really works. The atmosphere is right. Atmosphere horrified. And what a fear film does not need to do. Michael Cain, Dr. Like Robert Elliott, she flies in a mysterious, mysterious mystery. Kate Miller, like Angelina Dickkinson, is a sexually addictive adult woman. His son, Peter Peter, is gorgeous. Liz Blake's call girl like Nancy Allen is fantastic. Denis Franz plays her typical detective role. His Detective Marino is the most colorful in this film. There are so many creepy scenes in this movie. Elevator scene is one of them. Compare this and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. Some of these movies may also lead to sleepless nights.
