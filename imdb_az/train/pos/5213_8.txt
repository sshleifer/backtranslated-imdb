The first review I wrote for this IMDb was very naked with me, but I was glad to see this in the HBO and watch it. Richard Gere is great as an amusing agent / detective who ordered the job in this movie. I think the story is great, there is no dull scene that slows down the speed of the film. Some of the feelings associated with Demented Sex-Addicted are quite shocking, but if you have seen a movie like Se7en, you can make the scenes spectacular. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a good detective / tension movie, do not ignore the low price, this movie has fallen onto the IMDb and you can definitely watch it.
