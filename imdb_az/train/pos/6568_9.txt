When I left this movie I liked it as a child and it is still so far. A simple story of a kidnapping of a girl and a writer, which runs smoothly on paper. There are more prominent actors on the agenda. This should not give the audience a twist. Wayne Crawford stars like Jake Speed, the main character. Of course, it can shed some elements of romancing stone and shed Indiana Jones. But this movie is good enough to protect the basement. Many people are surprised to learn about this. It should be kept in theaters at '86 by other films. I watched him on cable television. It can be hard to find because both VHS and DVD have been printed. I could get a DVD from Ebay less than $ 8! Nice flick.
