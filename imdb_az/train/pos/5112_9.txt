In this movie there are all, action, fighting, dancing, bull shift, music, beautiful girls. This film is a true look at the United States. Believe me, I've been there in 1980. Many oil money, many women and many tonal tonks. Too bad, now all of them are gone. The film actually said another boy had met with a girl, that the boy had lost his daughter, that he would take the boy's daughter back but was taken back by actors and music. There is not a movie with the best music of this film and American graffiti. It's a movie that has been repeatedly watched and we're not tired of it. Every time I watch him, I'm still young, it's time to get out of the respectful tonight. The only reason I have just given a movie is that I do not think you need to rate it with 10 degrees, since you can not score a zero film.
