Soldier is not a big movie and everyone who hates him has very good reasons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Firstly, art direction is intensely and well-being. As science fiction backgrounds gradually increased, Soldier worked more than 90% of the genre. The sets, suits and details are all executed consistently and efficiently; I did not like their future military style, but I was amazed at my efforts. For me, it took time to watch this movie. <br /> Secondly, I am an admirer of Kurt Russell. I was watching this guy in one of the most memorable films in my youth ... Lean Shooter Executive and his John Carpenter films. Soldier is actually a motion picture and the role of Sergeant Todd is an important motion hero. This is not a prize-winning role, but Kurt gives a very convincing feeling to the dialog box. <br /> Thirdly, there are good choreography in battle scenes and battles. <br /> <br /> This is not iron monkey, not even a matrix, but once again, it is more than the average level in the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, and you go to sci-fi motion movies, if you choose to go to your selected rental warehouses. Just wait for the next Bladerunner.
