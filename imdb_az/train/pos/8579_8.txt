Assassination: A criminal lord, combining three different mafia to enter into an island, will serve as a money launderer for organized crime. To overcome it, the FBI is trying to attack one mafia lord. This thing goes wrong and joins some of the impossible fields and, alternatively, we present it with another "police buddies" film that does not resemble one another ... a female FBI agent and another DEA agent <br /> It's so stupid to date. But the strength of the movie is not a lie in his story - it's a good joke. It's funny. (At least a synchronized German version). The action is also good with a weapon shot and a memorable scene of a rocket launcher. But the focus is on humor. It is not smart satire, it does not slide too much, but there are many funny jokes in place. <br /> <br /> However, this film is against the political amendment. The use of legal drugs is demonstrated prominently in the face of criticism, even when it is cool. This is part of the film that seriously disturbs me and, in my opinion, it is inconvenient for children. <br /> <br /> All this is perfect for watching a good evening with some funny jokes to make a good move. Remember: When you enter the cinema / television room in this genre, it is often common to spread your brain inside the door. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
