It's not the worst movie, but the actor's skepticism and scenario and director are not that smart. <br /> <br /> This is not the best movie, the actors are not perfect, and the script and the director are not brilliant. <br /> <br /> It falls somewhere in the middle. Have fun together. <br /> <br /> In short, somewhere good, well-built. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> No one should say "do not take seriously" or "worse than good" or "no scary". None of these comments are relevant. <br /> <br /> There is a criminal atmosphere. This is actually a very unique atmosphere and really a genuine feature of the film, the one who made the film for me.
