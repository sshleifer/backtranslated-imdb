I remember that the zombie was killed two times and returned. I gave this movie on 8th. Come face-to-face with the nation, other reviewers say so, that's a "necessary-glass" film. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to the reception of the whole film. Todd Sheets The fact that more than 700 zombies appear in this movie respects his talents. Yes, there are holes in the story, yes, we see the same zombie again and again, but who really cares? What you can do for this is a fun and funny horror movie, share with your buddies, or look at people who really care about LOL. Throw people down, instead, I think you like dumps like "Titanic" or "Twister." To support the peace and independent film!
