She has been involved in this movie by a friend and has doubts about a subtitled Swedish movie. But I enjoyed every minute of this wonderful movie. Undoubtedly, man's unmarried aggression has been described as uncertain, without great visions - animal lovers may be able to maintain their eyes for a few seconds in the first 10 minutes. The story of a cruelty and hopefulness against the most cruelty tragedy has been described with pleasure in a new way, using the spectrum of characters with many natural defects and features. I especially liked how the film solves many aspects of the hypocritical human behavior, which is related to bias, discrimination, and guilty verbs. An absolute boat of a film that will support everyone who will listen.
