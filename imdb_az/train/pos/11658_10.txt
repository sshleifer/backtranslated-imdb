The first animated film from Ireland is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film's structure is Kellsin Abbotu, a village in a village. <P style = "text-align: justify; Ireland builds a wall around the city and should not attack any of the Vikings to attack the city, his brother Brendon, a young man doing the best of his ability to meet his dreams all the time When the legendary light of the island comes from a ruined monastery, Brendon is dragging him and his warm personality, suggesting his uncle's illumination to Aiden Brendon, to help him work in his great book, which saved him from the destroyed monastery. He goes to the woods to get material for him, and at the edge of the walls, he meets a friend of the forest, Ashley, who, unfortunately, finds Abbott out of the wall and is hell to pay. <br /> <br /> You've forgotten what you think about this movie, even though I'm telling you this movie is not fair - it's a very simple story. This is a beautiful film that seeks to find your way around the world, from the devils and the beauty of the world beyond the walls. <br /> <br /> His film accepts audiences as adults and has been rebuilt for a number of times, including a film dealing with her life. dark. There is death and destruction, joy and happiness. Not sugar. People die. Monsters are in ambush. (some of the children were shocked), but in the end there is hope. No doubt, in this film, darkness is no different from any subsequent American film. <br /> <br /> Forget the "sadness" in the Pixar movie, which is true and shows how it is renewed and even how Pixar is homogenized. <br /> <br /> His Genndy Tartakovsky-esquire (Samurai Jack) animated film Bach is actually based on Celtic's art of the time. A movie that looks different than any other. Here's another movie that pulls the movie square and uses it in every possible way. Images are designed to fill as many places as possible. Frequently, the film manipulated things to look like a page in the legendary Kells Book. <br /> <br /> Author Tomm Moore has created a movie with a work. I can not say more than that. Its a work. One of the best animated films ever encountered.
