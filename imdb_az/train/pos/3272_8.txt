I'm not surprised that the same filmmaker is a good movie, which is named "Candyman" and "Deathless Valentine". On the contrary, "Papierhaus" is a film that has never been heard, but has to be one of the best films of the late 1980s - partly in hands over the last decades as the worst movie ever. (Here I do not speak of Iran or Swedish "cinema"). The player is not brilliant, it is simply strange - unlike some people claim here (they should see a very nice "beautiful thing" like Anna). The story is an intriguing fantasy that does not end with a clever way of combining all the empty ends properly. These unanswered questions are likely to leave the target and leave the person's comments, and there is nothing wrong with a topic. "Pepperhaus" is an unusual blend of children's movies and horror, the effective use of sounds and music. It's not a normal, normal, but ultra-shy-but secretly-shiny social-outcast girl, not the typical movie clich√© of the central character; very fresh. I have been tired of my writers by predicting my children's books and screens, the childhood of their own accusations and, as if it were just like a childhood, closely followed by someone closer to follow or read, as if everything had a good potential or background. Anna's scene and boy were a little bit more "snogging" - a little bit too long - but also indefinite hate and fun entertaining emotions - given the likelihood that it would be only 11, but when Burke shot 13 or 14 films. I have no idea that the character has not raised the age or has taken a younger actress. It was quite clear that Burk was not young. Why did the filmmakers always transfer their children more than they played, so I slipped into realism, and I will never know.
