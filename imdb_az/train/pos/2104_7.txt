Who does not know Largo Vishin in the France-Belgium-Luxembourg trilateral (France, "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" three countries, massively released)? It must be adapted to the screens after 18 years after the first comic book to be adapted to some novels. <br /> <br /> Firstly, after a TV show did not try, the real thing started. <br /> <br /> First of all, most fans are not the aim of this movie, but the purpose of this film is not to seriously adapt the series of comic books. Some of the original parts, symbols and movements of the original are missing. The film itself presents an alternative and more up-to-date version of the series. Like the 1st class fan of the comic book, I must admit that it surprises me. Players are good, and may seem very fast, even if the scenario. So I would recommend this movie to everyone interested in financial / political excitement, but not for James Bond or Jason Bourne series to read it online.
