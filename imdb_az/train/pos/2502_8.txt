This movie surprised me! I have never heard of Hyde of Gackt, I did not expect much! The reason I want to watch this movie is that anyone in the film has serious action scenes in the style of John Woo. Usually I'm very careful when it is claimed! As for the movement, there was no director approaching his glitter, there is only one John Woo and the language today! I was even more convinced of having a "Month Child" vampire! How can you go wrong with vampires burning with guns? Promising and sounds cheerful! I saw the first thing about this movie, which was slow at this speed! It takes time to set the mood! This movie has beautiful Hong Kong style moving scenes! But the "Moon Child" is not the action movie! A drama about friendship and loyalty! Focus is based on characters and their attitude to each other! Pop performers Hyde and Gackt act well and act as friends! I only had a problem. Several times a few years before the movie tells you what's going on, and why the movie is waiting for you to skip it! Example: A member of the network dies (at a very dramatic moment) Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking the blood of one of the attackers! The film is nine to nine years without warning and explanation, and many friends are no longer in the same place! The Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) need to kill each other without a reason given! I know this is done to add drama drama! Because actors are very effective, but sometimes they are forced to do so! In addition to the flaws of this movie, this movie also has an ambiance and slickness that make it difficult to love this movie! It's hard to tell why this movie is so good! But only! The overall experience you get is hearty and sincere!
