If you enjoyed watching the movie night and watching the movie, understand that you understand the main element of the Vonngut article that Vonnegut is beyond his story, and the mind can not be put on the screen. Its white and humor can not be transcripted only by the scenario and even the best performance. I believe that this film is more than just asking Vonnegut's basic questions, but the frequent synthetic moments on the page do not appear on the screen. Does this mean that he left the film trail? Of course not. In my opinion, the film succeeds because it does not try to recreate the book reading experience (this is not a tool for those who are too lazy to open a page). It succeeds because it provides the basic elements of a story created by one of America's genuine treasures and provides them with an excuse. In other versions of Vonnegut's books, I saw that the director was obviously trying to sew the genius of Vonnegut and took his craft. If I did not put this movie in the best place I've ever seen, it's worth it to watch your own legs. If you're trying to get Vonnegut's "voice" in the movie's story, she will brightly explain the story of Mother Night and protect the story's main lesson with confusion, distraction or disappointment.
