Certainly one of the most witty and wrapped ones I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Michelle Caine were brilliant and took me all the job. <br /> <br /> A very elegant piece and requisites really give the process a sense of the atmosphere. Minimalist feeling works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that the film does not have a decent wide-screen edition of the movie. I have a full-screen version (I love enough to endure the full screen presentation), but it took my money off an excellent Deluxe or 'special' edition.
