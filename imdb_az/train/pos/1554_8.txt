I saw it in the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and intimidating scene is the time when the German army was attacked by a yellow butterfly for the first time. Germs and horses are covered with head-to-head (or tail) protective suits. Experienced British soldiers await gas masks (only) and one more gas cloud and German attackers. The clouds are getting closer, and finally, the British defenders. The Germans are slowly scaring in fearful-looking winters. Suddenly screaming from the guards ... This gas is different from what it once experienced. <br /> <br /> Now you will know that I remember this scene for the past 30+ years and still know it. Confusion, I think you will be!
