I knew the Bettye Page for a year now. From the 1950s its soft basic porn images have become iconographic and still have a strong contention. The Bettye Page view is still very popular in the world of hetero fetish and remains unchanged today. So, I watched this movie very familiarly. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <strong> All of them think so far. Mary Harron, in the 1950s, has done a great job of creating an atmosphere of sexual repression and hypocrisy in America, and, according to today's standards, it was extremely innocent. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol has done an excellent job of presenting all Bettie characters, I think innocent sexism and all its naivet√©. Bettie enjoyed the beautiful look, love of love, seeing nothing wrong with nakedness, and dressing your "foolish outfits" for the camera. The main thrilling sexuality and deeply feminine desires completely lost her. <br /> <br /> Today, he still does not understand what "all the emissions" are when it comes to his pictures or the content of their S & M. <br /> <br /> It's either uneducated or very simple. But I understand that he simply "does not go" to fetishism and will never be. There is no harm. The Bettie Page is just no matter who. The film attracted this beautiful style. <br /> <br /> The social environment written by Harron, born in 1950 and written by Guinevere Turner, really delights in the day and age I did. Hypocrisy and repression, combined with massive ignorance about our sexuality, all combined with a heart-storming world. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies were shot with the film "Bettie". <br /> <br /> This movie was sometimes slower, but Mrs. Harron tried and shot them well. I also recommend this film for those who do not know who Bettye Peyman is and who has little influence on American culture. For those who have this kind of interest, you need to see this movie.
