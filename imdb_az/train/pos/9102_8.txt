I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa film festival and this is one of the best I've seen this year. A movie with a great sound system (and I'm not one of the biggest TV screens) is always a movie experience, because the movie takes your eyes and ears onto you and tells you story <br /> it provides a series of characters that are directly related. Their stories hit certain points and most of the story lines reminded me of the great Robert Altman and his subtle movies. But the true protagonist of the film is, of course, the city of Madrid, which provides the background for the entire movie. <br /> <br /> There are places that involve shooting, paths, and paths of the film, and it attracts the background environment for all events. <br /> <br /> The film is again focused on certain topics (shoes), for example, Salazar's own metaphors are better understood by the audience as the film progresses. Combines city views with images of characters, and the sense of scene fits perfectly in sequence. A talented actor helps him portray different characters. An excellent example is Juacu's scene for Anita on the street for the first time. It will not work on a small screen, but I've easily given gas pressures on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The film's message is very positive and therefore the film is sometimes light and funny. <br /> <br /> The film's music usually opens with several instrumental pieces (I hope I'll put my hands on noise one day). <br /> <br /> Together, this film is a sensational feeling and I have not been easily affected (you need to look into my words). For this and more I give this movie 8/10.
