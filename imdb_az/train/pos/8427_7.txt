This is one of the most bizarre films of the Zat么ichi series, because it plays a very unusual pacing and Ichi. Interestingly, this is the first Zat么ichi film produced by Shintaro Katsu's new production company. Now, Katsu is responsible for filmmaking only where the bristle plays. It can easily tell that this movie looks different in style in the previous 15 films. As for the two roles, the film is very different because it's not in the usual movie. It's also easy to stupid and in fact, it's doing a lot to hurt people instead of helping for a while! <br /> <br /> "Zat么ichi R么yaburi" begins with Ichi talking with an old lady who is trying to use her blindness. At the same time, Ichi said that a child was blind since her childhood, but she says she wrote her blindness when she was eight years old. This is a minor mistake, and I would only notice a treacherous admirer like myself. br /> <br /> This movie takes place at least every six months and is likely to take a year - so you can see what I'm talking about strangely enough. The majority of the series is more than a few days or weeks. Ichi comes to a city where Asagi is a boss (Asagoro) who has a very difficult attempt to be good for Ichi, because he knows the fame of a blind man. The boss is quite attractive and surprisingly taken entirely by two bad men. At the same time, another manager (Shushu) responds - a kind of guru to the poor. The people of Shusha encourage them to abstain from all the violence, and even fall into her teachings - keep her knife for several months. The teachings of Shoushi are very similar to China's Daoist teachings - violence (like good or bad) and acceptance of life. <br /> <br /> The months passed well after leaving the city and after all, when Ichi, after leaving her, showed Asagoro's true colors - learned to enslave women, to attack the poor, and to be totally crushed. Asi helped Asagoro in a way and Ichi was responsible for doing so as he calculated it as a friend. Now Asagoro captured Shusha and several innocent people killed themselves because of the bad boss's actions. <br /> <br /> When she returns, Asagoro tests her good or badly but is cleverly tested. This bit inspired by a fright and leads to a finale, what else, killing Ichi baddies and releasing Shushui. This final was very good and it was raining. <br /> <br /> Together with Asagoro, the final scene and rocks are great, although the special effects of this day are fresh enough for their standards. <br /> <br /> The film's advantages are different, despite the bad progress and previous 15 (often very similar). In addition, it ends well. Minus (some outside of pacemakers) does not like to see so much mistake Ichi, and they make scenes with other blind men who come in for funny relief ... very, very, very flat. They are tacky and unfunny ... that's flat flat.
