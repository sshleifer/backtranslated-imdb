Diane Keaton gave a very sad, but funny story, which covers a few young people and their deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton (Natalie), "Family Stone", '05, can describe her single daughter and her love beyond words. He has always called him, and the expression "Dorothy", which was used in the "Wizard of the Wizard" in 1939, surrendered. A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie deeply links himself with her daughter, her friends and her lover. Natalie finds more truth about her relationship with her and her daughter. Great movie to see and love all the movies that are well-functioning, especially from all supporting actors.
