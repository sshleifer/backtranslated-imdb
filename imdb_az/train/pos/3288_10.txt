This is a cool fantasy movie. One of my faves is really cool. Director, Bernard Rose, started direct with this movie and made a great start to this movie. <br /> <br /> A girl named Anna was ill with a glandular dog on her 11th birthday. He draws on a piece of paper from his book, and dreams of a real home. It is replaced by the existence of everything that it adds to the next dream. In his third dream he thinks he meets a boy named Mark. <br /> <br /> Anna playing Charlotte Burke is a terrific actress, and after a movie that is very strange, she will disappear and never happen. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's account is also boring. Broken Arrow, like many music, excitement and mystery. Soundtrack is not a real shame that is no longer available on the CD. The DVD is only available on R2.
