I enjoyed watching this movie late on TV and was interested in me all through the landscape. This beautiful, creepy, yet mysterious British home, badly decorated decorations and furniture and rooms, you want to rent this house, or even the rooms where you're wondering why. There are four (4) Tales on this home, and every resident of the house faces every challenge. You will see the beautiful lake and pond around the house, as well as the birds singing sweetly, but not to cheat you, there is horror at all places. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", 80, one of the homeowners and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Crimson Altar", 68 and little girl Chloe Franks (Jane Reid), together with a beautiful story, loves to read some of her daughter's WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you love creepy, horrible and mysterious movies, there are plenty of surprises, this is for you MOVIE!
