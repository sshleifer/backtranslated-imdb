After a while, we get the R-rated comedy that takes everyone's time and attention. If critics love it, it is even rarer. I have just returned from a 40-year-old Sister, and I can honestly say it was one of the greatest laughs in my life. I showed it at 10:35 and every order was full. Not only that, but everyone was listening all the time laughing. It's funny for two hours. <br /> <br /> I dare to see this movie and make you laugh. A man is forty years old and he is a virgin. But behind this simple, five-second grace, we are given a deep and complex story, which will not be a witness, but there are real lessons behind it. Steve Carell beat Andy Stitzer, 40-year-old Virgin. Steve Carell, in my opinion, is one of the best scene thieves of all time. Stealing the hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially Anchorman, Steve Carell finally gives her moment to glaze, and proudly, as the star. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is 100% foolish. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; Judd Apatow and Steve Carell's bright record are really good, and a story is not hell to say. Although it is not well presented, the film gives us more than just a good time, but even if we see real-life struggles like Andy and his colleagues at the same time, his gut odor laughs all the time. the comedy gives you one of the most memorable endings you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think, when Roger Ebert puts it, nevertheless, when Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson come together, Catherine Keener gives a perfect performance, such as Trish, a woman Andy really has a heart for it, but he does not laugh at us, but this is a story <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "color: red;"> Alberta and Manitoba slapped the 40-year-old Virgin with 18A. The same thing with the Four Brothers, in my opinion, happened with the second best movie of the year, and I can say that I just loved Ontario more. For all teens in the States: Success is in failure! <br /> <br /> Generally, Steve Carell gives me one of the funniest performances I've ever seen and laughs to everyone in the castle as soon as possible. Everyone loves this 40-year-old Virgin this summer, and I encourage everyone to see how fast it is to people. This year's best comedy, hands down. <br /> <br /> This is a funny masterpiece and a lot of critics are worthy of praise. <br /> <br /> Anchorman is the "Best Yard," "Toy Crashers," and, of course, Apatow and Carell's latest memorable comedy. I love it. Each of my favorite critics liked him and immediately deserves a place in the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a great star. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> Objectively? 9/10 <br /> By topic? 10/10 <br /> Eliason A.
