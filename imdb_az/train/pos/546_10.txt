I thought it was one of the best albums I've ever seen. Sometimes I felt like I wanted someone to die, but it was brilliant to kill Stanley. It's such a good movie that you were so happy and happy when you died. My only problem was that there were scenes as if it were a shooting of someone with a home camera, and it was strange. Judd Nelson was, at least, my favorite in my opinion and excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant movie.
