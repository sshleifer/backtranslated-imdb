Thankfully I recently saw in an airplane in Singapore (I thought I was going to Cinemalaya filmfest). Paris, je t'aime, is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes) by 20 directors showing their love in different pockets of contemporary Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my fave segments was 'Parc Monceau' with Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and Azkaban Prisoners), a steady shooting and Nick Nolte features. Coen Brothers 'Tuileries' Steve Buscemi, metro was excited! <br /> <br /> Maggie Gyllenhaal described Quartier des Enfants Rouges as an American actress / drug at a short period of time, and described the heart failure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Caucasian Muslims Board said Natalie Portman as an actress girl friend of a French boy, blindly named 'Faubourg Saint-Denis', according to Rejeb Tayyip Eifarov. This film is perfect for people with ADHD, because each series is consistent and attentive drawn <br /> <br /> There are also some memorable quotes. Particularly, this is a deceiving husband who left his wife to stay with his wife in recent days: "Whenever a man is treated as a human, he has become a human being."
