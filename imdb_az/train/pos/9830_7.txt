No one understands the logic behind the counting of Italian zombie flips, but honestly? Why Do We Worry? Each film in the Zombie series is a great fun, bad body and free shock, and this is the exception, despite all the challenges of the production of the "Zombie 3". This film has begun as the Lucio Fulci project, which has to further develop the success of the "Zombie 2", but has been the product of Bruno Mattei, the most flawed and stolen ideas of previous films. The script has been hopeless and does not see any endurance, every miracle of George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "Crazies" is duplicated here, and the performances are really unhappy and painful. All this did not bother me for a moment, because something superlative from above pays everything! At a secret army base in the Philippines, the bacterium war virus has finished "Death One" and prepared for transportation. After a failed attempt to steal the virus, a terrorist infection cremated the body and contaminated the entire population of a tourist village close to zombie ashes. The last group of the survivors has to fight with white and dressed soldiers, along with hyperactive and non-human powerful zombies who are instructed to kill everything that moves in the dirty area. This film can be compared to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City". It's really bad ... but it's incredibly entertaining with fast paced motion schemes and many creative zombie-madness situations. Unconscious birds, for example, were genuine and all the zombie births in an abandoned hospital were quite cool. The sad flying head scene is not terribly fragile, and it is perfect for the cheesy and all-inclusive unpleasant Italian zombie flick. Fans are offered; I do not object to negative interpretations.
