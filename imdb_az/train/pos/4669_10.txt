If Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were two more charming performers appearing in a more attractive movie in 1968, I do not know who I am. I saw this 16 year old beautiful little satirical rom 25 years ago and I think every year that he has not been able to sit down to spend it again. Smart, quirky, neat, jokeous, sweet, gentle, destructive and absolutely magnificent. The romance of these two social misconceptions is also rich comic and terrible movements - Maggie Smith's right card in the deck is never more than just trying to bring a scene that's a fun little and portent of loneliness, which is a perfect little portrait. He asks Ustinov of the latest ice cream frame on the face of anxiety, anxiety, and distress: "Are you okay?" - Has a true and loyal look and sound made so perfect and naked honest? I would never want to ignore anyone who does not love this movie.
