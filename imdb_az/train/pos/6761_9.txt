Otto Preminger's Dana Andrews movie is an unusual gem of the genre. Because they were not paranoid, disobedient or hysterical, they were out of place at that time, but they have clear-cut images, complex complex identity, personality and representation, dispersion of traditional psychological structures, hearty, geometric style. Today, in a surprising way, it looks modern and looks very similar to Melville. The obvious style of this film is a "happy" one of the most cruel of the Hollywood history, and it's loaded, brutal, and irony. The fun is full of bright, intense and bipartite dialogue on entertaining thriller levels.
