I have never seen a silent film until July 24, 2005. I did not see a movie with Mary Pikford. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few people have hypnosis. I've found the last Mohicans and Ray Liotta as a hypnosis, and consider the source when you look at it. I started watching Tessin in the Storm country in the TCM to see who this Mary Pickford is, who owns a large number of credits for the Hollywood start. I did not know why. Two hours later I quit her and watched one of the most beautiful women I ever saw, and we played a great role in it. Imagine a movie admirer in 1922. You need to see it again and again. The setting for a imaginative girl was good. He was a poor bucket, but the king could not speak English, but you should love him. What a movie ... Time to start our Mary Pickford movie collection!
