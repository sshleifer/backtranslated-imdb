The epic expression of Fox's America's one of the greatest adventures comes with truly prominent "Extras" on DVDs. BRIGHAM YOUNG ("Frontiersman", added to European freedom) tells the story of the great pioneer leader who brought Mormon faith members to Salt Lake Valley in 1847. After killing their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (who was the founder of the Church of the Last Sacrifice of Jesus Christ) Vincent Price), was screened in 1940, and America would enter the Second World War. Fox's head Darryl F. Zanuck was a courageous step, and this was a fresh air breath for the Mormon people, as it was an attempt to show their faith on the screen positively. Fox, who works with James D'Arc, the curator of the perfect Motion Picture Archives at Utah, Provo, Brigham Young University, has taken this movie to DVD. A few years ago, Dr. D'Arc, a doctoral dissertation on the film, presented one of the deepest interpretations for the DVD. In fact, he separates art from his works and lets his listeners know how much these films are valued by the King's Leaders. One of the fun things to do is agree with actor Dean Jagger, who plays the lead role. A few years after the film, he eventually married a holy woman and eventually turned into a LDS faith. A lot of things about D'Arc's knowledge should be learned, and it's great to be a part of the DVD! There are over 100 images from the Fox & BYU Archive included in the disc, and the seven movie theaters in Salt Lake City have incredible premiere television views. Thanks to FOX for outstanding DVDs - and thank you for your great comment, James D'Arc!
