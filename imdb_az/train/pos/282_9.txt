This is the most scary game you play. It's not the usual shooting-everything-that's the type of action (usually does not matter to me), but the gfx, exciting weapons and magic, great surround soundeffects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") and above all the incredible atmosphere. I love Scrye, which allows me to see or hear events in the past at certain places of the game. The only game that keeps running at regular intervals after a few minutes of playing at the density of the atmosphere. I am a great fan of Clive Barker's stories and movies, and joining a horror story like this gives me more games, emphasizing a story that involves the atmosphere and more. 9/10 (-1 Because I'm not a fan of fps and maybe the game was a bit shorter?)
