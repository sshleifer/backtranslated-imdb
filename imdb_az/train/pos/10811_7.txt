This film is waiting for you at another time in your daily life. We are wondering how families will deal with the war and how quickly the young people are sent to battle. <br /> <br /> Finally, many of us are not forced to pass through our grandparents, fathers or grandparents. It was time for a battle. This film, I think a little thank you. Peter Outerbridge is a strange look like a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe, and it's as Australia can be. Certainly, it needs to be listened to by reading the "High Flight" and surprises me with what she can do with Shakespeare.
