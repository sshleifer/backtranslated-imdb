I knew that when they went around Europe in 1982, "Everybody laughed" and had been indefinitely but dearly commemorated. About twenty years after I got to know, I saw it again on the band ... Bogdanovich had a sensitive sensitivity because of his emotions and a feeling of embarrassment. Excellent comedies and actors, everyone's and everyone's good lines and pretty good editing. I laughed and always smiled. As always, sometimes. Go.
