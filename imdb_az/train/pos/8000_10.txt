... do not read any plot summary, because the so-called plot is small, brain may be dead and meaningless. The film is driven by both Denzel and Dakota (he goes to heaven, trust me), just amazing, and the scheme is on the horizon. In fact, "fantastic" is the smallest word used for such actors. The film is based solely on factual facts, and some of the characters are not fictional, but it adds to the shock that I've experienced in the film and after. If you love both the actors and the slightly twisted movies, you still have not followed your favorite people ... Trust me, eventually you will experience a strange and uncertain feeling. The movie is awesome, look, rent, buy or whatever ... just do not miss it
