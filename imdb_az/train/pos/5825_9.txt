Most Stoogephiles consider this the best Stooges short bar ever and they are right. Curly is a drifting scream like "Senorita Cucaracha" and Moe and Larry are the highest form of "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. Christine McIntyre's beautiful operative voice is a full-featured opera singer - and it's beautiful. The great Gino Corrado, as a terrific Italian singer full of terror by Stooges on a community side, is hilarious. Some really funny gags, good direction and very intense editing make this rise top of Stooges' productive product. What is even more surprising is that Curly had serious health problems at that time, and as you can see in her few shirts during this time she is clearly ill; his time runs out, speaks very slowly, and has trouble around him. Fortunately, after creating this movie, health has been a rising and it shows. I enjoyed the classic Stooge comedy and even the non-Stooge fans (Stooges had a girlfriend who could not stand it, but she even laughed at it). Must be A.
