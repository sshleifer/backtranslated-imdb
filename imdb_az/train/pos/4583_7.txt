I saw it in Canton VCD with an English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when a number of subarokers were virtually indifferent. It drew a film as a pretty bare musical account that made me really sad throughout the whole movie. If music score improved, I have never seen a few indispensable scenes. Then the film would be much better.
