Together with Cavemen, married by Alec Baldwin, the picnic looks at all the hominid (of us!) Species in the last 5 million years: who they are, what they want, and how they die. Along with having a very interesting scientific background on the information we have on these species, walking with Cavemen also explores things that make us human. I waited a few weeks to watch and I'm not disappointed.
