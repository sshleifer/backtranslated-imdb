A stupidity of a nuclear power plant causes the majority of people to turn into deadly, rotten, curly zombies, which are naturally strangled. Ragtag is a few unconscious people, doing their best to get rid of this terrible trial. Director / writer / producer Todd Sheets shows an attractive love and passion for the right-to-the-throat lively and terrible horrors: it keeps sliding fast, fills the screen with wallpapers, and gratefully shakes an unpleasant dialogue keeps it. Sheets, of course, is not limited to glorious graphics and extreme overlaps: this picture is a magnificent impalement for a tree branch, melting meat, evisceration, many munchings of a bowel, echoing a friend's heart. The sheets earn bonus points to capture the tone of a terrible and terrible bitter end (for example, almost all zombie chickens). Of course, this flick has a fair share of defects: ugly editing, a few hamburger attempts at the patches, and a terrible thing that comes from a number of unforgettable names leaves something as good as you want. The superior degree of heroism goes to Casey Rausch, a very beautiful and confused, with a perfect Daria Trumillio's triumph. Frank Dunlay is also good as a veteran army veteran, Ralf Walsh. Best of all is that sheets are understood by the feeling of slambang that is explicitly inflamed by the extreme speed of momentum and genre of heroism that is a common explosion to watch from beginning to end.
