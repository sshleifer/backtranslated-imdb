La Teta i la Luna (The Breast and the Moon) describes the life of a 9-10-year-old boy named Tete, who faced breast enlargement in Catalunya. I love this movie because characters are very honest and many people like all the characters in Bigas Luna's films (also Jamon, Jamon director). Tete reminded me that this could have an exciting and exciting life. And from Catalunya (northeastern Spain), it has brought many memories to my point of view. This film shows the wonderful part of the beautiful Catalunya, the beautiful people, the beautiful life and the unbelievable man.
