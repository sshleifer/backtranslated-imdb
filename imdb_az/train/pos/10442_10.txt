This is really one of the best films about love I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <strong> There is no other than the "sun before", this is not technically another movie because the same two men and the same romantic. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. Perhaps most people are clever and eloquent as they happen in the film. Reading other reviews makes me happy to know how many other people are crazy about dialogue-based movies. And before "Sunrise" it is so good. Dialog is perfect. It's so attractive and funny. <br /> <br /> Jesse and Celine can not be surprised to be in love. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is to encourage you to say that the coffee shop is your best friend and best friend. Perfect. <br /> <br /> It brings you back when you're in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> Once you've selected "Before the Sun". <br /> <br /> Once again, the biggest romantic movie in my books, like myself, was the first time you watched the Sunset, It's hard to shake the feelings of regret and sadness for two young ladies ... Beautiful manuscript, perfect script and beautiful places Young love is the best.
