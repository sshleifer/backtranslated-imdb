Now this is a family movie! In recent years, there have been several films targeted at several families or children, in fact, their publicity; but one of them. My whole family was away from the movie, excited, fun, dazzled, and happy. We still have here and here very few anecdotes. The kids loved it and we were also (hubbie and i, respectively, 36 and 32)! <br /> <br /> Besides beautiful and striking animations, the characters (like smaller and imaginative) have developed very well. They have no ability to follow anyone. Identities that bring these little creatures to life, some of the best animated Disney best casters are well cast in their voice capabilities, combined with skill and mastery. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney. I think Mr. Disney would heartily admit this new movie ... Flick, Dot and a small group of heroes can be famous for our time like Mickey and Minnie. <br /> <br /> This is a family, leaving the theater they want to see again .. and having a video or DVD. I would like to see it again .. for the first time to get what I missed. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, heartwarming, smart, and great. fun for the whole family!
