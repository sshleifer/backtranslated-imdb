When I saw this movie, then I saw another of Blue Crush and Michelle's films, he thought it was a reasonable future in this business. After watching her performance on "Girlfight" I was a mistress, not a fighter, but also a warrior who was fascinated by the way he captured an emotion. In this film, he is the way to express anger when he attacks his father by treating himself and his brother. or it can be hidden from love, or he does not earn it because he has gained power. I believe this role is perfectly suited to Michelle, the director saw his talent, and I criticize myself for not being able to see myself.
