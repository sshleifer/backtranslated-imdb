MATADOR (2005) *** Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan is one of the best Bondian roles in the middle-aged assassination, while serving in Mexico, but he is acquainted with an American businessman who deserves to be a quarrel (Kinnear's most unpleasant) and sees more of life is more than death . The newly-launched director, Richard Shepard, has made a solid big screen debut with funny details and a vicious black comedy that looks sharp for him for the development of gigantic dialogue and character. This gives him the ability to watch in fresh air, shattering his formula, 'friendly friendship', which allows Bossnan to wait for his ways and take on the devil's evil consciousness. A sleeping gem hit the indie.
