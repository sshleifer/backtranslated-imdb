This is a great game! Perhaps there were not some features for it, but Digital Anvil still has a good game. There is a similarity to elite (you can trade, destroy weapons and land cargo, evacuate ships, go to missions), but this game has a very heavy scripted mission. Great mission. The control system is different from the mouse use! You basically fly your spaceship around a system and work your way! The game has many beautiful graphics made in 2003. It should work well on a humble PC. The story sounds like some of the great sounds of John Rys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (he appears in every computer game). The story is getting better and better. There is even a racing track, where you and your opponent will have a long distance ride (these rings). This section has beaten me for a while. This game is different. Some parts are a bit challenging and here you can, but in general you can defeat this game. The game has an active mode scene on Net. Select some mods to extend the game. I still did not play mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this continuation has been abolished, shame!
