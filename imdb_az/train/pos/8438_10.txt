HLOTS was a perfect series, NYPD Blue will not happen, HLOTS areas are real, real dialogue is real, the relationship is real. As it returned back as a HLOTS movie, it would be good to close all the gaps and bring together all the gangs, revealing some of the dead (how they did not want to be called). The story was fast-paced, emotional, and full of souls within weeks and weeks. Life on Life, Life on the Streets, Network Drama, Best !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Upper and all these. Finally, we thank NBC for not giving!
