I like jokes such as "Cliché ..." or "Upper cliché boy, black, oily skin, strange ..." It's just funny! Daniel begins to hold him! The good thing is that Jack is no longer a team (in some way) or anything else but a sarcasm !!! I love only all the fields (season 8, a bit less, I have to admit), the character is good, the actors are great, and I'm starting to get facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... Only theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! I'm going to them again! Sorry, I'm starting to get the features of Carter and all of this takes my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Yes, to come to the conclusion, I have these three seasons or better, especially with all these humor, drama, movement, and so on. It's good if I keep the episodes with you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!
