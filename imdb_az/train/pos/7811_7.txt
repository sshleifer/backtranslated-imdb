Steve Biko, Gandhi, was also a black activist trying to oppose the black minority ruling in South Africa, as he tried to oppose the colonialism of the British Empire in India. Richard Attenborough's film is not about Cry Freedom, Biko, or Apartheid, but is linked to Donald Woods, the white-liberal newspaper editor who risked his life by trying to explain Biko's story. After the death of Biko's treacherous behavior in the hands of the South African "police", there is a sharp point in the film. Woods, played by Kevin Clan, should leave the country to do the right thing and distribute the country to books about Biko or to forget his book by his friend, Penelope Wilton. In this case, Biko dies in vain. What started out as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Vuds, Biko's death turned into standards by escaping from the boundary thread after his death. The Oscar nominee, Denzel Washington, is better than Bico's fourth film, but for more than half of the film, something is wrong in a film trying to describe the apartheid struggles, focusing more on a white family court. Rather than focusing on Biko's relationship with Woods, Attenborough would focus on a better topic, focusing on Bikon's rise. Perhaps the leading actor in a 2 1/2 hour film was not exactly fitting to the large box office, but the film was a great box office flop anyway. Aside from film politics, the film still sends a message or sends a message, though it's PG-sanitized fashion. *** 4 stars.
