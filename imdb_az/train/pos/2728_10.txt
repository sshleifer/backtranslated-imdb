Just one of the best! Richard Brooks's adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (Oscars should be earned), strange Quincy Jones account, and great speeches as strikingly coerced killer by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. This movie was 4 at the Academy Awards and was Dr Doolittle, not even a nominee for the best picture. Take a picture! <br /> <br /> Even as you know what you are doing in the book, just as in a sad family book, Perry and Dick was a painful process to pay more attention and watch these children. down John Forsythe is also effective as Alvin Dewey. There is simply no defect in this area. From 10 to 10. The best result is Robert B. Wilson's second one near R. Blake. Recommend!
