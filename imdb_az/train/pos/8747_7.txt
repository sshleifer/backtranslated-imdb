<br /> <br /> While the possible Spoiler * "Midnight Express" and "Paradise to Return" (and better), the Brokedown Palace still has a chord with me. <br /> <br /> Two young girls have been fired on Thailand for drug trafficking. Clare Danes's Alice? Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? Was it a nice stranger to meet on their way? None of these are really important, because it is a story of friendship and trust, and they are limiting. <br /> <br /> Because Brokedown palace is nothing unusual, Bill Pullman, his lawyer and Jacqueline Kim, the Thai bride (and a better lawyer) or for any reason - is not an original concept, it does not show sensational violence leading to the "wannabe-avant-garde" group talking about "strange reality" or "heavy hit realities" - it's just a good story, some beautiful performances with. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, though deserving, is not something spectacular. Bill Pullman is weak in his lazy layout and speech. <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "<strong> <br /> However, Do not make a mistake - this is the Clare Danes movie I've been a fan of his work for a long time, and that's not a change, and he's involved in every scene he's seen and if he did not, the film would probably be a dull price. <br /> <br /> there is a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7
