This is one of the 80's biggest films in the MY collection that I always think. <br /> <br /> The passing man is one of Arnold's best and most diverse films, and when I first saw him, Running Man was so excited to see a movie like me. I just love all the battles and this is really a special movie. There are also Jesse Ventura, legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2, and others. All the fans of Arnold should love this movie from beginning to end, because it's full of action, star, and the first of its kind, Arnold!
