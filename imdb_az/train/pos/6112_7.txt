This is primarily a chicken flick, a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. In addition to some of the pretty sweet fight scenes in this particular movie, I do not think any wire has been used or they were not clearly straight out. It is not easy to make a body in the body, much more complicated, but to analyze nothing to get a deeper meaning, but rather a simple, good chemistry and entertaining time. They can be incredibly sweet because they only show once they have the full potential, but throughout the film they have a very low base type. I was watching with a girl again.
