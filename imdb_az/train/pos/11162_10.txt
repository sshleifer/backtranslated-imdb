High-powered Raoul Walsh is competing with Jackie Cooper and Faye Wrey, who plays the role of playing the classic, The Bowery, a major competition since 1933, and dandy, the owner and operator Wallace Beery of the hall against George Raft. It's not clear exactly what the opponent is, but everyone is watching it in daily newspapers. At the beginning of the film, it is very clever, but the characters soften as the film progresses. Apart from this, the scenes in the Beery hall are striking. Various heroes, sexy chorus lines, multiple drinking, guilty pre-code restrictions, and then Carrie Nation's self-directed Carrie Nations to create an illegal structure. All of this creates a very lively look of a long life. I do not want to compare periods, but this movie is completely different from what you see today. The film has a lot of heart and innocence, which has long been lost, and absolutly one must see.
