This is an entertaining one in the latest Bombshells bouquet. Judy Dench, Elizabeth, plays a new widow at her free end. <br /> <br /> Despite her husband's good-natured wife and mother, she was not really happy. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth soon after her husband's funeral, when children are on a street show. This causes memories of the fact that during the World War II all members of the girls' sliding band in London were members. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth brings out her fraud (she was secretly engaged in her marriage). ) and the street musician playing the guitar. Elizabeth is more talented than a guitarist, and money begins to flow. He does not get money because he's rich and does not need it. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth was once seen on stage with a band drummer-drag by Patrick (Ian Holm). <br /> <br /> Patrick's "skills" did not see anything but drum, only Patrick's - still a man of women, and Elizabeth - only 15. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth was inspired by her grandson to unite her older grandson to play her granddaughter's school dance. old actresses are doing their job, and this is not just Judi Dench stars, but also a treasure trove. , but he is supported by many of the most prominent British actresses, including Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and many other actresses. <br /> Yes, it's fluffy but totally delicious and pretty funny.
