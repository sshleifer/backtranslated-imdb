<br /> <br /> But do not worry! However, many people did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is the team's Tony's Dream. <br /> <br /> <strong> Tony's dream is then a dream more. It's about preparing for his death in this episode. He loses his identity and eventually forgets himself, and therefore connects the world. I say on the doctor's scene, saying that Tony lost his "life" bag. They were surprised to think what was happening when they died. <br /> <br /> <strong > <br /> <br /> What is the role of managers? <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode really touches me, and I do not think anyone who's practicing a death experience can look better. <br /> <br /> 10/10 There is no doubt.
