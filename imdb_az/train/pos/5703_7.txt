I'm an admirer of Crash and Blade Runner, and I'm so glad that this movie explores some of the peach subjects from the death of this road and films shot in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Generally, the hero of the movie, the main heroism, is well removed from the female device and the hero is nearly a neanderthal, thus kitch warning.
