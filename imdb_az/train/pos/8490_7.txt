Recently, I saw this movie in the International Business class. I did not expect anything else except a boring document (I do not mean I'm fond of a documentary because I'm just a hard luck in this class of movies). Think of my surprise when this movie really is a movie. <br /> <br /> This film explains all the cultural differences in the workplace and how to co-operate to get somewhere. The clash of cultures shows how different the world is, and how we distinguish ourselves from others until someone calls us. I would recommend this movie to everyone in the business or just want a laugh because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's about it! Hearts
