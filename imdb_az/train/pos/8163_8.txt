Corbin Bernsen, Dr. Alan Feinstone, a awesome and successful Beverly Hills dentist, offers a terrific dense and riveting performance that is obsessed with the perfect way. When he sees his beloved blond beauty cup deceived his wife and the IRS begins pushed over his tax problems, Feinstone is under pressure, and goes crazy around bending. Brian Yuzna, a stupid, intelligent and demented script run by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli, and Charles Finch, exposes the neurosis and psychosis that breathe through the subtle cleansed surface of a respectable, rich, wealthy America. In addition, Yuzna blends even more awkwardly twisted pitch with a black mud humor. Burnsen, like Dr. Feinstone, shed light on the positive; Feinstone's fraudulent calmness and tranquility makes the frustrated way that is really disappointing. Linen Hoffman, his wife, Feinstone's strange, legendary companion Brooke, smoky, interrupted IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan's assistant Jessica, hanging assistant Karen Patty Toy, Jan Hoag as jolly office manager, Virginya Keehne, Gibbs terrible partner, Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec, Matt and Marl Ruffalo as Sleazeball Steve, Landers Like A Stunning, Amazing Detective Gibbs, Kenny Foree. First degree makeup f / x should be like everything, protected, general, and facial. Levi Isaaks has a polished cinematography, a lot of great bare bent camera angles, and a few delicious zooming closer. Alan Howarth's heartbeat score hit the meat crawling point. Tactical controversial treatment.
