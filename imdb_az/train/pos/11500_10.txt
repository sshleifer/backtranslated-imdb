MULDER is looking for his or her own, Darren McGavin, the first X Files, is just a season that the show manufacturers came up with a classic makeup and in 1993, Chris Carter, who had followed the Night Stalker, X Files. Both classically, in my opinion, the audience comes only once and after the X Files, the two favorite characters, such as Darren McGavin, Agent Arthur Dales, resolve the situations. I would like to respect humanity, I think if Chris Carter presents Darren McGavin for a forgotten television show in David Duchovny, you will not be watching X movies and never know about Stalker this night.
