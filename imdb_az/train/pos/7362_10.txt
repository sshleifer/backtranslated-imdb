What a fun, sexy movie! Of course, they do not look like this anymore. 4 sexy au pairs come in London and have all kinds of sexual errors. Sound smoke is innocent because characteristic nudity goes beyond the state of emergency, not any open sexual desire of characters. Men's symbols are accelerating when actresses accidentally lose their clothes. Richard O 'Sullivan receives' Randi' (sic). The film betrays the origin of the softcore feature, while lying in nudie cuties and naturism movies of the old school. Special interest in "Au Pair Girls" is a great admirer of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress looked better naked (she's fine but nice curvy), bride, (I've loved her since the original run of the UFO - can carry another purple wig!), I eat my hat.
