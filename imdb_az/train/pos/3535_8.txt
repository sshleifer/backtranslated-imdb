** WARNING - USE OF ALLEGATIONS! <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I liked this game very much. After two months I gave my parents instructions for Christmas. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the only player is very good. The first level is probably the best in the game when you are a party in London and some bad guys kidnap the prime minister's daughter and destroy her. Of course, we have to rescue it and have a very high level, but at least five minutes. The best part, and I'm also the funniest part, when you're in jet-pack and people are rappling down Big Ben. Just jet-pack equipped with the most reliable missile launcher and faces the clock and blast down the enemies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are four mini-levels that you can unlock, 25 means to kill enemy targets, ie c 'mon! <br /> <br /> Many players agree with me and some of my comrades, although they are very good and difficult, but at least there are many points to unlock these missions. boots. Halo did not have any bots, but still a few nice players! <br /> <br /> In the future, some people may be killed. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (it's pretty flawless graphics, but not often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (no comment is needed, just great, you get jet-packs and vehicle drivers). Sound - 8/10 The repeat value of the game is 7/10 (Loondon level return to repeat levels and 1st part of Istanbul). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> It can be a little progress, but it's still good.
