I agree that the film is a little slower in many scenes of daily life and in places where there is no dialogue. When I watched it, I was not immediately surprised. But just a few days later, I realized that the film was with me and that I had a long melancholic mood in my mind. My appreciation for this film. <br /> <br /> Many have commented that the film is not linear, and this is a true picture of European filmmaking, unlike the linear image form, Hollywood. I really do not know if it's the truth. Many do not like the absence of embarrassment or lack of clear explanations. I can not say a lot to change the views of these viewers. But for those who have not yet seen the film, I can not wait for the challenge and wait for the movie to give all the answers and, conversely, rather than enjoying anything else. <br /> <br /> The film is thrown slightly around, but it really only runs 3 times. Take care of the hair style and easily remove 2 out of 3 periods. This is not as confused as the offer; <br /> <br /> Yes, many things were not invalidated or not, and many cases were not investigated. But what is life? If you are not sure about the motives of your friends / loved ones often and you do not face them, then you will never be 100% sure if they tell you the whole truth. This type of movie makes us compelled to comment on the motives behind the movements. However, the film gives enough guidance to make some reasonable assumptions. For example, Matie is manic depressive on suicide. Why? I do not know, maybe life does not go exactly as he expected; perhaps missed his family, but did not forgive her to leave her sick mother, who did not care for her father; Perhaps he understands that Cedric is sacrificing, rebuilding, and splitting his life in order to be with him, all of which is "retreated." In my opinion, the director was always trying to show us that it was a little extinguished and that the scene weakened the faded bird's finesse. Maybe he has a very sensitive spirit and all these stresses are upon him. But we also show that she does not torture some animals with her lover, a street cat. There is also a conversation that illuminates the cause of separation between physicians and Cedric, and possibly suicidal attempts. The physician asks if everything is OK, and Cedric thinks Mathieu is deceived even once, but according to Cedric, this is nothing. That's just the reason, somebody else knows, all of them are mixed up together. Do we know exactly what they are? I do not think so for this movie. Finally, another misinterpretation is the scene of historical remnants. Mathieu is interested in learning about the ruins, not Cedric. <br /> Lastly, the latter is really very hopeful and sweet. <br /> Lastly, the latter is really hopeful and sweet. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints for DVDs. It is extremely dangerous for me. One is the sound. Very soft. I had to pull up the volumes to hear the dialogue, and then they went out to a bar or a crowd when they were in the crowd. Other subtitles can not be turned off; they remain on the screen. Most foreign film DVDs that have not been broadcast by a large studio are, unfortunately, surprising.
