I was forced to see the BUG movie at the Florida Film Festival last night and say that this is a treat. There were directors and then made Q & A. The film begins with a man underneath the young man's feet, while a young man pushes a young boy while he is next to the car and tries to ask the child? why? had he been forced to kill the vitality? "The man who is in a hurry to advise youngsters in his mistakes hinders the people who are not related to him, some of them funny, some sad, and some of them paying for a parking meter starting with a chain of incidents that are ridiculous, and that's a lot of laughs, actor, actor, actor, actor, actor, actor, actor, actor, starring Jamie Kennedy, starring John Carroll Lynch (starring Drew's crazy weary brother at Drew Carey at Jamie Kennedy Trials), Brian Cox (Manhunter ' the original Hannibal Lecter) plays Donut and the Chinese Dinner, a Cox's chef with a piggy-swelling line When Cox is on the sidewalk, saying it's pretty laughable, "clean up the dead" because of "facing germs". The boy is the wife of the day the most exciting moments of the movie, while imitating his lost father. "Many other comic and realistic scenes, Trudie Styler (Ms Sting himself) and another player, when a scene occurs in a cable show, is a plastic bubble.

There are many other beautiful and funny actresses and actresses in this movie, and they spent less than a month and shot about $ 1 million in budget. The directors Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (commercial script writers, crazy / beautiful writing) and Jackie Chan's upcoming Tuxedo) have made a great, funny and loved movie.
