This night's listener is generally better than people say. There are weaknesses and no doubt there is a genre of identity, but this is a creepy atmosphere and interesting exciting speeches. All this feels like one of the things that happens in the fantasy stories of "this friend of my friend". A big complaint about the film is pacing: but slow and sometimes horrible pacing is deliberate. Everything that comes up in this movie is in the presence of probability and in real life only in some kind of plods? So there is no shocking endings or shattering verses, no "conscious" scenes. Thanks to Heaven. When watching this movie, you have to enter the zone, and suddenly you have forgotten what your expectations are. Williams is not terrific, but he is eager to meet the story's needs, and it's likely that his character is somewhat general ("No"), because he is an avatard that embraces us in the story. Tony Collette's performance must be given to an Oscar (he may not be able to win). Give a shot. For a single quality and content, Night Listener is the top twenty percent of the films that have recently been released.
