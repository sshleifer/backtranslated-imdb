<br /> <br /> I saw that this movie was an interesting thing from the start - like the Spielberg movie - and I was interested in trying to figure out what the actual situation was. <br /> <br /> Starting - before opening credits - action starts and can stop immediately. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very pleasing. (Alec's non-discrimination, because of his political affiliation, there is a difficulty in loving Baldwin, but William did not look so bad in this film). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sadly, was. I suspect that the microphone receives video monitors on the set.
