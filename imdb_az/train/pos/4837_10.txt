In 1979, I became a young filmmaker from the Union Union of Soviet Union, who had come to Bulgaria from the Soviet Union and performed "Siberian" by Konchalovsky; Tarkosvkinin "Stalker" and Danelia "Autumn Marathon". I was surprised by the cosmopolitan dimension of art form. Then, and then, only Siberia saw 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was silent. Then Bertolucci's "1900" way. Remotely! <br /> <br /> Hope Andron will come in a way in a way and "full length of the director's recovery version" one day! Of course on DVD! Also, I have fought against the majority of my colleagues, who have made this film the worst movie of the Soviet movie! Time is on my side.
