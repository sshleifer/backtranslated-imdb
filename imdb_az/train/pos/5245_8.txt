I thought this movie was LOL funny. There is an entertaining fun that will not make a movie about life, love, and life of a man about life ... from low to busy d√©butante ... until the bus stop. Tim meadows plays a boy raised in Playboy style (Leon Phelps) by a Hugh Hefner-esquire father who is constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" throws him on the street, he must teach him to understand the life he has taught him with a chauvinistic look ... nothing but a mystical level of this charming and terrible success. And hijinx begins! If you did not see this movie and enjoyed the joyful, semi-romantic, comedy / love story, I also advise you to rent a "lady of the ladies".
