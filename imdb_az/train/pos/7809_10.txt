This movie went beyond the concept and remains the most beloved film of all time, in fact, almost every sentiment enters all 157 minutes. What's hard for me is that I do not want to hear nice music and songs from the movie, I have to put it on my DVDs, so I wonder who's knowing who's reading the songs in the movie anywhere and, as I look everywhere, in the last five years, I play one. My most favorite proposal from the film is the defender of the court, "But if your own words want a direct conflict, it's a call to violence." <br /> <br /> KIDA ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland, responded to Biko: "Now I am in conflict, but I do not see violence!"
