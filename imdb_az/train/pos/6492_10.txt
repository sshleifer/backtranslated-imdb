I am not a very good writer, so I will keep going. World of War - The best WWII document I've ever seen. I've seen various WWII documentaries (English / North American only) and this documentary appears to be the most up-to-date WWII documentary I've ever seen. I think we can talk a bit about the Great Depression, and I think Hitler is going to power, but he does a very good job of covering the war. Everyone looks full and objective and fair. Not to exaggerate or reduce the roles of different nations. There are many original images, including digital footage and many eyewitnesses (when it's more vibrant in the 70s). There is great music and narrator. All-in-All is good because it gave 10/10. (I did not see it in the DVD version, so I will not comment)
