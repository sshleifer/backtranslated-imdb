When I see the first look at this movie, I acknowledge that it's a disappointment. Was VH-1 going free? That is, Harris and Quinn do not really look or sound like John or Paul. But I have to admit that this movie really surprised me. It is far from my exploit of exploitation. Instead, we are looking at a character research, low, substantial, strange and ultimately friendly, and the last lesson we all learn: once it is difficult to catch up with what we have and what we have gone through.
