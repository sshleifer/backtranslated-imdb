If this film was prepared after a few years, the sound quality was pretty low, so it could be scored one or two points. Some movie scenes (with normal ambient noise) appeared. However, given the 1931 film and the French film, it could be completely forgiven. Especially in the subsequent French films, the sound problems were to be completely solved (such as L'Atalante in 1934). <br /> <br /> Well, apart from some minor sound problems, it's a cute little movie about a long list of missing lottery tickets and people trying to get it. And there are many small songs that you can help but do not like during the search. A beautiful charming movie all-in-all.
