Yes, it was a very simple story, but it really looked at the root of Qibta in a really interesting way. <br /> <br /> Many amazing scenes (J-Man's "lake cabin", Corki unceremonious grave, Weitz's spouse and Walken's J-Man - Reject the people in IMDb and shoot directly on the movie when they do not have any idea what to do, I envy any of the top ten comedies (Napoleon Dynamite). <br /> <br /> Remember these people; often Popular is not good.
