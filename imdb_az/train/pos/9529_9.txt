One of the best films is one of the best films ever since 2002. But it's not the best movie, but the best-looking, beautiful actor and perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who performs "The American Beauty." <br /> <br /> <br> Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) tells the story of a gangster, who was seen by one of his son Tyler Hoechlin. Michael's director John Rooney (Paul Newman) thinks that everything will be fine, but his jealous son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), also leads his father and Michael to the death of Michael's spouse (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and his second son . Michael thinks Rooney is responsible, and Rooney has to choose himself and finish a businessman, Harlem Maguire (Jude Law). <br /> <br /> Because Michael is a respected person, he is trying to win some friends who can help him. <br /> <br /> One way is 'a way to freedom' is a standard gangster film, but it does not mean that it was good. This film is good at production design, art, sound, music and, most of all, cinematography. Although the result is quite clear, all these elements can be surprising and ineffective. Of course, Hoechlin is not a boring kid and Hanks, Law and Newman certainly know how to help. <br /> <br /> Based on a comedy, this movie is much better than you expect and nevertheless refers to better films in the genre. Sometimes there are things that you have seen many times before, but for some reason, at the same time it feels fresh. The scene between the Mature Hanks and the child Hoechlin helps in that area. See this movie, which is very familiar to you once, but it's completely new in many areas.
