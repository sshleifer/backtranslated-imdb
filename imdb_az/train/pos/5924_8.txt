Woah! Can I say something about this movie? Personally, I am one of the lovers of cats that would be a great part of the movie, but I liked that everyone I love was caught in the end of the cats <br /> <br /> I liked it <br /> <br /> Bren Krause, could not prevent it in a way. When I watch this movie, I guess lust has improved with me. <br /> <br /> It was disappointing. I watched Charmed before, and Brian Krause married Holly Marie Combs, the kissing scene was O.K. In Sleepwalkers, if you actually compare the kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not believe that Krause and Combs are great chemistry or perhaps even more, and this was just a disappointment in the movie <br /> <br /> Brian Krause- If you use Holly Marie Combs to look like a generous husband and father's son, she will stay in the movie with Brian Krause. For a great surprise with this movie, she was a careless child. Now I think, though, that it would be good to see that Krause's treachery took him to something like the Savior himself as Sleepwalkers did. <br /> Many of the movies!
