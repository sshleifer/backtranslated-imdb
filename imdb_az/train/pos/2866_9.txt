I grew up in this classic western series and considered a treat as a child allowed to stay late late Sunday night to look at it. Bonanza is still good at running again. <br /> <br /> Cartwright, a family living in a home near Serial Virginia City, is Nevada, around the Civil War era. Their help is headed by Adam, Hoss and Little Joe, who is a widow woman (called Ponderosa) and her unmarried three children. <br /> <br /> These three brothers have different mothers, all of which have already passed. Cartwrights are a very respected, hardworking, prosperous and honorable family in these works. Ponderosa is large, so many horse riding is required for reaching the extremity. Also, buy or sell livestock and so on. Certainly, some of these excursions go unheeded. Despite being hospitable, the majority of Cartwrights' energy must be spent to protect their ants from controversy or to protect the jealousy of the city's inhabitants from their well-being and perfect reputation. Cartwrights is doing something fair and in the air to fire their weapons, but if it's absolutely necessary, tap to kill it. <br /> <br /> One of the key assets of the series is Ben and his everyday presence, and even in the political life of Nevada. between his three sons and three brothers (often in spite of dissent). A brother now and then has to beat someone else, but generally there is a good reason for this time and his anger is going on for a long time! The heroes are well-designed. I am portrayed as a lucky and noble man of great integrity. Adam, the eldest son of Adam, was the wisest of the brothers and sisters in the middle of the array. His younger brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant of a toy bear that has an unsaturated appetite for eating and is a bit shy around women. The smallest, Little Joe, on the contrary, is a warm, head-to-head, attractive destination for women. The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) states: "O believers, Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe) and, of course, Lorne Greene, Patriarch Ben. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful event full of western values, and cartwrights are always so vicious that many of the noble heroes and bad guys are just there.
