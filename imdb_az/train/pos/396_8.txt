Legend of Zu <br /> I remember that Tsui Hark's original book, Zu Warriors, did 18 years ago. Over a week during a week in Hong Kong on Channel 4, England, Zu Warriors was very enthusiastic for a very young watcher and his brother, and it was very memorable that it was now brought to the memory of growers <br /> In fact, in my opinion, the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest films I have ever seen as a child, so we can clearly grasp the storyline and the action scenes. <br /> <br /> So, after Zu Warriors's reconstruction, I saw anxiety. <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> </ div> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> I can not. But this is not really something. The legend of Zu tells the story of King Osman, the fighter, his master, Dawn, expresses his love, but his life is drawn from him by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later Insomnia returns, reincarnated as Dawn Enigma and returned to Destroy Insomnia Zu. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with the help of the King's Castle, try to stop the White Eyebrows and the Red, Insomnia. <br /> <br /> The solution does not go straight and turns, but there is enough detail to make me wonder. But I see this movie as something you love or hate. The film is particularly about special effects with the majority of participating in many computer-generated environments such as the Storm Riders and the Hero of the Man. Unlike the other two films, however, this film did not irritate the schedule and everything was fun. Unlike the hero, nothing looks inevitable. <br /> <br /> The story also involves many characters, and many people are interested in the movie. Maybe it was on the edge of many chefs, but in general, every character is in the story. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play a very big role in the film, but they did not say that the movie was showing their best performances. Although Cecilia Cheung seems to have grown up in the player, it's still pretty cool. Kelly Lin was new to me. Despite a very brief role, I apologized and acknowledged ogling! <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, I want to say that I'm very glad that this movie is from the original. Given that both films are made by legendary Tsui Hark, the two films are part of a chronicle showing how the Hong Kong movie has changed over the past 20 years. <br /> Of course, you can not compare all of the two films, taking apples and pears. <br /> <br /> Finally, both of them are rightfully full of happy movies. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
