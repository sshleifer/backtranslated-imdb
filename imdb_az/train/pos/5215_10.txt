It's almost the first time I'm watching this season. The actors, Gere and Claire, have chosen and the story looked promising ... I just watched it and I say - I was drowned. There are scenes of shock, true ... but more realistic. We must not escape from our realities, these moments happen right. And there are professionals who want to change things, do better things, and rely on what they do. Actually, I can not see the Hollywood touch feeling in the movie ... and it does it better. Both Claire and Richard played a major role and ten people deserved it.
