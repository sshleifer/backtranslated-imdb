The "man in the moon" is a pretty good movie. It often touches and works very well in all respects. <br /> <br /> All the filmmakers involved in the film had a good job with their roles. At such a young age, when he saw Reese Witherspoon, he liked it and did a very good job. Jason London is also a good job. Another person I know was Sam Samuelson who was doing a fantastic job with Sam's roles. The character of the Samine (Matthew Trant) really liked it. Sometimes he seemed like a frightened father, but eventually you love his character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify; I suggest reading the morning synopsis and if it's what you're interested in, then go for it, thank you for reading the movie <br /> <br /> - Chris
