<br /> <br /> This is a very interesting comedy about a community in the center of London that, unusual, is not an Englishman but a French burgundy province. Since then, the story has been based on a news source by comedian Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), the Canadian government "officially" welcomes the European hospitality a member of the hotel room. This idea actually reminded the real life claim of the state of Hutt River in Western Australia, where the landowner "left" the Australian Government because of the quota-quarrel. (Never received by Western Australia or Australian Government). <br /> <br /> This is not a great deal of political and economic issues, but rather a great play that plays as a "Yes Minister" television show; as well as a large eccentric character.
