This dark De Sika sells the goods. And "spaces will inherit the earth." This story of the class on the surface is a fact for all homeless people who have flooded Europe after the great war. They are homeless, but hilarious, in many societies, for Italian carpets, they are very poor and arbitrary to care for or to confess. de Sika tale, chooses to say this as Cinderella's story. I have not read the book I took as a basis, so I do not think in advance if it was a writer or Vittorio. The story begins with words "Once Upon ..." to illustrate the timelessness of the story because the story can be defined everywhere and everywhere. The boulange delights all of them when it comes to spinning off Spielberg's paintings, especially when the caricature sketches of the crushed aristocracy begin to give in to the desires of the homeless. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of its best. Removing from neo-realism, it always differs from both the clean and the beautiful old film structure, creating a violent film, and at the same time full of hopes of continuing to be released into this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
