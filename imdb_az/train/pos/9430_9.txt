I'm a member of the canoe club and I can tell you the truth is that it is synonymous with salvation and peace of experience. When we put our boats in the water, the banjons sound behind conscious minds. This film is timeless because it affects the philosophy and technology of human nature in its nature. We see it in a fishing rod. We see it in the tent at home. The city's mansion and village tree have a "cracker" advantage. Banker's "bad dent" from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) means putting it on the same level as the tree with its bad teeth. Finally, the struggle for life and death substitutes for the "civilian" the "law" of the law. This canoe trip ends in a very short time for viewers, but it is strange that it is short enough.
