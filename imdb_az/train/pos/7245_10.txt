This is a full-length feature film about the bridge world. The first 10 minutes I found a little slower, but then the movie is absolutely perfect when explaining professional bridge players and getting a life. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are funny. I do not think the non-bridge player will get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really nice, and the movie is black and white, and I can only think of it as a color. The way to describe the media is not fun. There will not be anything like that on Earth's bridge. <br /> <br /> Keep track of this as soon as possible, and inform your friends about it.
