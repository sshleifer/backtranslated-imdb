I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were the most important thing for me, plus the script and player. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's most powerful roles. He is fully satisfied with the performance. Just imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum solved this role. This is my first concern, Jean Peters. I am convinced that I am very impressed here, not waiting for his other job. Thelma Ritter, in a spectacular role, was awarded an Oscar nomination for the informer to play. This movie works on every level. Black and white photography is perfectly fitting and the story is closed from the viewer. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their challenging romance. Be advised, 9/10.
