Hey right now, TheatreX found it almost in a new position when surfing the videos on the lone market, and when she read the back of the box she saw a little "religious hit", of course, she came home to me. <br /> <br /> A strange movie. The former first lady, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis's aunt and cousin, lives in a decadent 28-room house in Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and shares her home with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) And knows what else. Suffolk Co was somewhere to live in a dirty place and the old Jackie came to set things right. Anyway, this is a strange couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings, and rarely gives the camera a little bit of sense. Great Edie (mother, 79 years old) loves to escape from the naked look and receive instructions from what we can look happy, so we came to the point at which we were forgiving. These women talk about the past and talk and talk, and they do not feel any more. They are definitely living in dirt, cats are working everywhere ("look cat goes to the bathroom behind my port") and a bedroom looks like their operating center. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice, she remembers the night lady who is from this part of our country and I have the emphasis on Lawn Guyland. By putting the little Edie beard repellent in a scene, your favorite place should be infested all over, so you can see all the cats all the time scratching. In the box these two women are called "eccentric" and in this case I say that it is an euphemism for "being pulled out of the tree", but this movie is not really the same thing you feel for something. It's equally terribly fragile, sad and disgusting, but I could not stop watching once. This is not a "normal" flick, but I found it a little interesting. For everyone, it will be guaranteed.
