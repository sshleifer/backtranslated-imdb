To watch this movie from head to toe, watching it laughing at one point requires almost an act of faith because it does not mean "self", "it's old", "classic", "kindness." The film is very bad, but it's very good for the best. This is a historic film. Although it's a classic, it's a mix. I have to rely on people in any case, in principle, if it were done by others, I'm a little annoyed. The fact that the informant is entertaining in my mind is something like a lilac in a foolish scientist who dribbles the orange juice on the tablecloth. Yes, he says to himself that he is a fool, but when he is on the play he is a true savant. At the same time, it is true for the Informer, who is sometimes very scary, although there are outstanding photography, beautiful players, a good score and a good, decent simple story. In the end, I will not, politics, religion and psychology can make the scene mixed up and visible in one place, in a society, and still have life. People who do not read simple faiths (probably brilliant) behave differently from modern nations and the scene is not unbelievable (I took it, but I know Ireland). People behave like this, they say things like that. Everyone is not hip and does not even want everyone to be hip. Are people seventy, eighty years older? And in what way? I do not think so. We are not just different. Now watch the movie.
