I loved the guys I took to this movie (four kids, 9-12 years old, they would give 10 stars). Emma Roberts starred in the lead role. After Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton's love, she was refreshed to meet a girl who was invisible. streets. I also enjoyed a game supported by Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (by Bruce Willis). Last package: Favorite movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I have not read the book series, so my comments are based solely on the film's essence.)
