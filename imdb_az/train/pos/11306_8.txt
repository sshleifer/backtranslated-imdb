The disastrous social situation begins to calamity: a poor Giovanna has ended in trench, but still has one arm: beauty and youth. Bragana, a fat-free petrol stationless tenant, has taken her to the street and presents her bed and home with her swelling. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> However, Giovanna is only a hate in physical contact that is exposed to it and, therefore, is not a philanthropist, but a young migrant worker, finally providing the opportunity he desires. You do not need to apply twice to him: in the first encounter he gives him the physical desire he wants, and then gives him a chance to deceive him without any resistance. <br /> <br /> Even though there is an emerging partnership, it should be presented to Giovanna strict rules. Gino's longing for freedom was suppressed, his desire to leave the place with Giovanna and the desire for a new life away from fatals pushed aside. Giovanna targets one goal: to kill Bragan, inherit and collect insurance premium. In their hands Gino becomes a selfless vehicle. By touching the grace of this woman, she is transformed into a cold-blooded murderer. <br /> <br /> Unlike Giovanna, however, she asks that the crime is at the moral level. Bragana, who fell asleep on the bed of the dead, was deeply annoyed. Later, after receiving information about the upcoming payment of the insurance money, as seen from the plan prepared by Giovanna, he has a physical separation from his beloved and finds comfort in a whore's weapon. <br /> If Visconti's film has ended at this point, it can easily be identified as a portrait of a cool, compelling and dishonest woman with a slight touch of public criticism. But the recent sequences build up the collapse of carefully constructed ideas. Finally, Giovanna is surprised at what she's doing, and with her smallest emotions she can rebuild Gino's love again. Undoubtedly, his killing by an immoral death is simply a matter of his own merciful mercy. It also affects us, but we understand that none of the moving characters are responsible for the disaster. <br /> <br /> The state of a society that defines the path of individuals indefinitely from the beginning to sin. <br /> <br />
