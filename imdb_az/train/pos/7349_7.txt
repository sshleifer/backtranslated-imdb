Of course, you've already seen this movie when you read my review. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I just love a spoiled brat concept with 24 * 7 slaves on my motorcycle. Watch movies, characters, and more. Dress up with it and so on. I love the scene when I'm eating a stone at the dome of the queen. Also Shakti Kapur gives Raja Babu's sentimental expressions on a dining table and a rabbit called "Gharanda". My favorite scene of the movie. 'Achcha Pitaji to Chalta Hoon' scene is among chemistry making a comic scene with no dialog boxes between only two major Indian actors. Its brilliant. This is a cat mouse movie. You can only watch these actors who help each other and take the stage from each other. Its a total entertainment. If Govinda and Kader Khan were like chemistry, then it should be. I think that RB David Chawan is in the 6th place on my list. Before the cruise of a film "Deewana Mastana", "Ankhein", "Shola" or "Shabnam", "Swarg", "Coolie no 1". 7/10.
