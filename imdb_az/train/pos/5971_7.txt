Family Skippy Skippy, in this fairly passionate movie, passed from a clean child to a metal child. The film is designed to respond to all painful parents who claim that metal music has worsened their children or killed them - a dead satanic metal star tries to get back from the grave (with Skippy). If the plot is confusion and cliché, how grim (and big) is the darkness (such as a bad green mist that takes a girl's dress) and noise film. And, of course, there is no such thing as playing a Christian who asks what happened to my darling song like Özzy Osbourne :). It's definitely a movie to have some friends to make a good laugh. And when you're with it, make a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - a black-skinned w / fringe driller killer has a "bad rocker" (there's an expression in the video box). Must be a must have for your favorite movie fans.
