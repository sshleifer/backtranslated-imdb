He is not Michael Jordan! Think of all the wonderful NBA players who are saddened by any good reason, except for career lanterns. Their names are easily accessible to the lips of the people as Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt; <br /> <br /> Part of life is turned down for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and Michael for some other major players who lost their headlines. <br /> <br /> I wrote that Gretchen Molin's career burned Ms. An unavoidable superstard for Mol was released after the predicted 1998 Vanity Fair article. Then they say that he was angry. I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that after seeing the "Devil's Lawyer" in the 97th or 98th years, I was mistaken as actress Mary Ann Lomax played. Was Mol or Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was "The Valley in 2 Days" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> I saw the Thirteenth Floor (Mol) and the "Sweet November" (Theron), but I still made them very clever, but they still took the same mental image. <br /> <br /> Both are extremely capable, sweet faces, similar body types, short blonde hair, and so on. It was. <br /> <br /> Theron, more work was offered. <br /> <br /> Monster was released in 2003, and since then, all films in the film have been awarded the Best Actress award ever since Oscar's release. And worth it! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to figure out exactly what Ailen Wuornos is doing is repeat a digital video trapped at Selby's head. And to make yourself physically attractive for a great talent! <br /> <br /> The Notorious Bettie Page was published in 2005. Molin performance was unusual. Maybe she was in the shadow of Theron. It was like a balloon to mark the victory of the presidential candidate, no one came in and no one cared. It was viewed as an extension of an ancient fairy tale, once a promising actress with a declining career in the movie "B". Ho hum! No, no, no! Wrong! If you think of what the movie is about (and I love the films about the elderly), then do not miss one of the best performances of that year. Ms. Moll was somewhere somewhere like Bettye, Theron Aileen. Unfortunately, Aileen is a more sympathetic character with the filmmaking community. For any reason, an amoral, sociological killer is less embarrassed than a naive, honest, uninhibited, religious girl who lives in a completely safe and completely exposed life, which is more free from crime. Bettie Page was one of the 50's symbols. His photographs and films are never sexually explicit, never pornographic, but everything is presented near kinky. There was no sense of realism, just parody. Ms. Moll captured the very essence of the character. When he wins 20 pounds to add some pods to the subtle figure and shoots for various photographers in the film, his body was Bettie. The lack of any frontal inhibition makes exactly what Bettie has to say. Cinematic nudity normally reflects erotic or sexuality. This film has a theme of innocence. Gretchen / Bettie did not want to skip me by seeing his nakedness, but he wanted to protect people from all the horrors they could give each other. If you go to this movie, you will not miss one of the best performances of recent years. Incidentally, MPAA is embarrassed to give this R rating.
