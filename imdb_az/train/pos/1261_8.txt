I liked this movie very much. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) make reliable speeches, and Harris is very pleased. Some lighting and pull angles in Harris's scenes make the face look really devastating. The stunning turn of the site is interesting at the end. A nice movie, not a pleasant one. I gave you 10 to 7.
