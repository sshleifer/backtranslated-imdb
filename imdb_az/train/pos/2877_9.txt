I do not think I need to explain the story. It has been explained for many years and years. I'll just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella at the age of five. Since then, I've been a Disney child in a good way. The animation now looks like childhood and old fashion, but now it's part of her charm. Now, Lisa Music and computer-generated pictures appear, appear to have been dropped from the early Disney films and magical essence of people. Fortunately I knew this classic because I was born before. And no matter how old it was, when I looked at the VHS, I was five years old. The true magic of Disney.
