Actually, Goldie Hawn is from Washington, DC (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I respect. This Mr. Smith is a type of Washington, with some changes, under the same conditions. I left this movie a couple of years ago because we had a great deal on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but some cocktail bakers are not so difficult to get an important job in the government, because it saved lives of a few great shotguns. It made me laugh and at the same time made me mad. It made me laugh, because some of the situations she found herself were funny and I had to laugh. (HANSIDIR SPOILER AHEAD). It made me crazy to think that the government would set up an average citizen. And finally the output made ... beautiful. Not so bad that many people have such a thing in real life.
