It was a pretty low budget (some scenes that seem to be recorded with a home video recorder). But there is a good plot line and easy to follow. 8-year-old sexually assaulted father, Amanda, is released psychiatrically with the help of a doctor with a secret link. The physician rents a house and rents a car. During the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda kills her and yells in her garden. Then his neighbor, Richard, puts his eyes on her, and nothing stops her. He is acting innocent, but another neighbor Buzz finds that Amanda has been killed by a physician and Richards is trying to kill his wife Laurie (Amanda takes him to a hot tub). Then he acted innocently and killed Buzz, and then tried to kill Richard, whom he liked and asked. And you have to rent a movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. Generally a good movie reminds me of many of my life that you know all the neighbors are falling, and you know that nothing is missing unless they are part of it.
