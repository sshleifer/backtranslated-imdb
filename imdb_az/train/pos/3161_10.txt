I did not start watching the show until I really got to the FX. I was bored and there was nothing to watch and I saw that the repertoire of the show was a premiere, and I decided to look at it. I was very sorry that for the first time t.v. I really liked the show! Finally, everyone likes a show. Complete home and family issues and step-by-step remember and they showed well, but not quite funny. They simply play with silence on the things that are foolish and laugh, but they do not show up to 70. The show of the 70s was cheerful, clever and realistic. I think it's the best show and I'm very upset that I'm done. Though I love this show, I think it should end in seven seasons when I leave Eric and Kelso. Last season was not just true, Eric was the main character and should finish the show when leaving his character. I still love this show and hope to organize more shows like this on television.
