"Batman: Batwoman's Secret", animated film Batman, is in a fun situation. <br /> <br /> Despite the emotions of the comic books still animated by a lighter mood than the animated film. series. Bruce Wayne seems to be as much as before, but now seems to be few. <br /> <br /> Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by Tim Drake Robin, younger than ever before. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, calls Batman's voice better than the live actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did a job that worked more efficiently than I expected. <br /> <br /> Like the live action in Batman movies, the film lives or dies according to the quality of life. My favorite, Penguin, is here. His design was even more prominent than before, in the '60s, more than the description of Burgess Meredith's "Batman Return" of Danny DeVito. David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for Penguin's voice. The penguin is finally described as a cunning sophisticate, as seen in most cats. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a much more memorable Bane than the unforgettable version of Batman & Robin. Finally, Batman has a mystery of a century to "Detective", "Detective", "Detective Line" (which stands for "DC"), a Revolution for Mystery, <br /> The score is added to the mysterious air of the movie "Poirot" sounds like a mix between the score "Missing: impossible." All this is more entertaining than your mid-size movie.
