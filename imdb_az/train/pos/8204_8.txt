In my opinion, Ani Impact was generally better than Enforcer. I was set up to be a great movie, but then I saw that there were disgusting people and were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The instant idea was different from the previous ones. As long as there are many police approaches around Dirty Harry, this film has gone a different way in this movie. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood once again captured the show as Dirty Harry, enough to say that we do not see monsters so far. . Pat Hingle was welcomed as Harry's newly appointed director, Jannings. Bradford Dillman changed his name to Captain Briggs, who was not distinguished in any way here. Michael Currie prefers Harry's annoying superiority as L. Donnelly. I was personally known as Kevyn Major Howard Hawkins, a young punk inviting Harry. Albert Popwell was great as Harris's friend Horace. Audrie J. Neenan was well-known as a lesbian Ray Parkins around town. Jack Thibau was thrown in a good way like Kruger. Now a really bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's longtime lover, Jennifer Spencer, was harassed by Harry's lover. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
