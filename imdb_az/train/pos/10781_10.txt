Road Rovers was a great show of dog heroes chosen by the Master in the fight against assassination in the world. The show was fun to say at least. Simple and complex jokes that can appeal to all ages. Throw jokes throughout the series that can create a drink game. Campaign was very nice and intelligent. The characters are very original, each one is a very different person. But what has shown to me that the show was the deepest of the characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties expressed in subtext that have never been expressed. Hopefully one day there will be a way to re-launch Rovers.
