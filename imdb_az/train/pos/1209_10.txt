During this kind of cartoon, I'm not shocked to see a movie with a very good pardon. Bring it to the IMDB Sublist for animated movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not contradictory. I do not deny it. However, when I'm in the target age group for this movie, I have not even seen it and it does not matter what I do. People who do this can use the "New Generation", which can be started by the Caregiver family. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie at the age of 3-6 and did not scare me and I was not surprised at that. <BR>
