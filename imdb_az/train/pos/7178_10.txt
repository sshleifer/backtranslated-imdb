SHOPPING OF THE CAMERA IS MY FRIEND is a deceptive movie. This is really a complex idea in the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface there are some nostalgic images of some home movies prepared by some of the high class neighborhood children in the 80's. Darren Stein, a film director, appeared on a video camera and soon became an artistic director for all films. Of course, it's just a few cute kids. However, this is more. The children are struggling with a number of confusing issues facing our lives - they try to understand the world of fear, sexual awakening, mutual love, loneliness, and the only visible adult. Blow up our surroundings. As we are old, we are trying to keep in mind how we will overcome the realities of life when we are small. <br /> <br /> One young Darren Stein, who made this movie more secure, is watching the movie become a general. As Darren manages this show, these little movies are his vision, but they all are informed about their friends, their problems, the overall confusion of the interpersonal dynamics and the horrors of adult life. Many children are home cinema, but I have never heard of creating "little" films about children being genocide, homosexuality, nuclear warfare, and adaptability and companionship. These guys are facing some of the hard things and dealing with them! <br /> <br /> The power of this movie, Stein and Shell, draws on a variety of scenes and draws on the children: --- all are now adults and still friends. It adds a new angle to this movie. How did we contact our childhood friends? These guys are. And many of the issues they are dealing with are still going on after twelve years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - the confession of defiance still provokes a heart, is a very normal childhood sexual experience, continues to be a "sticky" issue among men, some criticisms on the dynamics, team and a member of the team at the center stage! Over the years, watching the progress of these home movies has given you a perfect sense. Darren Stein is the director. No doubt about that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> This is especially the filmmaker, writer and for Stein, who has achieved great success in the entertainment industry as a director. From the very first part of the camera, we see a small gay boy emerging to understand everything. We always see artistic minds and personalities that are not "beautiful" or "careless", and are a brave act of sharing an artist with the audience. <br /> <br /> There are many clear moments, but the most uneasy and complex moments cover a movie that we see here is a Jewish concentration camp that has been tortured and killed by a speaker. We discover interviews and narrations about the fact that the game was played by a Jewish child and that part of the victim played a magnificent child. Fear is a painful state of concern over the darkness and the horror of a mature world that is beyond the reach of children. <br /> <br /> This is more than some home movies. This documentary pain affects the growth, beauty, joy, and grief of growth. Strong things --- worth seeing! <br /> <br />
