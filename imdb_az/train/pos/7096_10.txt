I had the privilege of seeing this movie a few years ago with a scenario and encountered a camera group from a television station outside the movie theater. Then the only words fleeing from my mouth were "Awesome. Just Awesome". <br /> <br /> I want to think that part of my life can be a little better for me, but then I could not do it. <br /> <br /> The story is fascinating and thought-provoking. managers. This is the first time Terry Gilliam shows that he does not have a credit card. After a long, hard fight with "Brazil" with "Universal", Terry achieved what he wanted; "last cut". Terry is a master craftsman, and every shot is a beautifully designed painting with determination and confidence. This is the justice that such a person is not free to try to convey. Unfortunately, such arrangements still have limitations. Although most of the bonus features are not included in the box, the Universal Collector's Edition DVD is just stunning. Among other things, there is an informative and exciting 90-minute documentary about the film producer / producer's sound recording and the film "The Hamster Factor and 12 Other Monkeys Tales". The team checks itself with suspicion and despair by checking some of the creative traps, including screenshots, in the filmmaking process. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to make very little change in the film and make great success. <br /> <br />
