"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) Producer: Mary Harron Player: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson & David Strathairn <br /> <br /> : "R" (for nudity, sexual content and language) <br /> <br /> It seems to be now that every prince has a biopsy related to her life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are now luxurious. The Notorious Bettie Page is the latest on DVD. Gretchen Mol operates as Bettie Page, the world's most popular pin-up model, and is mainly painted in black and white. However, unlike Ray, The Walking Line, and Finding Neverland, this movie will not have anything to do with Oscar this year. This film is not the most emotional resonance in other biopics, and most of the dramatic moments in Betty's life are completely ignored or simply offered. However, this is not a bad movie. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a full-fledged and fulfilling movie - a solid act of cinema. This film focuses more on the Prophet's exciting career and the delicate error between sex and pornography. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Everyone knows the Bettye Page. Do you know him as an icon? Or if you are a simple porn star, you know it. She is a woman who has a great influence on American culture, but she is more likely to find the skin more than it is in a particular era. Now, most people recognize him as one of America's first sexual symbols - a legend for many models, especially for magazines targeting Playboy and other adults. He lived at a time when he could have captured only one scarlet under the rubbish, and Prague's captivity photos pushed the American public in a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < daytime accident is just as brilliant as Bettie Page. I understand that when he was announced for a role, many people were facing suspicions. When you think of a great deal, his name springs to my mind immediately. Now, it will. He played a completely rooted role and drew me with his sensitive and yet deeply involved performance. David Strathairn, one of the best performances of the year 2005, was a new manifestation of last year's Good Night and Success. Despite being used here a bit, it gives another excellent performance. I'm shocked when the screen is limited, but the quality is always the most important part of a good movie. The only single I saw from Lili Taylor was "The Haunting" (1999). Although many people have not seen the movie, I have found it to be a totally desolate, horrible movie, and I always believed that Taylor was as safe as emotional bell Nell. Here, Taylor is still providing a reliable performance. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol's perfect performance. <br /> <br /> After reading and saying everything, I realized that The Notorious Bettie Page could not be compared with other biopics. Like "Finding Neverland" and "Line Walk". They are unmatched because they explain a story about a woman and her career from the beginning to the end. His personal life is designed in a very short fashion, but his impact on the world, which is truly a high point. Are we watching the movie, knowing that the page will eventually surprise everyone and we know the impact of his decisions? However, we rarely have an impact on their privacy. She is a woman who has never returned and is always able to rebuild. After all, he was a great model that turned into a Christian missionary. This movie does not dramatize anything. This hysterically respected page can be cunning moments and begging for forgiveness of God. Running from the rain, shouting, trying to get rid of the dreams of the past, and still not. The Notorious Bettie Page explains a simple story, and it is rare in today's standards. <br /> <br /> The last thought: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie with incredible cinematography. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (A)
