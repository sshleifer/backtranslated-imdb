This movie is incredible. <strong> <br /> <br /> In this film, a young Sho (Gackt) comes from a vampire Kei (Hyde). In time, they create a friendship. <br /> <br /> Kei is suffering from other people's lives, forcing a half-life of the vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie, but it's not nice. The area was very unique and it was contrary to the typical vampire frown. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "</ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; <BR> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <strong>
