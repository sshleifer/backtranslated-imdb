Takashi Miike's next movie, like some of the wild, is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The story is a story of a Chinese police officer with a Chinese parents. Difficult things are like his little brother's wild ass and lawyer. The film is really very interesting and keeps interesting things and distracts everything from the loss of the central story. This one-hour shortage and loss of the film makes this movie less than a movie. (This is a very good thing) It's worth seeing, especially if you do not encounter any strange speed. /> <br /> A warning word is explosive and bad when it is violent. Gay sex has semi-graphic images. <br /> <br /> If you do not have your cup of tea, be careful. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7 or 8.
