After a 7-year reef road in NBC, he decided to make only one last Super Installment. Serial TVs were blocked by a number of balloons with no numbers that they would accept as a blockbuster. There was always a tough, difficult corpus hard. <br /> <br /> The series, "HOMICIDE: LIFE IN LIFE" (1993-99), was a series of series in the "southern part" of the series. It was just too big to get rid of it, but it was too small to get rid of Rabid Ratings Ravings. <br /> <br /> During the hours on Thursday, the hourly Drama presented the best and most brave Artistic. I was there artistic, artistic! Finally, he was convinced that the line for the "Homicide" was the end of the line, finally, artistic, that is, lonely, loyal, pedantic; for this super episode TV movie this 2 hours was created. <br /> <br /> Looking at the events of the past seasons and the parade of regular characters, the Production team came out and proved that they were superpowers. <br /> <br /> What's going on? ?????. Baltimore Crime Command Lt. We see that Al Giardello retired from work and dropped his pin. But 'G' is not yet ready to retire. <br /> <br /> While leaving the city, some campaigns take off and shoots, and an old Detective Lieutenant gets a bullet from a conspirator. She lives, but in a comedy, she is taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news is spreading rapidly and, as it is officially called, we find detectives from the Baltimore Unit, which offers their services and help. <br /> <br /> The manufacturer carries a great view when looking at the prospect and progress of each of the previous and today's silverware. <br /> <br /> The manufacturer incorporates their memory into the story. They succeeded in answering long-term questions, and even offered them for those who did not. The whole story series is the most captivating and original. But at least we will leave as classifiers so far. <br /> <br /> When making everything clean, small, this TV Movie will definitely get our approval. As for "THE HOMICIDE FILM", we can not give it A or A +. However, despite the degree here, he did not consider it a typical weekly episode.
