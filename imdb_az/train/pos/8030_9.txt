It was another great Tom Berenger movie .. But some people were right but another awesome SGT BARNES character .. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in Panama jungles! Billy Zane was originally a Wuss who rescued Private Ryan, as Cpl Upham, but later became a bit more aggressive! Sniper was awsome and should watch the buffs of action .. I remind you it would not have much activity like a fog of action .. I also have this one on DVD and it is excellent!
