Just waves, I hired 12 monkeys in 12 days, because I'm a great Bruce Willis admirer and heard some things about the movie. Some good and bad, but it was one of the two films I needed to attract attention, so I was a little worried. For a moment, I felt like this was one of the movies I had to watch a few times. But I watched last night and really amazed that there was everything in this movie: action, drama, fantasy, history, dark humor, and even a little romantic. All of the actors did a great job, and for Bruce I picked up a lot of credits on his car scene with a psychiatrist, he really came to me. But Brad Pitt was very surprised to see how great he was doing. He did not fulfill his treacherous character, but worked and was extremely convincing. <br /> <br /> James Cole is a man in the future who has been killed in the past and killing 5 billion people and killing only 1%. His people entered it. People are dominated by the animals below, but the scientists send James to 1990 (actually, to send it to '96) to get information about the virus. James, the new psychiatrist. Kathryn Raily and another mentally ill patient, Jeffrey Goines, are placed in a mental organization. He says he will come to them, of course, no one will believe in him, and he will return to the future. But scientists have sent him to the doctor for a year to the place where James had been abducted, but he says more and believes in it. <br /> <br /> 12 Monkeys were an incredible movie. I said that the story was so scary because it was not difficult to believe that we were far away from what had happened. But all the movie was just great, casting, sets, only the whole picture was great. If we did not listen to someone else, we had a Terminator, one day we could waste something worthwhile.
