I think The sentinel will be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw it, I did a good surprise. The movie is not a big deal but it is very entertaining and moving scenes are very well done. This movie is a series like TV 24 or Alias. It was very similar to this series and reminded me of Wolfgang Petersen's retreat. On the line of fire. I will wait for one of the most original and greatest exciting works. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
