Radiofreccia is about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, addictions, and fears. One of the most important decades of all past centuries is a bright film where a group of friends talk about the difficulties in a small town. The film does not make everything happy or sad, it just tells us a story, something we all live. Happiness and excitement, sadness and sorrow. When the power of this story grows to love symbols, it is one of the movies you will watch over and over, Emilia is approaching a small town in Romagna. One day, we hope to listen to the music that has changed the world through the old radio with a breath of sound on Radio Raptus International, to walk along streets alongside Freccia and his friends, to play their dreams and dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, sometimes cry, shock you, and comfort you, give it to you, and get it. Personally, I believe it plays an important role in my life and in my friends, and I suggest that you all watch and part it.
