Barbara Stanwyck aims at this early Douglas Circus, Universal production soap just gives you a shot. The serial is not as memorable as the next melodramas, and it would be easy to watch the movie All Desire, which will be run in the near future with Sir's craft. Stanwyck returns to your family after leaving the US, ten years ago in a small town. There is a mixed feeling about his return to shock his family and society. Some cinematography is incredible, and Stanwyck is a tough-as-nailla and really gives this film a shooting energy. Generally, a good show.
