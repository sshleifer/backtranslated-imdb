Another silent love triangle film, Hitchcock, is a mystery, not too English, very well paced and photographed. Smarter Boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) Circus Boxer "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) returns to keep his party close to Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) to become a tranquil partner. Jack and Gabriel's students at the wedding, many characteristic actors standing in the hallway, and a lot of strangers, shocked the eyes of very long and very short men, fat lady, of course, discussing where to sit on the corridor and the wedding ceremony is entertaining. The rest of the film resembles that Mabel lost and returned to his heart. In the evening, it was another time with the audience and boxers were also decorated when leaving the ring. Camera angles, speed, symbols, cutting - all very stylish and superior. The last boxing match camera gameplay is very gripping. Brisson's good looks are used in a good way; his smile is unaware of what happened around Hitchcock's The Manxman, and is therefore not frustrating. But can boxers have such gaps?
