Sam Fuller's Perfect Paradise Meeting is comprised of a set of low-budget noir vehicles of early Cold Warfare. <br/> <br /> <br /> The Virginia stars remain a transit money, such as Skip McCoy, three times. However, McCoy can not escape his brown finger - anxiety when it comes to gangster's Moll Candy (Jean Peters) 's wallet. The candy wallet has an irreplaceable microfilm roll for the communist movement, and it's the last job for the delivery of old boyfriend Richard Kyle. However, when Widmark dismisses it, Peters must do everything necessary to claim that the film can not do anything at first. <br /> <br /> This is a delicious structure with the character of Widmark, the Death of the Death, real live wire, unexpected and tough, but attractive. When Boutart or Mitchum plays a role that you know about what's going on in your movie: Only an anti-hero protects his moral integrity and is an extremely laconic man who can eventually win Bogart or his trap (Mitchum). You do not know what to do with Widmark, and with its incredibly modern gaming style (movies are always good), it's great to watch. It's about creating a big account for yourself by selling the movie or giving it to the police and fighting the "Committees" on the right side of the law. <br /> <br /> Peters sees her best role as a golden cocktail. Widmark's unexpectedness is best expressed in scenes with Peters; Coming soon into the wonderful tramp (and more incredible - romantic angle flies) Widmark's magic falls, but Widmark varies between his kissing or the collision around him. Lana Holger's lack of glamor (Lana Turner would not work well in this role) is the main source of the film. The sweets are not innocent, but it is very weak, it runs continuously and pours by men. Widmark beat her robbery in the first meeting and wakes him up by pouring beer on her face, but, according to the latter action, she goes to the tender (after a hell of a police officer). Thelma Ritter is brilliant as Stoolie Moe, who deserves the Oscars nomination, but the incident at the hospital with Peters and Widmark should not work. <br /> <br /> Like all that Ritter has shown in the film, she is proud, realistic and honestly honest. His death is a scene. Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting. Fuller is approaching well, and the SUNNY in Paradise is full of cloistering intense shots that worry only the tension of the field. Fuller was not afraid to let the camera go longer than standard Old Hollywood, but with a spine he ran away from Ritter's death to maximize the audience. Cities and unusual, confronted camera angles give a brave, hesitant, contemporary look to stay in the South West. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
