This very good film reaches tension. Certainly, the stakes are of course high - Police and Widmark, a public health doctor, seize the offender who does not know that he is the carrier of the disease before the full-scale epidemic starts? Among the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and Palance, who was a deadly man, who was murdered by a patient who was murdered, the plot elements were smaller - the tension in each area - between Widmark and the captain of the police, smuggling a number of valuable goods among Widmark and his wife through the public and the public about the danger and the situation in which the situation is closer to preventing a full-scale panic. The film is beautifully drawn by the Kazan, with beautiful choreography in New Orleans, and the Palance ends at a stunning peak fleeing like a mouse coming through the city's docks and warehouses. The comment is striking, and perhaps the best of what I've heard is a film workshops and movies in the 1950s, such as cinematography, shooting and illumination, production design, small rolled-outs of non-professional actors, and ironies and parallels in the field. Follow the movie once to enjoy it, if you are interested in filming, comment it for the second time.
