Aditya (Kumar), a toy industry, the son of the millions of merchants, the son of Ishwan (Bachan), in the eyes of Ishwar, Aditya, can not do anything wrong, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah), son of Ishwar is responsible for late work, because Ishwar is married to the lung cancer patient and his son Mitali (Chopra) and only 9 months after his marriage, Ishwar attends Aditya, but when the happy couple Aditya Mitali returns from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant, Aditya does not know that her father has been exposed to lung cancer, and she does not know that her father threw herself out of the hose to assume her more responsibility, with Ishwar, Aditya, a hungry and pregnant spouse he said he would die. <br /> <br /> Aditya can do her best to prove her father when she's a great break in the film's art. <br /> <This film is absolutely brilliant, this is a breakthrough in Indian cinema needed for the Bollywood industry, the director of the Shah is almost impeccable, but there are no defects in the film? The best part is the relationship between the father and the son of a tearjer. the song's intervention is only set at the right time, the scenery is good, the only part of the film's failure is that the jokes that occur between Boman Iran and Rajpal Yadav are very long, and after a while they are heartfelt, generally a bright film, I advise everyone to go and watch regardless of whether. 9/10
