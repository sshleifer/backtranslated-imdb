A beautiful film full of excellent performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. Something that really distinguishes the film, but it does not happen in sadness. Stories are highlighted by fear of losing jobs, loneliness, suicide, frustration, losing jobs in a world that is causing catastrophic consequences. Most importantly, it was created in a world where there was no disintegration, with the beginning of the Second World War. If you compare the percentage of difficult scenes to comic scenes, the film is actually a movie. Listen to the hard work of Margaret Sullivan's Jimmy Stewart and explain his terrible statement because his comments are a remarkable blend of "poetry and morality." It is funny, noteworthy and sad at a time. It has become a great achievement and one of the best screen comedies.
