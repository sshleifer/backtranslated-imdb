A friend of mine recommended this movie, referring to vocal and intellectual similarities with Des Howl, the main character of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a very unique job. This is just a movie. There is more to a resemblance True is not meant for romance, content, or shooting style or dialogue tempo (Whale Music is just more, better, more comfortable), but instead also represents modern love stories. <br /> <br /> Generally, I am a big fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example, I recommend Hard Core Logo) and especially this movie. This is an innocent attraction, Des is not always the most unpleasant person, but there is something about it, which implies an empathy.
