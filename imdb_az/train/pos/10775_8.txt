Beautiful movie, a great soundtrack covering the rock landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation, describes the life of a small village near Correggio (Ligabue hometown, a singer who inspired the movie), describes the lives of young people and their problems around the world. Trainspotting reminiscent of a little Italian touch.
