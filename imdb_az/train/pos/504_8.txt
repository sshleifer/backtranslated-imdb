OK, Star Trek's new history was not good. The next generation was put out in the last few seasons, and DS9 bravely stayed in no place before, and Voyager began to go badly and did not really live up to its promise. So when they announced a new Star Trek series, I had no high expectations. And the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Indeed, my husband's entirely uneven lotion from the room was a friction scene. <br /> <br /> However, this area was strong and good. Heroes may still be well rounded and always seem unexpected. The volcanoes are clearly presented beforehand by a very different theme. In particular, I liked linguists who were the first Star Trek characters to avoid pride in death, but rather to deal with his phobia and fears. The Trek loruna, which is a major problem in the past series, has had a lot of time to shave things like shields, but have a sudden invention of technology and an inevitable plethora of things. time travel news. <br /> <br /> All this has a great potential for the series. They see the universe with fresh eyes. We have the chance to learn how things are like in the next series. How did the Klingon just go through an insult? How did we meet the Romans? How did the federation take place and who is responsible only for its place? Why is the directive so important? <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran, by saying "no one has ever gone before"
