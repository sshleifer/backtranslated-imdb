I saw this movie a few years ago and came to tell you that I really loved it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. Director? I'm not really talking about it ... and I'm convinced that the efficiency is good. In a few words, I have to tell you something strange, weird, or even dark, but it's a good thing. I've seen a few years ago and have never seen it since. I would like to see it again and again. I know I'm not afraid to watch it. Scenes, atmosphere, actors, story ... everything is fine. 120 minutes should be perfect. I hope for a part of this movie 2. Something very bad happened. Jason Patric: You are a human! very good movie. last :-)
