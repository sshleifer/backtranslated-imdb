This film was a remarkable and beautiful goal. The Prince's Oscars were rich enough (not knowing that many people won). I think it's one of the best movies to watch on a DVD as a couple at night. A great surprise: The princess is doing a fine job and is very good at pain on the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good in supporting roles. Very cool, remarkable movie.
