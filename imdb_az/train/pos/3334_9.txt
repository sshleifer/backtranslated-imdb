I liked this movie very much, because I have a husband like this man. This movie is about Lindsey who met Ben in the middle of the winter when it was not in the baseball season. Love falls, but when the spring comes, she gets shocked when she's stepped down to her kingdom <br /> <br /> This is a comic movie full of any kind of baseball I have in my existence. She can not avoid the things she loves most, so it's so funny and why many women can relate to Lindsay in real life. As well as those who are in baseball games as well as obsessed. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie and you will not shoot if you rent it.
