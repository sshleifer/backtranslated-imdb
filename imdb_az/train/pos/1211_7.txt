I grew up in this movie and remembered when I used to play with my brother in the back yard and claiming that we were in care. Now, after many years, I'm going to watch my movie with my daughter and follow her. If you are a parent and have not watched this movie with your children, then keep them in your arms and watch them take care of the moon and the care-of-a-lot! Songs, especially Forever Young, are very sweet and memorable. Parents, this movie is a great pleasure for all children, so they can learn from other people's dissatisfaction! As for all the garbage on television, you can train your children to create the right frame to associate with such films.
