Luckily, watching this movie for the first time you think it's incredibly stupid. However, if you look at the second, third, fourth and fifth time by chance (I am doing hundreds of times so far), you will find yourself spitting and shaving yourself! My friends and I are actually saying, "Do not be afraid of the Black Hats" to get more of our friends.
