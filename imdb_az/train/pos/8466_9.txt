Like TALK RADIO, BOOTH can really be predicted (TALK RADIO, because we know the truth of the incident, because the face - the genre and the basic structure). This is not necessarily a bad thing. So, in essence, the filmmakers will not, in the American version of this story, finally make it pessimistic. BOOTH moves in spite of its (foregone) result, but at each level it is well-designed that you can use a familiar cruise track on one way (multi-stage). This is a strange story of Harlan Ellison, FLOP SWEAT. Clustrofobia is sometimes almost palpable. It deserves a beautiful long look.
