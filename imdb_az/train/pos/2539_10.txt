For true filmmakers, this movie is a condition because the movie works as a perfect little allegory for themselves. Janos Rukh / Boris Carloff is related to lighting and illumination of scientific space events. This can hurt the light or can be used to do good. On the one hand, she curls her mother and in the other is used for the treatment of blindness ("I'll see!" This is a slightly predictable young girl). When Rukh / Karloff is poisoned by the uncertain power of this light, we see that the man we see is a projection in his hands and face, with a glowing glow in his hands and face as a badly damaged face. <br /> <br /> Karloff / Roh has just begun his research, and has a beautiful link nearby. Everything that happens has been kept light in space for millions of years. Because the Andromeda light was erased from the Galaxy at a time when the earth was still melting. <br /> <br /> If this new science fits in with the old culture, there are links in the film: the author, Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religious, local sculpture figures on cathedral Karloff explosions. <br /> <br /> This film is intended to encourage a regime that will last a year before, especially in Germany, and especially Riefenstart's use of the film, to hurt much of it: the will of the will. Fortunately, Mom (Violet Kemble Cooper) remembers the first scientific rule, Janos Ruhu. <br /> <br /> If you want to stand and shout at the theater, he has shot more films: "I see!"
