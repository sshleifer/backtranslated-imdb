Older horror films are interesting, numerous screams, lots of cries and plenty of humor to go with it. The Blob is classic in its work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who wants to be a hero in his city. Going to a date with a girl is quite characteristic for all teenagers. However, if the old man puts the same object into the sky, he ends up being a victim, and Steve is doing it in the best possible way. This film really does it until the teenager's strength. I know that most young people have been overwhelmed when they move, when they are in danger, they must learn to forget about the past and start doing something good for humanity. When the grown-ups in the city learn the hard ways that the "Blob" works, they should learn to rely on adolescents and not allow them to improve their behavior. Oozing juggernaut was pretty sweet on the day and I think it was JELL-O! Whenever everyone tries to put an end to the danger, the city is safer with good old co-operation. Still eat Jello and watch this movie all the time, Jello, Tough! 5 CREATED RATING
