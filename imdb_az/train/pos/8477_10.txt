<br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a kid, and I recently remembered and looked for it. <br /> <br /> If many parents think their children can influence adult and sometimes severe issues, many of my information is unclear. then I love this movie. He taught me much about life and death and brought me many emotion. So far one of my favorite films remains.
