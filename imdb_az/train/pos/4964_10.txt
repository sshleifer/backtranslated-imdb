I really love this show! I always loved the Space Ghost show in 1990! This show was cheerful and I do not believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would shoot from such a funny show. I hope they put this show on a DVD or something. The show is about Mother and Father, who lives everyday, and many, about Brak (Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet), who lives with the best friend who wants to love Zorak! My favorite episodes Zorak was a really good sound, and then his voice never read Zorak no money. An episode I love is a place where Brak and Zorak did not complete their homework and then returned to the market from Friday to Friday and then just missed and then returned home on the day they were invented. There was no present assignment! An episode, Brak's Dad and his neighbor next to them, Thundercleese Robot continues to enter the area, and then a giant worm gets eaten. An episode that loved me was a place where Zorak was standing with a bull, and then a new man took his stand. I also love some of the other episodes! It's nothing to fail to make me laugh when I'm beaten, blown up and zapped!
