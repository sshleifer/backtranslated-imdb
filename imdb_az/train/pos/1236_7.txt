Eddie Murphy is looking for children who have lost their lives because when a very special magic kidnapping is being abducted in Tibet, sexuality Charlotte Lewis calls for help to get rid of this child's self. <br /> <br /> The story is somewhat foolish; it does not feel absolutely angry, even though the comedy likes it throughout the film; <br /> <br /> The Golden Child is a very funny, action-packed and seductive, almost exciting comedy, which, in a very magical way, is really a very attractive, very serious and dark character. <br /> <br /> 7/10 is great for all generations.
