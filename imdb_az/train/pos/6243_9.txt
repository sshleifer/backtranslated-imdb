This is a film about the cruelty of the world. Only because I could be the truth I found my freedom. It also contains many funny bits. Some of the players are unusual, such as Maria Hofstätter. Leaders have tried to portray life as realistic as possible. Generally speaking, sex scenes are not fake than a clear and tougher movie. Although I have difficulty understanding a sentence, I found the movie in its original language with more subtitles than its subtitles, as the actor's great job lost half the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie is the voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter.
