This is still another thing - it is Madhur Bhandarkar. I'm sure why this place will show kids moles *** ion and g * y concepts to Indian filmmakers, but some of these scenes are really disgusting! What's new? A beautiful piece set by Bhandarkar reflects the story of a fun reporter starring by Mrs. Ms. Iyer, the lead singer in the popular film. Different from this movie, it also covers stories of people who have a relationship or friend with the reporter, his room, his colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people and others. his newspaper. <br /> <br /> Caution: This is a better job than Mrs Mehriban. It is different for this role. He plays selective roles but shines in them. She is dramatically awkward and less beautiful in this movie. But then do not have to look at the people surrounding the entertaining journalists? Verdict: Madhurk has revealed a better movie that brings a lot of public attention to detail. <br /> <br /> This film loses its focus and does not know if one's director is convinced of what he's conveying. <br /> <br /> Is he trying to show the joy and glamor of the rich people? or is it trying to show us something that is contrary to the life of a fun rapporteur and the REAL criminal reporter? Does the government and the rich people try to explain to us how it manages the media? or trying to describe the problems and people involved with the use of the child. <br /> <br /> Although they want to be included in Bolivia, young women may also have unwritten rules that they want to go with film directors or co-stars. <br /> <br /> In addition, flight attendants talk about illness and fatigue <br /> <br /> Women and children living in the Caucasus continue to work after bringing together children and apply to extreme measures by marrying elderly people. <br /> <br /> It is just too complicated for a medium-motion film maker that wants to take some stress from your everyday work
