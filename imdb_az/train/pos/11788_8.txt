I really think people are doing this wrong approach. First of all, I find this short film very entertaining and exciting. I just do it for what it is. I think that confusion and mystery are spectacular in the speculation about the guard. Another thing that I was dreaming was, even though it was not a clear story, to enter into the audience immediately, just the tips, the stagnation, and the emotions, did they have such a story? Continue. Nobody else could do that better than Lynch. This is the best lynchianism. Certainly, I will agree with everyone that people starting out with the desire to entertain themselves in a truly creative way can imagine themselves. And in good condition. Lynch is not about it. At least Lynch is not on this side. Lost Motorway / Mulholland Dr. People who are looking to entertain here exactly where you want to tilt and just watch something, this does not get all about it. In my opinion, the Darkened Room is to blend your instinctively with your own instinctive means (picture, sound, condition), mixing with your animal-kernel instinctively. Not talking about any satisfaction but talking about getting any reaction. And, my friend, pure art.
