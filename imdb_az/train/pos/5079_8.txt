Well, firstly, Kaakha means Kaakha to be a part of the Tamil prayer and to be "protected" roughly. On the other hand, Xakhee expresses the color of the police uniform (this is Xaxi!). The Tamil film industry is also full of fully-fledged businesses, any Rajnikanth or Vijay movie is original! <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is a PREMIUM movie that is a great soundtrack. Of course, on the final stage, he is very surprised, especially in the end (this, of course, unexpected!). Gore is a long time, but of course, this is a great movie!
