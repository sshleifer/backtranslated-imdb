This movie has been on my wish list for ten years and was found on DVD only when my partner's grandson was given. He learned that he was excited to learn that he was born in 1930 and that he was evicted from 1939, and that he wanted more information about it - and he was more interested in me. Fortunately, I paid him and I looked at him and cried all of this. Only those feelings, the difference in class, the difficulties and warmth of the human relationships of those years (both verbally and unconditionally), but accurately! When I am an anorak, Arp shoe, ambulance (LCC) prevents the operation of the right color (white) and bombs and the Heavy Brigades. I do not blame any of these memories, Anderson's asylum and WVS canteen have brought everything back. The distinction between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and the war-ravaged London was also dramatically revived In 1939/40, I rebuilt and evacuated from London with this product! The golden job, of course, would never expect more of this detail than it was, but far from the accurate representation of the facts and touched on deeper chords about human reactions and more than half the value decisions of those years. Indeed, John Thaw has become one of the great highlights in the actor's career and in the direction of Gold and deserves better recognition. This is a great movie and I've already ordered a few copies to send to friends.
