I just saw this movie in Turner Classical Movies last night and blown up with Victor McLaglen's performance: in every sense of the word "tur de force". Atmospheric cinematography and production design in 1922 presented the techniques used in the best film shootings in the 40's and early 50's. When awakened by Frankie McPillip (Wallace Ford), who focuses on details, miracles are all prayed by Gaelic. Max Steiner's account is forgotten. In 1939, as in GWTW films, he mastered popular ballads to make local color and space and time sense. John Ford: A movie giant in 1935!
