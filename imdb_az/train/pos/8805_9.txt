11 stories from 11 filmmakers are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (some in the first place), sometimes to Americans, "we've had more deaths than you've been and you've supported the murderers." Sometimes it's really strange (but it's highly symbolic and exciting). I really like Claude Lelouchu (showing that the problems of our everyday life in New York are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (odd, powerful warfare) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, terrific afternoon afternoon optimism) and Youssef Chahine I am very glad that most Americans love this film (the Egyptian intellectuals, peacekeepers, and those who are experiencing moral difficulties in accepting US policies in Arab countries). This shows that we (or they are still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) are interested in other cultures and question their government's past and present-day democracy.
