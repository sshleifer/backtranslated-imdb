"Europa" (or "Zentropa") is one of the most spectacular stunning films I've ever seen. The gray-colored and colorful photography blend is not nearly ... a real celebration for the eyes. Picture Canners was a contender for the 1991 Golden Palm. The award went to Barton Fink (by Coen Brothers); stylistically similar to Zentropa. There's a classroom workout: Hire both movies and become a referee for yourself.
