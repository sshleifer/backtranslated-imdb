I love lots of great epic pictures - I'll spare you enrichment - it's nice to come back with a few beers and sometimes flicking in a simple move. Films leading the plot back. He wrote that the dialogue was so foolish that he shut himself down in the infinite knots of purple print. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The idea of ​​the films have the DUES. but I thought it was one of the better ones in six seconds. <br /> <br /> This is an update to the movie that shares the name. It also shares the image's image, but not entirely executed. What's good about the original is corrected. A better budget has been upgraded, no matter what has been settled. Often such attempts are definitely a complete disaster - so look at the ugly restoration of an Italian business - but here are six of the most outstanding players here. <br /> <br /> Most of the back and dialogue is not much to write about IMDb. Often you will have scenes that if the dialogue progresses among the same line actors, each of them will sing with different entertainment. Many people find this inconvenient; I find that it boosts a smile. Of course, every actor, of course, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall, has the chance to determine his style. (Pitt is also interested in not seeing the first billing here). <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> Before, I know the role of a tough guy, he knows he can do it, but I think he's focused on fulfilling his role so as not to miss out on the move. We know that our heroes will succeed in some way; we just sit in the car, enjoy the trip. In my opinion, many of these scenes have been played with the tongue so far that it has passed on to many heads of people who gave a very bad rating. <br /> <br /> This is generally a movie. <br /> <br /> It is not all that style and is not a very substance - if there is something often exhausted, it would be worthless if it had not been replaced. And for the most part. Magnificent way. I noticed that in recent days, it has seemed a common trend to use sharp close-up shots to make it straightforward. Personally, I find these things tiresome. I prefer films like this, where stunts are not necessarily artificial tension, with tight compression at all times. I have been told that Cage really did a lot like car insurance, so she could go away without losing her insurance (I mean, in real life - its symbol is open-minded) and it shows. <br /> <br /> So, a car can really move, and this is best used in a slow-burning climber final that directs a Mustang to earth's most delightful and fun way. <br /> This film is an effort by "epic, compelling social commentary after 9/11 confirming life." Pacing was uneven, some scenes could be cut off, and all actors were drawn. But car movies are rarely better than that. So if you hate the car ... why are you reading these comments? <br /> <br /> I'm going to take a lot of repetition of any day called "The Flaccid And The Tired" (very simple and urgent). 7/10
