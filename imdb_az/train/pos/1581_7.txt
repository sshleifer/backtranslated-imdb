Goebbels was not investigated to support his motivation. After Stalingrad, Reich decided to make a "general war". It is mentioned in this movie. Part of this was the use of women in the wars that Germany had not previously seen. An SS massacre of women would be faced with a massive social disaster with Goebbels. His superiority was to ensure that the problem was calm as long as the Jewish men could always roll back. <br /> <br /> His other problem was that the "Red" Berlin was never too enthusiastic behind the Nazi work and should be carefully followed. <br /> <br /> Most of the SS troops showed slopes that they did not have permanent German citizenship but had German roots in other countries, such as Lithuania or Latvia
