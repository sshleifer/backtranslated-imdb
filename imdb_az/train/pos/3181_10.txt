For the first time ever, I was able to see this movie at the award-winning Appalachian Film Festival for Best Picture. This movie has a gleeful, well-functioning, well-functioning ensemble. My favorite performances were Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. Also, I was surprised to learn that the film was implemented in a small budget, and there are some great effects with crickets and cockroaches. Writer-director Adam Jones believes he has earned a record for his writings, and he does a great job with his leadership. The audience liked this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laugh. Certainly, it is necessary to see.
