Due to some minor childhood defects, I cast 8 votes for this movie. Moreover, this movie is one of my favorites! At least it's fun to say. Though the shooting scenes are fun, I think Gackt (who wrote the book) receives many of his "Matrix tactics." As you can see, enemies stand there ... wait for the shooting. But this movie touches and always cries. This is a great humor, so it makes me laugh. Gackt, I must say, is a very good actor ... shows a lot of emotions. This was the first time Hyde worked and she was good. The roles are appropriate. Wang Lee Hom is great. All castles will be perfect for this movie. IT WORKS! WANT!
