In the 1970s, many vignettes series, mostly television spoofing TVs, and some excavations in government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, The Dealers, is not fun for me and I do not know what parody is. Some of them are completely different. Especially I am very pleased with the show-show segment. Most of the bad words I know are used in the film, and if you challenge full frontal nakedness, stay away.
