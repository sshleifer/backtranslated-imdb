Farewell Friendly Adieu L'Ami / Honor Among the thieves, the French Algerian veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson, who are trapped in the same basement, are a neat and entertaining tension to return to stolen bonds. Others to clean up the two million people sitting there during Christmas. Natural things are not so simple after opening the ornaments. On the Debate side, there is a very strange striptease scene in the parking lot, Bronson, in the most miserable moments, Brigitte Fossey has a catchphrase like the catchphrase, which has a very scary Fonzie, which used to be the most terribly unprecedented hairstyle of the 1960s (he creates it) looks like a parchment exploded in a high wind), is it a commitment? "I will cook spaghetti, I will learn to love well, I will read Shakespeare!" Is counseling hysterical in all the wrong ways? <br /> <br /> The UK DVD of the Kino Club only introduces English, but it's a shame to have a terrible line / shooting. But on the contrary, it can create an impression or a surprisingly fun and unpretentious figure. Soundtrack, but Delon sounds itself and the rest is very good, because there is not a big problem, especially because wide screen transmission is pretty good.
