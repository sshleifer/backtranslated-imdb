The 12th animation is a film that Disney describes with a classic simple story. <br /> <br /> It deserves a place in the list of Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Not only is Disney's best of works but is happy. One of Disney's most "simple" works is yes, but keeps a certain magic and magic (which is well-known in old Disney). It was an important movie because it saved Disney from a sensitive situation. If this were a failure, there would be no Disney animated classics. Cinderella's Disney's 1 animated classic ("Snow White and Seven Dwarfs") looks like a turning point, because it brings back the genre genre. <br /> <br /> There are many unpleasant characters, such as Positive, Prince, Bruno, because the location of this story is not clear, but I think it's somewhere in France. <br /> <br /> Jaques and Gus (two main mice), Fairy Godmother (for the fairy he is funny), Birds, King and Grand Duke. <br /> <br /> And entertaining. I love your voice. There really is quality like mouse. <br /> <br /> Qus is celebrated, but I think it's a little bit funny when it's funny. Grand Duke is a very cool left and funny. In this movie, I am responsible for both of my most beloved characters and most of the funny moments. <br /> <br /> The prince is certainly one of the most attractive in Disney. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (student) does not need to be unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Prince Philip is "Sleeping Beauty" because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastasiya and Drizella) are no better than her. However, a teenage boy is not as annoying as ugly and selfish girls. The main character Cinderella has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, beautiful and loving. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dresses are more beautiful than given by Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br /> Focus (cats) is tricky harmful. The path to the walk nose to the air, and the arrogant and surprise facial expressions make it laughable. Perhaps, when it comes to personality, it is very similar to a young girl. He is always happy with his relationship with Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for her, because she means a devil and a cats. But there is nothing to know about him. <br /> <br /> Although not among Disney's best, the soundtrack is simple, but pleasant. The best song of this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> Among them are James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. Although it's simple, the film has a good artwork as well as its beautiful details. , although nothing is "this-world". However, King Palace is a magnificent work, truly outstanding and magnificent.
