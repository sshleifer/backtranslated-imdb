Whatever I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophrenic 2 series ... you will probably not be able to get away from it even if you are not strictly detached from the PC or the sense of humor remotely. It's not a comedy but a "fear" movie, as it's a sick and disgusting movie. When it comes to the point where it is funny, if you are able to appreciate one of the most extreme restrictions you can imagine with good taste and political honesty, you have to see it in order to believe it. This movie came out of control of a very large movie studio with a 10-meter box (finally a condom). In my opinion, the best, most extravagant works of art come from underground. <br /> <br /> If you do not remain loyal to the same old-fashioned way of life then they reject it. <br /> <br /> I'm terrific, boring, z-grade, Perfectly good VHS tape or DVD-R waste. I've also seen strange bombs coming from the big studio, which has been completely exposed to millions of dollars. When you get a BUDGET movie from Ron Atkins / John Giancaspo, and all the other "shock" movies are totally hitting the water, you really have to look at the whole scenery of the entire film of Indy. <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie, you can see how much freedom can be gained by indy filmmakers in their work. <br /> <br /> The funny movie has seen this movie and "hated it" in all its ways. It is possible for anyone to watch one of these two, I do not think. So if you do not accept everything you see in the mainstream media, and if you are finally able to laugh in a misanthropic, puppet-colored psychopathy, you should see this. We can only see it for the stand, which is classic. Both Schizophrenia / Schizophrenia 2 and more than 1000 dvds participate in my collection.
