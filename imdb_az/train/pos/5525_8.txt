Many people have a lot of problems with this movie, the story is more entertaining (not based on a true story) or Che (which is not really)). This film is very close to Jon Anderson's Cheli Bio and the story is right. Soderburgh is doing a great job of determining the mood for a decisive mistake that Che's Bolivian adventure is. Indeed, the Bolivian peasant's overall timidity and surprising Che's revolutionary ideas or the impressions of men's suffering with hunger and terrain. We apologize for leaving the admirer of the movie, but how it happened. So do not go to this movie, a Rambo movie, waiting for its true story!
