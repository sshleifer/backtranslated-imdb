This movie was very nice! As I am a teenager, both myself and my friends love the series, so only these films draw attention to all age groups. I advise everyone. My favorite line in this movie Logan Bartholomew says: "golden cheeks", while talking about her baby daughter. He is a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They are well-coupled and have such a great chemistry! I hope they can work together again. They are attractive and are very good actors. Finally, I found good movies to watch. It's hard for me to find good movies, good morals, and Christian values ​​lately. But at the same time, these films are unattractive.
