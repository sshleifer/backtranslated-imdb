This is not exactly a big movie, but I am amazed at the writers and directors to work for a little different. The main theme of the film is the fateful and minor trivialities that make big changes in the future. In some cases, this movie is reminiscent of the SLIDING DOORS movie, though focusing on an occasional event, appearing randomly over and over again, and each one helps for a great result. Of course, a strange bald boy understands all this and talks about it on a short scene - he's a mighty creature, but there is no explanation for him in the movie (like two boys fighting each other) clock tower HUDSUCKER PROXY ). <br /> <br /> Only the Audrey Tautou is shown on the DVD jacket. The film succeeded in AMELIE, though it is one of the many actors in the film and plays no role. The demonstration is fast, the action is good and the result is not bad. One of the reasons I did not consider higher was that some of the characters did not care much and that the film was probably compressed with a few subpages.
