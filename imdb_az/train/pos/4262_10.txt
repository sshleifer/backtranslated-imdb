I have repeatedly seen it before leaving the scene. A favorite and entertaining movie with some of my favorite stars. I only wish I could find him again! Of course, if you buy, you will buy it. Please, let someone bring it back. Fred MacMurray II was perfectly patriotic in the World War II and his leading ladies Joan Leslie and especially June Haver were beautiful and charming. It was music, but also romantic, funny and smart. It was my favorite movie starring June Haver, although I always liked it. His glowing laughter burned the screen, and his beauty and talent were active on any movie. In general, a credit that supports their roles has been given. Well-balanced and light-hearted movie; Just like it!
