Tian's reconstruction is not good. Only in 1948 I was racing on his remake documentary to see the original actress Wei Wei in the classic film. We will meet Wei Wei on Sunday (28/3/2010) following the show of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in the Hong Kong Film Archive. Wei Wei is always surprised by his 90-year-old silver-haired, Hong Kong film appearance. This year's Hong Kong Film Festival is a special film dedicated to the director of this epic film, Fei Mu, and a film from Wei Wei's film is still in Hong Kong. This year, my son returning to 21, was surprised that Wei Wei was so beautiful.
