<br /> <br /> "The Life of a Life" is like a favorite sweater bar - it's full of tiny little bits that add to something really delicious. <br /> <br /> The story could not have been better; intelligent, "heart" (feeling), and each character has a beautiful "arc" (growth or change). Compared to Toy Story, only characters with the "arc" are Buzz, Vudy, who learns to be a toy and opposes Buzz's fury. "A Bug's Life" has tons of funny and cute moments. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <strong> I deserve the "10" I gave.
