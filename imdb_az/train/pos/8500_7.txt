I was surprised to see a pretty low score for this movie. For the first time in 10 years I saw this movie and I remembered why I loved it. <br /> <br /> With me and my children, Michael Keton was a plain-comedian, and you will find some joy in this movie. This gentle comedy - specializes in this kind of Ron Howard - but if this is your job, check it out. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a little history, because it is still important because it occupies the last stage of the global economy. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering it. <br /> <br /> Especially if you really enjoyed the scene, but it's a slow but steady stream of the whole film's laughter. Like IV. dripping That is to say a good way.
