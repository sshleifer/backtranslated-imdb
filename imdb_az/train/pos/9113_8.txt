Probably the first Portuguese movie I've ever seen in my life and I liked it. The area is about how the troops in Portugal were defeated by Caetano's fascist government in 1974 and captured to complete the wars in colonies - Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Verde. Most of the film shows that military officials and soldiers, including the new development and freedom, the resistance of Caetano's men, as well as a new development, the strife of numerous counties, weak nations, and the most conservative officials, including Spinola, became the new president. The Portuguese Revolution may be mentioned due to the movement of several young officers, but for me, the most interesting part of the film for me was that the young captain should develop the essence of Portugal in a democratic way, and it has been a few years since. or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers did not want to kill anyone; Even the most serious enemies were respected.
