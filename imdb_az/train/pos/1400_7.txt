Bogmeister and others nailed it pretty much. Shore Leave is actually the first attempt of TOS's lightweight sci-fi (they will be perfect with the Tribbles with the classic Trouble later on). <br /> <br /> This gave the crew of the corporation as well as the TV audience, for example, the universe causing the dangerous consequences of The Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> For a while, looking for a place for cold, a visible hell occurs on the planet M Class and sends an intelligence team to get a closer look. Soon there are enough all kinds of absurdities - some seemingly dangerous - but a strange blend of all fantastic mystery (McCoy-looking bottle has passed), psychological tension (Kirk stalked, at least sequenced in all series series Trek franchise) , so much of the episode pointed out to the heavy, potentially tragic drama of the first season, unlike the subsequent French franchise writers, the TOS producer was not afraid to go where no television series went before.While sometimes, The only criticism of this episode is that the cast does not know how to handle these new wrinkles on ST topics (especially Shatner - ironic legendary humor). <br /> <br /> The last scene is probably the whole TOS- One of the best scenes I can recall - h m composition, but also in terms of the actor. My advice - as has been watching all season to be seen - this order.
