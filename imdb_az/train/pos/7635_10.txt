I have seen this movie many times and I have to say that I liked it every time. This is Belushi's peak film in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so unpleasant and definite with the general person, but you can not help but have begun to watch. In the film stars have a nice casting game, some were big and others just started. This is billed as a good movie and this is exactly what it is. This film teaches that life is not always bad at all. In some cases, things need to be looked at in a different perspective in order to fully appreciate what is already there. After you finish watching, you'll appreciate more and smile. In my opinion, you do not want more than a movie, you do not recall that it's a charming movie and you will never lose interest. <br /> <br /> Do you have any feedback?
