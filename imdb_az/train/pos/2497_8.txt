Indeed: Drug use, barbarian throws, 'matrix'-esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city, a futuristic city with Asian races and a single vampire - in the same film ... should only be considered by a Japanese pop / rock star. And this is what is a monthly child and much more. <br /> <br /> The whole weekly campaign, which combines all elements of life, can be seen as a perfect theme for the B movie, but 'The Moon Child' in this way draws with a couple of anticipated bumps and strokes. <br /> <br /> Instead of going through the stages after one stage, spiral jumps and crosses the boundaries, looks at the lives of heroes and is hitting a realistic field. <br /> <br /> Heli, HAMI, HAMA, HIDDEN, HIDDEN, HIDDI gossip vampire is a perfect 'Kei', a great deal of character, and balancing Gackt's extreme activity like an orphan, Sho, who loves Kei. Lee-Hom Wang shines like a revived 'Boy' who is friendly with minors Sho. This story takes place around different times in the lives of these characters, their friends, and your family, and simple friendship can easily turn into sadness and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Movement is only visible in time to show non-realistic and special effects, but it is impossible to think about the famous Asian singers who have nothing in common with the film. Actors like superstars have their flaws, and their characters. The film is rarely elegant and finishes it after a very short passage. 'Moon Child' is sometimes quite pleasant, humorous, and even touching too: it's definitely worth your time!
