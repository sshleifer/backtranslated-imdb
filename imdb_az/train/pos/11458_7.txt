Greetings from the darkness again. Give thought to the mind and motivation of the magnificent artist. How strangely it does not look for someone who works for most of us ... whatever the circumstances, the reason for the existence of something else stops. Goldsworthy sculptures are voyeuristic to see live and react to each one. This artist should create it, because it is not for money or fame. This is his lifetime. When you see his failures, your energy goes out like a hot air balloon that causes your body to explode. It is not a re-startling fear, but a power out of work. It reminds me of watching him, creating the nature to capture and feeling painful, though breathtaking. It discusses flows and times in the minimum dialogue, and doubts that the artist and the place are the same. He says he needs a place, but he does not need it ... I do not want to make a difference. Only complaint seems to slow down the pace of a musical account that makes it even better.
