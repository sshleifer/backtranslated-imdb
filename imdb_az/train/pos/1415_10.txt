On the German television I saw the German version of the movie and really amazed. I would generally like to see documentary films, but I can not remember to see the better than "The Earth". I knew some of the scenes from the Youtube videos I found with random scanning. I remember that part of the film was displayed in multimedia stores. After seeing the movie, I know that footage is very popular among Youtube users and multimedia retailer: It's so spectacular and spectacular that you can not only help to look on the screen regardless of nature. documentaries or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitation from 10 to 10. On the contrary, there are more thrilling movies, but in terms of documents, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best genres.
