Trawling with the Sci Fi weekly section of the Local Video Rental Store has lost hope of finding the best movies I have not seen yet. Cypher's rent was likely on a very clever horse. My son needs to point out that I did not see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia.> It is still there. <br /> <Br> Not worried by seeing the current "B" is not exhausted by Science Fiction. <br /> <br /> It was really a pleasant surprise! This is not a B movie. This epic series is a "Blockbuster" and not try to be -. More complete savored area has to be seen several times in silent cinema Special effects are stronger than my only complaint is that the first view of the super helo is a clear leetle CGI but they have the 2nd appearance it gets right, and beyond everything was top notch - they were presented when they were used. Anyway, they are secondary effects. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything about the plot. The plot structure has a Russian puppet aspect which is a bit reminiscent of Basic Instinct (despite the very different content). <br /> <br /> I will say that lead Jeremy Northam is the master stroke of choice. actor Cambridge was born in England, and was forced to listen to her emphasis on this film as a key to a TAD off of a kind of New England dialect. Look at the last bending of the area and why such a brilliant choice! I rarely watch the movie a few times a day -> "he will shoot me, he will kiss me" edge <br /> - this is one of them. And Lucy Liu is just right.
