If I had not even joined the characters in Henry Fool, maybe I liked this movie more. I'm not going to worry about Henry Fool. While presenting Hartley's film at TIFF, he said with jokes that there were many expositions and explanations in the film. <br /> <br /> This film is very heavy in the structure that continues the film's movement. There are many exciting moments, and the movie has the Hartley's trademark having the rhythm of humor and dialogue. I'm sure to provide all the technically good movies and new Hartley fans who are starting to explore their work. As for older fans who love their earlier works, such as Trust and Amate, this movie may go both ways. I have mixed feelings about the movie about Hartley and later on. Hartley's best is to define his stories in smaller cases, paying attention to the intimate and characteristic ways in which his characters interact with each other. Since the late 1990s and since then, the films have been expanded in terms of theme. In such a thing, mass media, religion in the book of life and terrorism in Fay Grim now. <br /> <br /> I do not know if Hartley's talents fit into such a big issue or just can do justice. It's strange that the movie is still a woman who is intimate, looking for a husband she likes. The only problem I've seen with Henry Fool and everyone seems incredibly visible in this movie. You can tell that this film was written long after Henry Fool finished without the next intention. In any way, terrorist areas feel comfortable using Henry's confession as a macbuffin (in the hitchcockian sense). <br/> <br /> <br /> Fey's motivation to find Henry was not just about who was loyal to Henry Fool, but also based on the needs of the field. <br /> <br /> I'm a little disappointed with the film, Henry Fool, who is committed to characters and does not work exactly as a tension movie. There is a lot of mockery and peace in Hartley's approach to the big issue, such as terrorism. It works in the same way and does not work at the same time. All I can say is that you love or hate the film because you know Hartley's work and Hartley's work. An admirer of Henry Fool, should be seriously warned of a disappointment. For the rest, welcome to Hal Hartley's world and enjoy your trip.
