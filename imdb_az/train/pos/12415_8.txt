This was obviously a prototype for Mick Dundee but Barry McKenzie's adventures are funnier. I am very excited and very laughing. An awesome central performance by Barry Crocker, an Australian who occupied England, was upset by her mouthless way of running the pomegranates. Several Brits face frequent brutal observations on Barry's homeowners. The relationship between the two countries is very strange, but in the friendship, this film is emphasized by the last line of the film given by a rebellious McKenzie when entering an aircraft home. "I just love the pumpkin."
