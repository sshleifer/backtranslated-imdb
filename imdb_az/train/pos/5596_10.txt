"Tenant" is the largest IMO movie by Roman Polanski. And I love Chinatown, but this is more original and unconventional and obviously creepy. It's a big black comedy. Some people have shown that they are very concerned about this movie, so some people are affected. Polanski is doing a great job of playing and managing the "tenant" role.
