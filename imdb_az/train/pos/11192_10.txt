I have featured this movie several times in the college and every time I show it, as I increase the number of people watching with me ... in addition to my daughters, everyone who needs to see me again! It takes a little time to get into it, but in the end, the whole room is screaming, screaming, shouting, repeating scenes, repeating the dialogue, and only Pia Zadora's "The Lonely Lady"! The stage scene is staged, poorly written, terrible it is thrown in one shot, which is the smallest thing you can do (small statements, friends), for me nothing is compared to 2 U, Pia ... And I am not the only person who feels this way!
