I have this movie on DVD and we have looked up to thirty times so far. I really should love it, but it's true? Yes, not really. <br /> <br /> I've been in the world before and I love sports. So far I am impressed with a good surf. There are plenty of Riding Giants, and thus I am an absorbent for things. But there is a certain bone in it. (Peralta, are you listening?). <br /> <br /> Firstly, the film believes very little on its subject. Cutting and fixing the waves show that most of them are destroyed. Very few waves were actually buried from beginning to end. The peralta hyper-kinetic seems to be dependent on the incision-rate method. Mavericks in northern California are particularly bad in the middle. A single wave does not burst. Almost all of Mavericks's (about one third of the film) is a charming assemblage of clips with a noisy soundtrack. I can perceive Peralta's effects on Mavericks because the place is a really frightening blend of bone crushing waves in an octopusic open oceanic sticks but far away. Mavericks is not just a bad pickle trip. The waves are really there, even with great demonstrations. It would be good to see some of them. Peralta thinks this is a great sport (and I'm sure), so why does he insist on speaking so much about this subject? Sometimes the editing movie can not be clarified. There is a fast clip in the Peahi section in Hawaii, and I still do not understand. Even though I'm on the slow move on the DVD, the picture is too fast to be decipherable. <br /> <br /> Secondly, did the children who did these things learn to never understand? It's galling to watch the version of the directors, especially those on DVD. These guys sound like girls in two upper valleys. It shows the same mood in basic production. Everything is always "incredible" and so on. Especially a character is simply surprising - Sam Jorge, the editor of Surfer magazine, almost always works in his trousers. <br /> <br /> This film has a great deal of effort. I want to say that their old film shoots and all of them get all the talks. The film is a great story and it is usually fun to entertain. Naturally, in three parts, Greg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton are centralized. There is still an extraordinary use of the photo. In the story of the directors, they say that they are a new 3D technology and they really work. The three principal characters shine in both interviews and water. As an athlete, Laird Hamilton is a revelation. He just rises to the top of his sport as I saw Michael Jordan in basketball. And the story of his father's meeting was one. <br /> <br /> This film could be more than just a few. The last part of the movie gives you a clue as to what might happen when you get a loan. There are several beautiful panoramic pictures of the waves that have a magnificent soundtrack. (The rest of the film is noisy, even though you are an admirer of a modern, naked rock school). In any case, there are two counts ...
