When I was small, I saw this movie - not a "frozen fox". I was totally damaged by that! A cute little fox around the family is watching around. I remember it was bigger than before and very close to small foxes. And I would like my mother to take me out of the theater. I will not tell you what's going on, but let's say that it does not end well for all foxes. I've used Disney-type wildlife films that animals will not really die. Oh, man. This movie could take me an hour. It was a good movie ... I think that was really little and I did the truth. I remember being happy for foxes and seeing one of them died. You can, but do not show your children.
