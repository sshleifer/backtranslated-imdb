Barry McKenzie's adventures began as a satirical comic strip, written by Barry Humphries, and based on an idea by Peter Cook. McKenzie ('Bezza' friends), who has two major interests in her life (at least though) and Foster lager, who has sex, severe, hat in Australia. In 1972, he appeared on the big screen at the first of two visits. Humphrys should have been tempted to attract himself as "Bazza", but he wisely left Barry Crocker (later called "The Neighbors" to watch the TV soap opera). Instead, Hummers played many roles in the fashion of the true Peter Sellers, primarily Bazza's angry aunt 'Edna Everage' (this was Dame). <br /> <br /> Do you know that his censorship classification stands for Ernest 'No Poofters Allowed' when the UPA is UPA. Pomp-hating Bezza said that a Sydney lawyer should go to England to win England's culture to take over his father's will. Edna picks up Aunt, Hong Konga leads a Quantas flight, and then to London. Most likely, a customs officer pays a sack of import duties on everything Bazaar has received, including a Fosters lager pipe. She says: "When it comes to you to leave, Poms suddenly goes out!". An insidious taxi driver (Bernard Spear) enhances the recipe by taking Bazza and Edna first to Stonehenge and then to Scotland. The London streets are bad, and their hotel is a stick made by a magnificent host (Spike Milligan), who says that Baza is putting money on electricity every twenty minutes. Despite our hero, there are some good news; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Caucasus believes in faith pants are a kind of an aphrodisiac, a strange encounter with Dennis Price, a joyous love of wearing a school uniform, a conservative dance in Rickmansworth, infusions (vomiting) is almost an international star and finally the BBC TV Center, <br /> <br /> This is a far cry from the recent work by Bruce Beresford - 'Breaker Morant' and more voiced sounds. <br /> <br / > Some of the comrades came to the rescue boxes, slide 'Miss Daisy', which made the critics 'very vulgar' when released, but this is not a big PC, entertainment. 'Baza' is a disgusting creation, life is three Sophisticated euphemisms ("Percy in Chinese") and vomiting ("Technicolor yaw") have passed into English without knowing how many people came from. Other guest stars are Dick Bentley (including a detective who follows Bazza), Peter Cook, Julie Covington (later Rock Follies) and even future artists Russell Davies. <br /> <br /> Well-named Barry McKenzie maintains herself - two years later. In his premiere, Humphries had the chance to blow up the critics of the first film. That's why it's good. <br /> <br /> Despite being released in 1985, "Crocodile Dundee" has to be more careful. with foreign culture. <br /> <br /> The latest credits (provided by Snacka Fitzgibbon) are spectacular. There is a lyrical love of the line: "If you want to send your brother anger, present it to Barry McKenzie!". It's time to end this look. I have to go to the dungeons to shake hands unemployed ...
