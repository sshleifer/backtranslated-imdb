For the first time in series, short films were featured in cinemas along with a feature film about pulp magazine's serialized fantasy. Known as "chapter play," they are moving images that are divided into several segments called "chapters" or "episodes". Each chapter would be featured in the same theater for a week. As the hero and hero find themselves in the final danger that can not escape from any run, the series will end with a cliff source. <br /> <br /> How will the audience return the next week? save the hero and the hero, and once again brought the murderer into battle. Serials are especially popular with children, and in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday night film for many children covered at least one series with cartoons, telegrams and two feature films. The golden cycle of the series was 1936-1945. <br /> <br /> Zorro was seen in many films, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was great in this role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zorro's victories, as usual, continue, and we are guiding the last chapter in which we find the identity of the offender.
