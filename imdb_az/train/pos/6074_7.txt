Laurence Fishburne is a wonderful player and deserves respect for this attempt, but is in a classy Shakespeare class like Olivier and Welles; and even suffer from Kenneth Branag. It is an Irish, always brilliant, dissatisfied. Olivier knew the potential in his production, and he was laughing at someone he knew he could go upstairs. I did not comprehend Iago's possibilities for the worst of Shaki, but Branagh shows us the depth. It's great to see Venice's thoughts.
