In 1980, I saw this movie at the Montreal International Film Festival (English entitled "Who's there?"). Then he won ... and disappeared. Terrible shame. It's brilliant. Sublime, ridiculous, sad and extremely funny. Scenario is a work of art. For 19 years, I've seen a few comedies (or any other genre) that can be adapted to their originality.
