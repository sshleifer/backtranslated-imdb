This film is a very funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on strike, his father is willing to discontinue things temporarily. <br /> <br /> It was Leslie Nielson's best job. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is very sweet and attractive, and I know that I will never forget her. Do not just miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Such great family fun is very rare. Go to your little bit of lizard pictures with a happy ending! We can watch it for a long time, and I can do it often! It's hard to find a few copies of my complaint about this movie.
