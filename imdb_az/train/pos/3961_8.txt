This is a spectacular sign of Mats-Helge Olsson, king of the Kingdom of Sweden. Rarely there is a film in Sweden of this size and really is one of the most successful Swedish films ever. Who pays them? <br /> <br /> Russia's nuclear scientist Markov wants to break into Sweden. However, the Russian military broke his plans by abducting him and saying he was in Sweden. This deception is their way to see Markov continue to work on nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply of the entire planet. However, the CIA resembles Markov's departure to the west and sends a ninja to release them. <br /> <br /> Experience of Swedish-speaking Swedish actors is a perfect thing in Mats-Helge's subsequent work. This generated cheap b-movie feeling is probably not appropriate for performance. Along with that? Good motion is standard direct video format. The weavers throw a huge cloud of clouds. Thousands of Russians have died. <br /> <br /> People fleeing black ninja suits try to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> Indeed, though, the battlefields are choreographed. When I wait for martial arts, when I say "Ninja," I'm waiting for a close fight. But in this film there are probably two or three scenes of true martial arts. And they are cheerful. Too bad, there are no words to describe it. The ninjas slowly moved, their hearts stopped. Of course, the whole film ends with a bang that shows a special effect budget of four food brands and McDonald's checks. <br /> <br /> What is this decision? Immediately classic. Never filmed so much that it would be consumed with a great deal of alcohol. This is the latest party movie. Video and laugh. You just have to understand that they do not have similar movies. This is the film's history. <br /> Therefore, rating is 8/10 for fun, 1/10 for quality, and 10/10 for accent.
