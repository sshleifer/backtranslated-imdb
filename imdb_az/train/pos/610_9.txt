Of course, this is not a fantasy movie with the expected end and average values ​​of Stardust. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite films. And I'm right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is a fairytale rather than an adventure movie. There is this magic 'aura' from the beginning to the end. This story is well written and keeps you on the edge of your place. Like every fairy tale, there are some defects in morals. Therefore, we know that the wicked brothers do not have the throne, but the innocent boy, who overcomes all obstacles and obstacles encountered on a journey. We also know that true love is a material girl who is superficial and manipulative, not Yevaine and Victoria. <br /> <br /> I have to give Claire Danes extra credits. It literally shines in this movie. His eyes are completely sparkled with his character. Moreover, he and Chemistry have chemistry that makes the novel even more beautiful. The rest of the piano is, of course, the well-known actresses and actresses that make Stardust an interesting and "high-level" movie. Generally, the movie is FANTASTIC, magical places and an interesting sight. The film was so disappointed that it would not be a candidate for more prizes. I need to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
