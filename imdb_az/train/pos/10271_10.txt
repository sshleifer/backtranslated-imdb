This movie is not comparable to "The Sting", or other player / heist / con movies. Such a great film experience means what about relationships, deception, and trust. The heroine of the hero is a very sharp criticism of psychiatry, given that it is so easily deceived and then a final contraction in the finale. Mr. Mamet had a bad experience for therapy? Very Unsurpassed Recommend!
