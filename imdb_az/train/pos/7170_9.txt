HOLES is not a mid-level Disney product - it's often a lot of fun, so usually the cutesy, focus-group is a live action of the Walt's Uncle studio for "family fun" adults. Perhaps the secret of the success of this movie is the loyalty of the original book, which is less dark than your average children. The strike begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a prison camp, where all prisoners are forced to make mistakes in the desert sun. But, as the story progresses, Stanley's tales are associated with a legendary treasure, and this adventure is about ten times more fun than any Disney movie about the whole prison camp. Jon Voight is particularly bad and colorful and Sigourney Weaver is always as beautiful as ever.
