Certainly, the movie Hayao Miyazaki is in the sky. For the first time, I'm glad to say that there is no disappointment. On the contrary, you get the value of your time, that is (despite the concerns of Miyazaki movies), that's great! <br /> <br /> After preparing her early movie career, the castle in Sky, waiting for many brands in her subsequent films, helps with strong (but young) female characters who are forced to grow due to external circumstances; sometimes favorite) with supporting characters. And, of course, the natural warfare of the nature against civilization, flying machines (many!), Beautifully painted coasts? but unfortunately, there is no pig (at least once after I see it). Miyazaki has been preparing for the first two years of the theater, Nausic√£a and Princess Mononoke, a test prepared for his magnum opus. The heavenly castle is part of the two, a mild action of the first 30 minutes, resembles the Conan television and resembles the director episodes of Meitantei Holmes. Here, we get acquainted with Sheeta, a girl who just falls from the sky, only a young boy who works in Pazu, a small village farm. Pazu, who was interested in his amnesia and questioned his connection with the mysterious flying city of Laputa, helped locate the place he had escaped from a group of military and air pirates. When the film progresses, the area becomes even more intense and even more interesting - it puts Myiazaki in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> A composer like Joe Hisaishi remembers the sound track Spirited Away (or vice versa, as it was originally created in the sky), and the composer starts with a very lightweight, more consistent and beautifully adapted to success! <br /> <br /> Even though Anna Paquin's Sheet is a very strong accent (although the actress is still at this point in her career), she is heading to the English dubbing with a good comment from two leading stars, , but builds a devil! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one!
