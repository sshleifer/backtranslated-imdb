This documentary is traveling all over the world. In the desert, it is rare and confused. This shows how our planet is split and how fragile it is. It is emphasized at the beginning and end of the future of the polar bear. After all, its painful future is closely linked to global warming. This documentary is a simple approach to such a serious environmental problem. However, it can easily be seen by young children who are mostly illustrated. Scientists can imagine Al Gore's documentary "An incredible truth," but a sincere document can not be re-established ... what a description! One question may arise: Are we protecting the beauty of our world? This documentary, despite the different contamination in 2007, proves that there is still a beauty. We are trying to keep in mind that this is part of nature because we live in cities and cities. Everything considered as a documentary reminds us that we have a common treasure called EARTH.
