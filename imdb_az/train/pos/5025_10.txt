People, some of you have a cold. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of seeking justification or messages to justify your reality, why not understand that this is a work of art? One story. Entertainment is for God's sake (no purpose is foreseen). It seems to me that most of the people here are trying to be a film critic and do not do well. I'm sorry to be in the directorship of Bill Paxton and I'm going to contact him to tell him about it. If you did not try to analyze the storyline's impossible, you can enjoy the movie only. He made me and all my friends!
