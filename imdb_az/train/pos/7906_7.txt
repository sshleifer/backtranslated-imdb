Gus Van Sant made some great movies. I'm not really a fan. However, I do not feel that Tom Robbins has been translated into the big screen on the cerebral edge of the book, Get Even Cowgirls Blues. Only, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and talent towers. As a result, it just did not work. <br /> <br /> It was said that the heroes were not well developed or that the plot and content were not right. When we read such a book, our imaginations are stronger. We have been taken to different time and place and sometimes worst and / or best thinking and adds to the overall roller coaster of the book because it opens in accordance with the author's sensitivity. Movies can but leave you with less imagination and erasing the emotion roller-coaster common practice. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading this book!
