Very funny. You know, like a comedy. It looks very good as Hollywood Spectacular. So what more do you want? Howz very good about Sally Fields. It is better than anything I see here, and it seems so damn. You need to understand why this movie is a Star. Those eyes! Just like a silent movie star, it's good. In fact, everyone's eyes are very good. I used to be a bad television player with my girlfriend. We'll do one thing quicker than your partner. They do not even bake the soap. Great. There are eyes! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are many terrible speeches, waiting for each one to come back. There's a whole seminar on how to build up with Kevin Klin very thoroughly. I understood? Yes, damn good. So Robert Downey Jr., Slick, enriched his career playing Slimy Executive. Although Cathy Moriarity is not the most talented actress, she is so charismatic and trickier when she's angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg deserves, giving her a little bit of Zing delivery here in her natural time. <br /> <br /> Yes, no one is in trouble. <br /> <br /> Then you have hair. Soap biscuits, finished at the end of BIG Hair Shrubs, so funny languages ​​are a great character. They are bigger and smoother as they are. <br /> <br /> I am sick, self-taught, semi-skilled egomaniacs, that is, I'm sick of films that tells me to care. TV soap actors. Soap bread makes me feel happy, but laugh at me. Thank you very much.
