Perhaps we will see stars that are really stars after years pass. As a French film critic, whose name I run, "There is no Garbo, Dietrich does not exist, only Louise Brooks"; and thanks be to the heaven! Louise Brooks! This is one third of Europe's masterpieces. But at the same time, it is an exclusive film, though not the first French branch to comply with a script written by Georges Pabst (in this direction) and renowned by Ren√© Clair for sound combinations. Edith Piaf had previously been known! The talent in the film and the film, how could not it be a masterpiece? And this is the film. It's a shame, when Louise Brooks returned to Hollywood, she was painted black - very talented on the roadside! It's nice to see Louise Brooks as well as the pictures of Paris streets in the film. In 1930 he announced the young voices of Piaf. I'm never tired of this movie!
