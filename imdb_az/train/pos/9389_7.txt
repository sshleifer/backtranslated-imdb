Red Rock West (1993) Nicolas Cage is a fatal murder without knowing it first, and dominos lead to increasing threats, adventure and misadventure in the wild-pale American West in the 1990s. Red Rock The West is often fierce and sometimes sad, and Cage easily blends with ordinary sardonic minds and caution. <br /> <br /> Generally, yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a terrible, almost unpleasant killer? Yes. Does Cage have a chance? Well, you need to watch and see. He never gave up and surprised for the first time I saw him. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, at the second glance, I was amazed at how well he was doing, how well he was, and at the same time he was funny and funny. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (also helps writing) is more familiar to the television business, but with the Rounders this film shows a hand in hand with sensory areas. It was saved from his humor by way of carriages and cartoons. The bar is desperate, the police suspects. Do not miss a truly inspired community as a truck driver by Dwight Yoakam.
