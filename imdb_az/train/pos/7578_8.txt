Shintar√¥ Katsu, a blind-winged "Zatoichi" in 27 films, completes the Hanzo trilogy with this great film, which opens the love to a ghost Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> Katsu was an ordinary intolerant of those who persuaded those who wanted to steal from the fun, if they were guilty of guilty lenders. <br /> <br /> The great guy's strange hero and ability were ready with blood. <br /> <br /> I'll give it away.
