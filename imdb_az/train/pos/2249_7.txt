I've watched Brigham Young look and have a positive and largely true description of the LDS faith. I think that restoration of this epic journey on the plains would be useful, because many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions that the Mormon Church faces. <br /> <br /> As a member of the Church, the most disturbing part of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me). Brigham deceived "knowing that Young was convinced that the church members were following Joseph's prophet." I understand the dramatic causes of this plot line, though its doubts on this subject are historic, in fact Brigham is also called by the majority of church members to guide it. Brigham did not deceive the saints; but on the contrary, he brought them safely. This point is important to Mormons because it is an important aspect of our faith: God speaks to the prophets today and Brigham Young, as Joseph Smith, was a God-inspired prophet. <br /> <br /> If you do not believe this statement or not, do not clearly indicate that Brigham believes in the movie.
