The "Mouse in the House" is a very classic cartoon that is loyal to its tradition by Tom and Jerry, but full of jokes. Hysterical, cheerful, very entertaining and entertaining. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Butch lives in the same house and the mouse because "in the morning there will be only one cats in this house and a cats holding the mouse". <br /> <br /> If you ask me, this cartoon has a very funny gags. For me the most spectacular, for example, when Mammy's Two Shoes saw two lazy cats sleeping and he says, "I'm glad you're so happy with the siesta," and she hopes that she's not there. two cats. Tom is another funny stick when Mammy clings to himself like a Two Shoes and knocks Butch with a snack of bread and then makes Butch the same toy Tom. Of course, this is even more funnier, the real Mammy Two Shoes appear and both (horrible!) Think they see each other secretly like Cats Mammy and then attack the "back" - lol. Of course, he is sad and once crazy, he is not a mixed person. But Jerry can not win this time because he's leaving it.
