The "Rich in Love" movie is a silly movie about a little strange Charleston, the SC family. Highly romantic, beautifully drawn, well-written and animated, "RIL" is filmed as if it were the old friend of the family. <br /> <br /> A well-prepared movie, RIL, designed by the Director of Driving Miss Daisy, is a somewhat dark little "bedroom" that will appeal to adult audiences.
