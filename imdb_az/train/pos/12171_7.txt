I was preparing to hate this movie, so I believe when I'm worth watching this movie. Generally, stories and gags are drawn, but there is glamor and elegance to film. Jason Lee is not very smart when he thinks he is embraced and does not think his boss / future parent and his staff have not seen him scratch, but he laughs at me. The shades of the film have very little brown, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film's charm and charm could be a long way off. <br /> <br /> Cartoon is also very unpleasant. I would like to see James Blair's character more and more because he was in a very small scene. His wife (who serves as a barrier in the lane) is just a cad. Selma Blair's character is not a difficult thing, and I do not have a scene I thought of, "Why did he want to marry her first?" The end of the Hollywood-ish, but may be more schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> It is capable of casting. Jason did not provide a favorable overview for most of Lee's main work. I just loved Kevin Smith's films, but I could not help, but I was disappointed to see him in these doping roles. And these doping roles are not comfortable at all. Even in this film, he does not look perfectly comfortable, but he helps his two cents and manages every field effectively. But I still have not missed his work in independent films. Julia Stiles is proving why again so damn it. Of course, she is a beautiful girl with a beautiful smile that laughs at me, but she also has a unique charm and a good personality. In other words, its beauty is inside and out. I do not know the name of the actress, but the woman playing the drunken grandmother happily happens. Julie Hagerty also has a small part and I wish he could play a better role, it's always nice to watch. I liked it in "Aircraft" and "Lost in America". This shows that he does not have the same opportunities to imitate his skills. <br /> <br /> Do not put horrifying trailers and even more horrible cash registers. This is a comic, charming movie. Romantic comedies have a sense of the genre, which is ready to be recommended these days, and therefore be able to see a good thing about all these evil intentions. <br /> <br /> My Account: 7 (from 10)
