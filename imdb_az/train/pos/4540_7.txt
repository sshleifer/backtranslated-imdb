This film is a Jay Leno stars as a Tokyo police officer, sent to Detroit as a Detroit police, Tony Costas, and Pat Morita to get a prototype of a car. A man named Derrick Jarryd fled to Detroit, a Japanese man, who hopes to sell him to a car company. Unfortunately, the men agreed to him, killing him and taking the prototype. A terrific Derek Jarryd tries to get away from Phillip Madras, who heads the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) does not have any, and forces Jarryd to continue his partnership. At the same time, Tony Costas's friend was killed by the same people in the same small yard where the Japanese man was killed. <br /> <br /> Toni was watching her husband's garbage garden. <br /> <br /> Toni sets out to find a killer against the order of superiority. Tony is in robbery, without a doubt, to investigate murder. Toni is looking at the crime, though he sends a police officer to Japan and is mistakenly arrested. Finally they are starting to work together. They make a weird pair, and some of the really entertaining portions, like some of the ridiculous scenes like the Madra's single-tapping head, jumping through the front of a car that moves like Pat Morita. But at least in my opinion is a friendly friendly police movie. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he likes that role and Pat Morita is also good. Still, in an action movie, they become more friendly police duets. If you love friendly police movie, 80s favorite movies, or if you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, I'm also coming to this movie.
