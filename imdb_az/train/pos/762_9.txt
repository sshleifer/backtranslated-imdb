Especially when talking to people about the best scenes of the film that leads to a disco called "Roxy", especially when it comes to talking about people. Especially in Christmas time, because "MC Santa Claus" appears. <br /> <br /> Even though it's an old movie, I went to Finland's State Film Archive to test it on its big screen in the spring of 2004, even though I filmed the TV. <br /> <br /> Although many people here spend the ticket price on the big screen, I do not agree with it, and I think that I paid my ticket, as it was on the big screen, especially in front of the movie, an unforgettable experience and it's better than the video.
