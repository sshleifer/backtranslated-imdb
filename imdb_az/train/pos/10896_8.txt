At first I do not think Ben Affleck can draw a really funny Christmas movie, the boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to watch with her and I'm not disappointed. James Gandolfini was funny, but I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O 'Hara was good, the storyline really meant for me, I mean, it means putting too much on the family, but for people who are just challenging on the table, but once or twice a year, and apparently The fact that the premise was good was that the family with $ 250000 thought it was a bit too far from the side, but it was pretty good for me , because this rebellion is the whole way, it shows the class struggle of different families. There are many funny moments, including embarrassing things on a computer for a very young boy. I like this whole movie and will be watching Christmas again next time my daughter wants.
