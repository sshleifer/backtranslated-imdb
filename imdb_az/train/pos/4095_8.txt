Now, my friends like "La Beet" (aka "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be seen in the old continent :) In this film we see all of them: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind gorilla off, non sensual dialogs p. etc.) ... Now, in serious cases, men may sometimes be free, viceral and cruel, Walerian Borowczyk (director) tells us of innocence, sexual violence, harassment and cruelty. She has a fascinating kinematic experience, strange and strange scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploits, I propose this movie. If I do not want you to: "Orloff against the invisible people" and "Altered States".
