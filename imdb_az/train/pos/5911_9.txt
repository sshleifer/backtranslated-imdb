Remember Ralph Bakki? Later, a man named Paramount Cartoon Studios, an animator about Terrytoons, was Fritz Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic Director? That's Coonskin. And really good. Racist, but good. <br /> <br /> This film is made up of a twist in Harlem Nights (No, Duh, this is a business title), but became a lamp of a Disney movie called South America's Song. <br /> <br /> Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) runs away from prison, but is stopped by a smuggler and is being attacked by an armed attack by a police officer, Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone). While waiting for Randy Randy to explain a story about "three boys, as you know, you and your friends", Refining Pappy (Scatman Crothers) does not listen to himself. The story of Pappy is explained by the animation shown against live action photos and shooting. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox (Gordone's Voice) are mortgaging the house of the bank after collecting and leaving the South structure and selling it to a prostitute. When it comes to Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox, this is not all. They face a brother named Simple Savior, who is an energetic revolutionary leader who wants to be the "son of his uncle" Black Jesus and gives "power to kill the scorpions". <br /> <br /> <strong> In the Caucasus, the "church" was represented by John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, who spoke on the stage stunningly with the symbols of Red Zion. <br /> <br /> <<<Rabbit is primarily opposed to Madigan, a sophisticated racist and homophobic white police officer and a bagman for the Mafia, who demonstrates his respect for African Americans by refusing to bathe before the anticipated encounter with him in various ways. they are not worth it). <br /> <br /> The goal, when she sees Rabbit spending, she and her cohorts are taken to Ruby and Bobby, a nightclub called The Cottontail. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When entering under the influence of spiked drink, she later became involved in sexually explicit sexual intercourse with a stereotypical betrayal and later recalled that women represented a racist archetype adorned with racist <br /> <br /> Then Ruby and Bobby The story of the club that saw that it was dead. <br /> <br /> Then, when he gets out of the delirium of being a drug, he shoots his weapon randomly and is killed by the police after hitting someone. <br /> <br /> Rabbit, Bear, Fox and the opponent's boxer hurry up in the boxing arena. <br /> <br /> Randy and Pappy end up with a lively action story, fired by various white cops, but manage to carry on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, this film has the same theme in a documentary film. <br /> <br /> Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this movie, and the unique Tobe Hopper classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, have come out of business. Since Paramount wanted the production and dissemination of this film, Bryanston Bakch was involved in racism. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth the fun. <br /> <br /> Outcome: More than 9/10 results.
