I liked this movie. I thought it would be easy to watch and it was easy to forget. <br /> <br /> <strong> After running for DVDs, I ran away, easily forgotten obv! <br /> <br /> The scenario is brilliant and casting can not be more perfect. Each character has a moment and I was very laughing throughout this movie, the comedic timing was spot-on. <br /> <br />
