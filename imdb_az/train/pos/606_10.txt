I saw many of the Saura films and always believed in his films that included music, dance, drama and big movie. Iberia shows better Sauran, dealing with multimedia concepts and more modern dance and music. Another thing that draws my attention is that dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important in this film: the camera shows different aspects of musical interpretation, not just technical issues, but also emotional experience of the game. Sauran's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is the most aesthetically inspiring film among other works. That's why I strongly recommend to those who love good movies, good music, good dance, great art.
