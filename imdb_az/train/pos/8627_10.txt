My god Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is really worrying about these closest neurosurgeons to Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard's films, but they are not intimidating. All small stories have deep philosophical interests, and despite the lack of money, the directive is entirely in existence (see the "bridge" sketch). Highly Recommended!
