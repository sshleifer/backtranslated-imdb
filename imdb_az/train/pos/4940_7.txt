This film is related to human relationships. Attractive, funny and well-written, meaningful text. Morgan Freeman definitely enjoys the set. And good music. Sun Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really like his performance. Like her, it's a good motivation for learning Spanish. Morgan Freeman is taken on an intimate journey with two extremes that take care of the places he lives in when he first meets with his beloved Paz Vega. 10 About the product or less of life. If you're very happy with this movie, look at Will Smith and his son's happiness. It's not a motion movie or a bare comedy. His all human relationships.
