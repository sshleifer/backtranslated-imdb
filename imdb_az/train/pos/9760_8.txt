I have many memories of this movie, because I first saw two younger sisters in the theater in 1977 and eight years old. As it turned out, there was a failure and now practically forgotten (clipboard and scanned videocassette - never imagined, or unpopular Panavision works are in a desperate state). The film is very sophisticated (SARI SUBMARINE) and, of course, it is uneven. Some heroes and sequences are subtle, some are slightly smaller and more unusual. The sad blue camel (Eeyore shades) and its blue song are really heartwarming. Most of Joe Raposo's songs are simply beautiful. Surely, it is a great deal of fear that is just a fright.
