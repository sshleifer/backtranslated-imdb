These films do not make any ambitious efforts to hide the true genre - the B movie of the campaign. Perhaps at the outset you talk about the campaign's definition. He also gave the order of the pizzeria. But both come together in this film, "Hmmmmm ... so stupid!" then you laugh. For example, in the "16th century Japan" there is a scene that shows several samurai on the front of a temple. On the background of the temple, there are a few tourists waiting in the slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! He could not stop laughing. The leader makes his work worthy, glad, but it makes him funny. You see some worthy actors and you will find others really terrible. Although I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several works and it's awesome, I have to master it a little. The airtime on the film was short. I have seen Bryan Yamasaki in several games on the islands during the trips and is better than in the theater. Anyway, if you have a fun movie, something you need to do on a weekly basis.
