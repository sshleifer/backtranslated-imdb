This movie has received terribly pricing from just anyone who voted here, but if you love movies like Dude Wheres, I say that this movie is for you. If you're into movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id, you should embody a different angle. But I still love this movie and everything about it, even though it's a "kiddy", it's one of my few freinds and one of the few films that I can watch over and follow. ALL MOVIE. This film should be No. 1 of the AFI because it is a high-level fiqh. The only problem with this film is that it is already available on a television channel prepared for television. So, I do not know how to get this movie, I want to buy id for a DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I've been banded for the first time, and if you come, I can fall asleep. this movie is mostly based on all the rocks and thats.
