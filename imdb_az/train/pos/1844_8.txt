It was not exactly sure that tomorrow's operas, which took place just at night, would be another one, but this is a very good show (thanks to a talented cast). Four female friends with different backgrounds come together and share their weekly efforts. The hourly software is watching each other individually through frequently cropped visitors to find love, and makes it boring or unobtrusive. Sharon Little's "Trudi" is a homemaker (a widow after September 11th), a little propagandizing and trying to work with his comrades (a little weaker and more creative in his creativity). As in "Experienced Lynley Mysteries", it's great to see that t.v. is small. Chick moves. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most harmful, but still very sympathetic for women, because he is a wrestler, but his spouse, Hari (Jaffrey, formerly known as "Spooks"), Regardless of the. The last two members of the cast, an effective Jess (Shellie Conn), is an event planner with everyone and everyone, a wild child who is not sexually explicit and lying with Katie (Sarah Parrish). His son sent his career and took away life from control. So, I'm hoping that the BBC is continuing to squeeze this series because it's good, it's different and has a great game.
