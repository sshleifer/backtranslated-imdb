A super-slick fun with a superb script, an outstanding script and a definite fit in the approaching 1950s. At that time RKO produced dozens of classic sounds. But this shadow reflected the time of war to give the Sunni environments of the Eisenhower period, regardless of the value of the downloaders. Films about 40 in the evening continue to move forward. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) works as an admin at Madison Ave. . According to her little girl, she sells things that can not be sold for people who do not need things. He earns good money, but thousands of people live in a cave in a narrow city. So, with his wife Myrnah Loy, shoot in the desert of Connecticutt Village after their dream home. Of course, in the arms of nature, they get more than what they have to negotiate and happily negotiate. <br /> <br /> There is no lifeless line in the script. The printer does not know Panama and Frankin Oscar, but they should. Of course, humor occurs around all popular problems when urban population is building a large house in the desert. Unhappiness is accumulated as fast as mortgages, all eccentric types involved in construction, and Grant are given a difficult time. Of course, no one is less humorously or frustrating than Grant, so it seems that the locked cabinet is a terrible sight. But the film does not have an astonishing high point. Instead, laughter have such experience that they are not peak at any point. This is a real movie triumph for any period. <br /> <br /> After 60 years back, we see that the idea of ​​the Scripture is far ahead of us. Blandings with his servant can not be a typical American family, but post-war emigration from narrow cities was typical. And the future business, like Blandings, is more like a "ad-man" than finding a way to sell more cats. But more than anything, the movie has a sunny optimism. But I'm sure that feelings sometimes falters, but if a better future is in the horizon, Blandings only raises their sleep and carries them. Indeed, life will be improved for many people in the future, so I'm waiting for the film to be deeply resonated with the day's audience. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you have not seen him, hold him next time around.
