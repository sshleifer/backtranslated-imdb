When I talked about this movie, I thought it would have another chicken flick. I was wrong. This movie sends a strong message about the judgments of others. I was deeply moved. I've recommended this movie to anyone I've encountered. No one says he did not go back. Busy also played a great role in this film. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> But after going to the hospital Wow, the movie sounds again. there is no idea why this film is not in the film world. My dream is that this movie will be re-broadcasted and advertised more ... because it sends a strong message for an hour and a half.
