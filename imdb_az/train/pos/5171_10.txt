I can go back, even as an adult and camp to realize my spelling days ... I would have been there too fast. The camps I went to were not so great. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes carried people, but they had horses and fish. Film cinematography was astonishing, especially characters such as Perkins, Pollack and Arkin were comic and convincing. Sam Raimi's character and antiques were priceless. So this movie is desperate without any thought ... I'm sorry to say that because of their dignity as an adult, they have not stopped enough curses or stopped as children. All this made it possible for these people to retreat and become teenagers, and at every opportunity they did something like that. I wish I could. It's funny, clever, beautifully written, brightly painted, and crafting takes me back, so I want to see the scene for a couple of times. Sorta as Wolves and Dances with LadyHawk ... good movies, but actors in the desert become a character. Buy, rent, buy and watch it again and again ... it will never be old. 0)
