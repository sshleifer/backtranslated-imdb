So far this movie has been rated 6.9. Anyway, this movie was one of the finest Indian films I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a film showing traditional family cinema. When I came to the story, I thought very well about the witnesses in the marriage with amrita rao. Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very useful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her nephew does not care so much for her husband Amitha's passion. Amrita is cool, because he wants his lady to love her. Although Amrita's family is undoubtedly a low-grade middleweight class, the Witness family still respected your family, even though it was at a very high level, and even really nervous. We have seen people who are very rude for people who do not think of the standards they really believe are very calm. This film shows that the Martyrs family is ready to look at the great values ​​Amrita has been raised and that rich businessmen are ready to turn their eyes on whether or not they are. Because I am worthy of 8/10 in this whole movie, I would like more of these films.
