Writer Samuel Fuller, Director South Street Pickup is a harsh, cruel, and good film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark), which has become a target for accidentally hiding microfilm and become a target for espionage agents. Additionally, Jean Peters is a harsh width used by his evil old lover, Richard Kiley. The film is the best and the great actor Thelma Ritter who stole the film, though its performance is very good. Moe, as a tired street vendor selling his necklaces (and selling the information), is horrified in a role that he brings to another Oscar nomination. Miss Ritter has been nominated for the Oscars six times and is unlucky enough to win. This must have a role to play for him!
