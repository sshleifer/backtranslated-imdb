Cypher is a clever, effective and exciting movie that surrenders. Its good structure is well presented and content is delivered effectively, but also in accordance with the genre requirements. While a movie can immediately label a science fiction, there is a little more. <br /> <br /> This is a movie, as it usually happens to be a kind of nightmare. so create and maintain a good atmosphere. We are never convinced of exactly what is happening, and we never believe what some of the things we are actually doing, and we are not convinced of certain people as if we were a dream. Does this uncertainty rule us? Hero, and in the previous film, Terri Gilliam's Brazilian bar did not appear in this way. Going forward with eeriness, Cypher presents himself as horrific elements, detective, noir and science fiction, and there is something for everyone and combines its elements well. <br /> <br /> There is a sense of spying on the film that has helped the detective side of the story. The hero around the hero that everyone is concerned about saying the least of the mystery around, and finding that Rita Foster (Liu) character resembles a femme fatale, everything seems to be less of a danger: the seemingly friendly people are not actually helping people who say what they are doing actually use it and those who seem to be harmless are more deadly than they seem to be. Despite the fact that many things around are wrapped around and wrapped up several times, they follow the instructions set out to appear as if the world will end; is one of the most dangerous things to look for, a romantic relationship or the character of Lucy Liu? and she tries to help! (film!) The film protects both sides of the spy war, spying and opposing their employees and oppositionists. All things play like a mini-cold war; It looks like the United States and the United States is a war on the summit and, in fact, I'm black, dark, often CGI-littered on the screen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> It is very important to talk about how Foster's motivation stems and this sequence disappears because he is alive and lives away from computerized, recurring, controlled life. <br /> It has all the elements of a good and well-featured movie. It looks like the first Jason Bourne movie, set in a fantastic fantasy genre, not fun enough, but you can see the similarities; but also released in the same year. As I mentioned before, you can feel this is something everyone has in this movie, and you can end it with a thought that some people can predict it successfully.
