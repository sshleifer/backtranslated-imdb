These men and women are a fantastic fantasy film, how to see the movie. I talked to a lot of people about the movie, and almost everybody loved it and said it was brilliant - most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only film that has polar ideas based on sex. Perhaps, many women have less tolerance for areas that are disgusting or distressing, but whatever, we are always interested in this difference. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and Charlton Heston. It is set up in the near future and the head of the major international Soylent Corporation has been killed. As the film opens, you often realize that this is a terrible and unfair future American society. It is rich with secure apartments and can take all the pleasures with money (including "furniture" - euphemism for money-filled kiosks). At the same time, the masses are poorly weak, unemployed, and often live in abandoned cars or settlements. Overpopulation and smog pulled heavy money and the future looks really terrible! <br /> <br /> Why is a rich man dead and I can not live with terrible truth - this can ruin the film for you. However, the film has a great deal of space and activity and is very exciting to watch. Moreover, Edward G. talks to Robinson on Hester's last screensaver as a curly sidekick. Although not easily depressed or curled, this is a great, allegorical and deep fantasy movie.
