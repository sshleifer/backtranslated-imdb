When I stayed in Japan for six months last year, I first met this show. I found online when searching for drama dramas to help me with Japan. The hostess warned me to stay away from him because he thought I was strange, but I did! Koyuki showed such contradictory character, and Matsuju's spirit was always regulating my day! I first saw "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked it better! <br /> <br /> Although the heroes are interesting and well-developed, I have not changed much throughout the show. Their relationship grew, but they did not really exist. Still, an all-inclusive time was all (even for Fukushima!).
