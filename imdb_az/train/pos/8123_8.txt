KWRice's "INCOME RESULTS" Movie Review <br /> <br /> Here's another miracle full of science fiction movies from another time and place. I'm not just a movie I've seen in cut pieces, Art must be taken in full. This film was made in a dark theater, on a silver screen, with a sparkling reel of the film and an audience to share it. This audience and I was impressed by this movie! A woman living in WW II survived the battle to be remembered and completed, though positive. <br /> <br /> The things that attracted me from the very beginning were the first loans. The first thing we see is "HG Wells" in the form of a thickly-blown block like "Supermen". The title of the film, not the title of the creator, and then the actor or production, will not be passed on to any other person, director William Cameron Menzies is there! Who is You've seen his work from the very beginning, "World Over 80 Days," "Yankees's Pride," and "Walking With the Wind." <br /> <br /> He created Mr. Wells after the Sci-Fi epic opera, but his film footage, kits and design were well-known. <br /> <br /> This image is very effective. I know pictures from many other films that respect this classic. Along with Bugs Bunny, Fantasia, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," "Sky Captain and Tomorrow's World", "Dead Dead Night", "Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy" I know recently, but which names have fled from me. Here are some special effects, and scenes made by CGI are performed with actors, large sets and detailed models. This film was made in 1936 and this is something else for auteururs. Wells and Menzies also worked with Bliss, and the producer worked with Korda to create a masterpiece with warning, warning and sermon. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare actors Cedric Hardwicke, Ralph Richardson, and Raymond Massey speak sometimes, but still hear the lines I've heard. "These toys are nothing when I'm a kid today", "This will help them improve their coordination", "Why book a book, why not read it?", "We need machines, no place to go There is no war, but there is a war! "Alltown's naive citizens refuse to write on the wall An unheard-of war causes the Christmas Eve, a small boy who wants to be a good soldier like his father, it is always an image that will be with me, and this is what the Hitler fans were expecting in 1936. This war does not end. <br /> <br /> The poisonous gas of the air temperature turns into a second action. <br /> <br /> Another dark There is no government, no service, and no one remembers anything about the war and cheering. perceptions, war accusations and oppression, flying planes for existing fuel, and hitting on the street until the loved ones can not surrender. Midway Rolls Royce has a very nice vignette, which is a very important postponement midway. <br /> <br /> These lands include future futures planes. <br /> <br /> This is the third action in the future. The world has been rebuilt with the help of "attractive animals, human beings." Helicopters fly in this movie even before they are invented. Plumber assistant has more uses than Dalek or Glenn Miller. Large-screen plasma screens deceived the masses and incited people to downplay the people. The city's father warned the rebellious people: "Protect yourselves from distress, and be warned!" So be aware that this movie is like hitting me. There are some conscious mistakes and wrong calculations, but the idealism that provokes the thought is worth rethinking, and I want to see this feature again. Others criticize Mr Wells's vision. It is very easy to work with the 20th and 20th, with things related to things, suits and fault errors. Mr. Wellsun is not about "Future Things," but in fact I think about concepts, social trends and philosophical ideals. In addition, we are now starting a new millennium and will not be in the future. This cheap carton is not British Science Fiction, but a valuable epic filmed opera by removing minor shortcomings, such as singing, a whole concept.
