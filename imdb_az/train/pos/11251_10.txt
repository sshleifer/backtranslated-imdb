As the author of John Le Carre, I was slowly working on both his books and their adaptive ways. I saw in 1987 that my local public library adapted Le Carre's work, and I think I know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Peter Egan exhibits a great performance like Magnus Pym, the name is a perfect spy. In the long run of Le Carre's mighty main characters, Pym is also pretty good. Egan plays Pymni (in fact, the majority of writers), as a liar, and sometimes forced to compel one another to live as a "perfect spy". Whenever Egan is not always the one himself, Pimp plays for excellence as a cats always. <br /> <br /> Egan does more than six hours of these miniatures, worth seeing only from their performance. <br /> <br /> Egan Surronding is a fantastic support. Ray McAnally (as Carre says) gives one of his best performances, such as the Pymin man, Rick, who was strongly built on the writer's father. McAnally Pym is one who is in charge of becoming a "perfect spy" of Pim's life and playing. <br /> <br /> Unless McAnally's work was accompanied by many British bumps after several years, it would, unfortunately, be a very short career of a very short career. <br /> <br /> The rest of the supporters are also good. As Pony's friend Peyman's wife, Peyman's wife, Jane Booker, helps Ponyon's mother Alan Howard get Caroline John as a spy teacher like Rudiger Weigang. <br /> <br /> Three young actresses who play Young Eating Pim (Jonathan Haley, Nicholas Haley, and Benedict Taylor), who have managed to become a well-run by Peter Egan. <br /> <br /> Miniseries production values ​​are also strong. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley People can be said to be miniaturized in miniature formats just like miniature adaptations. Places are from Chris Edwards, from English locations to those in Eastern Europe and the United States. Elmer Cossey's cinematography adds to the world of miniseries a layer of realism. <br /> <br /> The author of the script, Arthur Hopcraft, solved his work perfectly adapting more than six hundred novels. Autobiographically, at least in the novel (at least in the previous sections), John Le Carre reflected most of his life in the early life of the PIM. The scandal for the miniaseries is an exception, as Magnus Pym describes the development of a young boy "a perfect spy". Once the miniseries did not move away from the purpose of explaining a wonderful human drama in the context of the spying world. This will prove to be that if no spy trader wants to prove that a gun fight, fist fighting, or proof that the James Bond style can be intense and exciting without the car's pursuit. <br /> <br /> For those who do not pay too little attention to some people here may be several times over. you need to see. A Perfect Spy, a portrait of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally's beautiful production values ​​and a beautiful literary script, is one of the coolest mini-hopes you can expect. Despite the history of the Cold War, this is more. Also, John Le Carre is a low-paying trip, which is a "secret road": the path to the spy who betrays the lie and survival. Perfect Spy as a human tragedy like spy thriller should not be missed.
