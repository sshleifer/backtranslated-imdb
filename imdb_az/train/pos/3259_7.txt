This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but of course, it's beautiful and beautiful. It has been routed in an old way and works well. Sibill Shepherd like Corbin is not bad in his role as a woman who can not get her husband's death. Sexual competence is available. But for Ryan O'Neal, I can not say a lot like Philip, because he is, at best, non-existent. <br /> <br /> However, some heroes, especially Alex and Miranda, have not written enough deeply. After just a few minutes of the story, the writers do not tell us much, because we do not know anything about them. However, this problem was solved because Mary Stuart Masterson had a fresh-as-a-daisy sweater to clarify her, and Robert Downey Jr's mysterious charm. Even his smile is infected. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is lightweight and easy, and why not try it if you love them. <br /> <br />
