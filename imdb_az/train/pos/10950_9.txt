When I first saw this show, I thought I looked interesting. I watched him, saw how he was going around Sarah, the character looks at the world ... and turns around. <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> First of all, and I took it all for the price. Then I had to see the film, Jesus Christ. I think Sarah Silverman works as a primer for me and speaks "language." Like Marilyn Manson, he works hard to give us so many awesome ideas and illustrations, but you understand that this is not an attack. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it may take a few days from today. Your speculation. Although I love many 'smart' shows, I still do not see the humor that protects your enthusiasm. I feel good about my impression, but I can not get it. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad to be in the end <br /> <br /> The creators of this show are working hard, not every episode, just a song or dream sequence, production numbers. These people put something to fill the time interval and ask the advertisers to look at them as a mission to demonstrate the best possible combination. If I had to predict the future of this show, I would say that they would go to the Detention Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled before, and will live in the hearts of fans and on the DVD. But at heart, the creators of SSP, your audience will be there and watch them as long as they are allowed to show.
