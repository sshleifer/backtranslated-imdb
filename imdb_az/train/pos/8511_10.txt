This film revives the term "Spring Breaktime". Hans, one of the group's greasy groups, shows these generations like Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "King of the 1 dollar bet," indicates that he is no longer in Kansas, increasing his shares consistently. Kyle's laughter is truly infected and for ladies (Matt as well), she offers a little eye sweat. The Dwarfs did not justify the Mexican hat dance, as he deserved. Finally, our hero Ed. He still gives hope to everyone, unhappiness, stumbling, confusion, faded people, yet looking for a special person. This hope is a place called Cabo San Lucas. When this subscriber releases only theaters, it must be rented directly, because we all may be related to this Spring Breakamentarions.
