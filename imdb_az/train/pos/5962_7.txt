Over the years, I've seen a work called Rocker Horrors of the 80s, for funny ghosts like The Turla Terror, Slumber Party Massacre 2. Sometimes I was able to put something in it, which is strange, because it's probably the most popular and well-accepted. Well, I've finally caught it with it and this is easily the most scary (but almost always pleasing!) Subgenre. He connects the area with a musician named Eddie, which has been rarely raised in the "Black Roses". She loves the metal of the 80s, especially her idol Sammi Curr (played by the late Tony Fields.) After Sammi's death, Eddie's favorite radio DJ gave him Sammi's latest album. Eddie's record retreates, so he understands a bit tough, and bad things happen to those who insult him. Does Sammi have music? "Crafty or Therapeutic" well-prepared and total hoot. Special effects are awesome, though the laser beams of the 80's are typical. Although I grew up in the 80's and was not a fan of heavy metal, I remember the legend of a city playing a record of Satan's worship. Haha! And I remember the words of my brothers and neighbors who were worshiping KISS and Ã–zzy Shaitan, so it's fun to see both of them as a monster against the direct harmless radio DJ and the resolution. Only if I see this movie as a child! Although the film seems full of fun between idolatry and heavy metal in the 1980s, the audience Sammi Curr can not really find out why death caused by death and killing those who have died. This is the weakest point of the film, but you can ignore it, it's a fun burden.
