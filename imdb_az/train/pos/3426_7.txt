The film is not a criticism, but a comment on how blind to our past. <br /> <br /> Recently, I watched the Winter Soldier and was like the restoration or subsequent watch of Earth Reality. Similar to the Winter Soldier because of a one-sided message, both films show how marvelous we are to involve us in bold argument-making conflicts, and allow young and courageous (and often) heavyweight to overcome this greedy warlike tendency. Both films show that mentality is compelled by young minds and is ready to ask for machines that kill them willingly, but training is a struggle for failing to teach the diplomacy and landfill skills needed to effectively gain the hearts and minds of the people we refer to. As a result, he did not lose a war in Vietnam and was likely to lose the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative opinion is that the film's unilateral can easily pass from the left to propaganda. Think about you, not me, but by those who want to hide the movie and message. A more balanced caregiver would talk to a wider audience.
