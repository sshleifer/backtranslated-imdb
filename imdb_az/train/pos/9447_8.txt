A canoing weekend in a remote river draws the drama of four people. They are Psychiatrist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), immoral Bobby (Ned Beatty) and beautiful Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are great - there is an incredible dueling banjos sequence, an interesting interaction between characters, and a wide screen cinema only by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them is raping Bobby ... and a picnic is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's just amazing. The decoration is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence is happening. To be right, Beatty's aggression has never bothered me - although I'm a good player, I know very well that this is fraud. This film also shows how the characters change - Ed has experimented with pacifism, Lewis is weak, Bobby is disrupted by one of the people he mocked and Drew is trying to calm himself. John Boorman's leadership is also very trustworthy, and the forest and river voices help the mood. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good. Voight management is just fine - it's been better. Beatty is also just OK - but his debut film and he is daring to take on a risky role. Very good, especially when things start to fall apart. And Reynolds is simply superior - one of the best-performing jobs! This runs away even though I'm not a candidate for an Academy Award. There are also ways to believe that Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward hillbillies too. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie - NOT FOR CHILDREN. Try to see an unheard version - the TV version feeds. It is also important to look up the letter box to capture breathing images.
