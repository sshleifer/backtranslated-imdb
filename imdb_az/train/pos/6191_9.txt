As you can see, Hal Hartley's films are shot or missed by most viewers. This movie will not be an exception to this rule. Fay Grim acts as Hartley's Henry Foole since 1998. Meanwhile, Henry's ex-wife (who is always brilliantly played by Parker Posey), all the news of Henry is his shadow job. In all of these, Fay ends with odyssey fighting international spies. The film drowned in the second half. If you were an admirer of Hal Hartley in the past, it should not be forgotten. For Hartley's first-time filmmaker Hartley, you would like to check out his previous films before filming this movie (especially if you have not seen Henry). I was amazed at the camera work, sometimes reminding me of some early Man Ray photo.
