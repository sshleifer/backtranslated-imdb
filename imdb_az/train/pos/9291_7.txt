An interesting view to Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne, the first consul of the United States in Japan, conforms to Perry's armed escape diplomacy agreement. He is not welcome. Wayne, after eventually bringing a cholera epidemic under control by the American ship, is gaining an opinion with Shogun. The shooting is followed by a colorful walk to the capital's gifts, including a glass of Old Tanglefoot. Meetings with Shogun, an assassination during the debate between the Japanese noblemen and an archery exhibition provide an interesting view of the periodic politics. Generally a pretty pleasant movie and how often a man in Duke see a man lose half a size fight.
