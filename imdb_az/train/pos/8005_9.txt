I've heard that this is a game similar to the elite on eBay. The gameplay is really very similar and very addictive. After playing a couple of times, I immediately returned to eBay and received copies for all children so they can join in. I play this game correctly and feel like a storyline in a movie actually, it's brilliant. If you have difficulty investigating a limiting nature of the game in a player's game, simply set up a Freelancer server on your PC (easy and software included) and play with your heart's content. There are so many Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is no problem, and all of this is not dangerous because you do not often want other players. So get a copy of this game, learn by playing a single player campaign, create an online asset and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game, the great systems to explore, and the devastation to find, as well as all other things to discover - hidden planets, worms, hidden bases, are nearly as impressive as the list. You can get fantastic games and get some points, especially on eBay. If not, download it better, not with full written instructions (blue box, Xplosiv red box)!
