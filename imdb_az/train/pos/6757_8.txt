In 1950, Dana Andrews starred in "The Sidewalk Ends" as Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Carl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays New York City Detective Sgt. Mark Dickson is a bad-tempered police officer who was worried about the beatings of suspects in the past. When a man was killed by a gambling club, go to Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner to explore. Scalice's accusation is based solely on Ken Paine (Stevens), and has now left the club after fighting with her husband, not just his wife, Morgan (Tierney). Dixon believes that the victim has earned a lot of money and as a result grenade men have died. She goes to see Paine and does not know that she has a plate at the top of the war, killing her and accidentally killing her. Now he must cover his murder. In addition, Morgan falls for some difficulty; <br /> <strong> After seeing Paini's shot, his father, Ken Tully, was arrested for committing a crime in Paini's apartment. <br /> <br /> This is a terrific, flawless noir, which is really good performance. Strong and handsome, Andrews is convincing, as a tough, but frustrating detective that his colleagues should be one step ahead. The film combines it with Gene Tierney, "Laura", and looks like a bad taste in men who used to be roughed. Little knows, there is another one in his hands. Ken Tully is as stupid as his father, despite some dangerous evidence that protests his innocence. Karl Malden is very strict as Dixon's manager. <br /> <br /> My problem with this well-directed, fast-moving and dying movie ends. When I'm replacing Clean Hollywood and Tierney, I doubt that I will react in the same way. A small criticism by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not find it as terrible as Laura, but there are a few things in this world. If you love cinema, this is something you have to see.
