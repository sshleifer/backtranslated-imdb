I decided to buy the DVD box of the First Season, and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first venture, Captain Jonathan Archer, the beautiful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip are at least excellent at this pilot. In IMDb I note that this episode is really divided into two parts, but on DVD they are only one, so my view is also valid. I did not like the sound of the music I found very boring, but it was an exception to this great show. <br /> <br /> <strong>
