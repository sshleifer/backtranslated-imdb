I was often influenced by Chávez's anti-globalization position, but before I saw the film at the Amsterdam Documentary Film Festival, I realized what you really got. This film tells the Venezuelan elite, oil companies and oil-loving western governments about a coup d'état for democratically elected president Chavez and return Venezuela to a brutal dictatorship. This film should be for everyone who believes in freedom and justice and the rest of the world! I appreciate the Venezuelan people to take the substance and rescue their countries from the Halliburton and the Crisis Regime.
