This movie is absolutely fantastic! If you watch with your friends this may be a very nice day ... Of course, you need to know that the movie is foolish and very badly managed and acted (Tomba / Unziker is a couple) and this is probably the world, but you can love it. We watched it on 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first thing when criminals murdered Alex's friend and he is trying to act as hopeless, and the result is a comic scene from the first category ... And then Leva (Antevleva, a name) "Palassio di giusstissia" and then once the car went astray and Leva accident, which indicates that the car is completely empty after a second! What a magic!
