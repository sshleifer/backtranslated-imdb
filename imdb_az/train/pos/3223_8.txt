Okay, basically this is a popcorn fantasy movie, but from the very beginning it was directed to a great intelligence. You can count 10 clicks developed by the movie, but only about three, and there is a twist to know that several people know once more that the director is your fool. Wolf Russell's actor is truly excellent, and gives a profound outcome from the surprising and surprising character. If you only want something really stupid and want to restore your faith!
