The original censored copy of this beautiful film was discovered at the Congress Library in 2004 and was featured in several specialized cinemas in the world in 2005. Based on my analysis on the Internet, the original nastiest dialogue and innuendos are solid; New York has been removed before the previous release of the state censors or completely re-photographed from the studio. And I've read that a DVD is expected in 2006 and you can hope for one! If we are really happy, this will make a comparison between version 2. The released version of the censorship can be found in the Laserdisc I've seen. Stanwyck rules!
