An investigator notes that he does not seem to be worthless because Welles really says or does not do it. I agree. It is the only force in the film and remains. Operation was a good genius, much more than a triple threat that could be written and managed directly. It would have been an artist earlier. This film certainly boosts this impression. Is a musician, a theater player, a Shakespeare's successor? it's hard to say, but I'm often grateful that his film is full of the film and has been filmed. I love accent. I love the face, the size, the style, the mind, and the games. I love all the movies and I wish more. Especially I love how other actors communicate with him in the film. Many had never been good or at least different, because he was in a solid position. Even when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps with his own intention, he was not able to overlook and made every stage he was in. Rita was a beautiful blonde - a Lana Turner looks alike, but maybe she likes, even then goes to Welles eye and another company for another minute, another movie, one hour for a watch. That's why we want all of us to be filmed because we know that part of it is not worth our time. Look and be grateful for your luck.
