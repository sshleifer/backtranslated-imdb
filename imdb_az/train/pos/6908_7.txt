Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo, Richard Dreyfuss starring Paul Mazursky in 1988, stars titled "Parador Over the Moon". New York actor Jonathan Nolan plays Caribbean in parade to shoot Dreyfuss. When the dictator suddenly died, the Secret Police Chief (Julia), who was in charge of the dictator and the country, prepared Jonathan to play a dictator and distinguished between them. Soon, Jonathan was identified as Alphonse Simms in the palace, and Simmus's prostitute girlfriend Madonna (Braga) said she could help her understand the transition concept. <br /> <br /> Mazursky's Mom, which looks like a Simurg, looks at how the CIA operates in third world countries. The Winters character, a so-called vendor, is actually a CIA operator. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> Actor and dictator Alphonse created two separate heroes and split them both. The magnificent Sonia Braga is as big as Madonna, and Raul Julia is doing a dirty comic activity like Strausmann behind the dictator. This is one of the speeches in any place that knows very well what the character thinks - it can be either pleasant or psychologically at any time. <br /> <br /> She treats Shirvan as a girl and at the same time she is funny and surprised. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, not a big block, is very entertaining.
