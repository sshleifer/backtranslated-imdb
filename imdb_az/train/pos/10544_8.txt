Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and challenging ideas I had ever seen in talking about movies. They only had one scene, one group of actors and one plot. How specific it was that all the effective directions, great dialogues and characters were strange in the labyrinth to deal with rats. The second film, "Cipher" (2002), was about his story, but it was not as good as Cube, but still tested as rats. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a very interesting thing, and Vincenzo has never played once again playing with characters playing once again in an experienced room, locking his heroes in a different space. But a retardation of fantasy (sometimes even invitations and trailers are wrong), "Nothing" is not a blank and bright comedy, which can be called a modern satire about our society and even a non-tolerant world. we live. Once again, Vicenzo admires us with a beautiful idea of ​​a small thing. 2 actors and a sparkling white scenario, all of you have a lot of time and you do not need more than that. <br /> <br /> Although Cube is a claustrophobic experience and Cypher is embarrassed, Nothing is not exactly the opposite, but also hopeless. <br /> <br /> This film once again proves that a clever idea is more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, the film is sometimes unsuccessful, but its main idea is a lot and eliminates any deficiencies. There is nothing else to talk about this movie, because everything is a bright surprise and a different experience since I've been in movies since "Cube".
