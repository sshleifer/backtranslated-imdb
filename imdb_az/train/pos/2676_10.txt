Everyday we can watch a lot of movies, soap ... on TV. Sometimes it is a miracle. A great movie with great actors, great realizator-directors, with real feelings. For me, there are two things everyone needs to see: the first is Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Umid Safar". As humans, we need to learn about modesty, the love of others, the acceptance of other civilizations, and the other lifestyle. We must also fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid judging and criticizing; We must love only the wife of the earth. This beautiful movie helps us to dream to John: Imagine living in peace with all the living. It's hard to see these two films: look at them, but we will be sure that you will suffer, but it's better. Great movie, great actors, terrible story, pain and crying, and better understanding of others. Enjoy.
