Everyone wants Mel-Gibson to see this movie instead of watching Christ's Passion and worrying about strange violence. Although this is not a success in the cashier or television rating, The Fox Movie Channel still finds a real good intention to instantly display it. I loved the guys who painted Chris Sarandon and his students to read in Hebrew. Sarandon, in another film, is not as tall as Jesus, but looks very close to a Jewish man. It surprised me or angered me, as Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate and said, "I'm a Jew, do not forget!" Colin Blakely tried to look like garbage in the eyes of prominent men of today. Miles's rally is comparable to previous performances in Pilate's "Story of the Story," by James and Joseph, and "The story of David." But if you compare Pillis's picture with Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he really reflects the impression of a Roman prosecutor .
