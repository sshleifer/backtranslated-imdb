When I rent a Domino, I must be terrified. I really hate movies that are sensitive to editing and cinematography, and Domino has taken too bad views. Keira Knightley is the only reason she likes her because she likes other things like Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott. I also use fact-based adventure stories. Yes, editing and cinematography were very strange, the story was weak and the player was mediocre, but I liked this movie for some strange reasons. Domino was very entertaining and often very funny. He had fallen from the heart when he was released. Because everyone wanted a very emotional journey like Scotts' latest movie Man On Fire and instead of just having a great fun. I really do not understand how much everyone hates Domino, though I liked it and I recommend it.
