It's one of the more exciting episodes of the Twilight Zone to break the tension of some creepy moments with a few fun and fun characters. Usually there is a garlic vamp "dancer" (Serling is different from his love for this character, as he demonstrates in different episodes?) And there are other different symbols, but Jack Elam's "old man". I believe that "The Monsters Are Connected To Maple Street" or, perhaps, a comic, lightweight version of the 20-minute Twilight Zone parody called The Thing. In another note: The young lover of the episode might finally be someone else - but I think, as it seems, after two television credits named "Ron Kipling".
