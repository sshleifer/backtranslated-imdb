Eddie Murphy Delirious is the funny thing you see in life. We can compare it to any movie, but it's not a funniest movie in a poor film. This movie is about 1 hour. It was 45 minutes and it was a moment when I did not have a laugh. You will laugh a few hours after you finish, repeating the punch lines over and over again. Eddie Murphy's career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming to America, Madness Professor, Shrek, etc.) gave splendid speeches, but this is his most real moment. I have seen this movie many times, and this is always funnier. Never lose its edge. From now on, the performance of each large stand will be monitored by Delirious. ***** and up to two finger up!
