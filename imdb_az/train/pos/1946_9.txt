I'm not a great fan of Star Trek since last 2-3 years. With the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology, I can access the history of all major Star Trek episodes. TNG, DS9, Voyager, and so on. For people who really want to watch each episode through and really do not know them, say, "An Idea of ​​Gross Reputation" is the "Best Next Generation". Because Captain Picard and his crew are fresh when they first appear after Star Trek's hunger. But to be calmer, I value the creativity of the Voyager episodes more than TNG. Voyager episodes are developing over time, unlike TNG. The information provided by TNG is great, but ultimately it becomes old, but Voyager Doctor - now there is creativity! Instead of making the artificial intellect unbreakable and shaky, give it freedom to overcome everything you imagine. Not just a big actor like Picardo, the physician, the space to realize himself, the place to grow, now science fiction is the best way! Endgame describes her as an "organic", a neuro-implant transmitter for the human-machine interface, and even the end of the episode to comply with the Captain's command and create "human" mistakes. Unlike DS9, which is blessed with 2 beautiful women from the first episode, Voyager Jeri Ryan should live after 3 seasons, and I believe it's Picardo, who leads her. Of course, the rest of the Voyager casting chemistry is flourishing, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very natural. Tuvocu is sometimes fond of humor, despite being a volcano. Finally, I am so glad that she has rescued the original female captain - oh, you watch rare footage - thank God for Kate! Over the past seven years, she has become a very credible, convincing and respected female captain. What is GREAT work! Thanks to Star Trek to make Voyager, I love every episode, opportunity, morality, and creative intelligence than our spacecraft.
