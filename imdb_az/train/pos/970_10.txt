Now I've seen a lot of movies on my day, but there are very few selected ones that are very good for me. I am a 19-year-old man who made this film a hit for a young audience. This is very valuable for watching foreign movies. Almost all players are convincing, graphs are worthwhile (you will not care even when watching the movie. Trust in trust, jealousy about graphics would be foolish), the story is well written and <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Someone made me laugh ... many, two, I felt the characters as you think, and the three are a very strange story. At the end of this movie you will feel good. Of course, what anime turned out to be a young kid becoming a great warrior and what some great defeat was bad. This is a very commonly used formula. However, in this case, it may be forgiven, because some of the characters you see 5 years ago and some of the average graphics use puppets, but their appearance is not judged. This is a very touching, ultimate, original, and keeps you in the movie as you would imagine it. Nevertheless, you can compare it to "The Never-Ending Story" or any other movie that will make your ideas different. <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Another movie I gained this feeling, the TMNT way back I saw him coming. There is something about the movie I really feel about TMNT that loves me. So do not be too offensive or offensive, just enjoy it.
