The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (duh) is somewhat small in the story, but is covered by extensive scene scenes! Specifically, Twi draws a portion of the working time and makes this movie even better. <br /> <br /> The director and the star (Damon) themselves have found it difficult to find a story in the last part because most of the latter second film was an advanced story. How did these happen? Movement scenes at one time, but they did something else that I could not figure out, because there would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, it's more than you'll notice! I'm reading the reader enough to make sure that this adaptation of the Borne books is the least accurate of the three movies. If that means you do something: o)
