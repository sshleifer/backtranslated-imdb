The film director, Andy Goldsworthy's art, made her feel closer to the land and water, and felt a sense of proportion - and again she breathed the film back to silence us. "Rivers and Tides" love Goldsworthy's work, and joins into a flowing world as if it were visual time and human existence, to conceal its ability to blindfold. Watch this movie!
