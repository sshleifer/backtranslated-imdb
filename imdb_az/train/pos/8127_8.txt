While propagating as advocacy as the grace of humankind, it is still a striking film, which presents 40-year-old science fictional blockbusters with special effects. It is the global chaos of the Second World War, but for the last 30 years, it has expanded to the extent of the conflict, and then explains the epic tales of humanity, which came out of ruins and vacant places on earth. Acting looks strangely wooden and sterile, but this is perhaps the result of the shocking images that have been breathtaking since the film's release. It is a film that should not be released by anyone interested in the SF genre.
