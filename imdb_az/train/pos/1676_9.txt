Sergio Martin's Scorpio Queue Event is a scene at the peak of the 70s of the genre. An explosion on an airplane leads to one million dollar insurance for a lifetime, but for a betrayed spouse. <br /> <br /> The Scorpion Tail is a fairly straightforward piece written by Giallo's expert Ernesto Gastaldi. However, being a murder, the crimes themselves were memorable and well-prepared. In fact, the violence in this film is very strong in places - one area with a broken glass is especially graphic. The emphasis on violence undoubtedly affects the transition of the giallo genre to more extreme areas. But, as the genre's best films, cruelty is replaced by a good score and attractive photography. Bruno Nicolai's music is reminiscent of The Bird's avant-garde work, with Ennio Morricone's Crystal Plumage, but stronger. Photography helps with the good use of foreign countries - in this case, London and Athens - Martinon, the Assembly and the Acropolis, are able to enter their homes, respectively! There is also a number of inventive camera work, the most effective one is the use of slow motion in a sequence that runs toward the sliding door outside the mania. In this special scene, Martino has dropped a knife-stricken door with Dario Argento's crystal plumage, but there is a murderer trying to hit the blade with a knife again with a knife again. Argento in Suspiria. Thus, the movie itself is prestigious. <br /> <br /> This is a good pot that can greatly appreciate the genre and non-genre fans. The performance is good and the production values ​​are good (even though there is a plane explosion, a bit lower budget!). No free DVD release by NoShame. Both the English and Italian language options are a real bonus. However, to fully evaluate the English subtitles you need to emphasize that you need to be a fast reader at a quick pace. This applies to film and documentary additions. This is a decent addition to any collection of DVD releases, even though it's a small point.
