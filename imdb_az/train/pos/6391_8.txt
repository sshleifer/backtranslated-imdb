He filmed this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (the festival director told me that he was one of the best films ever). I sold it for five minutes. This film, shot in a shooting budget in B & W, is not fun. The player is strong, the text is firm and the appearance of the movie is strong. Imagine, perhaps most of the movies shot at budgets are amateur or staggle movements. This is not the case. Tourette's syndrome has one of the most convincing, gratifying, and funny imagery of a character. Without any blemish, it is made up of others with confusion and unhappiness. If you have the chance, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (I hope to be alive) are desperate to bend their material to a wider audience.
