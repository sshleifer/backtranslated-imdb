The film tells why Joseph Smith stands for and why the LDS Church believes. The FLDS Church and the leakage of Warren Jeffs blended the LDS Church with all available media coverage of a particular refugee man. Jeffs is associated with the LDS Church, but media groups have asked LDS church to comment on Jeffs. Jeffs does not touch anything in the film, but the philosophical views of this film with Yusuf all speak of the FLDS church and their smaller media world leaders. This is a film about Joseph Smith and a similar film. Some of the clearest differences between Jeff and Joseph are described in Joseph's humanity, his acceptance, and his love. Jeff's ideas and thoughts differed from Joseph Smith and the LDS Church and were seen in this film. Jeffs thinks of "Negro" as devils. Joseph Smith, they knew they were children of God, and gave his spouse an African American (former slaves) to get his son's freedom. Joseph is criticized by a member of his wife if he does not lose his wife in the case of his wife, Emma, ​​and if Joseph does not stay with a man and his wife helps him with a job. Jeffs knelt down in front of a classroom full of students, holding one of the polygamous women, kneeling down and kneeling down to the knee. Finally, Joseph joined the law enforcement agencies and always asked the government for help. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie very much, and if what Joseph Smith and the LDS Church think, then this is a movie. And if you mix the Church of the LDS with the FLDS church, you really need to bring your action together. There is not much difference between Jesus Christ, the holiness of marriage, and those who believe in family, motherland, and patriotism in our country. You can find different Protestants, Presbyterians, methodologists, constellations and Catholics. What's important is our message and what's up for us. This film tries to describe it, but most of Yusuf's life is impossible to cover in only a 2-hour film. It was really a great show.
