Sunrise is romantic from the beginning to the tidy generations. The romantic drama of Richard Linklater is that many people do not express the reality of a dream. The film reflects all romance with fame, but not the least of all the family's traps; In short, the film is just one issue, and the relationship with the problem of time is two in the future with a close relationship to perfection. While many relationships are aggravated over time, it is getting stronger all over the world, and is a time-consuming thing. Sunrise is certainly another of the typical sentimental 'Hollywood romance', but it's another aspect that puts forward the claimants of a movie. The story consists of two people: Jesse; an American and Celine; A French girl meets Vienna on a train. They communicate directly and express their awesome thoughts for the television show, and after almost leaving the train, Jesse asked Celine to take part in a picturesque Vienna city on one day ... <br /> <br /> Sunrise is basically for two reasons - is a great scriptor that operates and symbolizes thoughts and emotions, and thus enables us to introduce people as they are in real life. It's easy to believe that these characters are free and that they are real people, not just actors running a script. It also allows us to feel the symbols for ourselves, and not just their heroes. This kind of realism is difficult to catch as we know at the end of the day that we are watching a movie as a spectator and not observing real life; but Sunrise represents the most accurate for realism life exhibitions to be seen on the screen in advance. In fact, a great article does not work on itself and needs great actors to convey a measure of justice, and I am not an admirer of Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; When you look at this movie, there is nothing you can do, and respect them. I do not know if they are in character or just playing themselves, but a movie is good; <br /> <br /> This is the most important thing in a movie, and there are many observations in the scenario that most of them may belong to me personally. It does not mean that Richard Lynchleter's symbols are created and built by him, but also shows that true love, along with many other aspects of life, does not. Not to reflect the glimmering of all the anecdotes rewriting personally to me. Everyone is different and different parts of the scenario will appeal to different people. There may be certain qualities about a person who loves and hates a person; and the situation with music in that script. In addition to the beauty of the film is Vienna. The city itself is not really important for the film because it's just a story that can be seen everywhere - but it's a nice, energetic romance of beauty that blossoms through some beautiful images and movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard Linklater created something unique in the world of cinema; It is a film that suits the beauty of life and can be extremely sensitive. What is at the beginning of Sunrise. And what is pure cinematic shine.
