I saw this movie in 36 years ago (1969) or somewhere near. Now I can only remember the bits, but I would like to see it again. The parts I remember are either true or false, as well as trench gas and Suzie Kendall, a German spy, and some sexy pursuit behind a closed truck to get military information. The music was mixed with the Gone With the Wind, which was particularly memorable and sensational, and I would love to hear it. The reason why this movie is not available is that there are some commercial or copyright reasons. Why Does Everyone Know? I doubt that there is something of quality or interest.
