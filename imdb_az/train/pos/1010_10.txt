I love this show! <br /> <br /> I repeat this line each time I watch an episode, and I well remember how it is a show. I'm a great fan fan and this show has a reason to be the most important science fiction show in film / TV history. There are many theories about the universe in this show that can start a religion. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 years old and I'm so mocked that my two favorite TV show is star Richard Dean Anderson. <br /> <br /> After returning to memory, I love him and think of him as one of my favorite fancies. <br /> <br /> For some of my films, it's great for me, but I did not go for the duration of the fifth season. <br /> <br /> I'm not disappointed to hear what Roland Emmerich and Dean Devley want. a trilogy of the film, but instead chose the studio instead. <br /> <br /> Someone says that's good. Maybe it's even better. <br /> <br /> This show is beautiful and I hope that I will never die. Atlantis comes here!
