I do not expect the audience to have a good understanding of Romania outside of it. This, of course, tells us about the cost or perhaps not the universality of the film, even in Eastern Europe, as in Romania, it tells about a different date and even how life is in Romania. <br /> <br /> The film is the adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who lost her life right after the Communist rule. A philosopher professor, who lost his life after being arrested by false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era, explains the story of a philosopher. The first part of the film tells the story of the survival struggle, and the latter describes it as temporary to recover after being released. <br /> <br /> 60-year-old Romania asks him various compromises and murders, but his struggle to survive is still morally difficult, like in prison. <br /> <br /> The best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who plays the lead role, will be a mega-star at another time and elsewhere, and we'll be able to get a good look at the incredible player art. A film that describes a tough story and sometimes falls in incoherent details or character novels is still an important medium for Romanian cinemas and is in the process of restoring moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
