I really enjoyed this movie because I showed great interest in American history ... Antebellum years, and in particular the Internal War. I recently bought a set of pre-recorded videos on the supermarket, and I am so glad to add this one to our video collection. <br /> <br /> At least some of his films, such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg" of the Civil War Films, provide a long history of cadets at the West Point camp before the Civil War. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, I am interested in youth or military discipline, but from the 1830s on the story of the Cadre Corps, to the threshold of the War. <br /> <br /> In the first class, sitting with other young people is to learn how to fight, and then use their lessons against their classmates. <br /> <br /> In fact, the two classes graduated in 1861: one class in May, the second in June. film Henri A. DuPont will not make any real mention of it, except the first grader of mine class; and George Custer, the end of the June class. The reason for the two classes was not much about the war, but after a few years of testing with a five-year course (I was in the first class) five years, another four). As seen in the film, trainees were brothers and often had a nickname for each other ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Cushing Alonzo "Lon"; <br /> <br /> I say that this movie is "Santa Fe Trail," because the film of 1940, though unpleasant, is really a history of fudges. Young people from several different classes finish together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are described as the best friends and John Brown at Harper Ferry side by side in 1859. In fact, Stuart and Custer have never been friends, but were enemies during the war. <br /> <br /> In 1863, at Gettysburg, they met each other (Stuart Harper's ferry raid), but Custer was still cadet at the point where he appeared. <br /> <br /> "Fanny's Custer plays a role in the 61st class, but his classmates, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton, are fictional. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really enjoyed any movie that provided a window to the mid-century.
