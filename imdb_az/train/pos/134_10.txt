Someone leaves the film on DVD, as when critics and filmmakers look at films shot in the 1990s and see how much they are for them, from ten to twenty years old, like most of the greatest movies of all time, Lars Von Trier tried to revolutionize and animate the world of this masterpiece. Thus, Zentropa (or Europa is outside of the US) is one of the most fascinating and artistic ideas of the uncertainty and almost psychotic uncertainty beyond the WWII European post. physical horrors only fit into the mind of his people. Von Trier takes a blind eye on the screen. From the late 1940s, you feel as if you're watching a class of espionage with a black and white scene and at the same time you feel you are on the edge of something prejudicial, especially in scenes like conspiracy. In fact, when you see this movie, you are witnessing the evolution of an art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Von Trier was soon captured in his native movement. His "Waves Breaking" and "Dancer in the Dark" are some of the classic ones, and together with Zentropa, he has actually raised the film art in new and exciting heights. 10/10, begging for a wet wet and a DVD release.
