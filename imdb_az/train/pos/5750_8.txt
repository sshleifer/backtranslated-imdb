But the rest of the love-loving sentimental and emotional story that has a lock to try to cry us ... happy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is a spectacular slow-gauge Dominick who plays a professional wrestling and brother Eugene, a doctor and long-running Ray Liotta. <br /> <br /> According to Eugene's work plan, Dominic is just a long time trying to make a suspicious decision. She really wants to be a good boy, do something right and give her brother pride. He stops the church to worship somewhere, and the joke clearly expresses his feelings when crying for character before the film begins. <br /> Do not give anything here, but the movie is extremely attractive and sad and hearty. Those who fear these things will have this wonderful story, their favorite characters, and a great song that I can not quote from here, the film has nothing to do but it's strange ... but you've heard it in the bar <br /> <br /> I'm Tom Hulce I thought it would be a candidate for the film, because for Amadeus, I thought it could give him an inner way to really win. There is no such chance. Liotta is also good, but less emotional, but then later. About Jamie Lee Curtis, I can say that there is no part here, but it was nice for her to name a small drama in Pittsburgh about two brothers who would never forget.
