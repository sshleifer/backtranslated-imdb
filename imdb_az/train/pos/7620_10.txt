Lost is the best television series. Initially, it has GREAT actors and fine leadership. Writing is a very controversial issue because the first two seasons were unusual, but after the 3rd season, the writing was very complicated. For example, who is Jacob? Why are the polar bears on the island? What is the mouse? How did you disappear on the island? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people think that writers have lost and raised many questions and secrets, they will not be able to explain. I believe these people are wrong. I trust the writers. When you get over your secrets, the whole appeal of the series has gone. Anyway, it's missing, the biggest television series will last for a long time.
