Solino really moved me with a deep-drawn character. Although it is a simple story of competition between the two brothers, it's not just about hate or jealousy. What I like most about the movie is how to define your feelings, especially when you go back to Gigi's mother's return to Italy's home and to avoid participating in the festival movies when the movie is included. It was so frustrating to see this character who was struggling with her artistic dreams and concepts from birth. Even when he tried to reach his father, he was so brave. As in real life, most fathers will not go through their walls to reach their children. Even Giancarlo, a self-confident and brother-in-law, had many insults. It made me laugh and cried that it was a really nice movie.
