When I found a film in the movie's schedule, my head did not know me because I did not read my novel or heard about the movie. But as I read the content, I decided to spend my Christmas evening watching my movie. The effect has completely surprised me: I do not remember when I see a movie that attracts me every moment. For CHERISH, VOW is undoubtedly one of the most exciting films I have ever received from movies. Here are some of my films, and I think this movie is a high-quality movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, content is particularly educated. There is something to offer to a modern audience - right answers and answers to universal questions. Do We Need Christ in Our Time? Is Love Still Important? Why do you have faith? What is the logic of burden and torment in life? Can someone really trust me? <br /> <br /> The main heroes live in internal struggles and deal with extremely challenging decisions. Kyle is good for David Denman) and Teri (Megan Paul) to start their own lives and forget about the family or maintain their values ​​at home? Is it good to leave John Howard, a sick wife Ellen (Barbara Babcock), and start a good lover with Julia (Donna Bullock) with a lover? In fact, Ellen already knows him ... But he decides to give HIS WIFE an endless loyalty. John's disobedient brother, Phil (D. David Morin), despite his happiness, continued to live better or to think seriously about his life. Phil's prayer in the park is a universal psychological work of humanity. Thirdly, this is not very popular today, it's a great illustration of the family: there are problems, but there is still something that is stronger than ever to bring these people together. This "one thing" is love and confidence. I know it might seem a little idealistic. All families will not trust loyalty and can not be so simple. However, this is a very educational and realistic one. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the film focuses on the mutual aid of people. If you want to live a happy life in our society, you have to understand one thing: we need to help each other. Iskender (Ossie Davis) is an example of this kind of attitude. At the start of the film, we talk to him about praying to Jacob. He then helps his brother. Alexander the Great is a "angel" to John and his family. <br /> <br /> Fifth, the artistic features should also be considered. PERFORMANCES: Barbara Babcock gives the original performance of Ellen as well as a challenging role, but it does a great job. For example, think of the moment when she is in school and she wants to teach bad things. Ken Howard is remembered as a faithful husband. Photo: The most memorable sun for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park, falling from falling leaves (fall) everywhere. <br /> <br /> A HIGHLY CITIZEN, what does it mean for me to be a realistic showing film? Love, and loyalty, once again proved how wonderful it is to live and believe. In the end, I would like to say very deeply about the movie I found very touchy and I hope you will. <br /> Kyle's uncle Phil: Yes, she (John Brighton) is the Bible. But no one is forced to do so. But what are your rules?
