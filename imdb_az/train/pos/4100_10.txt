"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk, an American heir, engraved with the son of the poor Marquis, is a mythical altar for the descendant of the family and the drifting of the nearby forest, based on a short story "Lokis" by prosper Merimée.Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel). The old lady of the house (Sirpa Lane) once thought that she was having sex with a creature and Lucy consumed with the dreams of the event. "The Beast" is a blend of surreal fears, open sleaze and porn craft. The contradictory attack on the spirit, the attack and the disorder, the very fake ejaculation on the naked chest, the masturbation of a bullet and the timeline, with an incredibly large phallus. This is really a really erotic film, yet beautifully shaped and unpleasant. Here, women are strikingly beautiful and they are often naked. Generally, "La Bête" is a visual feast. It is necessary to watch Borowczyk's masterpiece with careful attention and attention to the details of this fetishist or to visual motives related to pregnancy. Must be for fans of European cult cinema.
