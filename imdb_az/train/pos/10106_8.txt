After Aakrosh, this is the second film for Govind Nihalai as director. This film is designed for the fact that there is no audience for documentary films in India. This film is the essence of a movie commercial movie. It was one of the successful films released this year. In 1983, this film opposed Bollywood's big banners such as "COOLIE", "BETAAB", "HERO". SmithaPatel, in this film, was more likely to attract the hero's conscience when he was dragged, or to lose himself, to remind him. <br /> <br /> He did not look like a usual hero to do the ordinary things around trees and shrubs. Once the aggression of the hero touched the roof, he once abandoned his love. <br /> <br /> Om Puri is characterized by modern, Naseeruddin Shah's character. An inspector turned into an alcoholic character. Role conveyed the message of an honest cop who sipped the wrong side of the system. gave a chance to predict the end of the heroes. Sadashvili Amrapurkar watched his role as the first actor to win the best supporting actor. The film is not exactly a straight forward personality able to adapt to some degree in the police system. Anger in the Govind Nihalani's other "Drohkaal" film continued unabated. Even after 20 years, this film is only for the director and the entire crew. Each has played its own brightness.
