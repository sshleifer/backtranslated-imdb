Although on a Florida National Guard website, "Tigerland" totally reminded me of Fort Polk, LA, hitting the shooting, maneuvering areas, backwater and all of them. The film was similar to the same numbers in 1974 in my AIT and it was the same characters. In 1971, the difference between the Tigerland and the 1974 mine was that all drillers and teachers would not return to Vetnama. It was quite a lot, so training was very comfortable - no problem. All of our troubles in the 70s and 80s were a warning that I knew it was a truth that I had stayed until 2004. I did not hear anyone from Tigerland, but the Army had real Vietnamese training villages on different bases of the United States. Vietnam Vets told me that Basic & AIT could be pretty rough and solid until 1972 because coaches were there and mandates were given to men with Vietnamese-related skills, and that was not always the case. Both the Polk and the former sergeant in Vietnam Veterinarian NCOs, when we become trainers at Fort Bliss's core training brigade, everyone can not do anything for me to be ready and for people to find and just for themselves. This movie is high.
