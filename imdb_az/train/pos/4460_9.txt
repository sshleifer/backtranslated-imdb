Oh, a Kelly / Sinatra sailor-suit music. So familiar, right? Yes, but this is not something you normally hear. The city is on this path. But if you have something around you, you can learn something. Okay, not likely. In any case, Anchors Aweigh explains the story of two sailors three or four days off. Joe, the "Sea Wolf" and the book type, calls for Joa to get him "iron". Now, after they are selected by coppers, they get little Donald home. Where they encounter Sezimi, it is charming that jezebel. Just joke! Clarence's in love with her. At least he thinks. Right? Or is it a moron? Or was he guided by the community? <br /> <br /> P.S. Kathryn Grayson should be sweet, sweet, sweet, and try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
