Mercy may not seem to have gone, but Murphy's character does not take seriously, as it helps the audience to mysticize the mysticism and contemporary hard-fried kidnapping. Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis and Murphy are on the top of the 80 comedy / action. There are some great F / X, many surreal imagination sequences and a pretty original area. Often Murphy is in the pantheon of the flickks, but it needs a look at it.
