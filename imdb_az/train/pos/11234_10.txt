This is a bright and good contribution by a group of fans, and given the fact that a single bedroom is made of a painted green screen, these story lines are complex and twisted, and these symbols show the true depth and size. CGI breathtaking by the crew. Although the first season is a bit shaky, the last few have been well thought out and well shot. Some fans believed that Star Trek Franchise ended with early termination, but these fans did not respond. I would like to invite you to the 10/10 secret frontier crew and newcomers. <br />
