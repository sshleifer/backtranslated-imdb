Paulie was lovely, cool, pleasant, and pretty fulfilling. I went to this movie, waiting for a typical "family" movie that will find me in an instant and find it in a trash. My mind was instantly changed when I was in the real sense of the movie. Rarely find a comprehensive and "efficient" family movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, Paulie was clearly written and produced to attract members of a family. <br /> Yes, the Paulie plot. This tells a young girl (Marie) and her best friend, Paulie's parrot, talking incredibly and often talking to her. Marie's furious father's father found this incredible, and Paulie's 4-year-old daughter thought he was suffering from mental illness and quickly broke them. Meet many memorable characters along the way, as Paulie's adventures (and misadventures) try to unite with his beloved owner. Oh yes, Paulie could really speak (smart) and was fast in New Jersey accent. It's cool. He kept his area in a bold and entertaining place, attracted me. Paulie is the best family movie I've ever had, and I am glad of heart. Ever. Seriously. Take a copy and go back and enjoy the real family movie with the whole family. There is no dream. I promise.
