When I do not agree with Bob and Tammy's decision to abandon the baby Jesse, it's something I'll never do, they're trying to do the best for the baby. As it is written, it asks you all the different things that make you twist your story and believe in it. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Not yet, as long as I'm concerned. But during the film, he said he was psychotic, or at least, something serious with her. His character has the meaning of "emotional anxiety". The film ends with things that have not been resolved soon enough. But besides, this movie is really great. This is really the case. It's not just a movie to go back and watch when you want to watch something cute that will make you laugh and relax. But it's a good movie when you challenge your own belief, see something of the others' perspective, and find some things about yourself. Caution: It can even grow while watching this movie! And in the end, it's worth it.
