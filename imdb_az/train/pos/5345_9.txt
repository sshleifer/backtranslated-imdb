Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan friend and I have seen this emotional lesson in my history. Spain is again in the direction of political confrontation. Therefore, this masterpiece should be demonstrated at all Spanish High Schools. It is a great lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. The American pilot, who took part in the Spanish Civil War, chooses the elected Democratic Republic of China. The role of religion in a striking way is shown in one of the most created scenes by Uribe. Colors are magnificent. The cruelty of a war (Can it give me the difference between any war and civil war?) Two young children express their feelings and use each other as a hopeful scenario. Even the cowards who have started to abuse power against innocent children are already active. "Hand by Car de Carol" / "Carol's Visit" is one of many sad stories of the 20th century. It can be any book that has a better lesson in history. Again, great work from Iberica on the Peninsula!
