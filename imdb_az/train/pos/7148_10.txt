This movie comes from me. A boy is charged with murder on Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf) and sent to the Camp Green Lake, the boy's prison. There, it is 5 meters deep and 5 feet in diameter. While there, she meets the other children of the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray and ZigZag). Not all of them are able to "build features", but Kate Barlow's ability to dig up the treasure. Throughout the film (and in the book) Stanley takes on the past, more about himself and more about drilling holes. I give the movie 9.5 because I'm very careful about the movies when it comes to movies (I want the movie to be fully booked). However, it was still good.
