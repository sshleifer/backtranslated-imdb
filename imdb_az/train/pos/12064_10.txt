The "black woman" is one of the most surprising British fantasy stories made easily. A young lawyer is staged by a mysterious black woman after she arrives in a small town to manage a dead customer's property. The film is charged for a very heartfelt atmosphere and frights loaded and provides maximum possible impact. The event attracts spectators deeply and is extremely worried about the finals. Acting is perfect and tension is almost unbearable from time to time. a really creepy horror film gives this one look. Everyone dare to watch the "Black Lady" from night to night only off of the lights off.Highly recommended.
