She was still in school age and had to learn Shakespeare in the past four years (which is good if she is better than any writer), and when I was an English teacher, I was very happy with her; I was thinking that it would be a bad-looking English language movie: a bad toy, a strange, badly drawn and terribly old old dialogue, so I'm almost ready to go into the coma. But what I looked at and my anxiety was not that much to pay attention to myself but really enjoyed the movie. This production of Hamlet is probably one of the best drama films I have ever seen, and I really look forward to the expectation that Shakespeare wants his role (well, that's different from that of cinema). An English teacher might have been opposed to anything on the text. The story is good, the dialogue runs out of anxiety, with an unexpected grace (though it's hardly challenging if it is difficult to follow in Shakespeare's language), and even with the smallest parts you can expect; Perhaps, perhaps, this film has come to the fore, the number of brides has increased. Brian Blessed and Charlton Heston are as big as you expect them to be in such smaller parts, but Robin Williams gives such small parts unexpected pleasure, just like Gravedigger, who is really distinguished by Oscar and Billy Crystal. <br /> <br /> Certainly, The stars are also beautiful. Kenneth Branagh, like Hamlet, can be seen as a whole, not only by the clutches and pains required by the roll, but also by playing some kind of hilarious play on comedy scenes. Other key players are also good, but Kenneth Branagh stands on top of another and <br /> <br /> The sounding pieces are also striking, of course, the film's essence The film, which he perceives as an old castle corridor to be seen in Shakespeare's production, is not error-free, but no matter what is important (pacing is the only problem I can only think of, and, as I said, the prose for everyone in Shakespeare) The Shakespeare production I'm used to seeing in the cinema is really bright. Even my previous typical youth position forced Shakespeare to think again that his works were boring (I came to the conclusion that this was not awesome, but just a classroom teacher). <br /> <br /> Let's also note that an English-speaking student in the United States may have a higher opinion of Bard. <br /> <br /> 7/10
