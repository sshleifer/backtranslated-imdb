The perfect Alibi is a fun and highly-loved merry-goer with a clever scriptor and a steady hand from the writer / director Kevin Meyer. The film begins as a methodologically and builds steam to show that clues are nothing as it seems. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo, as well as Nick and Nora Charles, from the "Simple Adam" movies, are terrified as a team to uncover their mystery. Kathleen Quinlan is as good as a characteristic role played by Alex McArthur's cherished wife and veteran actor Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris, a good time, and provides plenty of light moments at just the right time. There is a cabbage by Rex Linn. Generally, I felt like reading a good book with wood.
