The star of this movie is a scenario. It draws attention to clothing, language, social life (do not harm women) and details of the political era. This is a reminder of Kosovo today. Exquisite pieces of action scenes are for a careful audience, and choreography of these action sequences is superior. Perhaps this is to get the support that should be drawn to the bone of truth. Each step is a step in the increasing violent stance of peace and tranquility. Great movie ....
