<br /> <br /> Our members are members of ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club. It's also a great British movie, a screaming laugh and sexy Gary Stretch, and oh, it's a very bike and beautiful Welsh village. Extras! Hooray !! <br /> <br /> There are some really cheerful bits, good toys, a good idea. <br /> <br /> Director Jon Ivay demonstrated at Wareham, Dorset. A great guy, a place and a good laugh. <br /> <br /> So, like all major British cinema, this movie should be supported! <br /> <br /> So, if you go and see, there is a website with cinemas showing it, so find one close! /> <br /> I will not wait to get a DVD. Some of our biker friends have already filmed two or three times and can not get enough. <br /> <br /> Amanda
