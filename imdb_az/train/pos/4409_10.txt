This movie is one of the best-known samples of all time. I gave him 10 degrees. The story is the Bushwhacker 'famous' Missouri city that fought south on the war between the US. The clothes they wore were peculiar, the history and why they were fighting were very accurate and well-investigated. It was one of the battles that really did not happen in places where it was described for Hollywood ... but not bad. The actors were well-played or the actors were the most brilliant or the director really knows how well they are from them. I doubt that there is a great leadership, a super-casting merger to find great people and perform perfectly by actors. Only one or two ... this movie really jelled! Movement, romance, confusion, good guys and bad guys (sometimes dependent on the individual point of view) and a historical film. There are even the future Spiderman and the Jewel. And it is good!
