Paul Ryker is a friend in the military court who is in fact attempting to convict an apparently innocent prisoner of war in Korea, a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the classic drama dramas, "Sergeant Ryker" <br /> <br /> This film was originally created as a television movie in 1964 and was subsequently created.

Marvin's passionate passion, with passionate determination not to resign, perfectly passes through this convoluted, often intense performance manifestation of this dramatic drama. <br /> <br /> However, the "Sergeant Ryker" is still in a strange situation, and is still in the best list of the courtroom. A compulsory exam as a book that you can not just write. Be advised.
