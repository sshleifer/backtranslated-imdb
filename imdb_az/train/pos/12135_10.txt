Bette Davis should watch every movie. Davis, together with Leslie Howard, came together in "Human Care", where he was on a movie account. According to the legend, Davis "robbed" the name of Oscar in 1935, as "a waitress speaking, a unwed mother and manipulation boyfriend-user" Mildred Rogers. The story encouraged Davis to reward AFI Joys Heath with the 1st Oscar to play with "Dangerous." I imagine admirers of Davis's "Man of the Ear" movie, the 1936 EU film and the 1936 film, which adopted the Oscar-robbery legend, will be in the contrast of the 1934 film criticizing the "Dangerous" work. In 1937 he received his 1st Oscar. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch Bette Davis's moving pictures, television interviews, videos, popular series WWII and TV broadcasts. It is easy to know why this film gives you the opportunity to become a candidate for his speech from "Human Care". When the movie was complete, it was only 25yo to reach Hollywood's red carpet. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star for his speech on "Human Care". This is his legendary performance. <br /> <br /> The "God Who Plays My Prize" was also great and paid to Warners to play with Rogers. <br /> <br /> I will not go with the AFI, 41 years after them, Davis decided to award the 1st Best Actress Oscars for "Dangerous" two years later. By doing so, AFI could help to get the best out of Hollywood's most talented 20th-century actors. Because Davis knew from his "Human Bondage" that he needed to get into deep profits to find out his performances earned by his golden statue. Certainly, he deserves more than 2 Oscars; perhaps up to 6. <br /> <br /> "Dangerous" gives an exemplary contrast to the depth of Davis's acting character. Because, in his "Dangerous" (1936), he becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, he is a dead center on a red carpet. <br /> <br /> Davis is ready to withdraw the rest of her 60-year-old actor career. <br /> <br /> Maybe, his legendary Oscar, instead of a star born in 1935, was encouraged to extend his heart to the greatest actor of a talented actor. <br /> <br /> As it is known, his upcoming opponent camp was Joan Crawford; his performance is still an uncertain star for Davis. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a "star". Howard Stern is also a radio host 'star'. Many people on the stage and silver screen stars. It was a very big actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bette Davis believes that this is the difference between the desire to play a great role or to star a star. <br /> other. Maybe AFI and I know it. Davis was able to become one of the greatest actors of the XXI century and became the 27th year after reaching the goal. It's so high that it has reached the bar since the next 50 years. . . Although the AFI sent a message that he had come to his "Human Care", Davis's life history was a great actor, instead of being taken to the star.
