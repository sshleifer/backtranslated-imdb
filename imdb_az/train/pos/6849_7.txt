<br /> <br /> Kill sometimes, just by seeing the first day of the first day, some terrifying sequences, some beautiful performances and a beautiful, genuine Hitchcock ripoff film, Wrap in the end. <br /> <br /> At least two women killed are engaged in secrecy of a murdered murderer (perhaps more movies). never tells us) and searching for three people by a murderer: a clever child who is a victim of his mother, a psychiatrist who is the only mother of a brothel and a neat intelligent child who defines murder. Nancy Allen has a number of good performances that are more concealed than what she looks like like prostitute Liz, sexually immortal victim Kate Miller, and Dr. Rober Elliot like Micheal Caine; No standard is really outstanding. On the other hand, Denis Franz, who is a great character along the same line at the NYPD Blue line, spends too little time, but is less embarrassing than an exaggerated, relentless, hateful detective. the film is too. <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scene with her mother, such as the subsequent death that caused her premature death, was doing well with confusion and good deeds. I also love the sequence of the doctor's office that identifies the identity of the killer who brings the entire film together. And it's almost a classic thought that's a split screen scene. There is still a situation in which Liz escapes as a murderer on a train, and that is not the case with almost embarrassing race stereotypes. As a tension, it is tense and often persuasive. As a crime drama, it deals with an incomplete, ridiculous explanation of everything that happens in the end. At a time when they are brave enough to shoot one's leg because it looks a few minutes at a time, there is a needless and very long dream sequence. It was a low and low practice; a scene filled me with a heart and mind, and next he asked me to rumble and ask why. If it's less than 100 minutes and it's a good movie <br /> <br /> Fear film fans should love it. It still stands as a much better film than today's slasher flicks. Maybe it was a good movie at the time, but recently I saw that I love it and it's worth seeing only my three favorite scenes.
