Perhaps this is because I am in a great fear of hospitals and medical staff, but this is under my skin (forgive the Punishment). This piece was not afraid of going upstairs and satisfying as they came in terms of revenge. I did not feel too much hate for myself, and I did not feel so much hate for myself, I felt a bit embarrassed, and I felt hate in certain parts of a really unique and enjoyable thing for a hero-like viewer. Some parts are reminiscent of Hellraiser, but it does not mean imitation, but respect. This is a heavy-handed piece that does not look to many audiences, but I'm delighted to attack a movie once and for a while. This piece brings it and is not appologize. I like it very much. Do not watch when eating pudding.
