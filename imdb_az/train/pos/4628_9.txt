One of the best parts of Sundance sees the movies you almost miss. If you're a real artistic artist, you probably did not hold a lot of documentary movies. Only one handful receives any known distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentary films in recent years. <br /> <br /> Behind Shakespeare Bars is a strong document about a dramatic production group at LaGrange Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in Kentucky. Every year a group of convicts presents a Shakespeare game. <br /> <br /> The film is full of charming stories for those who are not exposed to prison conditions. Hank Rogerson and his crew are persecuted. . Despite the writings we have known (condemned, felon, killer, etc.), we soon began to think and appreciate these people. Serendipitously, the cast of the selected game for the year was The Tempest, its forgiveness and instead of reputable attention. All players are struggling to match the game's life, parallel with heroes and symbols, and dramatize the meaning. <br /> <br /> For a documentary like a movie, I hope the best we can do is change our lives. Behind the bars, Shakespeare was an individual unit for me. "O brave new world, there are such creatures."
