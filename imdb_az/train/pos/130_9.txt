In October 1945, American German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) came to Frankfort after the war, and his bitter American Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) was on his way to sleep on the Zentropa train line. While traveling on a train, he sees the occupied German occupied and meets with the daughter of a former powerful businessman, Carthage Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), and Zentropa, Max Hartmann. Leopold remains neutral between allied forces and Germans, and knows that there is a terrorist group called "Kurtadam", which kills sympathizers of the allies and destabilizes allied forces. She falls in love with Katharina and soon she announces that she is a "Werewolf". Leopold needs the position and decision when printed by the "Werewolves". <br /> <br /> "Europa" is an impressive and furious Kafkan story of the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Fritz Lang explains the difficult period of Germany and part of the problems facing this great nation after its defeat in the war, using an expressionist style that renders a spectacular black and white cinematography reminiscent of some colorful details. It was impressive that the occupation forces destroyed resources that would allow the country to be destroyed more rapidly and identify Maxi, the most destructive of the Jews. Jean-Marc Barr has a frustrating performance in the person who wants to remain neutral, but manipulates everywhere everywhere. Max Von Sydow's hypnosis narration is a classroom touch in this premium movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Eurovision"
