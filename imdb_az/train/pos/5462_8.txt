First, if you are planning to watch it, be sure to follow the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and watch censored scenes). This film belongs to a young woman playing Barbara Stanwyckin, who has been forced to prostitute by her father since the age of 14. When his father goes away suddenly, he can get out of the world. After learning about Nietzschein's philosophy, he uses his sexuality to manipulate people by giving him what he wants and makes them desperate for ruin and love. Throughout the film, he becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative, and the audience begins to wonder if there is any sense of morality. Generally, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with many sex scenes that many will not expect in black and white movies. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching this movie very much and I think the most up-to-date audience will enjoy it at least a bit. especially with film shocking values. While thinking of watching the pacing appear a little slower, I thought, but for the first time I think about the majority of movies. In fact, I think that all the films I've seen since the early 30's did not have some small pacing problems or some parts just flowing. This is probably not the perfect art of filmmaking? it would take only a few years. <br /> <br /> Compare a movie in 1939 and compare it with the 30s movie. <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm delighted to see the original part; really makes a big difference. And fans of John Wayne will be surprised to see this movie before becoming popular with a non-transparent role.
