I have always liked this comedy as one of the few who tried hard to deal with the annual needs of the US Government. Have you ever read a tax code? It's a great test to follow many of our congressmen and senators who are accused of helping financial supporters and different interest groups. Despite the claims that it is fair, the tax code is always rich and not authoritative; it lends itself to the lion's share of middle and working classes. Most of the special items are intended for use - go to 1040 or 1040A on average, and look at different investment and business ventures with different rules. <br /> <br /> There is part of life that a wealthy landlord (Philip Ober) uses his reputation to abandon the IRS because it's not his neighbors (Paul Douglas and Una Merkle). He paid 20 years of tax. Under the influence of the IRS's Baltimore office, Fred Clarke, and he draws attention to Ober by its effect. Randall Douglas, Merkle, and three girls and two boys are rarely worthy people who need cash (they go to their farms) to produce and barter with their neighbors. However, Randall has been trained on clear IRS lines and strives to justify the family. But gradually Douglas notes that Reynolds loves Randall and dismisses Randall, eventually making him drunk. <br /> <br /> Randall makes her difficult to separate Randall, leaving her two "cars for repair" car. <br /> <br /> The Solution City follows the growing charm and friction with the unusual ambitious Randall. Reynolds who loves life in the village. In fact, take a cute couple. As a result, after the complaint of Ober, Randall is again sent to shame and a Clarke (a tougher cookie) falls into the brass crust. Douglas comes with a huge tax project that will destroy his family. <br /> <br /> The film does not end there - it happens happily but reminds you of the power of taxpayers. and that the Government often went to destruction. A chance to recapture a million keeps my family, but it's rare that we know it's just a dramatic game. Clarke's director (Charles Lane) is more realistic considering how Ober reduces his substance of "help" and believes that next year's taxes will be carefully considered. Then Ober is very green.
