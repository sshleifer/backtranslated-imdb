The Somerset Maugham novel put Bette Davis adapted in 1934 as a movie actress. He might have earned an Academy Award, but films were credited, so the studio did not push him. It does not meet current standards in this event. Davis, who is a sensitive medical student, who is excited about Philip, and who is nearly destabilizing his own life, Davis, is almost the devil. Normally, director John Cromwell has often made good performances from his actress, perhaps unhappy about it. Davis is really nice, but it looks like a very strange and predatory man. I imagine Millie's character with a soft, less feminine, perhaps tomboy's touch, than Davis. Davis is such a powerful, immediate presence that there is no mystery to Philip's attraction to make him look more open to a masochistic. <br /> <br /> As Philip, Leslie Howard is excellent. For her lucky esthete, her beautiful, beautiful look is good. As Dirk Boqard's case was rare, he did not comment on his own. It is entirely under control that it must be a person with a rational intellect, and he has ineffective emotions that can not be ruled out and even totally unable to satisfy. Because the purpose of his actions is to act in ways that he can not understand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Huseynov said, do not give a comfortable comment on the film's loyalty. I think the story's good is good, and it's in Philip Karey, Howard's perfect. Sexual weaknesses have been silenced, and sometimes Philip acts so masochistic that the lack of strong sexual feelings is surprising about the foolishness of the character, of course, of Mr. Mougam's intention. Thanks to Howard's performance, Philip remains in the spotlight as he can see something beyond his reach to comprehend that Millie has a reasonable mind and the other in his various thoughts. <br /> <br /> Generally, a very good movie, sometimes stilted slightly, London is beautiful and is moving very well.
