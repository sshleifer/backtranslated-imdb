I absolutely loved this soap. This is one of my favorites. We'll recommend :) ... I just love Brazilian soaps, they are dealing with real life events. I really sorry that soap is over, but I'm sure I'll be able to find it somewhere. Let's see what you do not see. I liked how the end of things for the characters, the assassination, and the devils. The only thing I could change was that of Hike and her long-lasting love. It is not possible to wait and see it again. Xika was away from the best soap I've ever seen. Do not forget everything :) GO XICA .. Everyone likes it.
