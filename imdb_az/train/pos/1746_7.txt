Bela Lugosi plays one of the rarest role-playing roles in a series of long-range radio-based attacks (Lugosi was also the source of a feature film starring this villain). Lugosi was not a big figure and a place where he could be a good team man. Here, Chandu needs to return to the East to help Princess Nadji, whom the Ubasti religious leaders are fascinated, to bring back their religious high priestess to the dead. This is a great deal of fun, a good-looking globe trotting series. To make sure that Pacing is a bit of a stain, more Principals (one of the production studios) then make a drag adventure, but still enjoyable. This is better than the two feature films that have been cut off, because it allows them to happen at their own pace or to replace the feeling that I missed something. One of the three best series of Lugosi trilogy, others are SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
