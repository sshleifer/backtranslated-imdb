This is a dramatic piece of a serial character that plays a part of a series of interesting stories ... that takes people from real life (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.). Matt Clark, a Railway Detective, plays a role in watching the repressions from the Old West at least partly based on true accounts. In this sense, it is almost an anthology series, and as others have pointed out, this strange structure creates a series of graphic conflicts with real events, but is an entertaining series that works hard to prevent hunger in the west in the 1950s. 55 years later, it is still very good. Clark breaks a stronger western gear figure when he opposes the most unhappy baddies of history. Didi's sidekick Frankie is a meal. If you favor the West, be sure to check it out if you have a chance.
