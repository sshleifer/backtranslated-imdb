Next, this is not a bad movie. 1 actually liked it better than 1. found more entertaining. the documentary style seemed to be drawn. First of all, it bothered me, the budget budget grew up on me, and it looked more like this. This movie, in my opinion, has a dryer liner than the original, which is a good thing. with some scenes and symbols it becomes almost parody itself, at least 1 of this point.this movie has a great reduction in my view.it my view.it is very good from the same great original music. Still, many things were worth the effort, though some felt that they would gain momentum toward the end of the film, even though they were from above. it looks really slow in just a few minutes and it just does not look like the rest of the movie, though it was a very good result. Y rating for "Return of Lake to Lake" 7/10 *
