As the winter approached, our state-owned television, ABC, decided to partially hold the Jane Austen Festival on Sunday night. It started with a twelve-year-long movie version of Emma last Sunday; An interesting point about this product made by A & E Television Network is that the newer versions of every three novels, Persuasion, Northanger Abbey, and Mansfield Park, are based on Andrew Davies, played by Gwyneth Paltrow two big budget movie versions, and Clueless, Alicia Silverstone's Clueless version, as well as Beverly Hills. Perhaps, as a result, with Kate Beckinsale, it can be concluded that this production has been lost. <br /> <br /> As a rule, novels have been downgraded to fit the length of the feature film. Both wisdom and characters have enough space to develop. An outstanding example was Brideshead Revisited, a 13-minute 50-minute episode in 1982. Only in 2005, the most common film length version of the movie "Pride and bias" should be compared in 2005 with a brilliant 1995 sixth television mini series. . The novel of a novel does not have to go to the page and some novels (not very good) should not have a good idea of ​​the movie (Atasement is a last example), but Jane Austen's novels need some time and space. <br /> <br /> This kind of adaptation Given the shortcomings, this production is complete. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma her own confidence and sensitivity, and Mark Strong is open to Mr. Knightly (he remembers Jane's idea of ​​returning her characters.) P & P's moody is a more expressive version of Mr Darcy. Samantha Morton was a strange Harriet, but Prunella Scales found blabbermouth Miss Bates perfectly? Quick Sybil Fawlty. Bernard Hepton, as Emma's weak father, was also excellent. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everyone, but also saw the luxury interior of the moist country, sludge and poverty. <br /> <br /> Although this is a coherent adaptation, it's pretty slow places ?? Some of the conversations are even decorated, allowing for the time to be formed. <br /> <br /> If you love movie shootings, this is a fine example, but it compares with Paltrow. Anyway, there's more to come!
