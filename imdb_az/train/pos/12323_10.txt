This is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen, and in my opinion, the Hero or Chrouching Tiger is better than the Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and at the same time horror. The best thing to do is to succeed in all of them! <br /> <br /> This movie will definitely bring me to the top 5, and every movie is good for her lover. Activity segments have a traditional non-real jump and even flying, but the shooting way differs from the hero's style and flying is always great and usually even logical (ghosts can fly) <br /> See this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10
