This is the least movie movie with a Brooks ball. Of course, its flawed. It does not give a real idea of ​​homelessness (Citizen Kane, in contrast to what a realistic view of the lounge singers is, or Titanic, the Italians gave you a real look at IDDOGLU). Many of the images fall flat. But this movie is still very popular in the absence of many comedies, and it's really a story about some of the most traditionally insulted members of society. Not his Fisher King, but his shit. My only complaint is that Brooks should be transferred to someone else's head (I love Melni as a Director and a writer, not more than a device).
