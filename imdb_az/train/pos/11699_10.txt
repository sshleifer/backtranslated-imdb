I've seen this movie many times and it was awesome. However, the only thing that started with it was that he talked with whom he would go in the beginning. I think it would be interesting to rebuild it. On the official site, they said they would not do it, because many people saved it when they saw it. What happened to Patty Dunning now? She's a very good actress. In the 70s and 80s, he shot several films, but we have never heard of him. Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for Accounting in RD Movies. But in general, I say that the series itself is just like the old school past.
