If I had to watch it for the first time on the GIS, I was a little lurid. I was one of the many people in NYC that day, and I went to school at Hunter College. Nevertheless, I did not want to see all the deviations and massacres, but many were interested in seeing what that was about it. This documentary came to my tears. All my memories returned, and only the intense images were incredible. I drove a DVD for a year and watched it several times. How incredible these men could not handle these shots. If you have not seen this documentary, give yourself a favor and check it. Obviously, it is drowning and tears to the eyes, but there is an incredible document in the dark hours of these countries.
