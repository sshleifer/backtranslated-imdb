A tragic beautiful film ... brings us to a non-usual Japan. Despite the technical experience of Hollywood, I have not yet seen a Hollywood movie in this small town near this seaside in the small town ... Tom Cruise loved the Last Part of the Last Samurai <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The blows that sought to seize ancient Japan living in the Caucasus. <br /> <br /> If you like it, quietly, there will be a delay from the noisy noise of the last 1000 blockbusters you see. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of the better stories of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Although it is a film about geisha and evil, and a film about complicated rules that govern life, it is not a skin flick. The heroes are full of depth and are moving too fast.
