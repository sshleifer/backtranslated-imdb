In addition to my understanding, many garbage dumps from Norway have been remastered for DVDs and will still be unable to regain their reputation. Not because I consider it very good, 7 because it is one of the few SciFi films for Norwegian television. This film is nothing less than a film-historical gem that draws on the first foreign film in many ways. And in my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Ridley Scott or anyone in the band saw the mini-series? But it is not possible that the scenes are very similar. Okay, the Norwegian movie has a very low budget, but it is a well-worked piece of the Norwegian dance film, which lasted until the 1990s.
