I liked this movie. The first (the lake's booth) was almost the same, killing men instead of killing women. Stanley and Allison are in the dance club, and she explains Kimberly's last moments before being thrown into the water, and secondly, when I visit Stanley Allison, 2 of my favorite scenes are even more interesting. Before he heads the crown when he kissed the cellar, kissed and kissed. For me, these scenes were very tight and riveted. I gave the movie 8/10 because the movie was bad, but filming was bad, there were times when you almost felt that nothing was wrong, you do not see the shooting of a "live" camera when you hit it as it usually is shot, In short, you see film-making errors. what was wrong
