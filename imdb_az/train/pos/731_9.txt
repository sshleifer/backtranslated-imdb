This movie SOOOO is funny! Imagine, Ramones are sexy, jokes are subtle and the plot is only what every schoolmate has betrayed to his school. I absolutely love singing, as well as a carefully placed kid. If you like monty python, you'll love this movie. This movie is a bit "fat" esk (without all the bored songs). Delighted songs make you happy; you can even play these songs inside the movie. This music is for me in the second class (next to the second blues brothers). But I ask you not to think of it as music for every word. It is difficult to describe a choreographic scene carefully, seeing how much the songs are loved. I think this movie is more comedy with romantic romance. You will remember that you want to become a rebel teenager; If you do not, you will remember the old high school days after seeing this movie. Both families are also highly recommended (because they are very jealous of having funnier with age and experience too, but also for adults.
