I liked this movie. you have to respect the midgets that are dressed like little marsians. Indeed, the story may have been sometimes subtle, but you can not avoid it. At the age of eight, I have been watching this once. There is also a children's movie, and it has the biggest circulation. Blanzi's phrase "Home at Number" is intimidating. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, if you do very well, from 8 to 10.
