I always wondered what happened with this magical feeling of old Slovenian cinema ... Well, I wondered if it was just a nostalgia in time. Or he decided to pack his "bags" and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our kinematic history, and then never came back? Or it? Because I first saw "Express, Express" for me. <br /> <br /> This film has three features that make it a little unique and enjoys watching - the story's smooth flow, the color temperature, and the most important thing - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (at least should be part of the Slovenian script). There is no use for words, and when you understand each other better than other means you use (yeah or better). Just follow Bakovic and Cerar. <br /> <br /> So, in a few words, I'm just like a Slovenian movie called Express, Express, for Slovenian <br /> Yes, Bakovic is dancing to Vivaldi's music scene . <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. See it.
