It's a beautiful movie since the 40's. In this film there are many dramatic scenes fighting with Japs during World War II, and with just a machine gun, John Garfield (Al Schmid), "Severe Force", 48 and Dane Clark (Lee Diamond), "Last Rites", 88. When Al Shmidt was able to go home after an injury with a terrible injury, his problems began with his family and he was engaged to a girlfriend. Dane Clark's friend Al has given her a promising supportive role as Lee Diamond, who has done everything to help restore her life. It will not be a complete victory of war, and do not forget all the brave warriors in all wars and veterans' hospitals in the current Iraqi Vets!
