I did not consider this film to be more honest than the great classics like Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. But this movie is a very good thing, the truth is that the overall IMDb is so bad for its voter. <br /> <br /> Helsinki Kate Eisenberg is just an act of criticism that does not describe a weird stuttering child. I'm sorry, but Rainman, who wants to get Dustin Hoffman, a 6-year-old child, says he is unlikely to shoot. <br /> <br /> The transfer of a small complaint is directed at the Friends of the film travel, con-games, relatives friendly party, animal (party-bird), humor for Disney and others for the young and the elderly. Best of the movies? Tony Shalub plays a few comfortable jeans. It looks normal to her. <br /> <br /> <br / Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin are very suitable for the movie, but I do not like the mango, but I mean, I want to go out and buy me. The roles that we know about us: I have always seen Jay Mohr a little slim and its role on the screen is also well <br /> <br /> It is the only surprise for me that Jay is Pauli's voice <br /> <br /> If you try to find a film that does not hurt you or your children, Paulie is a perfect one, is a candidate, but I will admit that Paulie will paint my vision at a happy moment, during a great heat wave. the restaurant was half cold and as I said, "watch a movie at the airport" is good. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> / STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG>
