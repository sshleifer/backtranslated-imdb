It's not a movie, as many people believe (including the late aunt, who says it's the movie's favorite movie). Due to the better part of the film, especially because of the fairly popular "entertaining home" philosophy, SHANGHAI OF THE LADY has come up with a key role as Orson Welles misses Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Welles' Hollywood figure position in 1946 was mixed. CITIZEN KANE was not recognized as a great film for the Hearst press and Hollywood's attack on itself. Welles' overall supervision (direction and production and functioning) seemed to threaten the entire system. The best of the times at this stage was Edward Rochester, who was shot by Robert Stevenson in JANE EYRE, but was actually shot down by Welles by the blessing of Stevenson. But the loan went for Stevenson. A movie that benefited from the war following the Nazi war criminals, just won, gained a profit. For five years, this was a great record in Hollywood. Welles returned to Broadway in 1946 and was hoping to recover his critical capabilities in 80 WORLD WORLD. But despite the help Mike Todd and Cole Porter compiled the account, the music was unsuccessful. His failure has also occurred when his wife, Rita Hayworth, was upgraded to GILDA. Velles was forced to earn money - his Broadway production led to his personal bankruptcy. He showed interest in the film rights of the WORLD'S WORLD TOROW (finally, rue), and sold his idea of ​​a film about Henry Desire Landru's career, which also turned into Charlie Chaplin (and turned into MONSIEUR VERDOUX). The story tells that Wellnes, with a $ 10,000.00 tax declaration called Cohn, offered to make a movie with Rita for a payment. Cohn was ready to do this, but naturally, he asked what the movie was. It was a wise question. Welles was in New York City on a paid phone at a drugstore with a book department. He caught a book by looking at SHANGHAI and said it was a great tension. As a rule, Welles convinced the Welsh Cohn that he knew Welles was talking about her. Cohn said he was looking to get his rights, and Welles sent a lower fee of £ 10,000.00. After closing down, Welles took his book and read it and found it really bad. <br /> <br /> Rita's Elsa Bannister has re-written a treatment and scenario that will build her character. <br /> Of course, there is an interesting field development. Michael O'Hara is a sailor / longshoreman. He rescued Elsa Bannister when he was attacked by bandits in a park in San Francisco. Elsa got married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a prominent criminal expert with great reputation. She agreed to hire her as a yacht head. The cruise also includes Bannister's bad partner, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and a Sydney Broome (Ted De Corsia) detained by Bendister to watch Bannister's Elsa. <br /> <br /> Grisby recommends Michael - as he likes (due to the reasons for his modern-day public's fatalist theory), Michael and Elsa can try to find time together, but Broome or Grisby, to talk about the death, to get out of it. According to Grisby (this area is darker here), he still can collect life insurance (even though dead) and use it to escape to the South Seas. Michael will charge $ 10,000.00 if he orders Grisby to be shot. <br /> <br /> This is actually signing a document that criminalizes (even if Michael thinks that Grisby is probably all the other evidence that he is dead). <br /> <br /> Of course, Grisby is killed and Michael is being arrested for this and for killing Broome (Michael is shot dead by gun). Michael was tried by Bannister, who defended him, and saw that he was doing a second degree because he wanted Michael to be convicted. Michael is trying to escape the decision of the jury, believing Bannister is the real killer. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary movie (as I have explained), it is put on a carnival in a carnival and is released and this is a popular "fun house". This does not mean it's not worth seeing - it's a surprising visual. Witness the battle between Michael and the police at the court judge's court, where the court puts the juryman in the court's office and breaks the bottle. <br /> <br /> The intelligent use of the photo to draw Hayworth's life-span was reflected in the horrific Grisby's binoculars. <br /> <br /> The player is pretty good, especially Sloane (probably the best player in this beautiful player). Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway performer. Rarely prepared movies before SHANGHAI, and its gentle Grisby unforgettable. Also, Ted De Corsica is interested in himself with a detective who is really looking for his own interests with Broome. <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, it is unlike the majority (QAN and QUM, MANHATTAN STATE and LEFT TASTE exemptions) and is a memorable siren. Welles O'Hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a beloved but loyal person learning a hard way to avoid believing in a secret way. BLOOD, COLLAPS, OTHELLO, EVIL or CHIMS, but for all this is a good movie.
