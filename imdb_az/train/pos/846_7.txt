Two years ago, I watched "Matador" in the cinema and loved everything about this movie. Obviously, I regretted Pierce Brosas's magnificent role. Yesterday I was watching this movie again on television, and we looked a little further. You can now be sure that this movie is not special, but you love it for a person. <br /> <br /> Brosnan, in my opinion, raises Julian Noble's surprising performance with no friendly, tired hit man. Soon, Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico, he is an evil man: his son died in an accident, did not go well, and is not sure if his wife, Hope Davis, could. <br /> <br /> I always liked such films; great movie, humor movie. Brosnan comes from Brosnan when he says jokes about a great dwarfs, or one of my favorite lines in this film: "On Sunday morning, I resemble the province of Bangkok after the fleet's left city." Brosnan says with his charm when he is in his interest. There are many people like Danny Wright, as Greg "is a typical American face" like a pest that plays a lot like Kinnear. <br /> Therefore, I suggest you to follow the very best role possible. Brosnan never. He will smile and admire you at the same time. Big Brosnan is not in the same big movie.
