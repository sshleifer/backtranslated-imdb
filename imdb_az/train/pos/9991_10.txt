I thought this movie was hysterical. I have repeatedly looked and appreciate it. Mel Brooks was great. Casting was fantastic. I do not understand that this movie went to 2 out of 5. I loved her. I saw her other films and they were laughable, but that's really my mind for humor. I can not say enough about this movie. I'm waiting for it to be on a regular basis, but it's enough for me. People playing homeless people were at the same time comparing funniest standards. Put this movie more often. I do not see enough ... Lolly Ann Warren was another favorite since I was Cinderella. I always thought he was not really laughable, but I loved his work. She was very funny in this movie ... and Mel and Mel did a great job together. They need to shoot more on television.
