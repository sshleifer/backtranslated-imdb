As noted by other reviewers, this is an unfairly depressed, depressed episode. Written by Frank Borzage (Two Oscar) and Jo Swerling (Heaven, West, Lifeboat, etc.) is a well thought-out, well-structured and fulfilled action of a sailor in New York City. <br /> <br /> This film can be the first of many admirable features. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the character of Spencer Tracy is the difference between Bill and Loretta Young's Trina. He did not worry, physically aggressive, and obviously not afraid, but Bill is not a character that gives the film a sense of survival. While those blusters, Trina really tends to be difficult (this term can be applied to even one character as a lady). His commitment to him is open and full. When she gets pregnant, she says, "If you just want to leave, I'll give up on the child," she says. Loretta Young's (20 years old) performance is quite a simple character, but it is neither a poor nor a dignified figure, but rather a woman who is happy and does not want more.
