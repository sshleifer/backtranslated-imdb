My children recently started watching this show's repertoire - N, and later in ABC - watching early episodes and they love it. (I could not go past the first or second season) I'm not interested in causing all the cast changes - I've seen them as a "high opinion" and half an hour searching on the Internet, how good the early episodes are from the next episodes nothing else but infinite interpretations. (I personally do not see a lot of differences - scripts and themes are exactly the same - but some people are losing their way on the road) My daughter has put the DVDs on her list, perhaps land features and descriptions will give a little light to all of them. I also like to say, "The Match of the World", when they see some of their self-referencing humor about the changes they have left in the season or so, and when another player sees him doing it, they ask him where he is, and where he is called "up" , or when it comes to a Minkus nickname of the early series of Minkus, they ask where it is and say "there", no part of the class is shown. The camera says, "Hey, Mr Turner, wait!" to say. and the screen runs out (Mr. Torner left another character) Well - maybe this is a Hollywood story about something or something? I was just delighted to go to the Hilda Aunt at the finals - he is always one of my favorites - it's so bad that it could not have a more cohesive combination. (Zelda pine just did not cut it for me)
