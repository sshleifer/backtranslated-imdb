This movie is based on the story since it started reading, and I have mixed feelings about the outcome of the film. Before I read a book, I learned a bit about film adaptation, because I was inevitably disappointed when I read my book. <br /> <br /> This is really true here, whereas in the Torah probably it would have been possible for a book I saw to fit into the best filming. <br /> <br /> I know what the reason I'm trying to do, and I think I'm forced to show my finger in Michael Cunningham's corner. I can not escape being aware of the fact that Susan Minton's book is a very symbolic and basic principle, for the watches I respected (I have not read, but I've seen and been deceived) <br /> <br /> I do not love this movie. Actually, I love the movie, so I'm worried about things since I read a novel. I enjoyed the film that I was loyal to Mintona. By reading it, we can understand why such a struggle fits. Unlike the film's review, some novels are not worthy of being a movie; Some books are too short to go through. Ms. Minton's novel is personal and sincere in its own way, so it's not possible for me to live internally in a physical world. Although most of the book is a memory of real events, it is memory, and that's why it's not a filmmaking affair. I think Mrs. Minton is a real work of literature, but she can not go to the movie. <br /> <br /> I still can not say that the movie is taking place tonight. I do not represent the evening of the novel more than the superficial, because I'm only half going, but the original at this point looks like the following movie that will have to make a big leap. I think that's what I'm writing because I feel you want to adapt and adapt a novel, but I will not do anything else. I'm not convinced that Michael Cunningham did something totally original, but some of the things I've seen so far are based on someone else's work. If Virginia Woolf did not write Mrs. Dalloway, there would be no "Hours" and Susan Minton would not have been for dinner if she had not had any difficulty in the first place. <br /> <br /> Thus, Minton would be better after staying alone, because in the evening, the film is a happy and beautiful job. <br /> Thus, I can not have my confusion, emotions, loyalty, and novel novels and vice versa, and finally, thank the writers for what they have done, so there are both things.
