One of the seafarers on the sea encountered a typical sailor girl, the complications that happened, were scattered in a happy manner. It passes pretty efficiently, but drags in places. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is not zippy like, for example, 'Top Hat' and Randolph Scott does not appear anywhere. <br /> <br /> There are damages. One of Irving's best songs is 'Let's Go to Yourself', 'Put All Your Eggs in a Basket' and 'Play Music and Dance'. There are Fred and Zanjan, when they dance, they do not release any movie in the sky. Everyone in the same movie is a lively dance, a knockabout comic dance and a hoarse dance dance! <br /> <br /> Dear Harriet Hilliard is also very good at his role. She has different career careers because she is more popular with Harriet Nelson. Here he touches without the sentimentality. Both songs are delivered simply and efficiently. It's a good contrast with Ginger, but you believe that there are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> The more squeezing film has made it even better. Although very good.
