I've read most of the comments on this movie. I've seen this movie (and all the prophetic series) many times with family members of all ages, and we all liked it and we just have to think about what we already know and think about. As I read in some positions, nobody is afraid or traumatized. The film is based solely on biblical facts. Recently I have seen many films, such as Tribulation, Armagedon, and so on. And so far, this is one of the best in introducing the truths of the Bible. It may not have great special effects, such as cinematic cinema, but I believe it's a good witnessing tool. This movie and its prophetic series can be viewed free on alipraise.com and dominated by yourself. He blesses everyone.
