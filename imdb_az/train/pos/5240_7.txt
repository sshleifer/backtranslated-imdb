Some of the players were a little suspicious. I remember that Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, yes OK, he was dead) started a rant about this movie, which was a disgrace that depicts NI Protestants as murderers. Now, with respect to all NI Protestants, this movie was concessional Shankill Butchers (loyal ones) and roamed Belfast in 1970. Believe me, they were not butcher for anything. My main nanny on this movie is not showing any ray of light or hope, all the doom & darkness, I mean, was to die at the end of the little girl. Maybe this lizard sounds, but not all Prods & tiags, it was bad or not good, could get tactics.
