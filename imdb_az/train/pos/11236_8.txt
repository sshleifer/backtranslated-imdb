I'm not connected with production in any way. <br /> <br /> The Hidden Frontier is probably the most up-to-date episode of the Star Trek fan film. <br /> <br /> This means that in almost no budget volunteering everyone's time and energy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ". <br /> <br /> I dip started from the beginning and watched it all the way. HF utilizes stories, putting all the good knowledge and background into a beautiful Star Trek universe. Characters from the original series and "relatives" were brought to stories and sometimes added a lot of things to the feeling of storytelling on the original characters. <br /> <br /> All the experiences are an excellent membership forum and weekly talk, often attended by a great web site, blueprint rollers, actors, and production staff. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high definition, high budget productions, <br /> <br /> If you are looking for and thinking about the adventures that Star Trek has on Star Trek credit stories, this is the only one.
