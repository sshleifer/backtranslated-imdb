I love this show. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at them every 6 times, I look back every time. <br /> <br /> Two same lady, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth) York. Holly continues to live with Val, who has been transferred to Japan. Val has a perfect life, a man and a superb Middle Eastern party. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems of Vall and Holly. <br /> <br /> Dear Holly is 16 years old and completely free, Val is totally opposite. He has a plan of action for an organized person. <br /> <br /> Other symbols are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
