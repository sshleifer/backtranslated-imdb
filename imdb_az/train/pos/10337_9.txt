This movie was extremely funny, and I have to look at the 1970s grape collection again, asking for it, knowing that these characters are being beaten are people I've known for many years, and I'm sorry that this comedy is not a DVD or VHS time was not. Redd Foxx is always a comedian clown, Pearl Baily is a guy, Dennis Dugan crazy funny man, sure not to be sure if his wife is witty and sassy, ​​with a son of Norman. Miss Dobson is a heart and little honest whore. I think that love, lust, strange family gardens, this film, return performance, situation comedy can be adapted and reactivated by such a phenomenon; Seinfeld plays Dennis Dugan, which is a series of Seinfeld episodes that returning to Norman, but it is impossible to keep a parent away from being a prostitute girlfriend and inaccurate. This film was a wild ride with a cabbie recommendation, to remind Kramer's memory of the Kramer's attorney's secret counsel. (Seinfeld episode) Parents have the time to drop their jaw, enjoy the fun.
