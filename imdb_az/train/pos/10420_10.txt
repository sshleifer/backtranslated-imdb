The Great Caruso shows the rarity of Mario Lanza. He is a great lyrical singer who joins the Metropolitan Opera cosplay, Dorothy Kirsten. I really dare say that Carousso will sing a better song (check out A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). MGM art and music departments also did a good job. This film could have been perfect, for Ann Blyth's unusual presence; we see that the 1920s worked best on the scenes in the style of the elephants - it is not forgiven. Lanza deserves a better lady and Blyth remains committed to less demanding production. Also, consider that Mrs Kirsten reads most of the opera duo with Lanza, and gives Carousso a misinterpretation that she has some kind of long-lasting soprano.
