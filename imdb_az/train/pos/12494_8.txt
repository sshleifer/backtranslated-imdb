Finally, some really great scary an indie movie! I see the most scary movies coming up ... Theater, DVDs, cables, etc ... and most of them are processed ... some good ... even less is really good ... Dark Remains is one of the best ones is one. At the South Padre Island Film Festival I took a show of this movie ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! Because of the fact that no name is a player, the budget of this movie is pretty low, but you will not know it ... the movie looks fantastic ... it's completely acting for the movie ... the story is good ... and scary is awesome! Most filmmakers forget about stories and character development while focusing only on fear, two things that help them to frighten them more efficiently. Brian Avenet-Bradley should know that this character and story is important. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size:," Dark Remains "stones there I think.
