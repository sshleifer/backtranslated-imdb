If you love horror movies with lots of blood and eyes, watch tram-moments and crushing, exciting death scenes, and then look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His wife and her son, George, Miles set out for snowy villages for a weekend break away from the city. Along the way, George has hit a stag with his car. Hunters carrying the deer were thrilled when George's followers were over. Particularly, self-destructive hunter Otis takes it. She takes her family home to a vacation home and is sure to see her. She is spying on George and Kim as she is in a sexual relationship. When they do not return home, they use the rifle windows to detect defective holes in their windows and walls when they return. While taking Miles to a drugstore in the city, Miles makes a small sculpture in a twisted look like a man in a table. A local American man, Milesa, says that Wendigo is the soul of the forests that have a taste and always hungry. Miles takes the figures he spent with the death of the deer one day earlier. At that afternoon, when he misses his father and his father, George is shot and Miles can be watched in the woods by a creature ... or just shock and imagine everything? Hours later, George ran to the hospital and Miles is still looking for a visual quest that captures the statue, either faints, dreams, or Wendigo. <br /> <br /> This time the angry, meat-eaten divine piece of wood, part of the piece and partly the man - caught for Otis, finally came out. <br /> <br /> Wendigo is a wonderful film, for the wind to shake with windy snow-covered trees. Okay, therefore, the monster itself is fraudulent, but it is a small flaw that is caused by a sense of irritable tension and fear of creeping through every frame of the film, and silent, snowy village. The performances are great, especially as moody and thoughtful by Jake Weber as sweet, but no nonsense spouse as George and Patricia Clarkson. They are a happy couple with the share of common problems, and their mutual relationships and love for each other, making it stronger. Watching this movie is often very realistic as watching a home video. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. Many people are waiting for the bloody revenge of Lovecraftian Beast, which is awaiting confusion. Wendigo could be seen with such a sensitive child's eyes and then with a crazy eye, and can not really be sure. It's more of a psychological drama than a fear film, but more than enough creepy elements to provide delicate horror lovers.
