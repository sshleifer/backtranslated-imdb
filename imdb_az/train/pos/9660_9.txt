Only after a while I liked this movie. And after reading all of the other posters and thinking more about it, I really liked it. I love American films - they are probably talking about it. They usually have a certain start, middle and end. On the other hand, "Presque rien" does not make such an attempt. I do not agree with other posters that this is a great art. In each case, this movie will cause your feelings to be remembered. You often feel like you are in the movie ... Summer sun, rays, heat, winter thirst, friendship, loneliness, and so on. You feel. <br /> <br /> In every way, the director draws you to the characters - that's why many people's film feels disappointed. When I finished watching, I felt as well. <br /> <br /> According to some ideas, I realized how the movie should be: the story is not the story but the emotions you feel. <br /> <br /> Lighting, scenery, and camera angles bring scenes - they are rich, delicate and detailed with a nuance. Although I can not face movies without normally a fully-developed structure (after all, a movie is a movie that tells "story"), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
