Even Billy Connely's beautiful as a zombie without saying a word ... Carrie Ann Moss is better than "Mother". Zombie girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "My father could eat me ... I did not try to eat Timmy". <br /> <br /> The dawn of the dead was good. <br /> <br /> Zomka's sponsored airplane (meats?) night is like the night of the dead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, social commentary can even begin to interpret. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that everything works really well!
