<br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> However, the topic may be very indicative can. It usually happens after watching Lost Highway, usually with the exception of the Lynchian space. It's a simple movie, but it's really a great movie. Both innovative and entertaining. Not innovative because it is not Lynch. But maybe this is Lynch. It looks like wiggling our minds, and Lynch unites a movie that's too far from her. Because he is the very avantgard director, he can only shoot a movie like this to entertain his normal demonstrators, because he knows what he is waiting for, but does not give them. <br /> <br /> The film's speed is slow. It would mean almost the speed of the grass mowing ... Do not wait for a moving action, but it's a really fun movie for those who go through the movie. Take a closer look at the Lynch movie, the small details that are in the entertainment fun movie. Look for a great filmmaker who has caused this film's life. And listen to the Badalamenti account and the main theme that really casts the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is one of the best performances in the film, and one of the most loved ones described in the film. There is no need to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His entertainment is just shining through it and his player won Oscar nomination for him. Needless to say, is this film does not have its poor health? After completing this film, he was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself. This knowledge focuses more on the film because it is worthy of Farnsworth again. <br /> <br /> All of the above is a very nice movie shot for all kinds of people to be made in a way that is like a movie. It's a clear and slightly naive, but it's a memorable movie, but it does not destroy the overall picture. 9/10.
