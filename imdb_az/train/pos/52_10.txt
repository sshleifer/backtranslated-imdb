This movie is incredible. If you have the chance, look. Although you have a warning, you cry for your eyes. Every time I saw it, I was there and I looked at it several times. The performances are superior. It deals with darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. This film looked different from the world: according to an English teacher, an experienced experience. Also, note the interesting use of shadows and lights if you see it. The living room is a phenomenal film and I rate it at 10/10 - for real - a perfectly functioning, spectacular plot and a heart-stumbling dialogue. Very intense, very moving. It does not give all the answers, but gives very good ideas about mankind
