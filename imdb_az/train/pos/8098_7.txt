As an animated film since 1978, it's pretty good - generally, Disney is far better than the standard of days that have never been a good thing in years (and Tolkien is less likely to care for Disney anyway). It is of great importance for an innovative and remarkable camera work, with the relative success of kinematic techniques. Very rarely rotoscope actually works well with the Ringwraiths and opening story, especially. However, this is very satisfactory - probably, as a money-saving method - a general effect. <br /> <br /> As for the story's adaptation, it's really good. Here are some small pieces like Old Forest and Tom Bombadil, Gaffer and Sackville-Bagginses. We compress Legolas as one of the Elrond family and look at some of Aragorn's old friends, but this is a pretty wise decision for the film. In books, you have the place to add references to a wider world of the elves and the broader history of the Middle East. In the film, you trade in visual and sound that conveys the same elements differently. <br /> <br /> Although I have some negative ideas about some changes, I am generally very happy. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> If only the sweethearts remember Saruman's name, it was often called Aruman, probably a decision to be different from Sauron by the same name; He had a second look at me before I made a mistake. Boromir is also concerned that a bloody phase is viking and irritating. But Gandalf is perfect and most of the sound is perfect. Just playing John Hurt Aragorn was not too old to play; <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a great disappointment with the film that ended in the middle of the story. The worst, the worst, is the Rankin Sonra Bass crew. After the rough, the king was allowed to return. Hobbit remains a great mystery; They are curious about bad songs than correct narration. For all its mistakes, this film is in a stable position and works hard to fulfill nearly an impossible task. I only hope that the upcoming movie series will remain in line with its vision ...
