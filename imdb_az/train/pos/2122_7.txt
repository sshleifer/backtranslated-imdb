On the day of the grand studio system, darndest casting decisions were made. Shop well around the good old old James Stewart Corner looks like a Hungarian. If I were carrying the movie, part of the Royal would be perfect for Charles Boyer. With all other European habits, the feeling of confusion would have been nothing. Along with Margaret Sullavan, Stewart's Mortal Storm had the same problem. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was the most leading lady on the screen and drew four films with her. But none of them are just dead. Sullavan and his wife Leland knew that Heyward Stewart was a football player in New York City. In fact, Sullavan's wife was Stewart's best friend, Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think only Clark Gable is thinking of being an American in the casting of non-American Americans in Muting in Bounty. Stewart was German at The Mortal Storm, but other players were American, so nothing was wrong. <br /> <br /> But if you can get Stewart, Ernest Lubitsch is more than just a good movie. The area is fairly simple, it does not connect with a man or woman working in a shop in Budapest. But, as you can see, they communicate with some of the anonymous admirers who have turned to each other. Also, the employer suspected Frank Morgan Stewart's mistreatment with his wife. <br /> <br /> If Frank Morgan leaves his usual unhappy, two best players are Felix Bressart and Joseph Childroot. Bressart has my favorite moments when Morgan's comments were thrown after asking people. <br /> <br /> Always good, Joseph Chillkraut, Frank Morgan is always as big as a little wolf. Indeed, you hate people, and I know Shieldraut in real life in 24-hour office politics. It just pays a good portion of the time.
