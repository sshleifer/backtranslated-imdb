<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least one Dozen. But, unfortunately, not recently. But Mickey Rooney, "Killer Mears," knows that he will be executed and approaches the moment of truth, he dances, cries and laughs. From the hesteria to the euphoria, the vacillates and the gambit of no sense. I have never seen such a brilliant performance by a living or dead, past or present actor. Mickey Rooney was "Andy Hardy" and was a great genius actor. But I thought about it, I thought for years with my thoughts, maybe I should be alone in that sense. The last time I saw this movie on TV, about 15 years later, I was going to read Los Angeles Times's old Q & A section. The question was asked to Lourens Olivier and asked, "Mr. Olivier, is you one of the greatest actors of all time and then you are one of the greatest actors?" In his response, Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney were surprised, but not surprised. I immediately pulled back to her "Killer Mears" and I felt so good for seeing her great talent and now my impression was fascinated by another whos job. Then he definitely understands "Bill" and many other great Mikey Rooney. The film "The Last Mile" will be screened by all actors. I really do not remember a big deal about this movie after these years, but this is Mr. Rooney's never leaving me. Is there anyone like me when everyone remembers this movie? It would be interesting to hear from me. In my heart, I only gave 10 pictures in front of her performance because I was alone in this picture.
