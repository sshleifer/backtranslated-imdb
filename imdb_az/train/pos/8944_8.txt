Bell Book and Wax were released in December 1958 and called James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film was followed by James Stewart and Kim Novak in the second album (after Alfred Hitchcock's classic Vertigo left the same year). Stewart's latest film was a romantic structure because he was 50 years older than he was. The film is about a cadet played by a deadly charming Kim Novak starring James Stewart. She puts a magic on her, and she lays her head on her lover. I liked the movie and its dump. This film was the medium-term success of the Golden Globe for the best movie comedy. GimmeClassics
