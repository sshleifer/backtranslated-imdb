"Footlight Parade" is very interesting. Of course, the staged "theater prologies" have no way of producing any theater on the earth. For example, think of a large pool and three-storey tall fountains with "Waterfall". (Berkeley directed John Garfield in "They Killed Me" in six years, and Dead End Kids performed their "Waterfall" songs). <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lil" is the best production in the world. '30s Warner Bros. is a directory of sensitivity. African children were involved in the scene with white and Asian whores. If you were not a servant on a train or a big house, you would not have seen blacks in other films of the period integrating into the public scene. Here black boys sit in the bar and read with others. I was thrilled when the military dancers presented Roosevelt's image to the "card shop". There is also an NRA eagle - the new Treaty's Controversial National Recovery Office logo. The FDR was a new president and his hopes were so high that he would pull the nation out of Depression. Of course, you will not see anything in the working class from the MGM. Warner Bros heartily F.D.R. supported the upward movement. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear Ruby Keeler, she was better than a Chinese prostitute, "Lil". He was watching his feet as he danced, one of the imperfections of the signature. <br /> <br /> Pre-Code materials are fun. The number "with the waterfall" is beautiful in this regard. The girls are changing their beach suits by accelerating the bus in Times Square with all the lights. Flying creeping eagle girls on the camera have been showing for 35 years that they provide black-and-white shots. A few months later, the Production Code will eliminate such nasty tastes.
