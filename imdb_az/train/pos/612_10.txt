This beautiful movie can be easily summarized. First of all, the comparison of "Princess Bride" is inevitable, and it is almost useless. Both films combine a great fairy tale and humor in a fairy tale, though "Stardust" is very different from any fantasy / fantasy movie I've ever seen. These genres have such a hybrid, but its description and scenario is rare that performances, special effects, cinematography and calculations - the finished product is simply a silver screen. Secondly, the account will be very effective in creating the true respect and excitement needed to convince us in the story and the fantasy world, simultaneously pulling the story down and convincing you to steer your wheel. there are characters. Third, I have not found the movie to be difficult to follow or confuse in any way. In fact, the interactive interactive between the three main subplots really made it even more difficult to watch it. Exciting wearing and moving on the statue. This fantastic adventure (with elements of Science) is the best I've ever seen since "The Return of the King" (I do not compare them). Okay, so it's not easy to summarize, but in the summer (or maybe for a long time) of any raw and / or perverted and prying eyes and the pitiful film of the movie!
