Perhaps this is the "best" after the first live action movie better than 101 Dalmatians. Have good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all the right slapsticks! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, a very serious therapist, is now a lover of dogs and is very kind to them. Cruella does not believe many, including Chloe Simon, one of the dogs she once tried to kill. Others think that Kevin Shepherd (2nd Chance Dog Shelter owner) has changed that. <br /> <br /> By the way, Dipstick, with her companion, gave birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! Small Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Cruella himself and Gerard Depardieu Le Pelt (another baddie, should give a clue to the name), Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (cheerful macaw), Glenn Close, with this excitement a good family movie and more! A collapse of this film is a very painful slapstick, not like a recent movie. This is even more strange than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
