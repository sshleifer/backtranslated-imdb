In this part of the series, Edmund Garaadder remained in the UK during the Regency era (in the later part of George III). This time, Blackadder's prospects are poorer - instead of domination, he is a servant for a very, very thick George IV (price peak). Unlike George IV's historical accounts, this is brilliant as a tomato, and as a result, Blackadder can benefit from his or her compassion. The only difference in style between this and previous periods is that the series ends with a very, very, very different note - only you have to believe it. In addition, there are all the usual story elements and the show is cheerful. This show, which I have just mentioned (as always), is not suitable for children in the language and adult position.
