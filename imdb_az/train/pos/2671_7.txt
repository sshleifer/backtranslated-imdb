Anthony McGarten adapted the Via version of the satellite, and for the long time she drew the best comedy film to go out of New Zealand. Chrissy Dunn (Danielle Cormack) is a drop-out talk. He did not get much in the years to come, and was saddened by his family's confession after his father's death. His twin brother, Carol (also described by Danielle Cormack), is in the center of the media for representing New Zealand in swimming at the Olympics. The film, Paul (Karl Urban), is the middle-aged, non-sincere and desperate director (Brian Sergent) and his charismatic cameraman - the night of Chrissy's night before; Watching Carol with a triumph. It would not be bad, but Chrissy's family is a shameful episode. First of all, there is a matrix of Wellingtonian Dunns, Joyce (Donna Akerston). She makes fairy cakes and cocktails sausages for all major movie crew and refuses to change her way. His eldest daughter, Jen (Rima Te Wiata), is desperate to become something more than anything else. He has a beautiful home (bedroom walls are painted with Blackberry sorbet), expensive tastes and a bad parasitic attitude to the match. She is also 40 years old and is a betrayal of a child. Her husband, Ken (Tim Balme), is an electrician and is forced to do things she does not need to do, as well as doing what she needs to do, that is, Jen. His middle daughter, Lyn (Jodie Dorday - Best Supporting Actress for New Zealand Film Awards for this illustration) is a "dismantled" cake with a suspicious history with Ken. Closer to both siblings, the mother is in a state where Kane is also a ToolTime Tim Taylor, Carol's dreams in the Olympics, and Chrissy knows all this is to shout on national television - why is not it shameless? It's good to see some of New Zealand's most famous tragedies with smart lines in the suburban comedy. I like sparring between Jen and Lyn. One is a narcisstic tramp - an oven in the stove, which is adult Mona-my-biological-clock-ticking-away, and the other has a sister's desires. The film Climax is quite syndrome and is done in a beautiful way. The plays are a treat and the film works perfectly. <br /> <br /> A good way to spend an hour and a half. <br /> <br />
