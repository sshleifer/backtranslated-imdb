I'm going to lie. Despite being interesting, I was watching The Notorious Bettie because I heard (and it was quite clear to look at something about the movie or something) that Gretchen Mol was naked with. I have never been a fan of Molin, but I can not resist seeing a charming woman taking her clothes. Yes, this may be a deterioration, but it puts the foundation and center of the movie in an ideal location and helps the film to be stronger than it should be. <br /> <br /> The film died on the eve of Bettie Page's (Mol) as a child in a secondary school in the south, for physical and sexual abuse and new life in New York. She wants to be an actress, but she also has to pay. <br /> <br /> After making a few-view innocent shots on a local beach, Pages are gradually becoming a modeling sense and are often sexually provocative pin-up photographs of frequently-featured photos. <br /> <br /> Nineteen minutes of film) is also a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, the film never meets. In a few minutes, you read the page, and then enters his modeling career and can not come back. But the film also curses, because we have no chance of realizing what's happening. Only the types of shooting between the modeling shots and disputes they have created before the jump to the grand senate research that reflects the final act of the movie. You sit there and try to swallow it all, so stay alive. Cinematographers feel like they want to summarize many materials in a very short film. He pushes for longer sequences and does more for longer comments. It does not feel fled; <br /> <br /> The Caucasian> Black and White, but frequent jumps and color sequences emerges. However, it can be made early as a symbolic gesture, though it becomes a little fad, because it is always open before black-and-white interruptions. <br /> <br /> Although the film's shooting is a bit of a jerk, the movie is dead. The page I know little is played innocently and the world is exactly the same. Keeping a few shadow symbols during her teenage years, everyone you meet is innocent, and it's all innocent. I had never thought I was looking at a complete nonsense, because it was something else that was vulgar and immoral, but it's really something to really be surprised. All at once, beautiful and innocent. The sexiest moments in the film (although compared to today's standards) give them an innocent and angelic feeling. There is something that describes Molin's naked corpse as having different acoustics in other films than the naked corpses. <br /> <br /> If there were any reason to watch the movie, he could see the magnificent portraits of Molin's body when he was playing Bettye Page. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the mole itself. The Prophet pointed to the fact that the Southern Hemisphere of 1950 knew (or could not imagine) everyone. Despite his profession, he is still a normal person and still sees himself as a religion. Mol has played the full range of cleanliness that characterizes this character since the 1950s. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> 's beautiful performance was shadowed. None of them particularly enjoyable, and none of them have the same power as Mol. It is, of course, not the fault of actors, but more of the work. Most of them are Oscar nominee David Strathairn (one of his closest performances), Sarah Paulson (The Studio for the Golden Globe nomination for Studio 60 in the past 60 years) and character actor Lili Taylor, but their performances are really good it would be difficult to actually place it. <br /> <br /> This film is actually not really developed, and actually, Mol, as it takes a steam with its brilliant performance, stands as the characteristic curves that control the circles around it. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is valuable for its description and for the perfect performance of Gretchen Mol's Bettie page. Everything else is a little too difficult and unnecessary. The story was not just a blast, but more work was done to develop supportive characters, which would be a better biographical film. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
