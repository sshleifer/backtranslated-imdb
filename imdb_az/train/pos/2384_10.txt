Gene Roddenberry was denied because he was originally assigned to Star Trek by NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was "very cerebral". When given a chance to the series, Roddenberry thought that it would be entertaining to identify episodes of canon rejection, and this was done by writing the The Menagerie, which is the only controversy that still exists. <br /> <br /> This time, not a new planet exploration, Kirk and his crew, on Starbase 11, former commander Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) is now a terrible and catastrophic situation. Pike attempts to starship his predecessor with an unpleasant surprise: Spike has effectively missed the boat used to serve under Pike and 13 years after Pike and Spock's death after Talos IV (death penalty). Naturally, as a logical creature, Spock is transforming itself into a self-helping society and it is a court-martial that can justify its actions. <br /> <br /> There is no need to give more information about politics, as the rest of them share Part 2 of the Roddenberry Cage with a special flashback (with more words), allowing everyone to see the rest of the Star Trek universe, how NBC did not give up on the original project to see what might be happening on the track. Specifically, Jeffrey Hunter (who is unable to return to The Menagerie) plays a better captain than Pike-i Kirk, and it's good to see Nimoy's identity as early as the Spoken in the early days. <br /> <br /> In short, not just a big "mystery" episode, but also a cure for those who are not worried about watching the cage. original (available as part of Season 3 box set).
