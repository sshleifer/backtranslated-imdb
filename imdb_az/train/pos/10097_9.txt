One of the first OVA purchased ("original video animation") is still one of my favorite anime names. <br /> <br /> Dominion's "heroes" are Tank Polis because they are different from each other. "If we can not defeat the killings, we will get bigger weapons", and, as the name implies, instead of patrol cars, we try to catch tanks in the city and catch more people than any criminals. <br /> <br /> If the majority of these police are not so, hypotopes and neurotics are boundless. <br /> <br /> Of course, their rivals, terrorist Buaku and his accusers are equally colorful and entertaining. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> English dubbing is still very entertaining, and the English version's sound program is also very good. I do not know if they have created a soundtrack album ... <br /> <br /> Dominion Tank Police is great in any case, and it really does not take seriously enough to be sure, with absolutely over-the-top characters and lots of comedy stuff There's a Japanese cyberpunk SF.
