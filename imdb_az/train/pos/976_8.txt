Takashi Miike's entry into the kiddie area almost immediately won me, because she demonstrated nervousness and courage in dealing with fantasy elements. It's not a fairy tale to dare to be dark. As a child, I thought there was something wrong with the most tales; In many children's books, terrible things happen to people. Miike realizes that these classic tales are a bit intimidating (and more uncomfortable) because they appear at first glance. The film director takes the child's archetypal story with a good research from preschool classroom. He emphasizes the real fears of a world full of never-ending dangerous missions. Westerners reduce the severity behind bedtime stories especially written for children. I acknowledge that Miike is more honest than most American directors. He goes through the knights of the story, but he also shows bending signs. But his own Miike is more strange than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Be advised.
