Vertigo co-stars Stewart (as recently as a romantic lead) and Novak have raised Stewart's other "Christmas movie" from mid-level entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars leads to a fairly moving experiment, and if gambling is seen as a metaphor for individual pain that hinders many people, the film may have more to do. All this is a wonderful provocation with legendary stars, 7/10.
