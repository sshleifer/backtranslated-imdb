The 'Last Wave' is more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a catastrophic film, it's just a survey of Aboriginal Australian morality and is more than just a simple court drama. The writer / director Peter Weir is able to bring these elements to the next level to create a really effective and thought-provoking film with the same atmosphere of nausea he has given two years ago in the "Picnic Discovery Rock". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> David Burton (Chamberlain) Chris Lee (Gulpilil) is the truth from Lee, when he was called to defend his or her responsibility for an Aboriginal death, but to understand what he was hearing. <br /> <br /> Burton is more disastrous than the one he thinks, and the truth about the two worlds - the daily and the sleeping era exists at two completely different levels. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, 'Rock in Picnic Shooting' will be better remembered because it is a permanent secret. We are on the same road, but we have trouble finding answers to ourselves. In the 'The Last Wave', we can collect everything in the movie until the end of the movie. However, even though we have all the information, how much do we want to believe because the film is beyond our normal reality? <br /> <br /> The Weir budget on the production side has a great deal of impact, a soft feeling of light, heavy rain, and a good sense of sound. Casual music is invisible and never tries to be spectacular. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the likelihood that the audience will not feel as he seeks to reveal. <br /> <br /> David Gulpilil is afraid he wants to do a good job of trying to make a good man in the world, but wants to do something good but knows that it's over. <br /> <br /> Put them all together and David Weir, a name that is familiar to the cinema after thirty years. Be advised.
