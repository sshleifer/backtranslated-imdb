About a child named Slaughter High Marty. He was raped and was selected in high school. A group of kids played a few games and these games were really bad. <br /> <br /> The Caucasian Children Network is reunited again to reunite. One of them was established at the old high school. <br /> <br /> This school is still abandoned and they have to enter. Given that Janitor still exists, he tells them to go and have fun because they give them a beer. <br /> <br /> Explodes and looks at old cabinets and sees something of Marty. <br /> A girl feels sorry for Marty, but another man calms her down. <br /> <br /> This is great after killing. Every murder is creative and scary. We hunt each other at school, see a figure on a jester mask. As you can see, Marty is a complete revenge. The first person learns that they are locked up in school after being killed. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical things in this movie. First and foremost, I do not know anyone's 5-year association. Secondly, after the first child dies, a girl takes blood on her. Everyone escapes in a panic, escapes to the bathroom and finds wind. Her friend was killed and decided to take a bath! Most importantly, why have a tub in a school bathroom. In any case, the bathtub does not really work ... and the film of the 80s results in a terrible death. this is a horror. If he had some illogical parts. I'm not for someone. This film has caused great deaths. End .... There is a twist. When we see Haute Tension lately, we can compare them. The only way they are, is that there is a twitch, so I'm leaving ..... ALL after a movie comes good, without the best killing. <br /> <br /> After the last killing, the killer appears on the screen and makes a crazy thing and is a great way to end the film. Wow ... is going to me.
