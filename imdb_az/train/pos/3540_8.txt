I bought this game from walmart. I was happy. Sean Connery's listening and playing was very fun. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a movie / game remake. The bonus level was very difficult! I think the sniper was very difficult, and I was very frustrated that I did not play for half a week. There was nothing to hide behind, or many people fired to control their lives. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the update system. I did not see any difference in an unmatched upgraded equipment, such a armor update did not seem to be more powerful or filling in my life-measuring apparatus like buying. Q copter really liked it. In my opinion, the developers have done a good job.
