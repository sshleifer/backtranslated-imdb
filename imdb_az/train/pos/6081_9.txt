You do not get much darker or disaster than Othello, and this film is a good game with great performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne explains Othello's suffering as he gives a real epileptic episode, falsely convincingly eroding Yaqo's lies. Jacob is a loving and loyal wife who turned out to be a tool of revenge against Othello or anger of Jacob (this is not why he did not cause Jacob's conduct). Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Showed his usual talent for Shakespeare, but he had some marginalization. Cassio and Emily's characters also look more like the Iago. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> The criticism of the film is that the story and that the relationship between some of the characters is not more explicit. The director was a huge castle, and no one had a bad result. Relationships between Cassio and Othello and the relationship between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed in the previous film. I think the film is closer to one another, though it's too late. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Though their suffering is convincing, it seems that the amount of interaction with each other is only met. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, perhaps, like Romeo and Juliet, they responded. <br /> <br /> In short: good speeches, very short. <br /> <br />
