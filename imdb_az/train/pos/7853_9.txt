This is a must for animated enthusiasts, but even the general audience will win CAMERAMAN'S INCOME, a very early example, called 'pixilation', by advanced, working Wladyslaw Starewicz. Starewicz and his assistants manipulated one of the flammable insect figures to explain this story by letting the legalization of Willis O'Brien, George Pal, Ray Harryhausen and contemporary digital influences. <br /> <br /> The CAMERA'S FUTURE is only 10 minutes away, but the story is packed with entertaining detail as they exhibit two beetles from home to a night club, a hotel, a cinema, and ultimately to prison cells. The nightclub ends with two short dance numbers, a clash between an insect and a locust, and a large-scale donnybrook, flaming projector, at the cinema. <br /> <br /> For 1912, even John Bray and Winsor MacCay had even begun, and Walt Disney was still at school. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that the title card of a silent film can be explained to the story. I saw two versions of this movie presented by two video companies and watched them back and the two different video clips tell the story of two different stories, although the content of the picture is almost identical. (And a third story explaining another part of the illustration is still there.) The British Film Institute reports that the press condemns the intertitles, both of which describe the story of two secretly-married couple hiding in the insect. to get this information inherited from one another's past father. And other Russian writers are talking about all the insects that are guilty. In the Russian version, Mr Beethle visits his friend in the English version of his brother, Bill Beetle, while visiting his girlfriend at the Gay Dragonfly nightclub. Personally, I'm simple - and spicier preference - Russian story; <br /> <br /> The BFI version tries to cover many areas where there is a simple fairy tale, and some of them are a little worried. <br /> In any statement, CAMERAMAN'S INCIDENT is a gratifying movie and will make an ideal lead to the other great cartoon work that YELLOW SUBMARINE beetle has.
