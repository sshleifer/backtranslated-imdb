And the masked murderer's where his brutal murder began. Lynch, with our hero, was routinely suspected by the Greek police and was warned not to leave Athens by Police Inspector Stavros (a familiar face between Luoli Pistilli and Giallo and Spaghetti).

Sufficient red biscuits and Mystery / Thriller fans are welcome to keep Giallo.The No Shame DVD interested in this story with a great transfer of English and Italian soundtrack to tell you that you can ruin more for anyone who does not see the movie. For some time by Bruno Nicolai, there is a very attractive account for a good event ... Giallo, in the first place as a whole.
