What does not matter about this movie? Each year, you will receive one or two yule tide films during Christmas, and most of them will be terrifying. This film is definitely a pretty good idea. A very funny rich young man pays a family to her for a real Christmas simulation. It is good to make money, if you can not do anything fun with it. This is a win-win situation. The ordinary family receives six digits, and a rich man lives Christmas as a dream. Lonely <br /> <br /> It was difficult to deal with Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) and his family was unwilling to meet his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.
