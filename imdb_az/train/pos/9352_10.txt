Most people, especially young people, do not understand this movie. This is a missing story when it is actually a story of being alone. Some people will not feel lonely at this level. <br /> <br /> Cheadler's character, Johnson, reflects the exact opposite of Sanderson's character, Fineman. Johnson was trapped by his blessings, and Finman tried to forget his life in that perspective. Jada is a great addition to casting and Sandler draws tears. <br /> <br /> When I saw that Oscars were looking somewhere, Chad played the role of a comedy and great support for Sandler. A very nice movie. You never lost time and you only feel that this movie is not yours alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
