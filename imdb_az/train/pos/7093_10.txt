You need your attention with "Twelve Monkeys", but if you do, you may find it much more appreciated. I knew it. The story is interesting and time travels. In 1997, many human beings were killed and Cole (Bruce Willis) sent back the 1990s and 1996 to treat the virus. He was arrested in 1990 and placed in a mental hospital. There he is acquainted with Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), possibly with a virus. He was also a psychiatrist who did not believe him in 1990. Meet with Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). Cole climbed and disappeared from a mental hospital while locking in a room, again in 1996, Kathryn believes Cole's stories begin. br /> <br /> The film is continuously playing. Cole calls over the phone and releases a message in 1996, is taken in the future and sends them to "one of them." Cole appears for a few seconds after the phone call. Things like this are happening throughout the movie, and you have to be careful about it. <br /> <br /> "Twelve monkeys" works as a fantastic job with a number of beautiful pictures and dark atmosphere. and works as a tension. What will happen next and regardless of whether you help this movie. There may be some shortcomings in the story, but just because it's a fictional thing to do when traveling, we must admit that the movie tells us and we should try to enjoy it. This is an easy part for me.
