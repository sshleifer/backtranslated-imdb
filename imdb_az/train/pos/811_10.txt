When I think of Jedi's return, I think epic. Yes what was Ewoks there? They added an interesting addition to the film (similar to the Vietcong, which technologically advanced armies could deal with primitive acts). The rest of the Jedi movies are even darker. Emperor Palpatine (described by the beautiful theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is very bad and bad, Vader looks like Mr Rogers in comparison. What an amazing end to this kind of symbolic character from Darth Vader. Vader is really a modern day's Greek tragedy, and now people can understand and appreciate it right now after leaving Sithin Intrigue. Finally his caliphate has come into action and really brings you a happy bitterness. The best part was, of course, special effects. Eighty-eight film is still something that can stop the test of time with graphics. The stages in the Jabba Palace (beautifully lit by Lei metal bikini) and, of course, are still striking to see the epic three-way battle. All Jedi is a fitting end to the deepest trick and emotional moments (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and Luke's truth when Leia is discovered) and incredible special effects in one of the most beloved franchises in film history.
