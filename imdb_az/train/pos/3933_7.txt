If the problem that describes a real-life individual does not believe the viewer is describing the performance, performance may be good, but it's still not working. This is a matter of "Mr. Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln": Henri Fonda performs a great deal of work, but it was difficult to believe that Ibrahim Lincol spoke softly as he described it in the Fund. <br /> <br /> This is actually the drama in the courtroom with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Whether this is a real story or not, I do not know, but why not use Lincoln as a central character? Do not worry. In the film, two young men accused of blasphemy said they were defending. <br /> <br /> There is really a lot in the film, and it looks so empty. I wanted more story and character development. The film is 100 minutes, but not like this. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> Lincoln . I just do not believe that this is Lincol's soft word. True, he has a great voice at the right time, for example, when he agrees to the luxury mask to suspect prosecutors, and in the background he describes Lincoln in a very humble way. Other speeches, especially Alice Bredi, are as solid as the mother of suspects Abigail Clay. She is a beautiful lady who can really feel. Simple and uneducated, yet very sweet; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> This is a nice watch, but not classic.
