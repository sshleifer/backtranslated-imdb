It's a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If you have something like "intellectual horror" movie, this is a movie. I'm scared and want to be watched by someone else, but there is something! I have to see this movie a few times before I really understand it. If you love "Andre's Evening Meal" and Godard's movies, or if you love clever medicines, you will enjoy this movie. Amazing! Wow.
