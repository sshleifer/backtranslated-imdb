When it comes to middle-class films on IMDb from 7 to 10, this movie (and many of them, like on average 5 star and low-level movies), blows the fanboy mentality again. a former girl friend said that this movie was suspected. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and enjoyed myself. They even laughed a bit. This and Replacement Killers director, Antoine Fuqua's black Michael Bay, "I do not see how many of Fuquan's films look like Michael Bay is anything more intelligent ... Any way ..." Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is used by the Treasury agent Edgar (David Morse), who won as a pawn to capture. Every move of the alveoli is followed by an error implanted to the jaw after the crash. Bristol then comes with these agents, Bristol comes after the golden bricks <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is great and funny as Alvin Sanders. Alvin speaks a lot, she is more intelligent. Doug Hutchinson is as good as Bristol. Sometimes John Malkovitchesque can be upset in his behavior. It was better than Punthere's as Looney Bin Jim: War Zone. David Morse is as good as a tough scarcity treasure agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both he and Jamie lived on the screen a few funny moments. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the film is a part of a tension. The horse racing scenario is overlapping, but I could not see it. The director went everywhere, so he got points. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < is not a bad movie. She is never boring, always funny, and my time is not every minute. This should be counted for something. <br /> <br /> PS: This film is too strong for the plaintiff .... How can you live under a rock? I believe you've seen the Die Hard and EVERY movie by Quentin Tarantino. But are these films not violent? Weirdo.
