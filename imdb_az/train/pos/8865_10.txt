Tired of competing for two dysfunctional siblings (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) who are bigger than f *** - up and Daddy (Albert Finney), they have to clean up a horticultural debt scheme to strip Anne and Dad jewelry and take a fresh will allow you to start. It looks like a great plan, it's a mistake, the 1970 melody of the style went wrong, and the guy is really wrong for our lucky prayers and everything that everyone has to do. <br /> <br /> He uses McGuffin's heist as an illustration by the screenwriter Kelly Masterson and classically directed by director Sidney Lumet to deepen the drama of the family before "Knowing the Devil's Death". <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief, Sidney Lumet is not dead. At the age of 83, he signed a contract with Satan to deliver a great film. Lumet was convinced that in the 1970s, he was filmed with "Dog Day Afternoon", "Serpico" and "Network", one of the most favorite films of all times. He sometimes succeeded in creating a film that reflects the traits of classics (graphic sexuality, violence, time frames and POVs), whistling, lively, bare, mean and provocative melodrama. I hope Lumet will be so excited when he's at the age of age at the start of the game of contemporary adults (like Scorsese or Spilberg) that emerged in the same decade. <br /> <br /> Lumet is a master who drives people into hollows to create tension and develop characters. Emerging Manhattan offices and machine-tools are slowly moving, creating a sense of anxiety as to who can be in the next corner or knows what this person can do in the next room. Lumet is also incredible as it uses many POVs and time frames. <br /> Of course, Lumet is good, directing the beautiful performances of the ensemble and trying to deceive them. it moves within a part of their lives. Philip Seymour Hoffman has never been and has never been here. Albert Finney is a masterpiece to illustrate a father's treacherous description and to follow at the end of the rope. Ethan Hawke, as a nondescript nice guy, is perfect as an emotional offspring younger brother who has a long skate with his charm and appearance. The blows are, of course, scenes between Hoffman and Marisa Tomei. Lumet passes through the gamut of the best scene ever since William Holden's Beatrice Straight was offended by the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in The Network. <br /> <br /> The devil of any great film, Albert Finney's car body clamp, will not close because of a fender, Amy Ryan (freshly transformed to his "Gone Baby Gone") to his ex-wife, Ethan Hawke "Do you mind if I say to you Chico?" (The favorite line, cunningly threatening, is that if you can not give three testimonials to his little girl, you will not continue with it, systematically solve a family over skids, Before You Know It. "If something good happens, then we know that a few other deals must be related to Old Scratch.
