<br /> <br /> I watched it in an 8-hour flight and found it to be really fun (probably because of pressure and elevation) (emphasize "soft"). <br /> <br /> The real idea behind the movie is brilliant, when a woman dies, her fianc√© is in love with another, she decides to make sure that she does not come to one another, but eventually gives them the opportunity to do so. Unfortunately, the actual movie was not good. Okay, there were a few laughs, and all actors did a good job. However, as it was estimated from the beginning, I was estimated to be the destination destination. I think the whole gay-but-gay-friendly part of the story could have worked better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "</ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; "> call.
