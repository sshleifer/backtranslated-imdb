Yoji Yamada's cinematic world is made up of his Samurai Twilight Samurai, the "Secret Blade" and "The Love and the Honor", the latest Samurai Trilogy. I enjoyed all three films and watched the prolific, veteran director's filmography that will last for a long time to watch all the movies, especially the Tora-san series. When our mother has finally reached the coast, I do not want to say that everywhere I have the opportunity to watch what happens to the mothers, and to celebrate their native love for their children. <br /> <br /> Teruyo Nogami, Kabei - Our mother says four touching families? Ana Kayo "Kabei" (Sayuri Yosinaga), Sheikh Shukri's "Tobei" (Mitsugoro Bando), his eldest daughter Hatsu (Mirai Shida) and the youngest child Teru (Miku Sato). Shigeru was appointed to the end of the 30s when "usury" had begun in Japan and would have changed forever forever after being arrested in accordance with the Law on Peace Protection for moral controversial articles against the nation. <br /> <br /> Thus, she struggles to cope with Kabei's family and frequent challenging meetings behind her husband. Aid comes from relatives in Shigeru, especially because Kabei's father has "told me that" with his wife's choice. Once Shigeru's pupil Yama (the arthouse buffs here is Tadanobu Asano) is slowly confidante and laughs as a bumbling guy waiting for the protection of the children and Hisako (Rei Dan), the Kabei sister Hiroshima. <br /> <br /> , in spite of the fact that children are raised in the presence of their mother, and some remote relationships with him, some indian alarm alarms on his unsuccessful fate. their father, how much I love, the microscopic family events are explained by the events in the macroscopic world that affects the general population in Japan. Japan is against the historical background of regional domination, and here it is necessary to disguise these ambitions and even succeed in conquering the conquered lands that discuss the consequences of the country. It is rarely something I've seen in Japanese movies, and it was even harder to get an idea of ​​a sincere and general man's fight against domestic issues, with resources targeted at warfare. <br /> <br /> The actresses here are a great challenge for their winnings and roles, whether they are veterans or children's actors. The actor is particularly proud of Sayuri Yosinaga's role as a mother-hero, who is forced to dig deeper and to keep her domestic environment intact, while Mirai Shida and Miku Sato enjoy the companionship and reconciliation as children who are forced to learn. Each scene is full of joy and happiness to fill it with joy when it comes to difficulties. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < My mother has some amazingly fine art destinations, and it's high in delivering happy and sad moments without overpassing, or cheaper melodrama to reduce the audience's feelings. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: A very miserable end (I hoped for more than 2 hours working longer), Kabei's mother is coming up for you every day that comes from high income, or about her mother and her victims who will be tired of coming back. If you need another reminder for the victims, during the last loan, the scene will likely remind you of what you are supposed to do.
