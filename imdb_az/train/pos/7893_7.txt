I think I am part of the silent minority who loves this movie. Is the best of the Nightmare series? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun. Freddy Kruger reaches his bad, foolish potential. As the 4th and 5th episodes were down, I felt this so-called final part ("New Nightmare" real finale). Breckin Meyer also has a place where a stoner played in a video game that was thrown out and fell asleep and controlled by Freddie. It also looks like a very original and unusual series, especially when it's jumping around like Super Mario. And Freddy, a funny liner, produced "Great graphics". Freddy regained his memory as he watched the game with Powerglove, just about 10 years ago. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is perfect. Lisa Zane knocked the ball over the bar. I have not seen Yaphet Kotto since Running Man and I think the last time I saw the movie 5 years ago. He is another great, worthy actress with a powerful screen presence. Who can forget? Johnny Depp (first "Nightmare"), a spokesman for the best anti-drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Finally, the 3D sequence is really awesome! So, if you want to check out this movie - please give it to the DVD! Hopefully all the publications come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video publishing 3D item has been deleted. <br /> <br /> I personally did not see anything wrong with the movie. It has been designed even at the back of Freddie. The film is a great mix of humor and fear, and the overall results are intense. Can this give better franchising to justice? Of course it could be. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. It's easier said than just finding the perfect result. <br /> <br /> And while closing, I liked to install on opening credits. The fans of the series will be delighted and look like a tribute to your favorite Freddy. <br /> <br /> My Account: 7 (from 10)
