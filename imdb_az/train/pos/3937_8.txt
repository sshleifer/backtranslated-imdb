Abe Lincol's early career is well-presented by Ford. Just as Lincoln is not seen by a true Lincol, the fake-nosed Fonda, like Lincoln, is like a voice, a delivery, a ride, and other behavior, as if it were Lincoln. Ford, the first of three consecutive films prepared by Fonda, perfectly matched the early start of the 19th century on his jacket. The story focuses on couples who accuse Lincoln of blame for the murder of Lincol and his scene in the courtroom. Most of Ford's attendance is supported on a regular basis. It was Alice Brady's latest film because he died a few months after his release.
