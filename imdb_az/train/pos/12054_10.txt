For the first time, I saw this movie when it was broadcast in the United States in 1989, Central TV. I still have a video tape, though it's outdated (many friends and family members paid this debt and chilled it out!). <br /> <br /> In any case, when I come home tonight, I remember that by holding the Christmas holidays, it closes the lights and watches what the "Christmas Ghost Story" is. I still remember that I still stretch my hair on my neck ... <br /> <br /> I've seen some comments in the film that is not and that's it ... I think these people were scared by Friday 13 and so on, laughing bones and shaking rammel. This is a "traditional" dream story; no big budget action or special effects ... no blasphemy, no blood, no sex scene, no chain or weapon etc .. So how refreshing! Atmosphere. This is a movie for you if you like horror horror, good writing, good behavior, and a truly intimidating atmosphere. I love the original horrors; Only yesterday night I saw the original Haunting and this is a beautiful movie. Again, atmospheric - Black and Black Women. The end of the film is different to the book, but it is still very good. I recommend it. Try it out ... you'll even want traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off the lights, open the wood, lock the doors, hold a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
