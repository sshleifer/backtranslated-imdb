Emma is a defective film based on Jane Austens's classic novel. I have not read a book, so I did not know a lot about the truth and still guess the whole area. There were many scenes that hurt me according to bad writing or leadership. Although the movie was fun for some reason, I liked it. Of course, there were all scenes I did not like, but most of them acted well and were funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives her one of her best performances, as heroes in Emma. The film also includes Tony Collette (who is good, but better) Evan Mecgreger (Kim is also good, but still very good here) Alan Cumming (I have never been really surprised at and is pretty much the same here)) and Jeremy Northam (Performance is from the tree even better, even though it is even better) Jane Austen's books have been better adapted, but it is still very entertaining and capable of watching.
