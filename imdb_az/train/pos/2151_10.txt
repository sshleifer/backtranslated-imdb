Funny. Sad. Charming. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful, simple movie watching all the words I have been scrubbed. <br /> <br /> A movie really moves me, but let's say, "Dancing?" He was able to do this with grace. Delicate humor, by chance, mixed with a gentle suffering that my film-review has become one of the best practices in history. <br /> <br /> And dance, oh yes, dance. Even if you are not a lover of art or you can not put a foot on it, the steps shown here will breathe and want to register for the fastest possible lessons. It was absolutely magnificent, even when parts of Sugiyama (touching Koji Yakusho by touch) started to dance for the first time, it was beautiful, humorous, like a child. And yet, this movie is not about dance full, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a shy man who wants to express his repressive emotions through dance, a beautiful dance instructor who re-experiences his love for art and personal development of each great supportive role. Pain. Emotional. <br /> <br /> All the love and the little excitement of life are expressed here with the delicate sensation of a beautiful Japanese watery painting. <br /> <br />
