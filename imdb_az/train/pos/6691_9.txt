This movie is very entertaining. Particularly, there are two things: one is a simple method of covering stereotypes by discussing costumes and collapses. There is a very exciting joy for parody; Second, the main sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special mention as Mr Furious's desires. He has the ability to work. I know that some expectations are disappointing, but this movie is very entertaining and kind.
