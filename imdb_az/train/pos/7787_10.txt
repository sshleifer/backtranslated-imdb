This film reflects the essence of growth in a small town for a little girl. Ashley Judd's character, Ruby, can be described as true for realism and delicate nuances offered in the story, just for the Florida panhandle life setting. From echoes of a screen cover to missing, the "echoes of life on the red neck" provide a rough choice for a young girl. Paradise was not easy. However, he slowly overcomes barriers and deception, and learns to be his own woman with a flowing power. Ashley Judd's victorious smile and infectious walk make it fascinate to the heat and labor. A careful gift of character development is similar to Ulee Gold in 1997, and Peter plays the role of Fondant, also under the leadership of Victor Nunez.
