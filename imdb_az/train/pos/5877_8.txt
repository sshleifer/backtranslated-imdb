Okay, that movie was nice, but I have to watch it as the price of an hour. Mac-friendly Mac and Sam are the fashion designers, and Mac's (Akshay Kumar) is the time to laugh when starting out with 3 air hostess while also suspecting his wife. Sam reaches a fortune and almost forgets his friend, but not entirely. But Mac thinks so, and he begins to start with air hostesses. Each step of the film has a heroic issue, the songs are rock, but there is nothing. It's not a comedy mark and deserves a prize. Its nice, but all the best. Some people laughed at their stomachs, but they laughed too much. Of course, everyone's opinions are different. So, if you want to watch the movie, you like it.
