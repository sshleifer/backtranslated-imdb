Possible Spoiler - In some ways, "How to Deceive Your Friends ...." learns that the type of story that engages in communication is "damaging, correcting, succeeding, and more important than anything else." - END OF SPOILS <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy gives a few good moments. Though I think the end is flawed. As if something was missing, I felt very fast and very sharp. Besides, I say that the film can not be kept at a high level. In addition, you will find a sweet selection of actors and actresses, sometimes with controversial features. So far, I have not seen Peggy differently. It may still be a bit more elegant on the screen, though it is a very unique type. Fox proved that he could play a hot star in the clouds. You do not know if it's a difficult thing to do, but it's better during the performance and warmth of "Transformers" (well, it's probably a difficult match). Kirsten Dunst is very Kirsten Dunst (again) and you can do it (like me) or find frustrating. On the other hand, you can see Anderson and Jeff Bridges (which may be a good, but possibly a little stronger) who prove their player skills. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think this is a bit more comedy and less funny passages, a sweet cast, but it's a good celeb comedy that ends suddenly.
