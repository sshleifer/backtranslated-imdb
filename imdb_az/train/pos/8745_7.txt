After finishing high school, the best friends Alice and Darlene decided to travel to Thailand. While they are there, Nick meets a charming Australian young man named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them to not have a weekly trip to Hong Kong. They agree. Though they were at the airport, they were trafficked for drug smuggling and were sentenced for some 33 years to what they said was a Thai prison. Without knowing what to do, his wife and I contacted an American lawyer, Yankee Hank, who lives in Thailand. There is a saying that if you have money you can help. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> But I do not believe it's over. <br /> <br /> <strong> Klair </ strong> <br /> <strong> Danes and Kate Beckinsale are here very well performances. Beckinsales's performance was a bit weak though. Friendships between both Denmark and Beckinsale are good, but they seemed to be strong. Paul Walker has a small uncredited role here. ;) <br /> <br /> In any case, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I gave her 7/10.
