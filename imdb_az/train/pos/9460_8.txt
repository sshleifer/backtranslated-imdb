I liked the story. At one place, a poster said that there were no families as mentioned in this film. Maybe it may. I thought everyone was really human and convincing. What a good hook was thrown. Great music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> After meeting his wife, I will say two words to recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. touching me fine depth. <br /> <br /> He commanded a widow to dedicate himself to a good taste with the costs of denying his own needs. <br /> <br /> You know that this movie was perfect. The actor who made this character felt something to me and just believed that I would act because he felt something, and he was perfectly convinced for what you felt and was denied because he did not feel himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave it to one of the eight.
