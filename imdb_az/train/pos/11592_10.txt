When I saw this movie, my son was 7 years old, now he is in the Russian Fishing Boat and the film is most impressive and this is the movie Legend of Legend that has been filmed for 39 years. Boy and eagle. He wanted me to be able to do so. I am confident that there are only 3 hours in the afternoon, and within three months this vessel will stay 3 months longer than the end of the contract. This film is closed because we are Indian blood. On January 27, he will turn 47, and I would like to get this movie for her. He lives in Thailand and is a commercial fisherman over the last 17 years, and we all know that this is the most dangerous thing. Can I help get this movie? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
