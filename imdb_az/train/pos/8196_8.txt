People do not think this is a bad movie. It has a pretty good plot, a good move and no change to place change for Harry. I am sure of some attacks and conflicts, but this is not just a movie. Eastwood is in good condition like Dirty Harry and liked Pat Hingle as a small city police in this movie. If you love DIRTY HARRY, this one needs to be better than its DEAD POOL. 4/5
