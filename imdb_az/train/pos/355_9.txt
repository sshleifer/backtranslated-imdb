Like many scary fans, I have been feeding Hollywood remakes and MTV high school slasher tripe for the same unique big budget over the past 20 years. <br /> <br /> If you wish, it is a movie in the genre of an original genre of fear, and you carry the right boxes. <br /> <br /> If you want a main actress, want vampires, ask for a cool weapon, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> fans.
