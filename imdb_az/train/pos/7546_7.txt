CAT SOUP "Hello Kitty" kittens, something that may have happened and then started on a strange journey through the next life. Asia, which opens this mind, does not use a dialog that substitutes for speech balloons instead. There is no way to describe this demented cartoon, unless you want to see it for yourself. And make sure there are no 10-year-olds in the room. Suddenly death and crushing disobedience for separation and greed, cruelty and violence and others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable feature is the waterfall, which consists of swimming in water and inside of the kittens, as well as walking. But in this movie, as it is practically all else, this silly, picaresque interlude is coming to an end in a terrible end.
