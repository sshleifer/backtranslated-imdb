"The Notorious Bettie Page" has always wanted to be an actress, but one of the most famous pin girls in America's history was about a woman. Bettie Page, played by Gretchen Mol, was one of the first sexual symbols in America. <br /> <br /> The Bettye Page modeling type that led to the ugliness and enslavement that led to the US Senate investigation in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> How much we came up with when we were going to the movie, how much we came from pornographic terms since the 1950s. Now you can go to the internet and find some of the most alarming and shocking pictures ever taken, and the images interviewed in The Notorious Bettie Page appear almost childhood and innocent. Despite the fact that Bettye Page took part, most of the images, including captivity, were nudity. But today, there are sickly pictures that we can see women who have sex with animals. <br /> <br /> I was looking at this movie in a very enjoyable way today because I see the envelope slightly reduced since 1950. <br /> <br /> I was very sorry to be honest with the "The Notorious Bettie Page", the film was very nice and exciting. The film causes the novel to be a very interesting look in one of the first female sex icons in the United States that you believe will be. Gretchen Mol looks like Bettie Page and delivers a great performance. I also thought that after watching the film black and white, the film would have looked real, because the audience was convinced that they were looking at a film created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> Only one complaint about the film was working, cut and somewhat seemed to have a few scenes. I looked at it and a 10-minute film was cut off from the original show at the Toronto Film Festival. And it was too complicated to end, and it would have been a little longer to wait for it, but perhaps a little bit more about the story of Bettie's life. <br /> <br /> Famous actress Gretchen, especially the writing, was good, except for a film about directorship. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron is one of my favorite films, American Psycho, directed by The Notorious Bettie Page. Mary, like Bettye Page, "Psycho", is a character work and it's a great thing to do, and I feel it's a talented director who knows how to create a setting and how to create great movies. Harron easily captures all the characters in the 40s and 50s. <br /> <br /> Last line: "The Notorious Bettie Page" has a definite eye. It's a very interesting event, like America, that shows how much the world is from a pornographic point of view. The film also features a beautiful performance of Gretchen Mol's nails as well as the star of Bettie Page. You have a good film in the hands of a talented director who can capture the look and feel of the previous era. Unfortunately, this movie will probably be floppy, as it will be interested in the film, except for those who are growing up in this era, but I think this should be checked. <br /> <br /> FilmManMenzel's "The Notorious Bettie" Page is an 8/10, one of America's most popular pins and an interesting character about sex characters.
