This film seems to draw a border - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other hand, can find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> There are many comedies that begin in this movie so many viewers are not "getting". Of course jet Li's mascara is like Bruce Lee's Cato - it's probably a joke. A man with a time bomb built on his heart is angry? Of course, this is a joke! Some readers are likely to question why this film is most likely to ask for extreme and strange violence. On the one hand, tolerance of violence at this level differs from culture to culture; <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Black Mask is really genre conventions and accusations that the type of movie would really recognize that Hong Kong audience is extreme violence, this is of course is a little bit higher for a little HK action movie. <br /> <br /> The conventions themselves are totally unreal, as they are over-extreme. After decades of waiting for people, many people were horrified to see the screams of Bonnie and Clyde and Wild Bunch all over the place. <br /> <br /> Indeed, when you hit a metal ink quickly, especially from the artery, bloodshed is almost certain. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese comic book. True, spiders can never get this pride - but if they are true, they would be! Well, in spite of his comic book sources, this film is committed to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I received is very sensitive, multi-styled shooting and editing. If the creators of this film looked like nostalgia in the Hollywood style (eg Rocketeer or the latest Sky captain movie), I doubt that everyone was attacking it. <br /> <br /> But if it stops, it's still a lot of fun watching this movie.
