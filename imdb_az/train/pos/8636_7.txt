So-so story, starring Brad Pitt and Culietta Lewis, David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes attended a journey from the west. The latter couple investigates intentional homicide sites for an upcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer (unaware of Dave) and Juliet, not his poverty, but his wife. It moves along a good cast and story, but Pitt, though better than one of his earlier roles, is not intimidated as a serial killer. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes, who can always shine, whether it is in the role of "life in crime" or "Wonderland" short series. <br /> Sound: 6
