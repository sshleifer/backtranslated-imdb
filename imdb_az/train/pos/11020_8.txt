Rocky Mountain Rescue takes a worrying alarm set up by the brilliant terrorist sophisticated Eric Quaien (John Lithgow). Quaien lost three major events in millions of dollars. Two experienced alpinist Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and Tucker (Micheal Rooker) and a helicopter pilot (Janine Turner), but with a trap by Quaien and his men. Now two mountaineers and pilots are forced to play a secret game. Quaien tries to find millions of dollars and kidnapped Tucker to find the money. Tucker died after finding Tucker money. For explosive firing power, bitter cold and gentle heights. Walker had to keep Quaien alive. <br /> <br /> Reny Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, Science Street 4: The Nightmare Master) featured an entertaining non-stop action. This film is also a spectacular, exciting, visual exciting action with lots of dark humor. One of the biggest hits of 1993 is one of Harlin's best films. Lithgow is a terrible funny lion. Stallone, of course, made a short turn into this acute tension. This is probably Harlin's best work as a filmmaker. <br /> The DVD has a sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35: 1) transfer and a great Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. There is a commentary that works with DVD's comments by Stallone. The DVD also has technical team comments. Behind the scenes of the DVD there are two scenes with more scenes with the director's presentation. Do not miss this great action movie. Screenwriter Micheal France (Fantastic Four) and actor: Stallone (The Rocky Series). Based on a foundation by John Long. The perfect kinematography by Alex Thomson, B.S.C. (Alien, Demolition Man, Legend). Oscar is nominated for best sound, best sound and best visual effects. Panavision. (**** / *****).
