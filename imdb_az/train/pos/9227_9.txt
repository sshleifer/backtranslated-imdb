<br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! <br /> <br /> This legendary ship of the film destroyed a monastery after describing the daughter of the 15th-century daughter of Noble's daughter, her father, and indeed the Middle Ages Christian community <br /> <br /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) and expressed openly on one stage by the monks), can not accept patriarchal power. Flavia is open to the public <br /> <br /> She finds herself and opposes the entire system of pressure, pressure, and violence, causing a disastrous outcome not only for her but for those around her. <br /> <br /> This is far from the truth presented as part of a nunsploitation. This is the description of the violence, the effects of patriarchal power, the nature of the rebellion, and the demise of the human soul. <br /> <br /> I described it as "post-feminist". and in the end, Flavia's victories must always be violated, offended and abused by men. <br /> <br /> Even the terrible end of Flavia is carried out by men by men (women are turning away and only monks look into fear). <br /> <br /> With regard to this debate, this would have exacerbated the impact of violence and anarchy scarred by religious persecution, limiting the impact of the film to escalate violence, lowering the film, and assuring its patriarchal discrimination. this is a true portrait <br /> <br /> A beautiful film, a beautiful film (especially by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), Flavia, which has a good score by the piovani and is still difficult after all these years, is the European Movie Classics.
