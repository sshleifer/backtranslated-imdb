Ring (or Ring 2) is not at the same level, but still a good Japanese horror, though. I wish North American horror producers would produce a page from the Japanese horror template and give you more 'swelling' and less costly shocks. It's a scene from a young actress with a very good example, a face with a face with a face, a photo of a wall smiling smiling a second and more suddenly. If you do not like it, check it out.
