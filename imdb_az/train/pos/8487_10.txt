I remember watching Gung Ho as a child with my mother, and wondered why he could cry in the last few minutes. I, of course, found that the film was amazing, especially the characters' characters. <br /> <br /> <strong> It did not exist until the past and much more than before. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shone as reluctant mediators in their role. Keaton was amazed at conveying my lifestyle and added Watanabe to the mixture of humor and patos. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was just as spectacular as a comic relief. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the 80s of the least films. In this movie we can learn from the combination of American and Japanese workers ... sometimes you can really be "the best of both worlds". Now, I understand that my mother feels this upcoming moment. I would like one of those cars.
