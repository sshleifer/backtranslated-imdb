Of course, of course, ignoring the conventions, as I am among the few fans who are really familiar with the majority of these children, I consider myself as a Frontier # 1 fan. <br /> <br /> The Hidden Frontier is one of the main ideas of Rob Caves and his studio. "Hidden Frontier", Areakt Pictures, which operates outside the back room of the Hidden Frontier House since 2001. Tos-based New Voyages (sometimes referred to as Walter Koenig, aka Mr. Chekov), but not the "fantasy" of TOS, which brings together actors / writers, we can create Rob's and HF's "Enterprise" worthy of substitute for this horrible experience . The most controversial and successful story sequence was Star Trek's first open-gay character, the introduction of the second season by introducing Corey Aster and his search for a spouse. Shortly after the series, he meets with Excelsior's Trill Tattoo Officer Jorian Zen. Zen, with two symbols on the last story lines (WARNING: MAXOR SPOILER, read the sequel to this point!) Zen combines with a deported simbion, causing a major change and some conflict with the Aster. Despite the uncertainty of the future, the "Beachhead", which I viewed as the latest episode, was shown to HF fans last night in the chat room - I think this attitude will continue, but I'll just say time. <br /> <br /> Gene Roddenberry has created an intention that Star Trek's story is more symbolic than fierce cosmic battles. Rob Caves has created the Secret Frontier for the same reason - and this made this series so popular. As mentioned in the previous statement, I could give it a rating of more than 10, but it is enough. Despite the end of the next season, the Star Trek show, based on the tradition of the seven seasons: New Generation - I'm ready to bet on a lot of hearing about the Hidden Frontier after the last section.
