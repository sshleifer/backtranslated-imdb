This is a movie that will never go out of the main market, as it will probably not be easily watched by the audience. The story about Difficult Spike and his friend Heaton is still a movie on Friday night, but has its own unique edge and I've found it to be entertaining. When spike aerosol is digested, there are moments of gleaning given that the film is pulled to such a low budget. But I have not understood the relationship between Spike and Heaton, and I must be honest because I try to get the most out of the movie. The majority of the film is a fact that is often spent with two friends who are talking, and it's not really a motion. It's a tiny movie that's hard to watch and makes it attractive.
