Other commentators have given me a detailed (or better) explanation of me or their public examples and comments, but I would like to share my admiration for this sad statue of the film. After 50 years in every category - scenario, action, photography, design, sound design ... really good. This is really some sort of classic. This was my first "young" Alec Guinness, and it became clear from the first frames that she finally made her special to get a hug. <br /> <br /> I only consider it to be a "8" because this is a really light example of human nature checking, but it does not really exaggerate it; and with the inventor solving the conflict between the mill workers and industrialists following all cities in the city, at the end of the plot is easy. In addition, the main flaw in the logic of a few minute thinking scenarios is that it is a certain fact that wear and tear is a matter of purchasing new clothes (especially dresses); children grow up, people change, gain weight and weight, always go with the latest fashion and have a knitted fabric. And if nothing else, the manufacturer will gain a wealth of materials that will not be split into military uniforms (especially BDU). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie yet. If you have a chance to see a classic movie channel, you should do so.
