The last film of Hal Roach (I believe) was very well-know before their 20th century fox journey. Even though there are weak moments, for example, the work with the "lung testator" is somewhat small, but ... ("Dr." Jimmy Finlayson is worth seeing) - but all this flick is a good summary of the boys' screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appeared on other L & H flies and threatened him like Nick Granger. One of my favorite moments is that the scene where boys can eat their own synthetic meals ("Good looks, good, probably good tasty"). Stan & Ollie will always be millions of loyal fans in the lives of fans.
