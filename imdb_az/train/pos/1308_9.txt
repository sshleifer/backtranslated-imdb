I have to say that I had no idea where to sit and watch this movie. I know that there was something better between class. But once I was interested in a television movie. Most importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eyes. I'm not really his admirer before this movie. Of course, I like Twister and like you liked it. But something about this movie really was for me. Now I see myself as a great fan. This movie comes from me at high prices. Give me a chance, you will not let go.
