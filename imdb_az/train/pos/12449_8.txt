Finally, there was a good modesty Blaise, which only explains a story, but really tells the story of "real". I acknowledge that I'm a bad movie if you're in for a motion excitement, but when you're on the road and you're up to all your expectations. Then you will see that this is a very close story by Peter O'Donnell. There is a story story just to talk about humility as a great person. Not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie that tells true tales. Some things could have been better, but when you do not forget the terrifying movie from '66, this is a beautiful movie. After such a fan enjoy and relax just enjoy the fact that the story is just a cover story to tell his story of modesty.
