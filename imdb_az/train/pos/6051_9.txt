This is a great British movie. A cleverly-scrutinized script with many word lines that perfectly fits the magic mushrooms into a weekly man. The most up-to-date British actor Geoff Bell is against the usual Phil Daniels. Peter Bowles brings a strange atmospheric piece to the fabric with a casting masterstroke and Gory Stretch's cloth with his brooding look with a combination of hanging. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, I think they will find a viewer other than that, just a lot of people are doing and buying a t-shirt. A great original soundtrack with Freebird's Gulf version. This can be the 21st century heir of really popular Ealing comedies. Like herbs in the Welsh fields: a grower!
