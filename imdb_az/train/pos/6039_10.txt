I was lucky enough to be addicted to this great movie and I liked every minute of the filming. I started in London and had a great conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon, as my husband. A few weeks later, I met the biking club members with the movie. What a brilliant movie it deserves to be there with all the great biker films. How much of my wife will not be able to buy Sue on DVD now. Now get a little stick from the club that I think is a movie star, oh can be a good dream. I think they're just jealous. The only disadvantage of the first part of the film was air, rain, rain and more rain, but hey, we were in Wales. Hopefully it will be a follow-up, so Jon wrote me. Danny Beck
