I had seen this movie many years ago and had a long-lasting impression on me. Unfortunately, many films have been stifling for years and I have not been expecting the admiration of California when I was watching again. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really make the film stronger: First, as it was 10 years ago, everything is beautiful and beautiful. The first is casting. Bred Pit's early grace is a strange concern. Knowing Pitt as one of us, as one of Hollywood's most beloved hearts, reveals that he has played such an ugly character. <br /> <br /> Pitt sees the show without addressing the white garbage stick or parody, and is able to stay awake throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is a forty-year-old old girl, like Grace's tragic lover. Lewis is trying to offend his humility (for his characteristic life) and humility, but he is rarely enhanced by the subtle grace he has done with so many young actors. Personally, I think that Pitt and Lewis were a tragedy that did not give any rewards for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes both inevitably, in the United States with Pitt and Lewis. <br /> <br /> Duchovony is in line with each other, and Forbes just seems to be silent and silenced, but both actors are trying to convince themselves of the change of their symbols because they are equally interesting, impeccable and strange to Pitt are. Beautiful cast and always shining, this movie really captures us with unlucky balls thanks to the perfect pacing. When Hollywood was released, Hollywood starred in psychotic films ("One White Woman", "The Beatles", "Beat The Rocks The Beatle", "Sleeping with an Enemy" and so on). Most of these films follow the same formula, but the change is the natural link between a good man and a bad man. 'California' is not too far from this region, but the first two movements are a perfect example of a slow cooking tension, and are kept outside our seats waiting for the return of the suddenness. /> <br /> Pitt maniacal leave the empty guy to play the bad boy, when the penny drops, the film is completely geared up and the last twenty minutes are not as vivid as the rest of the movie. That said, the move was thick and fast and resolved to be cold. <br /> <br /> The most part of life (somewhat clever, previous X-files provided by Duchovony) is very striking. Of course, it is supposed to be derived from the book Duchovony's journalism, as it can claim that a conscious tradition is a resemblance to a style without the scenario written by the majority of journalists. <br /> <movie is a great success, and over 90% of the last twenty years are cut off. Highly recommended, but not for gastric and weak weaknesses. This movie is disturbing at multiple levels. But then, that means.
