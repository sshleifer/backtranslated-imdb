The most sold horror novelist Cheryl (a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely Virginia Bryant), a long castle summer vacation located in the village of his wife Tom (loved Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (beautiful Patrizio Vinci). The local legend claimed that the territory was cursed. Cheryl finds a creepy, hairy, bad ogre (David Flosi hulking in a terrible ugly suit) living in the basement. Cheryl must get rid of fear of childhood, so he can beat his legs. Director / Writer Lamberto Bava is an expert to create and maintain an exciting and regrettable mood. Moreover, Bawa, the best way to frighten us, is to release a hero's finger rhythm of standard blood in order to prepare a story like how to make a sophisticated and provocative dark adult fairytale how we will encounter a single source. Sabrina Ferilli is backed by sincere schoolteacher Anna, like Stefania Montorsi, as daytime babysitter Maria and Alex Serra, like an artistic artist Dario. Gianfranco Transunto's bright cinematography has several fluid tracking weight and great ambient lighting. Fabrizio Sforza's strange make-up f / x hit Simon Boswell's spectacular inspirational spooky'n'shuddery honey and dank, dark, cobweb-covered floor skin scanning spot. It's worth watching.
