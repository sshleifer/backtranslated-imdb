Story and music (George Gershwin!) Are as beautiful as Levant, Guetta, Foch and of course Kelly. One thing is missing and this is a good leading lady. Sorry, Leslie Caron is concerned about me. In any case, though, the plot moves well with the popular (and decent) ballet. Oh colors, bright red, blues, greens and yellow. Do not forget the Mus! ; <br /> <br /> I only contradict the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (the absolutely black and white suit) and the always bright ballet. <br /> <br /> So, it sees it and enjoys it anyway, because it's not good, it's MARVELOUS. But do not forget that other Gene Kelly has fled the dwarf with just 20-year-old girl.
