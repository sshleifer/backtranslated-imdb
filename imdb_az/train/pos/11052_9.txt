When I was six, I learned about a series of "Los Campeons" and even though I was a kid, I did everything to convince my parents to watch the "Champions" and "Avengers" once a week. I think the English language was a "Golden Age" series ... (I already have a full cycle of "The Prisoner!") But a few years later, "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" Harry Potter ", of course, I want to have a girl from" Zone 1 "or" Zone 4 "as well as" Dr. Who "A few uhms, perhaps 300 DVDs, 8), "Tomorrow's People" and some other "low budget", but great stories that can be found in the areas I have reached. I speak and understand English, but my relatives do not even have parents who bring me these great stories ... One day I hope someone can feel this attraction and then I can sell them for the first time as I can see. Distributed or subtitled, but saw them in the same format. Remember, Zone 1 or 4 TVs OK with my TV!
