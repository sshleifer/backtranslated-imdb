Opening freshened with the tastes of those who master it - the modified version of the Archers logo, access privilege, and the way the camera splits into space. In the same year, it is strange to think, "This is a wonderful life." There is no great coincidence: The 1940s were filled with heaven and earth films; <br /> <br /> Alfred Junge's vision is next to the bright woolen nebulas and the angels of rivals resemble each other. <br /> <br /> And we have more stunning ideas. I am not a big fan to mix black and white colors in general. When one of the two visual schemes is placed in the other, it is almost always ugly. It is not here. Powell gives color to monochrome and monochrome colors, and this is the most natural thing in the world, just the change of pallets. Both color photography and black and white can stop themselves. <br /> <br /> As for this story, it can be the best script of the Pressburger, or at least the result would be a logical consequence of previous events. Other than that, there is a density, but perhaps more like I'm here. The heavenly things were real or imaginary? Carter may have imagined a fantasy, as was true.) Everyone says that we do not answer this question, nor expect it, but why I do not see it. I'm sure we want to ask a question. The film even gives us tips on what's happening to us - indeed, there are so many tips on the problem, and they point to different directions in the first place. Other things should also draw our attention that it does not mean we should not. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the scene where Ibrahim Farlan (a criminal prosecution advocate) has published a cricket match and speaks scary: The Voice of England, 1945. Reeves recognizes the exhibition with great embarrassment and then brings out one of his own: America's blues song, Farlan listens like a lemon in his mouth. <br /> <br /> Revers seem invisible. <br /> <br /> Snobbery? Yes, why not condemn blues music is not snobbish - and, of course, Powell and Pressburger do it. As the song is stolen, we get a shot of American soldiers listening to it: many are riddled with their heads and are perfectly at home. THIS IS THE CONTRIBUTION. There is something valuable about the song, and neither Reeves nor Farlan knows what it is. Reeves, most likely, performs. All English viewers (and all Australian, Indian, etc.) also know that there is something worth doing in the cricket broadcast; When Reeves understands it, Farlana can not explain it - so blues are published that show that these people can understand each other without sharing the concept. <br /> <br /> One last thing. I found David Niven a bit cold, without his charismatic career; But after the start of such a move, I do not think that a movie has captured my heart as soon as possible.
