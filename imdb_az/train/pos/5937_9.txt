Shortly after seeing Batman Dead End, I did not really know what to expect from the world. Of course Superman and Batman. <br /> <br /> After watching a 3-minute trailer, someone wished to create a serialist fan film for the world's best. Of course, some of the Superman's staff were cheese, but the movie trailer always had fun , only the certain aspects of the product. <br /> <br /> <strong > <br /> <br /> Nina Kaczorowski will make a good Lois Lane, especially for a dialogue that is closer to the film. > It's good to see Clark Bartram wearing a Batman suit from Dead End, but it should be a little more refreshing and not like the 40s Batman, 80s-90s skin head and cowl. His behavior is similar to Batman, but I am surprised at the reliability of the white contact lenses, as long as it still does not allow the eyes to appear through the mask. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn, Superman, can not play the cycle. He simply says, "Swallow me," while looking at his face. <br /> <br /> In general, I would like to see a full story and a movie on this work. There was a word about the world's best movie, and that could have been the right add-on to the script. We hope more.
