In this film there are Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill, and General Custer. Gary Cooper is playing Wild Bill and plays with Jean Arthur Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays a bad guy selling weapons to Indians and you know it in a difficult way. For the first time, Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie we have prepared was basically the same, but at a different time. This film begins with a conspiracy of Lincoln, and it deals with an Indian war. The disaster is in love with Jane Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill married and now wants to stay home. This film deals with Custer's last stand and is very far away. Gary Cooper is in a normal position, and I usually do not like Jan Arthur, but I liked her here.
