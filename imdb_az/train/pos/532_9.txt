Magical, romantic, innovative and funny. The vision of this unusual movie is virtually indefinitely beyond the well-known "death romance" known as "Ghost." When we notice that Peter and June will find great happiness at the end of a long peak, happiness is on the way. The source of story is, of course, timeless: love conquers all. But it is played in a piano arena full of vision and praise, which is a fight to achieve this victory. With more than 500 additions reflecting many ages and cultures, the vision of paradise leaders remains memorable until six years after CGI. <br /> <br /> But on the whole space scale, Powell and Pressburger knew the truth: the best story is explained in the smallest sense. Stairway's beautiful, determined romantic aspect is captured by the latest simplicity: June's tears are kept in a rose-groom. <br /> <br /> This movie, like the story itself and the set itself, is one of the centuries.
