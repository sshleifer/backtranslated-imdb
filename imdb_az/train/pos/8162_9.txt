Dr. Like Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen's "The Dentist" turns out to be a great mistake. <br /> <br /> With high-speed obsessive-compulsive tendencies, the IRS pushes her and is a very suspicious spouse; Dr. Alan Feinstone loses more and more perceptions every day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Dentist" is a solid film! Bernsen, at the same time. Feinstone's relative and hate character. Even though he leaves the tree completely, the audience will still feel sincere. <br /> <br /> In some movies, it's the best movie for me. <br /> <br /> Perfect direction will continue to scream along with good murder and protection and effective pacing films. <br /> <br /> Recommended for!
