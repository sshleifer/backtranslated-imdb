If you can not enjoy a chick whisper, stop now. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that Ann Grant Lord dies. Her two daughters came to bed. Ann speaks about her past moments that her mother is unaware of, and asks questions about the lost or imaginary acquaintances. <br /> <br /> Life is essentially changing in the life of Anan from 1953 to 2000. In 1953, he experienced the love of Anne's life and suffered the greatest tragedy in his life. <br /> <br /> Annin is married to two good friends, Lila, from college. Ann's best friend is Lila's brother Buddy. Lila and Buddy are children of a wealthy Newport family, Ann is a cabaret singer who wants to be a free soul, but still living in Greenwich Villages, which is associated with many of the 1950 conventions. <br /> <br /> Ann has come to become a servant of honor at Lilya's wedding, and she has met the person who will be the main character in Harris's life. Lila and Buddy are the eldest son of a former old-time servant to become a doctor in a small New England city. Ann soon enjoyed Harris, who was always in love with Harry and continues to be. Buddy is in love with Harris, but since 1953, Harris has directed homosexual desire for her good friend, Ann, because she has another kind of sexual desire that she can not accept. <br /> <br /> Buddy shows the inner excitement of being a spirited, clever, and bad-looking boy of the family - a lot of right and confusing parent's call. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, all of these are expressions and pressures. <br /> <br /> Now Annan's daughters go away from her mother and carry out her life and are in doubt. Constance tries to emotionally end up trying to take on the role of perfect mother and wife. <br /> <br /> Nina was not always able to keep in touch. <br /> <br /> Mix all these relationships for fifty years and get involved with society, values, and personalities. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the past is perfect, but there are some unusual speeches and scenes - along with two unique family relationships, this movie is very special, /> <br /> Claire Danes plays Annini in the 1950s, and clearly shows that she is an intelligent woman when she conflicts with what she needs to do. . His performance will not be forgotten easily. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays Death Annin's death from the past to fantasy flights, and, of course, Redgrave draws them all sterling. Natasha Richardson - the real daughter of Redgrave - plays the role of Annin's daughter Constance in the film. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays with Ann's other daughter, Nina. <br /> <br /> This is a scene where mom and dad play laughter with the mother and daughter of real life. Nina feels hurt and self-regretted when she and her mate love a good man. <br /> <br /> He said one of the allies would not attend the funeral. <br /> <br /> Best friend of the expected role in the life of the Caucasus, Ann. He is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays with Lila today. <br /> <br /> What does Mirel Streep mean when he says he is looking for Glenn Close to play at least part of Lila's mother on DVDs, Lajos Koltai? because he felt that he was the only actress to play a scene in the movie. He was right, and in the near future the performance of the scene would take into account. <br /> <br /> <strong> All of the other scenes and treasures that are the most suitable moments in Lille are getting more performance. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the film. All movies are worth watching. Lila's wedding day entered Mother's room and went to bed with her friend to discuss her misconceptions about Lila's marriage with a man she did not like. This scene is repeated every fifty years after Lila arrives to bed to talk about her life with Ann and her life. Streep and Redgrave are delighted at this latter scene. <br /> <br /> Another memorable scene when declaring his love for Buddy Ann is at least for me. Hugh Dancy gives Buddy a heart-breaking performance of a young man with a sense of sexuality that surprises us. <br /> <br /> Chicken shift? Yes. A very special movie with incredible toys, director and decor? Indeed. In the evening, many things can not be offered.
