"Killya KÄ±yafet" is one of the best works ever made. This is a movie for adults with sex and violence. Brian De Palma once again proves why another filmmaker could use the camera to explain a story. He directs many scenes to dialogue and reflects his story, and, therefore, using his visuals, is a brilliant account of Pino Donnagio. The film shot on the Panavision film, De Palma will be shown on large screens to tell her story using the full width of the film. Cut, the "Kill Outfit" on the video is the same film. You need to make solid speeches from the best movie account shown in cast, superior and possibly the best film, "Sword Sword".
