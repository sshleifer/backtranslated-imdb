I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great actor, and now I know he is a great writer / director. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I've been a fan of "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cabin" and "Stardust Memories". <br /> <br /> Lee Grant is very rare today in everything. Missing on the screen for too long. It's nice to see Cloris Leachman in something other than sit-com. This is the best work from the "Last Picture Show". You love this movie when you grow up in an Italian American family. When I started watching this movie, I did not expect much, so when I fell in love with this movie, I was pleasantly surprised. If you have the chance, look.
