Nimh was a mystery and a memorable masterpiece of the earth's creators before the time, a bittersweet cartoon that was very touching. I remember very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very nice. Well, a little dark, a pound ran, and a dog that was killed by an old friend begins, ends up in heaven and comes back. But it is sweet when you are friends with an orphan girl. Some scenes were a little scared by other animated cartoons like Charlie's dream, but everything was OK and the songs were fair. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise have an unforgettable role, and I just love that guy. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, God can rest his soul, poor girl, she is not worthy to die, but now in paradise, good people go to heaven. Generally, this animated film, Don Blut, is enough to embarrass the classic anime and Disney. Recommended for the whole family. And if you have the original video of this movie then you can find it after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, waiting for the man's love.
