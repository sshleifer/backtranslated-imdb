In this film, 11 short films feature masterpieces (I've just found a disappointment in Egypt). Except for the Mexican director, he chose to describe the problems of individuals or groups 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, widows of Srebrenica, AIDS, poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup, and later bloodshed, suicide attacks in Israel , Paranoia in the United States, and in the hearts of Muslim Americans, single elderly and Asian soldiers persecuted by the state after the Second World War. This can both empathize with empathy restrictions on both ways: leaders may feel that Americans act in the same way as short films when they ignore the rest of the world and care only about their disasters. <br /> <br /> I found the best in Sean Pann's collection, surprisingly, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I describe Ernest Borgnine's description as a semi-naked old man after WTC's "out of the light path" A New York apartment that lives in the happiest moments of the life of a widow shining through the window of the sun can be one of the most insulting to see a common American audience.
