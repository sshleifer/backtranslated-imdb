Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and all the best Jeff Fahey, in a film. Wow, that can be said about it. These are four of the most influential actors in the world and work together well. <br /> <br /> This film is like a poetry and looks like a good friend because of its natural ability to shoot. <br /> <br /> The film itself is beautiful, it's dense enough to spend the first time, and four stars help greatly re-await. How good is Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey on the screen, the moment the vocals themselves filled themselves while watching a few distances, gave me a tear in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Go to a good movie, a great cast, go. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
