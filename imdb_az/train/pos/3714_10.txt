First, I did not know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> Everyone brings a culture of genre of cult, and when it is adapted to the present, nothing will be lost in translation. <br /> Here it is not. This movie starts just the right way. This is a part of a familiar area, but it can also take over. Who is the Crockzilla scene? You have to look, just try and hold a flat face. This film takes part in some of the old entertaining cult movies and manages to mix it to a modern production. It is good to see someone fill their needs in this market. Very good work done. <br /> <br />
