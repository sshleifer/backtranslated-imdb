12-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother, Eugene. His feelings are imprisoned (or feeling that it is not true) to interact with the family itself. His immediate shelter is his father, and ONLY appears to be compassionate upon him. Realism will attract "true 2-life" movie lovers, but will not provide for those who want action and excitement.
