Every second part of the movie is beautiful. And so it has won 7 because the plot is not particularly unusual and I've been thinking about it in the last 90 minutes. If anything, luxurious graphics and framing have created certain scenes on more pedestrians (such as car chase) as they should - they do not look nice, and there are many original designs and sometimes new camera angles, but they are for any normal movement / tension it does not lose its kinetic movement and close-ups as part of the language. The first hour is united and the dialogue is very fragmented and feels a bit stagy - people are waiting for each other to finish, and they do not always react in a natural way, which is the problem of keeping the dialogue of each person individually. Rarely, the feelings in the sounds are not quite appropriate; really something that has not been avoided. Futuristic architecture is very appealing (many glass walls / ceilings / screens, beautiful smoke / creature / special effects) and beautiful looking cars, but still more in graphic design, the story does not have any real impact. The whole point of the captured animation (instead of the actors / CGIs) is actually to push the boundaries of imagination and design; make it very difficult and unacceptable in other environments. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance animation is, of course, strangely and unbelievably successful, but I have never felt as though I had never seen anything before. <br /> <br /> Immortel, another French CGI film, is also subject to an imbalance of beauty over the story and pace. In order to be fair, some wonderful and entertaining French films are also strange, and look at some of them or rain in Paris's cobbles is a great emotion - but animations need understanding, and are weaker than real-life techniques. Probably, filmmakers will leave the "noir" rules they want to stay in, but filmmakers will be able to explore the future society a bit further: social strata, fascist attitude of corporations, and so on. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend Renaissance to everyone who likes style design and / or animation (especially the 'Manga' fans), but I do not want to sit with my other movie lovers. Take the luxurious images and this is a difficult movie.
