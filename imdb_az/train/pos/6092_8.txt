Kult classics are almost impossible to predict. Who is the Vision Quest, the Fight Club, and 2001 guess? How would a Space Oddysey, a movie that was released by critics and audiences would be quite popular? Like many IMDBs, I consider myself a film expert. <br /> <br /> Unlike the majority of those who hate disrespect (with 4.4 degrees of danger), I found Envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is ridiculous. The dialogue is not smart, scenes are less durable, and the script appears to be written by a fourth-grader. But that's why the movie is so cheerful. As you can see, Envy's genius must be enjoyed in a mysterious way to appreciate the genius. <br /> <br /> Why do I love Enviyan? The film is good because it's good. This is a recipe for a religious classic and Envy is definitely in line with the bill.
