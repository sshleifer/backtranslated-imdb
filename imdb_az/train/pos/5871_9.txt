I like every frame of this beautiful movie. Regular people who suffer from a bit of life and have a luggage to carry around are all people we know. Like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker are perfect in giving their drawings, but Harris is particularly heartwarming and therefore very real. Perhaps he is a drink truck, so it will not feel anything. Baker, like his sister, has sensual moments - when DeNiro gave his flowers on a scene, he never gave a rose, and perhaps it did not seem. Very valuable.
