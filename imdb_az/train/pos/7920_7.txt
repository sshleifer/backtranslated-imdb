Full Moon High (1981) 3/5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly Tony (Arkin) is an average ordinary middle man. Prepping for a great homecoming game, girl friendly troubles and hair growth in strange places? While traveling to Transylvania with a horse (YES! McMahon) furballs leaves with a bad job, but in a strange place gets a bit of control of a piece of hair. <br /> <br /> Full Moon High says this is a foolish and entertaining horror. Larry Cohen (Q winged snake, The Stuff) is united as a writer / director as many gags to come. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a beautiful time with his lead role. If you're a frail fan of 'Aircraft' and 'Student Bodies', I'll have fun with this naked fest.
