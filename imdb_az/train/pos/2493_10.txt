The comedy of the typical 90s, a comedy for the modern-day comedy "My Family". Thatcher, Bill (Belinda Lang), the highest political joke, blames Thatcher for everything. "Bloody Thatcher" maybe shared the most. David is a typical teenager, brainwashing with bread knives, Jenny, moody old teenager, just boy and more boys. Bill and Ben work as much as they can to help their family fight in climatic conditions in the 90s. Unless the first two series are as successful as the latter, the 3 series begins with more laughter to count all. generally this show did not take the best watch time and should be spent for a while longer. Gary Olsen was unable to continue after her death, but I think it's time to get rid of "catherine tate" "office" "Little Britain" and bring the classics back!
