I always loved this John Frankenheimer movie. The good writing by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this is another tension, Frankenheimer. Ron Jeremy hired the porn star, as well as all the differences that attracted attention and attention to sad details! You can make a claim in the next best movie Roy Scheider. I always said that Robert Trebor was just a terrible performance. Clarence Williams III could not keep all his fears and he was perfect, but he actually attracted Trebor's attention. Frankenheimer is not proud of this movie, but is an effective tension with blackmail, murder, sex, medication, and sleazy parts of genuine porn players. What can you say about a film shot and assaulted by Ann Margaret? To say the least is a guilty pleasure. Vanity gives a realistic dark role and a very young Kelly Preston's early appearance. A classic exploitive thriller that should not be forgotten.
