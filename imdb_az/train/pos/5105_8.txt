City Cowboy's life cycle is the best proof of Texas life and how can he defend anyone else. Let's look at the following: Men beat men, drunk at night, fight, commit adultery, and marry for a mechanical bull. Test and name the movie that reflects real life in such a lively manner. They do not give it anymore. As you can see, current movies are always people with lots of money, they live in big homes, manage expensive cars, and do not work. <br /> <br /> I do not joke with the hadeeth of the Prophet (saas). I ended up filming this movie. Send me an e-mail to learn more about why I'm calling for a documentary. Take a look at the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are divided - he amicably honks and waves, he transforms birds - returns half of his neck to a half peace mark and then turns tears off. <br /> <br /> Buds's mother estimates. 18 hours after arriving in a town on Sunday, he is able to see if he has a job yet - all of his actions are drunk and (x2) are put on his aunt and his assistant. <br /> <br /> "You're all like pigs." Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Do you need it? Could not we understand without showing the bad sewage? I love God! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sissy, Only after a few days (or perhaps the next day) Wes emptied her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wesni? Oh yes, you did not beat my husband for another night, so if we take this lesson, let's not say that Bud and Sissy do not want to agree with him in many battles, and then all this happens. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a result, you do not give such scenes in a film to give an idea of ​​and understand the human psychology. <br /> <br /> I just do not want the director to be cut off.
