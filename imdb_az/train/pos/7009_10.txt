I thought it was a beautiful movie. It touches every fiber of a human being. Love in the film is very intense. I thought this was the best performance of Will's today. Great leadership. I like editing. The music was beautiful. Good use of Flashback. This movie is a must-see film. I hope people will get something wonderful. Generally a great movie. Hollywood should capture more movies. Even action movies can be a cautious story. I would like that his player was very subtle. He had a purpose and sacrifice, which is rare. I would just like to wait for someone you or I really care about. For me, the world stopped and my only movie was a movie. The outside world was postponed for a moment. It was a pleasant feeling with all this chaos in the world. And it was great to see something (someone) who cared for other people than myself.
