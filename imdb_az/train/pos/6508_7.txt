Watching Scooby was an eternal fan. This cartoon flies away from the same old agenda that may be boring to the audience. Crooks in mask mode is old and this cartoon is a change from that. It is not intended to replace the Scooby gang, which is just a break from the old scene, according to the audience and writers. Scooby and Shaggy, who are in the focus of the cartoon, earn a huge amount of money and use it to protect a crazy scientist and his sister's world conquest plans. They show small support and gangs of the network from time to time. If you are an admirer of Scooby-Doo, you can still appreciate the connection between a boy and his talking dog, along with the jokes that come with him. Just Enjoy the Cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers who will not be the ultimate Scooby Cartoon.
