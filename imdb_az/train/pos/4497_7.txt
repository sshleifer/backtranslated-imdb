For the first time in the late 90's, I saw the first part of this series and only had the chance to watch all three parts through Netflix (a convenient service in this way). Generally, I liked this unpleasant, sometimes in the genre, mini-series. The story of a young man falling for an older woman seems to work and all actors are good. Yes, there are some romantic clich√©s in the rain or on a train station, but the characters have the chance to explore, so it does not look like a Tom Hanks or similar one if it's similar. Robson Greene, sometimes reminds me of Scott Bakula, who is a separate birthday, can see a wonderful work of a man on the brink of falling, and the series and mirror of a wish and rejection. Personally I think the series could have been worked out in two episodes, but I think it's ready for discussions. As you can see, there is a conclusion and tomorrow should come through Netflix.
