Rich Basil Rathbone, an egoist composer who lost consciousness. For a while, he has bought his words and music from different sources. Trouble happens to meet and fall in love with two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and Mary Martin's lyrics. And then they discover what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin argue with singers. Mary signed a Paramount contract and at the same time doubled twice at Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Plays very well as you play. <br /> <br /> Like Crosby's paramount vehicles, I agree with the fact that there are no large production numbers either. a headline color reviewer sees a composer as a signal session in a pawn shop. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the original plot and great fun.
