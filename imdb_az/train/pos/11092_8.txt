There should never be a 52-Pick Up Respect. It works on many levels and has a complex, but challenging area. Some of the actors involved give their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover present perfectly detailed and deep illustrations. As it turns out, Vanity, who has to turn her into a serious act of career, taking into account unexpected abilities, and characterist Kelly Preston will follow you for a few days. Anyone who likes actions that combines with a powerful intricate story can do it.
