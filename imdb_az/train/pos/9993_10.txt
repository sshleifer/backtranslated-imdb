The most hillarious and funny Brooks I've ever seen. I can watch the strip 100 times and watch again. Once I laugh at me and cry for a few minutes. This is really a good and funny movie, and if you want Brooks - it's a must! In short, Brooks (billionaire) goes out into the street for 30 days homeless to win all his opponent from his opponent. Reality bites, but in the end - this is a warm relationship between people ... Consult with life!
