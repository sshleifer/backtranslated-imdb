Is anyone in tears of joy when watching this movie? I love her! One of the top 10 films of all time. It just feels good to me. I'm watching the production number along with all the castle members and ending up more! The beauty of the movie Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) IMHO! I have never seen the game, but I am angry when I read the reviews that say that the game is better than the movie. It's like two apples and oranges. The film making process will rarely present the finished product that is original to the original work. I think that just because of the fear of public lies, many well-known works adapted to the screen have not changed much. This is a very good film, very satisfied. Everything you need to know!
