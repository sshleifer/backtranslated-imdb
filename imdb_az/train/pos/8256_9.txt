<br /> <br /> This film was seen at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly smart, stylish and funny. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. <br /> <br /> <strong> Career Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly, and Alexia Fast's great job. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, writers Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie have participated in many political subtext; and it was meaningful. <br /> <br /> FIDO's sensitivity is guaranteed to be treated. <br /> <br /> I love her!
