This film, which recently voted as an audience lover at Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005, is inspiring and moving. The famous conductor, who had to retire from the disease, returned to the small village where he was born to become the leader of the church chorus, and finally found his music to be fulfilled. According to Sweedish's features, which keep everything intact and keep the insular character of a small Swedish village, this film is well-developed for every single character. perfectly directed, acted and sang, brought tears to many eyes and smiled at all. I hope you will be distributing in the United States. <br /> <br /> See if you can!
