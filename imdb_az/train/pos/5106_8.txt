When I see one of these old movies when I'm 80, it's just a little simpler when it comes to it. This movie is good. I remember seeing as a small child and I think it's the biggest movie. There are all heroic characters who want to be a young cowboy. Now as adults, I can go back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I know what it really is. I found something strange. How many people can move to Houstona and get in touch with Sissy, marry, go on a trailer, fall into, deceive, die uncle, and then return within a month? Only in America.
