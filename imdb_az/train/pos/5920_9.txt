American icon Henry Fonda draws the "Elegant" picture. After a long hiatus, an old truck, John Howard, owned by the great-looking Eleanor, was forced to miss his payments. She decides to go on just the perfect race, quit her hometown, escapes Eleanor, and blends with her old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who is forced to move the prostitute team. /> <br /> Fondas's great performance is a natural garbage for a film that effectively squeezes into the heart vessels as it touches the funny bumper on comedy scenes. Robert Englund, a reluctant young sidekick, Susan Sarandon (also a co-producer), and Dub Taylor (a delightful meadow, as always in the most obvious comedy part of the picture). <br /> <br /> The nature and the hardness of the journey, which confirm the life of the image, are incredible; <br /> <br /> This is a demonstration of an open road promoter here; the village looks beautiful. <br /> <br /> In the latter case, a small thing loses (John Byner and Austin Pendleton are less than intrusive), a remarkable aesthetically beautiful picture of Craig Safens' beautiful music account. <br /> <br /> Certainly, a premium movie experience that I can recommend without the hassle of driving / driving, especially from the title (especially its alternative name, Great Smokey Roadblock). /> <br /> 9/10
