BSG is one of my favorite TV series. I'm fortunate enough to follow him because he's coming to the last season of the series. It was a marathon from beginning to end and what an amazing trip! <br /> <br /> After seeing the pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what I was doing with the name of Caprica! When comparing both series, some things are not added when done in a good way. <br /> <br /> There was no mention of the hadiths of Battlestar Galactica or virtual worlds, but perhaps I did not have enough to explain why. <br /> <br /> I see this show as an alternative to the universe, technology and our world. This show is very interesting and you will want to watch more!
