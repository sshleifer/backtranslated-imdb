<br /> <br /> Although I love Doc's Smitin books and David A. Kyles's Lensman books, the anime dedicated to books is quite entertaining and sometimes innovative. Sci-Fi / Fantasy buffs inherited mystical powers as a child on a familiar planet and recognize the death of the family as a revenge, but this is quite fun. Additionally, Lensman was shot from one side and was the first animated film to use CG animation once. Of course, it may seem a little obsolete now, but it is still a novelty. If it were not for Lensman, it would have been better (personally with Computer Graphics live better animated). <br /> <br /> Because they were too bad, they just left it on DVD / VCD. Many countries have anxiety (mostly in extreme and different formats). <br /> <br /> I would like Lensman to release DVDs and DVDs in just about any part of DVD / VCD. <br /> <br /> P.S. Hell rules! I just think I look so subtle and neat.
