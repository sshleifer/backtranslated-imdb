With a minimal budget, eight-minute operation, and great imagination, Nacho Vigalondo acquired one of the most stylish shorts I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The sophistication of scenarios is really remarkable, because it does not end the last. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you what is short. more enjoyment. Nacho Vigalondo, the discovery of the year for a single show: writing, writing and acting in this mighty short form is the most remarkable effort I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to Martha Belenguer's performance, and her reactionary shooting is incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
