Maybe I'm very generous with rating ... but I love this movie! I have seen it many times, but I see it every time I love it again. It's just a romantic comedy, something big or monumentous. But I'm a great romance and this movie is romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins and Walter Mathau is very laughable. Scientists make me laugh ... I definitely come to anyone who does not see this movie. It's a clean, good movie, and it's rare now! My 20 year old brother also likes this movie, so it's not just a bare whistle. ;-) If you need to laugh, or just come and you just have to follow * an * romantic, come suggest that if you can not attend one yourself. This is a good!
