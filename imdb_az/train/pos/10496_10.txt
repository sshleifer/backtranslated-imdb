Great actors, oscar nominee actresses, stunning scenery, good storyline and more laughs can fit in with a new bag (and pretty big). This movie was brilliant. The beautiful scenes looked beautiful and funny moments. divide on the side. I did not laugh a movie theater audience, and my tears flowed through my cheeks during the 'ladies' shop. The British film industry and Craig Ferguson's magic ingredients are convinced that this is one of the favorite films of the year, if not all the time.
