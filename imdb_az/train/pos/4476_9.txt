Sinan is a terrible thing, like a boy embarrassed by Brooklyn. The first thing that comes to mind when you think is Sinatra plays its role. Kathryn Grayson is fantastic as Susan Abbott. We just lost this talented actress and opera soprano singer, who was only 88 years old. 9-year-old Dean Stockwell is one of those who want to be a sailor. Jose Iturbi sees a great deal of self-realization. His city with his piano. The head of the Eckhart Kennedy's police station is Sarah Berner Jerry Mouse's voice. There are so many great things in this movie, and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers. Only Kelly and Sinatra see "We Hate to Leave". "It's so much energy." "If you know Susie (I know Susie)" is pretty funny. Grayson, who plays Frank Brahms Grunson's "Jealousy," is very pleased to hear. The most memorable sequence falls into the world of animated fantasy, where it sounds and dances with Gene Jerry Mouse. Both were seen in Tom Cat Butler as they were there. They were ked as Mickey Mouse, but he refused. The film was nominated for five Oscars, but Georgie Stoll got acquainted with the Original Music Score. Anchors Aweigh, some high level fun.
