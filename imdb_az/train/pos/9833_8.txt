Terrorist is trying to steal a few secret biological weapons and, while trying to escape, is infected when dealing with a deadly agent. Soldiers can get back to work, but the terrorist will go to a hotel he's trying to hide. Finally, he takes him to his hiding place and "cleanses" the hotel and its passengers. <br /> <br /> The Zombi 3 is widely distributed by critics and zombie fans. on the contrary of a film. Although this is a fair assessment, it is not without high dots. For one thing, there are many bloody deaths to be very happy. There are plenty of zombies that can go anywhere. They live in water, the drops of houses are hidden in the trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a group of dead brushes, just as the heroes try to escape. There is a flying zombie head hiding inside the refrigerator. You just have to admit it to believe, because this scene requires only Zombi 3 to look at the IMO. One of the worst actors I've ever seen is the doctor who has some terrible regret and some very suspicious moves, but Zombie 3 is still a very fun movie. Sometimes it's nice to go back and watch a movie that does not require anything more than your time and an open mind. The Zombie 3 is in line with this bill and then some of it. It is even more pleasant if you look at some beers open with some brainy friends pop up. I just give 8/10 a chance to enjoy it.
