SOL LOVE, next to me, resembles one of the world's most talented writers and artists. The performances were light, the soundtrack was large and the cast was perfect. I thought Kristi was a very talented person, though I did not understand that he would say most of the time. In addition, he threw a tantrum, I'm a little scared. He also regrets that he suffered from cerebral palsy. Finally, if you have an immortal fan like Daniel Day-Lewis or biopics, I recommend this biopsy about one of the world's most talented writers and artists. You go for a real treat and for a good time, so do not miss this.
