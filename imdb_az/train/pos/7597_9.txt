Lost has something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and many things have been said so I will not have to write again for you again. Read only those who love it and you will know why you want to watch it. A wonderful thing about this series is its completely new. There are many films - and even fewer series are based solely on a topic that stops, but Lost proudly responds to the subject. All of this is a story of an episode that you unite with an unexplained and exotic place, beautiful circle folds, perfect casting, and a good format (combined in one episode and now combined). You can expect all the concepts of the characters, want to see the general picture, and you want to know where the writers are taking you. The result is a series that does not allow you to. In a more suspicious note, the series has been over a bit of season, probably its success. It is known that Lost was written only at the beginning of the season and when it was a great success, the writers also drowned. In my opinion, it was wrong to stay in the season 2 more mystery and higher levels, and then resolve the 1st (or at least partially) ones of the season. At the end of the season, there are a lot of things that can be done by a spectator, with secrets, consistent twist and unexplained incidents, with a great blurring. However, the difference between season 2 and 3 was great. Season 3 presents many concepts to replace with new questions. And that's how they write; you want to bend over one area, do not tire off a mysterious tsunami all around, and then choose a few to explain the audience. They have won the season 3 and bring us a promising series for the 4th season. It is good to see that such a different format of the array is so sensitive.
