This movie was funny, it could not stop smiling while watching it and watching it twice in two days! The film, Natali's other (more serious) films, are both magnificent and dramatic compared to Cube and Cypher movies. <br /> <br /> Dave and Andrew, who are very happy about this movie and "missing" characters, are described by David Hewlett and are very interesting. Andrew Miller (story co-writer), I love actors. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, the X-Box Dead or Alive battles (even Dave plays Halo at some point) and Andrew's fine guitarist solos. About friendship. You must see this!
