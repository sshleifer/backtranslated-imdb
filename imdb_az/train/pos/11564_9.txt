I've seen this movie a few times and all bad guys want to give it to him, but I think it's unfair for other good movies. But I think it's one of the rare stones: a perfect comedy. At all times, I'm going to one of the biggest comic movies. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly compatible and incompatible. The scenario is so sharp that bleeding must be neat. The story is well-known and has already been described in other comments. The two heroes give extraordinary speeches, girls are superior, and the situation creates side by side. It's not a sightless sight (as Hollywood says, you do not have to drink fun to be laughing, you have to be vigilant), and the transition from the stage to the film is not direct. They are more like that. Timeless.
