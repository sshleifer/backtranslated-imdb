<br /> <br /> The first thing I want to say is my Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find his brother. Her sister was abducted in Paris and her family did not hear anything. Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) suggests exactly where her sister is and finds it. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not just work for money because he just wants to help and get a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) watches him around and writes adventures into novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's fun, full of action, just great. Here is a cult film with little culinary. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed, and brings out a few liners that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are good as girls and sidekick. John Hurt, a man exploded in Alien from the stomach, plays for fun, plays fun and adds to fun. In many ways, this movie resembles Indiana Jones, and in some ways it resembles James Bond movies. Maybe it was called Indiana Bond, but it's a nice movie, no matter what name.
