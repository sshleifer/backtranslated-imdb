I loved Crazy more than any movie I've seen for many years. The successful group of 70 decided to give another try. They play some of the unforgettable European squares and start playing with cheerful results. Music is fantastic, scenario and player-friendly. Heroes are the leading singer, especially with heavy metal sound, makeup and personality problems. At the end, the concert was unreal. Go and see a good sound recording system with a good sound system :)
