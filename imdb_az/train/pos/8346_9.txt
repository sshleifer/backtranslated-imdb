I just watched this night again and forgot how much I loved this movie. It feels nice to have fun and to be right with the whole world. Ein Kleine Nachtmusik with Twinning, Twinkle Little Star, "Einstein" with Ed Walters during the IQ test, I love Mozart all the alumni. I love the fact that a woman is described as cleverly and a particularly unique case for the 1950s, when she was promoted to this career. (I'm a teacher myself, but I stayed at home to raise my children, so I do not think that many women are libberts). It is beautiful that a person with "only a monkey ape" seems to be finally. Catherine is a crucial and decent clinical behavior researcher like her fiancee. The message to me is not what we are doing but who we are more describing - there is no writing. <br /> <br /> When I hold a few things in the movie, there are many things that are not on the goofs page. At the scene, Ed Walters will feature three tools (others, rulers, etc.) on the right hand side of the body. There are only 2 shots on the next camera. The credits in our video are not Bob Rozetti, as he knows himself in the film, but lists the character of Tony Shaloub as Bob Watters and is here on Imdb. <br /> <br / I like this movie very much. Some estimates may be coarse, but many give credit for the possession of more items. Not just here, it's a big cast. Look and enjoy!
