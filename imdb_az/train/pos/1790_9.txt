I love this movie and this is a wonderful example of family risk, a romantic love story and a very sad story. Everything was just beautiful and perfect about this movie. It was a great mix of actors and actresses, and with some laughs and many crying, this film deserves a lot of prizes. With the remarkable scenario and I associate this movie with "Notebook" and "Family Stone," it was more cunning, sad, and brighter than these films. The evening tells a story of a love story between a woman falling asleep at her young age and remains with her two daughters when she is not good. The rest of the story was sitting on the edge of my seat, very strong and beautiful. You really know all the symbols and when it's over, I want to watch it again. It's really a kind of movie that's really a kind of sad and lively actor, so it's really nice to be beautiful. All speeches are stunning and the film draws attention from the very beginning and never goes. I like it and I'm glad to look it for it, it's a really amazing movie ...
