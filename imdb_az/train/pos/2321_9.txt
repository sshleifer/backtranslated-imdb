Here is my love story. And basically, for two reasons. First, youth, concentrated in many young people. People who are in their teens and who are in love for the first time, or at least they think. All of us in our lives and "The man on the moon" has given us a great impression in our memories, perhaps adding a few details and increasing the lives of any of us. The second reason is the love triangle. And I believe that like teenagers, this is most dramatic. And the story has been developed very well, believing that the characters can really fall in love, or simply something new to love, that they are extremely powerful and believe that they will believe in a tragedy or the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> The father of the man is full of great talented names. Sam Samuelson, a really versatile actor who can play in tough district attorneys as hard, yet caring and wise fathers, as in this film. There are also Tess Harper, Jason London and young, young Reese Witherspoon. When you look at a young, talented actress, you are about fourteen years old, and you think he's been on the road for about ten years, and he will win an Oscar. All members of the cast are afraid of big demonstrations and are in real contrast to real people by the great scenario. Probably all happened really. The type of movie I want to see is more frequent. Not a story of love. I would like to see movies that have done everything and do not deny or denied it in any way.
