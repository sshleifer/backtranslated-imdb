If the Ride has a rich and special thing with the devil, slower development can stand. Combined with a dark, strange theme, the mixed guerrilla warfare that has erupted in the West during the Civil War (outdated west of the 1870s) has left a strange, unassuming environment. Whatever I'm referring to is the music and lighting tendency of movies to feel the mood you are thinking of. RWTD has a relatively better soundtrack instead, and words and actions allow you to set the mood instead of manipulating the feelings of the speakers. <br /> <br /> As an enthusiast in this particular area of ​​CW history, I was impressed by the accuracy of the film. Diologically sounds over skillfully and in previous frontier wars (eg, Independence ...) than the Oregon Trail. Small events in the Jake group are similar to what happened ... Especially when the attack was at home and the shop / shop was destroyed. Battle scenes, though rare, are well-executed. <br /> <br /> This is the first CW cavalry fight to be filmed recently. <br /> <br /> The director shows the talent that everyone has in Angry Ang Lee's expectations. Example: The character of Black John is violently displayed in the murder of Lawrence during the massacre: "What is the army? Who will we fight? Who will we fight?" (Shooting, then the Confederate, going to a Permanent Trio, There is nothing to stop the massacre while the voice is running) You are not afraid! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no substantial lighting in the history of the film, which is a masterpiece of the "Glory" the main events are some of the minor problems that are not included in the events presented, but you will never see it.The bigger interest is that the only American American hero in the film is Jake and his Confederation bushwhackers. They were fighting against the Confederacy, including Lawrence before the attack on Quantrill (although they were suspicious), although this was a black rebel tyranny (African-Americans could think of it), a black film in black A single infantryman does not appear in CW's first black mode one of which was raised in Kansas (before the killing of Jim Lane and the 54th mass glory organization), and the Black Army played an important role in the battles such as Baxter Springs, KS. <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <strong> Rare and unpleasant, good, realistic activity. Good leadership. This film can not be a new Civil War block-screaming, but it's the cleanest thing anyone can do.
