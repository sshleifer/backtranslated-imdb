When I was 3 years old, I often remember to see it, but parents were accidentally released in a few seconds with a few other cartoons. Then I was 8 or 9 years old when I discovered it again and I thought it was a good movie after I realized better things. A few weeks ago (in June 2006), it was not just the same movie when it was rediscovered through several internet articles / video clips. I'm sure kids are still good, but there is, of course, a "Cult Status" written for 20-30 years. A shame that genuine production has gone through a painful process; If Fox gives enough time, today will be more popular in the public eye. Maybe Fox should make a decision if they do not make a totally different story and leave all star voices. I'm having fun here, I know. I still think the movie is a great movie, but it can be very good.
