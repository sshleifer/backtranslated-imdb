Something I can say about this movie is too long, too long! I really bought this movie just a few months ago, seeing a new version coming out. In 1978, I was glad to have 70 (even though I have never lived), especially for the music that I've loved for decades! When I watched this movie, the story was actually very good, but after about 50 minutes it was very boring and recurring. the animation did not surprise me! There was nothing I previously seen and it was very nice to see. but the movie could have been a little bit better than just the 15 and 20 minute scenes that could only have more conversations and stories. then in the last 5 or 10 minutes, the film was shot and rebuilt, but ended unexpectedly. I think it was too long. I know more than 2 hours and it's still long for a cartoon, but it looks like it's 4 hours since it's the most out of the movie! but in general, this is a good movie, and I'll look at one of the "days apart". I'll see someone new and I hope he is better!
