I liked the movie very much, but in the first place it was an interesting story, but as the story tells, the story is embedded in a long story. In this sense, the book has more than 400 pages. From 1920 to 1970, a period of time in the country of South America, it is often time-consuming. <br /> <br /> It would be better than a six-hour mini-series as it appeared as a 140-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Although treacherous, the story will not last long. confused. What is good is what is said. One blame is that Clara's non-natural powers appear consistently; or they should have come or go even more in the course of the film. There are two more mistakes (spoiler): Esteban's return to goodness is suddenly overwhelming, and although the sound of the story shows that he must continue forever, he is exposed to the curse of Ferula. <br /> <br /> Acting is good. Glenn Close, like the ferocious spinster Ferula, is superior. Jeremy Irons is a very good person, like a brutal, rich man he has prepared. The main film, Clara, is Meryl Streep, though it is better than it is in this movie. There were also very good small roles. The biggest mistake is that there is no film dialect coaches; each actor was talking differently.
