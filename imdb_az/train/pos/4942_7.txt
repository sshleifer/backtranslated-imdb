I must admit that the first half hour of this movie or actually I lost it. There were some gentle humorous humor, but it was a good sense of barebone structure and a sense of meaninglessness on the other side of the idea of ​​giving me time. Then - for no apparent reason - suddenly I understood that. There was no dark moment to carry out, and there was no dramatic scene that suddenly took hold of me. In fact, the whole movie is a very interesting thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is a "small project" (Performed by Paz Vega) - a cashier who wants more of a life, though he is acquainted with real life, he is preparing to work as a choice for a role. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega are a strange, but totally it's a "romantic, but incredible kind of chemistry," as it's on the ground, and if you feel lost in the beginning, stay tuned.
