<br /> <br /> For some time Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> Especially in a film like The Golden Child. Perhaps, Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or a movie star. But Eddie really works; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > Eddie is back in California from Nepal and all is beautiful, though he is wonderfully beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis), he says and knows that a crazy old saint male (Wong, as always perfect) <br /> It is interesting, spots are breathtaking, shocking and, of course, funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie is the only hero who knows how to read a pornographic magazine and start a movie with some rude words behind some of Ed McMahon's clever words. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
