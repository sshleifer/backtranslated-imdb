In spite of success in comedy or drama, Turkish managers are failing in fear. <br /> <br /> "Ok-D @ bbe" is a good example for Turkish horror films. <br /> <br /> But if you follow Gene, you will realize that it's a strike. The film's air is intense and dark. Also special features are colorful and inexpensive. Soundtracks are appropriate for the movie, but the script is not perfect and the theme of the movie is unusual. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film "Gen" does not make any difference with fear films, but it's not a fan of tension. In this regard, it is a success for Yesilkam and Turkey. (7/10)
