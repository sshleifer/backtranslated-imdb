My father was a guardian of this prison (now retired) in this documentary, and I grew up in prison, and maybe my ideas differ from anyone watching this movie. I'll say that film artists who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and better people. B) Enter the minds and hearts of these prisoners, and C) Take all these responsibilities responsibly. Luther Luckett Correctional Complex is responsible for its art and, more importantly, for prisoners and employees. They do not end there. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie, and I see that, taking into consideration the terms, it may take 170 hours, yes, to shoot, shoot, and download it for 93 minutes. I just saw a lot, very few. I was in prison. As I watched their hearts spill on the screen, I was in the same room as these men. I was crying on the podium in front of the men crying on the TV and telling me that it was a very deep experience. In some cases, these men committed terrible crimes, but even tried to save themselves, even if they were not returned. How do we have the courage to do so? How many people can do in such a harsh environment? It was an experience I was always grateful to react to the film, and I will never forget it. I would like to thank the men who allowed me to tell their lives and thank my dad for making them all possible, and thank Philomath Films for taking the time to fill their blood, skin, spirit and tears with this project. /> <br /> This movie will change everything you know about prison life, and the prisoners are kept there. 'Own' is not real, television is not real. Behind the bars is the word 'Shakespeare'.
