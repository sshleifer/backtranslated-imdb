<br /> <br /> An elderly man works as a guard in a mental hospital to try to get close to his friend and a friend. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, the most forgotten masterpiece of a silent era and the strangeness in the history of Japanese cinema. The disappearance of a large number of works in the 70s, was a soundtrack that perfectly matches with pictures. This could have been impaired by a doctor from the Caligary cabinet (director Kinugasa claimed he never saw the German movie). However, it surpasses it in style and in a more convincing (and cold) description of the inner mental state of prisoners in the shelter. To accomplish this, the film uses every existing movie technique: superimposed between multiple exposure and non-focus subjective, bent angle angles, fast and slow motion, expressive lighting, and so on. <br /> <br /> Filming is a multitude of films. <br /> <br /> The film opens with the installation of the windows of the hospital, wind winds and thunderstorms. Anxiety-giving weather reflects the mental state of the patients and offers one of them: a former dancer. The combination of voices in the rain, the wind, and the thunder call the dancers to serve as cunning, hypnotic dance music. In another sequence involving the same patient involved in another horrible dance, other prisoners are monitored. Dancer's exposure represents the outlook of patients and the mixed "appearance" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this beautiful movie trying to reflect patients' subconsciousness and appearance. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasus
