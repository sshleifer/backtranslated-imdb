Generally, I agree with Ebertin's review. In a sense, I do not even have to comment as a veteran movie, and I'm not a veterinarian (I'm a savior). This deficiency is that Martha does not develop badly and does not behave consistently. I guess that Stephen Metcalf is a veterinarian and has spent very little time planning on his character.
