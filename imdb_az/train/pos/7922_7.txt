In the 1950s, Full Moon High's star-prince Tony plays Adam Terry with the adventures of horrific films, the Cold War paranoia of the 50s, and the distribution of American and secondary school films during the Reagan era. He and his father, Ed McMahon, traveled to communist Romania and lost their lives on the streets overnight, and it ended by a werewolf. When he returns to stateside, he can not control his animalistic challenges, and a killing spell continues. The sad, fleeing from the city. Decades later, immortal Tony returned to the city and entered the high school again. They are still unable to handle the change, and the people of the city and their comrades realize that they are not very human. <br /> <br /> I've made it as one of the "good films" since the early 80's. But I was surprised that the film was actually funny in the legal sense. <br /> <br /> Roz Kelly as former coach, including Kenneth Mars, as Demond Wilson as a bus driver and Alan Arkin, as an oddball physician, appear sadly. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I've seen how writing and humor are similar to "Family Blood." 'Full Moon High' deals with the same thing and does not take it seriously.
