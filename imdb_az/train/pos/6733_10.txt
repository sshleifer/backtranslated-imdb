It was a spate of the latest surfing films I've been wandering around without warning in advance. This treasure this week captured the digital cable and it was a pleasant surprise! Focus applies to Greg Noll's 60's, from the existing Laird Hamilton, from the Waimea Bay to Mavericks-Jaws, who are exploring the great wave surfing. Hell, we can only watch a film about Laird Hamilton, one of the greatest athletes of this generation. There are good surf surfaces combined with past and present surfing interviews, pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious. The best way I can see this great wave story from all surfing movies I see is my favorite thing. Enjoy!
