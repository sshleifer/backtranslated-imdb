I do not agree with the previous comment on this movie. I think it's cute and fun, and as a girl she has a good message for young girls. Do not wear a cheap prostitute to be cool. <br /> <br /> I think the player was good and the story was good for the target audience. All-in-all my husband, daughter (10) and I thought it was a good movie. I, of course, recommend it This also encouraged my daughter to read the secret of the original Nancy Drew, which you are convinced of Hardy Boys love as I love them. <br /> <br /> This night was a fight to sleep because it started to read immediately. I do not think that the film's better outcome will not be of greater interest to the classic series.
