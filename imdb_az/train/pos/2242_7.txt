Part of the need for the film is a traditional love story about the area, in part, in the 1950s to ensure that the film is more productive to the public. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some bad behavior of high-level bureaucrats working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The British are doing so only with the English themselves. But then, the film loses its path to the conventional farquical plot. Terri-Tomas is always as beautiful as ever, but the great potential of the stone (Peter Sellers, et al.) largely vanishes. <br /> <br /> The release movie is not great.
