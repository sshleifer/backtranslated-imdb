I love Korean movies because they really can really keep real life (really quietly). For this reason, I have to watch Korean movies. Previously, I've seen other films from these directors. <br /> <br /> My headline summary should be from Chrstian's perspective, but I'll just start. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, Director Chang Dong Lee is a modern Protestant church (regardless of whether it is a sign) and all. I was always waiting for a Christian movie, which really depicts the dark shades of church life. Because those who want to share Christian beliefs share a common language. Many movies on religious grounds, though well-motivated, only come after a Disney movie resonance or a special school. They need to show you life. Real people are cursed, lust for true people, true people fall. Although Christians believe in the existence of those who seek salvation, we still challenge the daily horrors of this life. The character of Do-Yeon Jeon is an absolutely honest and authoritative image of a woman who finds God, but because of the painful truths of life she once lost her love for Him. He does not deny God. <br /> <br /> If he deserves the morals and madness, his character asks questions that are against each other. <br /> <br /> "If God is love, why would such horrible things happen?" This film does not answer in such a way. Although the film's last 10 minutes are open to comment, it leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of ​​a "full sun" to the full circle. I believe that this movie tried to be a religion or did not try it in any way, and it turned out to be. There is a reason why you are working harder than lie. That's true, it's honest. And that's why I'm the best Christian Christian I've ever seen.
