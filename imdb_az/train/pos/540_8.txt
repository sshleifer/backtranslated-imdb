in fact, the effect of the "video camera" is just one effect, it's a very good thing. (u Do not know a lot about a director's director) This movie is actually better than the original, watching for television is fun and there is no need to follow any rules. I think it is difficult to look at Class 1, because it kills her first daughter, her troubles. and when we set out to go with Judd Nelson, we will be with the audience. I hope one day we see the 3rd cabin from the lake, but I do not doubt it. Watching this movie, you can see how real movies are prepared, because it's a movie in the movie. Judd is one of the most terrible darkness, and he is more realistic, not just distracting people in horror.
