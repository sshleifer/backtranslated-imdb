Why is this film a crime, if all of these things are lost secretly? Conan is perhaps the only Sword and Wizard movie. These brutal violence, cool character designs and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies around. Of course, the biggest animated film directed to a larger audience I've seen. It is not like the ordinary brathetic style of Baker. It's a very unpleasant walk to Baku and, in my opinion, it's the best thing to do. I hope this film is well-known.
