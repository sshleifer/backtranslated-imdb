When I was first released in 1984, my wife and I wrote to her first VHS printer. Perhaps there is bandwidth running to watch every year. This was my first child birth year, and this wonderful miracle brings you fond memories of a Christmas Carol who has been fondled - many hours spent with this movie playing in the background. Finally, this year was broken and I ordered the DVD to take a moment to write this short reaction to this movie. The story of Charles Dickens is captured here with prominent fashion. George C. Scott is totally incredible and completely convincing, like Scrooge. Support is equally magnificent. This, in my opinion, is an impeccable production. Small details add a lot to your taste. The game "similes" is a clean item that Scrooge's nephew and his wife play with party guests. (After rebuilding my secondary school with English language students for a short time off from the classroom!) I'm honestly happy to use more of this production on CBS. first funded by IBM. (By the way, watching the old ribbon with the original IBM advertising is fun ... shows how many computers have been in 21 years!) How It Changed! Bottom Line: A Christmas Carol is a timeless story, and it's a classic period. Enjoy ... and bless God!
