The horrible, emotionless Michael Myers killed his sister in 1963 at the age of six at Halloween; On October 30, 1978, he escaped from a spiritual body and established a new terrorist organization in Haddonfield, Illinois. <br /> <br /> This is being persecuted by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how bad a young explosive is. <br /> <br /> This is a bang and helped to inspire many slasher pictures that really build a superb atmosphere and cooler. Most of these subsequent films were subtle compared to their wings; subtle and scary. Even after recurring thoughts, he keeps track of me. How many movies can you really keep in fear when you see them before? <br /> <br /> According to some reports, in most cases, James Lut Curtis, in his debut, debuted at Halloween, and several subsequent slasher pictures Then the fairy tale hero became a queen and he was a valuable sacrifice for rooting. Writer / director John Carpenter knows what he's doing in this movie, uses the shadows and darkness exceptionally; Tell us how the most part of the movie was built after the evening. With this picture, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created seven sequels, many imitators and a franchise that "re-imagined" in the near future. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is my favorite of all time at the Loomis (Pleasence), which describes Michael Myers's Sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertoire player in one of Carpenter's previous works) John Carpenter movie. <br /> <br /> This is not entirely inadequate - after all, there are holes in the script, but in general it has a strong impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
