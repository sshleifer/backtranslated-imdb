I liked this beautiful movie. Farrah Fawcett was very nice and played with the heart. After being attacked by a stranger, she plays a woman who has been extreme measures to protect herself and her spouse. After being denied by the police, he understands that he is himself. <br /> <br /> Then one day at home only the stranger went into the house and attacked again. <br /> Do not hesitate to call the cops or take them out, spray it in front of her eyes and throw her into a fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think it's dry. It's very easy for criminals. The time has come for more severe penalties.
