The fans of the 'Capital City' rejoice! This first season of this series can now be accessed from the Network DVD and have recently taken my copy! However, while each member of the team plays an important role in a particular center or peripheral line, the 'CAPITAL CITY' ensemble is a very important 'maverick' trading ground, giving us different moments both in the first and second seasons. The cultural mix of General Trader Wendy Foley (Joanna Phillips-Lane), with a variety of personality traits, interests and personalities, with a sterile theme of financial trading for a large number of people, with funny performances of shooting being busy. In fact, this seemingly dynamic young group of employees differs from Shane Longman's extreme and old leadership, as represented by Lee Wold (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I doubt that such an unconventional way of working with Wendy's team is that Peter Longman, a young pro-poor "free spirit," has taken over thirty percent of his company from his father and a modern way of becoming more and more fashionable business. To a certain extent, Wendy (I believe) instantly supervised by Leonard Ansen (John Bowe), but the love for Wendy often sees the "middle ground" occupation. The main interest in the series is that I always believe that Douglas Hodge's Declan and freely self-confident blonde hair traders, Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell), have always been romantically attracted by these two colleagues. and hopefully the second season of thirteen years will not be too far away!
