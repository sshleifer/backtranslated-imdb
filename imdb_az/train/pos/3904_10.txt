In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I've ever seen. After looking at Don Kill, I became an admirer of Eddie, but I think it's the best thing to do. I would say that if you get the chance to go to the chance to live. Attention! <br /> <br /> After a few occasions repeatedly, jokes start out often. But I have to say that I've seen this show a few times, but I remember all the memory of the word (yes I understand it sadly) but every joke is still laughing. <br /> <br /> Kill's clothing will never be old. I'm watching and watching when I need a good laugh.
