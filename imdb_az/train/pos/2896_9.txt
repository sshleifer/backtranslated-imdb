People criticize Disney's animation features of the 1950s as very bright, and are very popular in landscapes. This is just a criticism. But the whole story can not be, because the two most striking "Alice in Wonderland" and "Peter Pan" are the weakest. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Cinderella" is set up in a world where dirt is the best of dirt. <br /> <br /> Well, it looks good. Backgrounds are subtle and sophisticated; The colors are very clean without brightness. The animation changes a bit. I swear that some people are rotoscopic, but then rotoscopic people (including Cinderella itself) are not full bloody characters in the script, as this approach works pretty well. Animals that make the film really. I think the studio never used animals too much. Mice, for example, are the living things that make us think of them; but they are more colorless Cinderella representatives and allies. Cat, Lucifer, Wicked Stepmother is a type of witch that is familiar to the witch. (The cats are brilliantly designed and animated - Ward Kimball, a controller animator, one of the best cats of all time, and she has modeled her cats.) This approach allows animals. Do not steal the show from the main story. <br /> <br /> Their actions are of great interest only in the light of the main story. <br /> <br /> Most supporters are King and Big Duke of prominent people. The king is a recording character - he wants his grandchildren and no other wishes - but the note is drawn in a pleasant way. Grand Duke is a decent character worthy of being raised from his area as Cinderella did. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is a return to Disney's features after an eight-year break, and neither with a movie nor with its next glimpse at its early age. In addition, he chose "Cinderella" for himself. He is a passive heroine, and there is not much that everyone can do about it. (Maybe I made a mistake - I did not see the last "Ever After.") However, Disney points out how successful this unexpected story is in life without breaking the spirit of ghosts.
