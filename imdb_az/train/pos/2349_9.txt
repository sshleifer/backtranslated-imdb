It's a pleasure to see such creativity on television. This show is poetic, artistic and good fun. The heroes are in good contact and the writing is not bad (so they will get better as they get their legs). <br /> <br /> Girls are stealing this show so far. Chuck is very happy with Zeytun. The two points are a delight. <br /> <br /> Because they're magic, they're writing a bigger piece. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all about the anchor. Put yourself a popcorn bowl and enjoy something that is fun in an old way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
