This is surprisingly superior to the average slasher, in a pleasant and good way, sometimes with decent disaster. All characters are worthy and the story is quite entertaining, and Molly Ringwald has played a very boring plant. I bought it at a 1-dollar infantry shop, and it was a staggering thing, and the impact on the budget was pretty cursory, and I liked the mask as the killer was really creepy. The prize was really pleasant because they loved being defeated and the end of the predictable game was great, plus all the characters, except for Ringwald, were surprisingly enjoyable! Significantly written and written, I was pretty creative and original, and some of the death scenes were very impressive. It did not get around the killer and I liked it and Slasher fans (like me) really should love this movie as well as the opening of the movie was really bad !. It's a surprisingly average slasher that's nice and good, with a little decent, and I'm telling you that watch is well worth it! Direction is good. Kimble Rendall is good! Working with a short camera job, using a creepy setting, keeps good angles and speeds up the movie at a fast pace. Acting is tough! Molly Ringwald was fasting very well and there were problems that he apologized for because he should have been a hero, he was better off to the end, but I decided to shoot so much, but he did a great job! Frank Roberts was fantastic as a killer, he was a scary, creepy, and a mask of a hell and he did not mess around this guy, he was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays very well with her small role. Jessica Napier is as charming as her other hero. The rest of the cast is good. Overall good watch! 5 out of 5
