The third and final film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It's a simple fun, not a political movie. Jason Bourne finally knows who he is and will discover and remember the torture he has offered to kill his old personality: he really killed someone who was converted to his corpse. But the film finally shows that all these were organized and planned by the CIA as part of the Blackfriars program, which is clearly seen in the film to eradicate all American citizens trying to prevent the public in the film. a limited group of people. Until 1980, he served as an important officer in the CIA. This goes along with the Internet. Then the truth comes through Jason Bourne himself, but the only person who can convey this truth to the public and can decide on the CIA is a woman, and that woman participates in the general senate. investigation. A woman and the Senate; Read my lip. In the United States, politics are struggling in the press and both media are important for both presidential campaigns: music and movies. He is currently using Hollywood and intellectuals as well as academia and intellectuals to focus on the film and, in particular, the film, a woman and the Senate, to think about the future. So watch and watch the movie. It was pretty entertaining and a sweet smell of the end of a period and some great changes, waiting for others, but could not argue that nobody would come in. Knowing exactly how it was. it will be deep and serious. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques Coulardeau, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
