Since the universe Saga was a mafia performance package, this series was a mafia complex for the employee. If you've never watched this show, you're in for a long time. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but nothing happens at all, and Toni Soprano will never leave the gangster of the thinking person contrary to the reality of his birth and will never leave him knowingly or even how. Many employees have come to an end. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then knocking down a man with a fever in a fried bowl and breaking his body with his nephew and breaking a stall while sitting and peanut butter, and watching NFL football the only advice they had given to their marriage was the day after the afternoon. Even when Carmella gives her husband a chance to go on a journey, she sees her life with Tony and her way of looking at her in a different way against her life. If you do everything you know, how it ends. If you do not, do not trust me, I have not seen such a television show in such a way.
