I did not want to watch this show. But I'm glad. Critics can not just get it! It's currently the most funniest and fun thing to do at T.V! Although interviews were generally made with people, it seemed futile; but put them in the mouths of animals and insects, and it was a laughing holiday. I laughed so much, I had tears in my eyes. Babies are breastfeeding their mother and pigs. Her husband and his wife talked about the health problems of birds and said that the birds were drowned after their spouse and broke me! Creature Comforts, the most creative show I've ever seen! Hopefully, this will be the next summer when it's over.
