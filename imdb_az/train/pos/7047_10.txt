we need to see this movie. The most accurate view of events in the world I've seen since Darwin's Nightmare. Go, look! and if you are lucky to open your city, be sure to see the DVD on the big screen. The writing is sharp, and ideas are sufficient, although it is almost perfect. Joan Cusack is incredible, the rest is very good. John Cusack inspires this movie, and I believe he should use his money to do it. This is a wild, absurd ride, which has been developed without the obvious resources, but still a success. John Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, and even Bill Maher did not show courage by saying what this movie was.
