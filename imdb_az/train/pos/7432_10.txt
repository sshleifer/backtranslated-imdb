A blockbuster during the original release (the second highest grossing film in 1976), the third version of A STAR IS BORN has always shared the critics and fans. The film earned more than $ 150 million in the form of a $ 5.6 million budget box office and was awarded the Oscars and won the Five Gold Globe. Stri≈üendin's most successful commercial film is not a mockery of its most controversial film. For every ten fans reporting that STAR is the best film in Striphen, there are more than ten that claim to be the weakest film in his filmography. While both sides have some advantages to supporting their claims, still it should be noted that seventeen people are taking STAR IS BORN and remains one of Hollywood's most impressive and entertaining show-business dramas. <br /> <br /> For my money, this is the best version of the often-read tale. <br /> <br /> The film was a happy and easy win. From the old Hollywood studio system to the music industry's transition to a competitive world, it was a great idea, and scenarios create real contrast between the characters' romance and their career. A STAR IS BORN's 1976 version is truly the mainstay of the classic predecessors. Let's note that the film reflects personal and professional difficulties, especially during the recording sessions and during any phone calls calling Christofferson's song attempt. This version of the story is more convincing in the description of the characters of others. For instance, women in the previous two versions were as morally and indulgent as the saints did. On the other hand, in this version, Esther, the female leader, is not just a strong and passionate, but flawed and contradictory. <br /> <br /> This is more realistic than the characters Janet Gaynor or Judy Garland felt in previous films and makes the story more effective. <br /> <br /> Spectators did not rush enough to support the characters. If you are looking for an actress / singer who can walk a beautiful line between himself and his weakness, Streizand is one of the few girls who know that dialogue can look fresh and natural, and, as usual, is able to create a strong emotional connection with the audience. Just his Esther is a three-dimensional man, fully described. Chris Kristofferson does not have much respect for the filmmaking features, but he is always interested in it, and rarely shows the magnetic character he is exhibiting in his career. Kristofferson has indeed taken a rave review of NEWSWEEK, TIME, and even NEW YORKER's usually worse than Pauline Kael. Gary Busey and Paul Mazursky also give incredible speeches, but both have spent less time. <br /> <br /> Film noise recording Four million copies in the United States alone that sells and sells number one at Billboard Hot 200. The Strike "Evergreen" (in the words of Paul Williams) is one of the most sophisticated songs in the modern pop, and can be further enhanced by Styesend's unique vocal performance. Most of the original genre songs (mostly made by Williams and Rupert Holmes), and Streisand sounds fantastic - when the rest of the movie is left, live solo numbers remain. Streisand's live shows, "Women of the Month" and "See More Than One," bring a thrilling life and even works better for the sillier numbers like Queen Bee. <br /> <br /> Christopher's solo numbers sounded silent, but he could have been deliberate when playing a falling singer. <br /> <br /> Although in some cases it is written in a natural way (definitely reflects the decade he has made) STAR IS BORN, who is seven years old, is still very good. The film is well-built and slickly produced; the potential for chemistry is very strong and always original, and Streisand has two emotional scenarios close to the final, giving both impressive results. As a result A STAR BORN is not only entertaining and moving, but also overcomes all the criticisms.
