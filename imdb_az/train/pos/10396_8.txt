This was usually the recommendation of producer Alexander Kordan in many places; <br /> <br /> For her book, Top 100 Movies in 1987, John Cobal saw 81 critics of his research, the thief of Baghdad, the 55th. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> The Second World War has changed around England and America, eventually ending in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars. Like Citizen Kane, in some cases it is a movie that you can admire, not love. <br /> <br /> Special effects that are far superior to time are still unreasonable and are actually bent. However, their inventiveness is not as effective as their inventiveness. There is an entertaining horse built out of a kit model, which starts to fly when a button is entered from the back. Six armed Goddess Kali also has a killer toy (likely a woman with two women sitting behind her) and a ghostly spider-looking spider. It's also a sumptuous flying carpet. But the most memorable Rex English must be seen as a gin (gin), about a thousand feet long, at the moment of kinematic elegance! The Englishman describes the sex as a very dangerous creature and adds the element of danger to the process. <br /> <br /> John Jastin works well, for some strange reasons, like an English vector and high lip King of Arabia. Sabi, an astonishing 15-year-old muscle, was a strange thief who was close to Abu. After passing roads with the evil Caffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin blinds himself and Abu becomes a dog. As you can see, the rest of the film will be described in the flashback with the perspective of blind Ahmed (Justin), and we see half of the film we have captured and adventure continues. Indeed, the second half is a better place with more natural phenomena, filled with phenomena and science fiction. <br /> <br /> The film is about three minutes long, with three small pieces of pepper. not a real ingredient, but fragrant; I do not classify it as music. All great fun; Justin and June Duprez are love interests for waxes and fathers, Veidt, boo-feel betrayal, and Abu, a young, irrepressible robber. It can take a while, but may take some time to get into the short film of the English cinema in the 1940s, but when you sit in the first half hour or you really enjoy it.
