I have seen some parts of Aardman's work from this show in England. It was always fun and always funny. None of the temptations were missing in translation - people are as fresh as interviewed - some are written or not, as it is known, near the point. Always fun. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations has a great idea of ​​the characters used for every sound, most of my show and its concept (porcupines, porcupines, puzzles, needles, painting liquid). Regulars are really developing as both the Maryland and the father of the teens and donkeys, most up to each married couple (hats, insects and cats for a few names) and the child-playing character, and I really dig the conquest! Monday is finally a day to move forward.
