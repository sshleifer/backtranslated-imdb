For the first time, I saw this movie as a young boy and recently sold it to a DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart is a hard-working and special Chip Sticker, a FBI agent. The life of the Bureau extends entirely with family life, which is not all flower. His wife (perfectly described by Vera Miles) is afraid of the dangerous nature of his work and even spends some time; Chip's best friend and assistant, Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton), was killed in an armed attack; The son of the chip, Mike, sat in the seas during World War II. Thanks to all this, the family has the courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action segments are very interesting and the semi-documentary style of the film is effective. And Max Steiner's music tells them all; loyalty, courage and honesty. <br /> <br /> This country owes a large debt to the men and women of the FBI and, of course, J. Edgar Hoovera. When Mr. Hoover's sensitivity is observed, we can get rid of 9/11 and have many politicians who are forced to stop the crimes against children and stop us from the day it passed.
