I was thirteen years old when I went on television. It is now more than a majority of films. Martin Sheen is excellent and Nick Nolte has a small part, but it is very well supported. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Great. <br /> <br /> I voted for the vote. <br /> <br /> I think most of the ladies in these days are more interested in younger generations. <br /> <br /> Good dad burns masses!
