I saw this movie when I was 7 years old - 33 years ago - we never forgot this movie! The courageous little boy and the beautiful eagle touched me deeply. <br /> <br /> He met me in a movie with me, and I asked him recently. He remembered the movie we saw with a boy and an eagle, and he remembered it as we saw it yesterday. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong>
