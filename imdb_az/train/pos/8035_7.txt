Sunday would not be a market without a motion picture, and when I wanted a tough fight, I applied to Tom Berenger (Plato). <br /> <br /> Here he plays a gunner in the jungle after rebels and drug lords. Life is a bitch, so it's a green office type (Billy Zane) to help the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who connects Anaconda. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Strong movement when time is right.
