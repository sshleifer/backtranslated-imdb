According to John Ford's lyrical poem, the fraudulent biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life can be an obtuseness with his wife and "the worst way to dance". Ford's camera just praised his ideas for the emergence of Mr. Lincol's early life. The characteristic complexity of the film is not why beauty and vision depth. The beautifully unprecedented works of the previous film could have been a few spectacular frames, and Ford has a unique look to tell a story. The film reads a life of a hopeful young man. <br /> <br /> In the film, two young men, brothers, play a role of Henry Fonda, a striking and spontaneous intelligent Lincoln, about a murder which claims to have committed a crime. In the style of classic angry attack, the city decides to take its own justice, and dignity Abe will honestly make their couples loose until they step in. By saying that he did not rob his first big job, he was attractive with humor and as good as a lawyer. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> The movie plays as a John Ford movie: a spoon of America, a medium predictability, a definition, or not sure if Ford does not do it himself, is a hint of sarcasm. The film has been created in a totally pleasant and pleasant way if you can get the feeling of the Hollywood movie and probably the patriotic festivity of Lincol's future presidency.
