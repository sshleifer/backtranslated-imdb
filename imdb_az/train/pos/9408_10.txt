It's often labeled as a comedy, a man called The White Suit is here and there to throw more than a cartilage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who does not have the chance to develop inventions, because no one in the world is paying it, he is the sole businessman. After bringing one to the knitting factory, she uses her lab to create a piece that never never run out of need and does not need to be cleaned. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> First, a genius has been declared and those who did not see it first, suddenly want a big piece, but then the signs of the resurrection of a sector going on a bust bear the head, and the acclaim becomes more intimidating. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very funny, in fact, some scenes are sad, but it's the satirical basis of the film that has been raised above the usual film. Controversy over the development of technology is a very important issue here: do we not want inventions that rescue us when we close the industry? You know what happened to the coal industry in England. It's an important point to note that the film's ten-year history is not only easy to listen to, but also to science-frightening new proportions. Watch this movie and watch the protagonist Stanley with the heroic enemies and the events that are the worst victims of human trafficking! It's so dark that "The Man In The" <br /> <br /> I will not find anything wrong with this movie, Roger MacDougall, John Dighton, and director Alex Mackendrick's script could be drawn today, and this is the sharpness and thought of the mind Adroitly captured by Mackendrick with a tonal shift, sound and reception are not terrific, direct, some scenes are just beautiful, one of the nodes in the heartbeats, and 29 years after David Lynch's Elephant Man brings a certain scene into consideration and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness is a film of the past, the theme and the one that follows the story of Stanley's future. As part of the art, 10/10.
