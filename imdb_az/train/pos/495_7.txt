<br /> <br /> STAR TREK canon - most. We know the history of canoes. Technology, events, places, first contacts with new creatures, names, dates and so on. They are progressing. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE ignores most of the ST canyons. A failure for a long time serious advocates. First, I assumed that producers would review and remove some episodes from TOS at least, but not. <br /> <br /> Phase pistols are much more modern in TOS than most technology. An old style Starfleet laser weapon, a slow golden purple carrier effect - is what I'm looking for. Also, I did not expect TNG to hear sound effects based on a similar sound signal, but far from the TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the earliest appearance of TOS (the first pilot: THE CAGE) we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect. With ENTERPRISE, we look forward to a shock. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < STRONG BLAZER <), but everyone within the ENTERPRISE appears equally. <br /> <br /> It is much more than just any ST-series, more formal military service, insecure, far-reaching - says a lot! <br /> <br /> The theme of the opening of casual country music is the adventures of an important big warship that reflects the journey of a family's song. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE shows us a very entertaining, fuzzy study of human relations rather than taking us to a historical, brave, angry, high-rick quest. <br /> <br /> I would have chosen Adrian Paul Captain and an old man to become a doctor. Perhaps the actors felt very much. Linda Park, a dancer in Boston's College Ballroom, is convinced of a wonderful development. Creating a crew looks like a thoughtful creation. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE is starting to work stronger than the last 3 STAR TREK series. Hope for a good future!
