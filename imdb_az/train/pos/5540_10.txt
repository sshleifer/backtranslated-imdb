Firstly, this movie looks bad that once I saw the transrance once for the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream.A space bore. But I gave it a second chance, then another and another, etc. Finally, the actor / singer / songwriter made up of more than 70 progressive rock and absolutely delicate folk songs, Derek Lamb (Troubadour), when you were reading the song about the hazelnut wood, the silver trout, and the lady ... in the middle of the film and you heard it in the middle of the film. In the beginning there are some moral scenes. Elizabeth allows you to evaluate Suzuki's natural attraction. Although the film was designed by repertoire directors such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers, or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics were conscious of this movie as a space master. I personally think that this film is a million times superior to Fellini's kinematic sh @ Â¤ @ t! Surely not for ambitious.
