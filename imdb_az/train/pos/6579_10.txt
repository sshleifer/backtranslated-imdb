Quo Vadis's best screen version of Methinks? Never done. Yes, the story, as in the book, is very strong and unclear in some of the artistic works as it moves away from the aesthetic inclinations. But the film is really beautiful and has a "weird", a math and style, and other options - with R. Taylor and Poland's new - absolute lack. The atmosphere of the Roman decadence, the paganism of paganism and the beauty of baby Christianity. At least I believe). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov have done a great job of reflecting their characters. Forrest's Petronius appears to be the most successful (one of the greatest players, Brandauer) of the greatest success, and collects the essence of this death world (IMHO). This is so. So this is the kids ...))) IMHO
