These kinds of documentary documents are often considered very often. This film will get all the ideas and decide what to do with the information provided to the viewer. This film is doing a great job to show off the ugly side of the sweatshop because of the conditions that poor people should work on. Mardi Gras: A small feast for a holiday in China was a good way to show the world how it could affect the lives of so many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I've had to watch it. It's an English class movie that tells us about Tarsi shops and how to tackle some people and help them roll the story. It was a great, very informative film and I would recommend it to everybody, and open your eyes a little.
