Nina Foch, this entertaining little Gothic nail head, presents a strikingly striking performance. He accepts a position as a secretary for the London society dowager (imperiously played by Dame May Witty) and his creepy son (effete and worried Ford George Macready). He knows he can find himself in the barn on a seaside, which he had never seen before. Witty and Macready call her Marian and tries to convince her servants and surrounding people that she is Macki's naked companion. Of course, this couple only plans their loyalty, and although we know that Julia could eventually escape from the trap, director Joseph Lewis actually stops to answer the question of how to handle it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My name is Julia Ross, There are only a few minutes you can just sit outside, and I really rooted to Julia as I took the scheme involved and began to annul her. In any Gothic tension, the hero waiting for her hero to come and save her, screamed, shouted and dithered. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you how fresh he is in this film to understand how he uses his soul and how he has saved himself. <br /> <br /> I'm happy with B +
