The film tells the story of a beautiful princess, but after ordering a magician to go to a masked city after a magic magician, the magician then locked the princess and soon became the ruler of Baghdad's shadow. Prisoner Prince Abe faces a boy who escaped from prisons and headed to a town called Basra, where he meets a princess who is in love with her lover, but the evil sorcerer Jaffa, whom she does not know, tries to convince her to marry the prince and father. Jaffa soon learns that the queen's daughter is trying to earn her heart, so she blinds her and turns her into a dog. This is a journey to the adventure with the prince and Abu Jaffa to find a way to defeat peace in Baghdad and marry the princess. The flight from the clouds during the trip, Abu is a giant spider that really is a hungry and is likely to welcome everything from the Sarcastic Genies, the flying horse, which causes one of the most beautiful images of my old eyes. <br /> <br /> From the start, there is a pure fantasy film, horses, genes, flying carpets, and magicians who can actually make wizards, and strike people with their squad. There is no nonsense moments and love story is not a waste of time. Production designs are just stunning in this movie. From the palaces to the various dangerous traps that the heroes face. Although this film is older than 40, the design of the production is much better than the shitters that are made in today's movies. Music and songs are also good. Everyone who sees this is undoubtedly one of the great musical moments in the films I Want to Be Sailor in the Sea. I'm not a big fan of movies, usually because I'm happy to fulfill my taxes, but I am happy to exclude this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Before today's modern fantasy movie, the road came along with the real CGI to capture our minds, and there was a movie that burned your mind without leaving the green screen on the ground. One of my favorite shots in "Two Towers" is one of those we've seen on the Black Diamonds, and the main purpose of this shooting for me was to see these great fantasies that see what real work is and I love it in the movie Cin and other creatures. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to watch this movie and pay attention to where it is. <br /> <br /> It's just fantasy creatures that Aladdin's producers have inspired. The characters in this movie are quite similar in the film, from speaking Cenie to the flying carpet. It's not a bad thing in my eyes, because I am alone in a planet with a deep passionate love for this beautiful movie, so it's nice to know. I first saw her as a child in her homeland and considered the world to be the greatest thing and when I watched her again last week, I still believe. This is a true testament to a great movie that can continue the time test. Of course, the impact of a whip seems somewhat outdated and disliked, but in the 40s, return it a break. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Aladdin's live version, then you have to pick yourself up. I wish that, but the angry murder team is probably better than avoiding it, because it will not be their cup of tea.
