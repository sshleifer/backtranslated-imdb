An unconventional historical drama, with some amazing battle scenes. Tobey Maguire delivers a perfect performance and gets a pretty good back-up. The script writer is incredibly original and is protected from movie heroes mercilessly. That is, it's a little drifting and the last one is like a mini-series television. Still, Frederick Elmes's camera is something of a dull bit of interest (and now you see a hit that reminds you of working for David Lynch). It's worth seeing.
