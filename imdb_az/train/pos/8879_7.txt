*** APPEALS *** <br /> <br /> This movie has always been so exaggerated that my college campus turned out to be a former student - who was a Nazi-racist-killer <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson , Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
