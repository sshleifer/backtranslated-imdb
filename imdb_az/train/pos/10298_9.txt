I'm glad to see Jim Carrey in a movie that has no purpose. His character resembles us all. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great God. <br /> <br /> I thought Jennifer Aniston was a little sensitive and understood Carry's support, but we're ready to make a little sense of humor and real love for each of us. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> /> <br /> I've read some reviews and some people are looking for a bit deeper. <br /> <br /> This is a funny article and is not intended to solve all the problems of the world. <br /> <br /> A funny movie.
