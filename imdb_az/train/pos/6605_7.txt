2054. Paris is a Escher official who exhibits people and vehicles at many levels with a similar respect to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Paris is both ultramodern and recession. Among the sweeping sweepers, a tiny medical researcher is abducted immediately after leaving his sister at nightclub. It is a harsh police captain. Compared to Sin City, black is black in color compared to brown corridors, shaded alleys and most fused characteristic films. But the story is relatively indebted to Frank Miller for Masamune Shirow and William Gibson because high-tech controls, invisible hidden suits and ruthless super-corporations are part of the landscape such as weapons and cars. The film does not come from Gibson's cybercrime, because technology marginalized heroes face industrial types of corporations, all of which have their own Ministry of Emergency, but the viewer is definitely less than any utopia and future science in Paris. As soon as the police procedure line is opened, we enter the dark windows of personal passion under the bright ring of the cultivated PR of Avalon Corporation. The motion capture process used here provides an image between B & W comic books and a new generation of rotoscoping, and makes it attractive or interactive to your taste. Nevertheless, here is a great visual sense here, and in the future, Paris is full of small details, spartan and baroque, giving a brilliant detail. It's worth the look.
