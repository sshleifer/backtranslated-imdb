This debut by the cunning director Hideo Nakata really liked it. If you have seen the ring in advance, you will get acquainted with the styling and the idea of ​​this flick. It works even better than the stable (and predictable) stinger that can survive the mainstream of most genres, which has a subtle spookiness. If you like the movies you like, perhaps you'll be like that. A good, creepy debut by Hideo Nakata. 8/10
