<br /> <br /> A smart script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and intelligent performances by two men - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or any other way around it) causes an entertaining and entertaining tension. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> </ strong> <br / <br /> This is also a treacherous and deceitful person in the world, possibly returning from Algeria. Like other colonial powers of this time (like the WW II in the 1960s), France fought to protect its appearance. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (original title) fights for the movement of our two (anti) heroes, after discharge. <br /> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </> It's enough to say that these two men are fighting physically and psychologically for a long weekend. Their motivation is quite different, their purpose is different - their survival is completely interconnected. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Alain Delon and Charleston BRONSON are very different - old, probably a very nice guy and the last one is an ugly thief, chemistry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I should not forget that women in this movie are women and, <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, FRIEND is published in the UK; ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 Growth; ONLY in English (subtitles for hearing impairment are not); 110-minute period; MONO SOUNDTRACK but DE ROUBAIX music has plenty of punches! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
