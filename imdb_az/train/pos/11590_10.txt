Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting movies. Thereafter, the film was more than that. Now I'm going to go to the theater rather than to rent a movie theater and relax in my house. I also saw a short film called "The boy and the legend of an eagle." I'm looking for this movie for many years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I was able to collect more information from my site. Thank you ........ I was surprised to find out that this short film was opening for Disney's picture. And I did not remember the Disney movie. I did not remember having Disney's opening movie. I really do show it on television for some time. Can Disey justify this movie? DVD available? This is for all generations!
