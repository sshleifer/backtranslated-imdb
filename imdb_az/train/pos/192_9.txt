Before seeing the show, the silent comedy impression actually slapped and was just the slapstick. It was unable to imagine how the screen comedy could be based on some words or multiple pratfalls. But this masterpiece made me wrong. Davies, in my opinion, was the biggest comedic actress to come to Lucille Ball first. I first told Lucy that Davies' behavior and facial expressions reminded me of the fact that Davies was not one of the main effects of Ball. Before the 21-year-old had never seen a comedy, and I must say that despite the fact that I actually refer to what period (I did not, of course), you will not be so bored. More laughs than many talkie comedies. It's not just my favorite silent comedy, it's always easily between the ten favorite comedies of all time.
