Well "The Wayne World" has been a long time ago and since then it has been difficult for snl off-shoot films. Many, like the movie "Pat" in the last 80-minute "Night at Roxbury", surely do not believe that the other snit skit will make a successful transition to any silver screen. I'm scared because Tim Meadows comes through skiing. well-written space keeps the audience interested until the end, and lends itself to the character of Leon Felp, which is presented on the five-minute skateboard. humor (mostly sexual jokes) is fresh and interesting, and made me laugh more than any other movie in my last memory. If you do not feel yourself too serious, just a great time. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen "Saved by Bell" fame, gives a look in the film and looks incredible. Finally, Billy Dee Williams, 45 day Colt relive, gives a touch of the movie class. and for the filmmakers like me, this movie can be considered very transparent, "ooh, this is a lady!"
