Before I see this documentary, I have to say that the events of 9/11 have not hit me. Well, it took me a year. If there were no talk about towers, I was the only person who changed the station on the radio and on the channel. I have not heard about it. One year later, when I went out on the TV and closed my eyes one day later. It was the first time I was crying after the attack. I highly appreciate this documentary. Now, five years later, I watch TV and still cry because of the tragedy. It is likely that one of the first airplanes will be shot by hitting this tower. Get an accident and see where you are. These two brothers want to be there to help me.
