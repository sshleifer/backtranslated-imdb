I do not watch soaps. My grandmother is still looking at one hour glass. <br /> <br /> But this film is parody and grows in a new way. I found the story pretty funny laughable. 80's shoulder pads, sequins and polyester fashion - just go up. <br /> <br /> And all the actors just go to the city, chew parts and pour them into a great good scripted pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - beautiful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey, when he has so much potential, revives him to see him before the jail. And Garry: Why do we have to wait long to see him in the movie? Leesa Gibbons - did not miss her, but it was nice to note her as a real-life correspondent (and where do you apply for that job?). <br /> Of course, Sally goes to the drainage track. How many times did Lucy Ricardo do this, as with every comedian from Carol Burnett, and now I do not know who and what she's talking about, she would pour me a peanut. As you can see, when you're funny in a high building in New York, you do this. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: The second look was a decent dress, a great cast and my personal memories for me What do you really need more?
