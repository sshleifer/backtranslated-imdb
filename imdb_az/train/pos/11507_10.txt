I remember the original series in a lively way, based on the unique blend of wonder and fun that enjoyed itself. Kolchak was a well-known sneaker at the Ben Hecht School of the Big City Reports, and his strange, resolute and wise flaws could be watched even the most prominent episodes. My personal story was "The Spanish Moss Murders." Poor, worried Cajun, who is from the Louisiana bayou country, participates in sleep research for sleep analysis purposes. Something is obviously wrong, and he really experiences a swamp of vitality in the dark folk stories of youth. This traitor seeks all the people who appear in a conscious situation to the apparent imaginative and kills them cruelly. Kolchak investigates this terrible truth and finds out that the chief dream researcher, co-star Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (written by the astonishing Keenan Wynn) and the second urban developer Severn Darden. The outrageous, funny, dignified finale takes place in the Chicago sewage system and is a series of celebrations. Kolchak never recovered. Timeless.
