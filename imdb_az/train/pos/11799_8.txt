A good summary of a real event! Yes, in fact I was not there, but it could look like this. In my opinion, there are two typical American positions in the film parallel to "communism" and Adolf Hitler. They should be clear to the most independent observers. In any case, Boothe is a great performance player and there are many well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are unbearable - I want to say! Everyone who sleeps well after them is abnormal. (That's why it was very scary - all this happened, and probably it resembled it). But in fact, was this final scene really at the air station?
