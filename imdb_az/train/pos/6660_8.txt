"Gandhi is a husband and father?" has always been discussed by people in India. Only "Gandhi ... my daddy" would get acquainted with such details. Gandhi's personal life came as an idea. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film liked the story and cinematography. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shephali Shah have all done well. The most scenes of the movie will be beautiful desktop wallpapers ... a modest job. <br /> <br /> Traditional Indian folk music, which is featured as a backdrop in some parts of the film, gives a good sense of the incidents. <br /> <br /> But things that I did not like most were stories. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor Productions is a good job. I recommend this as "you should watch once." 8/10
