I just saw the Hot Million on the TCM and I completely forgot the boat. Ustinov creates a clever and slanderous ground that cleverly drives him out of the two wounded men ... Well you see. Maggie Smith is ideal as a bumbling secretary / neighbor who has a hard time working, but has a hot and vibrant personality crushed inside this picture. <br /> <br /> Senior executives like Molde and Newhart have a problem of making things that can be the chief roles. and let them make them a comic life. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are very glad to see you, and I know Ustinov's hand in Romero's case. <br /> <br /> This film is intended for retirement in a growing computer era and there are problems with a middle-class man or person, but in fact they are attracted to the characters and are very eager to see that the computer sub-area , missing ... almost say. <br /> <br /> Release your usual expectations for contemporary comedy and search for great pictures and friendships, forgiving them and bring them to this picture.
