This is a complex document showing many things about early gay life. To put it to view, Gay was the word used for homosexual revolution and was just described as Gay. Or is it used today? <br /> <br /> Most of the film comes from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so there were those around. <br /> <br /> 20-year-old documentary films that hold me in love with a man. Love that expresses only love. With scenes of joy and pleasure, there are many empathy and painful scenes. Life scenes are homosexual and have a gay like life. The film itself was a love affair and I believe it's not a diamond. <br /> At least this film will understand the devastating effects of AIDS. When I write this, I think how long it was before the movie was predefined. The achievements in medical, political and social sciences and culture that have taken place after this movie (15 years ago) have been unbelievable. However, it has not been made clear, in the case of AIDS. Story I did not do anything on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a very nice document. I would encourage anyone who can not understand gay life, gay problems, or AIDS wretched to watch this movie.
