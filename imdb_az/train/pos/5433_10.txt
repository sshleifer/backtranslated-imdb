This movie is one of my all time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what a cast. We will not celebrate Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure, and comedy resemble each other. The final battle scene is still so upset to me, and the end is always tearing me. If you have not seen this, I would definitely recommend it.
