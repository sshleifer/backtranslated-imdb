When I see this movie a few years ago on TV and remember not paying full attention, maybe I missed the first half, so I decided that it was weak and highly appreciated. Last night I decided to try again, so for the first time I missed something. I, of course, did. This is one of the most disturbing and beautiful films of all time, and it is likely that films will be very impressive today and will be eternal. I do not believe I'm missing this movie! <br /> <br /> A young John Voight and Burt Reynolds demonstrate their careers and are backed by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story follows you hatefully and you are afraid to watch it, it's really terrible. Oh, and I mentioned that the song song was great too? <br /> <br /> This movie will be filmed everywhere by movie lovers. <br /> <br /> Everyone should take this film for practice. I just do not expect a picnic.
