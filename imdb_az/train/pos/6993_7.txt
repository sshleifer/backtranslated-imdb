This is not the best film of Bela Lagos but there is a good old style approach for about 40 horrible entertainment. <br /> <br /> The souls died as a fly in the altar. I think I'll postpone the devil after being captured, but this is a scary movie, so people do not see the danger for a reason. In any case, Lagosi is a mad doctor who needs a young woman's blood to keep her aging, patient wife healthy and happy. <br /> <br /> Such a film will not be filmed: <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> should be complete without a Lois Lane female reporter who wants to commit a crime. Suicidal is good in solving, bad for badly fasting in the wrong time, like the one that Lagos has chosen for the next victim. Loos Lane I love the "haunted house" bit with a storm as a guest in the worst dwellings of Lagos. Secret passages, a vampire-like spouse, a bad knight Igor assistant, and so on. Good things. <br /> <br /> The good pacing is moving the movie and the story itself is typical but gladly solved. If you love old horror movies, this is the value of an hour.
