It was a very good film, and it was completely unfair to judge without considering the time it was released. There are films that are not old, but it's clear from that date. But when I was a kid, I saw this movie for more than 20 years, and the story was as memorable as for pictures, but for me and for many of my friends. In fact, this film is one of the few conversations and the theme of the meeting that our old guys talk about common ideas. So when we finally got a DVD, there was some frustration and even sadness. First, there was a theory of our generation naïve. Secondly, I think there is something more. There is something that should be of interest to all modern filmmakers of this film, especially those who care for the rotten horror genre. This is a jerk, an idea that fits the movie; The truth of a person's tragedy is a deeper fear than death and torture. When the worm crushed his arm, I remember how sick the feeling was. And in the end; The creature touches the doctor's neck to take part of the arteries. Another remarkable thing is that despite the fact that the movement is in a secret laboratory, it is the atmosphere of an illness that has been dominated by intensities in all areas, a man in a car looking for a female body, a single dressing room, and so on. The reasons for being a good film are just technical stuff. For example, a person who saves his head at the crash site and fiancée may be a more precise job for another and a modern second manager. The same thing as all the action scenes, including Kurtin's arm. In addition, something can be done with the makeup of a monster. Some rewards are good; I think that would be a worthwhile attempt. Nevertheless, black and white tones should be protected.
