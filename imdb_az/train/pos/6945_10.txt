My favorite movie genre is western, the only American genre is genre. Despite Sergio Leone, no one sees them as many Americans. <br /> <br /> The top of my eighty-west black list is Winchester 73. It is the first pairing and only black-and-white film director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was a film that Stewart Universal had selected part of the interest instead of a flat salary. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann has made B pictures of this kind up to this point and has done some kind of things that do not have real budget. Winchester 73 Mann, Robert Taylor, made a beautiful sunset with the Devil's Gate. But I'm convinced that James Stewart should see it and decide to partner with Mann. <br /> <br /> In this film, Mann has developed a mini-stock company, John Ford's legendary. <br /> <br /> It will appear in future Mann films such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson as Stewart. <br /> <br /> This is a simple structure, James Stewart finds and kills a Dutchman Henry Brown. I will not say why, but to this point we have never seen such a cold anger from James Stewart on the screen. Anthony Mann reached the soul of Jimmy Stewart and drifted with some of the devils we were afraid of. <br /> <br /> Hate is shown to the start of the film at a great moment. Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are then disarmed by Wyatt Earp by Will Geer, because guns are not taken in Earp Dodge City. Dodge City has a shooting competition for the Winchester rifle and the bet is threatened by Dutch Henri Braundur, Stephen McNally. While Stewart, Mitchell, and Geer walked in the hall, Stewart and McNally spotted each other at the same time and reached out to shoot weapons that were not there. See Stewart and McNally's friends, who said more than 10 pages of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character in the film is Stewart's Waco Johnny Dean. It could have been the best moment on Durye's screen. He is a deadly psychopathic assassination of a left-handed shooting despite sporting six weapons. <br /> <br /> Another person talks to Stewart, his fiancee is Shelley Winters, who was killed and killed by Duryea. His best scenes together with Duryea took a fancy. It takes time to safely pull away from it. <br /> <br /> In some small roles there are some good speeches, there is a scissors in the grave. John McIntire, as a Hindu trader, received his first real news as Jay C. Flippen, a grizzled army sergeant and a young Indian leader like Rock Hudson. John Alexander, well-known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in "Arsenic" and "Old Lace," is a short but impressive one, both McNally and the owner of a trade post that stands in different times. has a role. Mann and Stewart pulled eight films together, five of whom were in the West and Mann was ready for the sixth west of the night pass when they left the debate. The end of a beautiful partnership that produces quality movies.
