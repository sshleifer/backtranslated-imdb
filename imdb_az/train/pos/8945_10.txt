this is an honest attempt to make a nonsense sweet love story. Inspired by the success of a successful television series "Bewitched", this beautiful sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. comparisons are open. Jimmy Stewart plays unhappy, but it's "flat". who plays a delightful blonde witch who holds him by using a love magic of novac. but when this magic breaks out with a stronger witch, he is full of the task of managing his shop and relaxes because his beloved lover (who is familiar to his butterfly) cares for his beloved aunt. Get to know the people from the "Death to Murder". this movie is entertaining and effective sweet, with some awesome minds and a beautiful witchcraft. it is worth a visit.
