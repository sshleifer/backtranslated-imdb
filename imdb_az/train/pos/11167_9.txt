My favorite movie, this movie tells two bloody New York characters, Steve Brodie (Raft) and Chuck Connors (Beery), who want to be the "Home Guy" in Bowery last nineteenth century. Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, though this is a heavy account of their antics (based on the play) .Brodi 's legend (still in 1886 Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge), as shown at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). here is beautifully restored and covers the wild horrible ragtime number by the singer Trixie Odbray (young Pert Kelton) .Raft is slickest, like Brodie, and Beery again shows what is a smart actor <br /> <br /> Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is a very tough, heartwarming, and sometimes touching person, because of life and energy. , "The Bowery" moves at a fast pace (unlike very early "conversations"). This is not an easy movie, you need to look at it.
