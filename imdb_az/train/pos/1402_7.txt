Spoiler <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is probably the weakest film by Paul Verhoeven, the director of major films such as Total Recall, Starship Troopers, and Robocop. <br /> <br /> Probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhevan was stuck in a completely mediocre post and made the best of it. <br /> <br /> The first part of this film is sounded with very good kinematic jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie. Unfortunately, the film falls flat in the second part, turned into a standard slasher movie or very bad "Alien" clone. The latter are especially ridiculous, because Kevin Bacon returns to life after a series of incidents he has killed in his logical sense. </ SPOILER>. <br /> <br /> However, Verhoeven is able to stay on the middle level with this movie. <br /> <br /> ***** ***** From 1/2
