"It's a long journey" is a well-prepared movie, a good shot and a showcase for some good performances. However, this story is made up of the hangman and the character that is transforming into one of the spheres and no master. At the same time, Western listeners are likely to find esoteric culture of Parsee a little more to get their weapons in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those interested in India.
