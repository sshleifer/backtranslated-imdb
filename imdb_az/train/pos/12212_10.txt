What is taboo about love? <br /> <br /> The name of this movie did not stop me. About a 4-minute gravity film stopped the channel surfing. I could not believe how strange this movie was. Unless somehow brings me together, it touches on many levels of human emotions. One of the best independent films I've ever seen. I did not see these characters as sexes, just human. I would recommend everyone who likes the movie. Especially independent films. Praise the fearless filmmakers!
