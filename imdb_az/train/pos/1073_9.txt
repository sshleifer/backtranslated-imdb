After transition from Sopranos to a very different mentality framework, we took a few episodes to incorporate a story and a series of "Dark Angel". However, once we entered the array, we enjoyed it very fast. Dark Angelwas has a shame that has ended when you start a good past in just a good category: much more than your mid-range series. The action begins to move to the donkey and rocks, but the interaction between symbols and public reactions "mutants" reminds us of the constant prejudices we encounter (and do) every day. The story is created in the future that keeps the mood and prevents discrimination on our faces (so it is not "fun" for those who do not want to be taught during fun), but every event has a relationship of human and society. We all judge, we meet our prejudices, but in the end you have questions about who you are lying: you sit and shut your mind, or do you get up and do something about it? Those who do not have the option to live or to fight for justice provide them with this series. For those who have never answered the question, this series "hides" this message under the name of "pure action action". It is much better prepared and well written than most television series; It really ended up in a high gear.
