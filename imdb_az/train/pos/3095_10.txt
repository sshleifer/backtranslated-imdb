So, what is the reason? Is there a vendetta for this AWESOME show or someone who is there? Why will the best show I see in the year be canceled? I'm hungry. I saw this show accidentally in the last fall and immediately liked it and looked every week. Then he went and I tried Tivo, but it did not. For a while, I've forgotten an episode on ABC's site. Now I want more. Today, I agree with the rest of the television, but at the same time it seeks to see a whole thing and develops so much. I'm watching my eccentric-comedy correction in Boston and my intellectual-mysterious jackass correction home. My husband loves Gray's Anatomy for "realism" and I love / hate the show but could not be real to me. Very dramatic way. Everything is wrong. But once, there is really a real drama. Real people, real problems. Of course, it's a good thing like an old gangster, a girl who escaped from a gang and so on. There are many threats, but these people (especially NYC) really are there and I belong to each one. I can not seem enough. I hope that ABC will pull heads off the line and will continue on this show. Respect to earn a QUALITY drama. This can be one of the best demonstrations of all time. Nobody will leave it.
