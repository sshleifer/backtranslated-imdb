How can anyone like this movie? I think it's a funny laugh of all old gangster cinema; If you have not seen them, look instead. Michael Keaton goes on to do something in this role. A man speaks English every time he speaks and Griffin Dunn plays classic D.A, but my favorite role was to be Joe Piscopo. There are all good lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston, in this starry movie, the lamp is very strange because the Mafia did for the underground submarine.
