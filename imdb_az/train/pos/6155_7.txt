"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure movie, despite some of the best Disney works. <br /> <br /> It also comes with good live action and animation. The animation itself is, of course, very good. The animation tells about the 1973 film "Robin Hood" and about animated characters: "There are many wild animals like the moon, the elephant, the hippo, the lion, the crocodile, and many others." <br /> < This film is often compared to "Mary Poppins", "King" (a lion), "Prince John" and "King Richard" for a reason, combining both a lively imagination and an animation-like artwork, There are similar features in London, both magic and magical women, Carrie, Charlie, and a cute little Paul Banks are a bit like children, both were directed by Robert Stevenson and both raised David Tomlinson. Instead of a very serious person like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man - Professor Emelius Browne This movie, along with the magical movie, is slightly light on the stories of Harry Potter həmiyyətli have similarities. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs are good. "unbeliever Ages" and "beautiful briny sea," are the best. The Portobello Road is beautiful. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is once more in this movie. Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price, and all 3 children's actors are very good: Cindy O'Callaghan, Carrie, Ian Weighill, Charlie (a "non-believing boy") and Roy Snart's youngest brother, Paul. br> <br /> I love black cats. Very cool. It looks like a black cat from the TV series, Saberina, Young Witch, like Salem. Whenever one of the characters in the movie turns into a white rabbit, I'm pretty. Rabbits are really cute, hairy and cute animals. I love them! Professor Emelius Braun is even funnier when turned into a white bird, because when he turns into a man again, his nose shakes like a bird. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's a good movie, but it's pretty bad. The first moments of the film are not something special, but then they are getting better. But the end is weak. This is a great criticism for me, on the contrary, the animated knights are too small for me because of a sense of war.
