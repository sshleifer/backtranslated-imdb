This is a fine example of film nirus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, she does a pretty good job, Interestingly, he was not just an anti-hero, but on the contrary, he was an anti-hero. This is not very normal. Jean Peters gave a performance as a brothel with a golden heart. <br /> <br /> The great actress Thelma Ritter shines like a luxurious pigeon. <br /> <br /> There was a fair share, miracle, and harsh conversation between the folds and rotations of the arsenal. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie (at the subway station) there is a rather strange and exciting battlefield. <br /> <br /> I think no one will love this movie. For Noir viewers, it's a little dated and all the Commie thing can seem a bit overdone.
