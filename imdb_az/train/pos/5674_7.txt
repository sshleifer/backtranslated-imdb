This time around, Blackadder is no longer king (or particularly close to something like that) ... Instead, Hugh Laurie (who replaced Tim McInnerny, was abducted violently and he is not full of holes ... his character is an innocent attraction ... he it was a bumbling and full moron, we could not help, but his replacement was not true, for the care of daft (he did seem to have Trivia's page), he did not say loud and absolutely unsafe words. Edmund can do whatever he wants and does it. Why is he so angry and angry (honest, sometimes suffering)? Yes, the master is a belt, they are always. He does not have money and is in no danger. In the second series, the Queen was hated and childish and cut off or got married - a sadness. There is simply nothing that is exciting and exciting for any of the conflicts. There are still comments and even a small satir. Very often, history itself seems to be quite funny, so they repeat the truth, but in reality they do not have to turn the truth into jokes or embarrassments. And if I have not seen a few of them, I can not say more than a minute. This is not very positive when you know it before delivering Punchline. Baldrick does not change since last season ... He is very sad and stupid, which leads to "terrible" humor. Certainly, the amount goes through the roof. Do not start to earn me total. Sarcastic, oral wisdom may still be great, though it is so small. I would say half of the episodes were fun and obviously funny, and the other three really did not bring me anything. I was disappointed about how some areas and developments would be predicted ... I could see many people fleeing from such a mile. Some of the materials are trying to be funny and winds like incredible compulsion. These plans of II continue with the tradition, which sometimes works. The subject of the group's worst, credit sequence is least creative. All this is the fourth one I love at least. I recommend the franchise fans and the English comedy in general. 7/10
