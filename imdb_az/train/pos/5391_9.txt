Life begins and ends - Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em), and Vivienne Osborne await a birth of a typical 1930 birthday, Dorothy tree and Gloria Shea, 48 hours in the lives of several high-risk pregnant women . The film, although grandmothers are older than their grandmothers and adults, in a typical city hospital in 1932, although the appearance of the apparently structured devices, when they were more controlled and limited by birthgowns. I found the film interesting and pretty moving. <br /> <br /> Probably, this film features outstanding performance, an early player, Eric Linden, Jed Sutton, Grace (Loretta Young). What the actor! Like the father for the first time, Jed is worried and concerned with the hospital staff who seem to be overcoming his worries about his wife to scratch crumbs from a cafeteria table. I felt all the worries. I would like to see more of this actor's work. There was a very emotional sound that had an unforgettable experience with Wind Gone. In that movie, Eric was surprised by the young man who had amputated his anesthesia without being "cut off, do not cut!" Scarlett fled the hospital in fear. Onion! Another great performance, Miss Bowers, from Aline MacMahon, a nurse playing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color Loretta Young did another superb job here, as Grace felt very original and deep. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ Strong> </ span> <br /> <strong> Glenda Farrell <br /> <br /> My tastes (in 1932, anyone who has proven brandy from a hot water bottle knew , can it endanger the health of unborn babies?), but its character will end. Unforgettable Gilbert Roland, a gloomy Italian woman, was a quiet movie star. <br /> <br /> The beginning of life is a must for the forefront at the forefront of the TCM, but it leads to a few hankins. 10 to 9 o'clock.
