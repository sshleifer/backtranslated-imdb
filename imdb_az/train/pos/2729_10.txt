I voted for how good the game is, not for content. After reading the book, I am still upset when watching the movie. Two old rides aim to rob the family of a family protected from the dangers of being learned in prison. Tension during the trip begins to assemble as the film's overall excitement increases. After the murderers worked on the farm, the next morning, the family found the daughter's daughter in church. The hero cried with a shouting, cordon on the phone, when he sank into the phone, he really took my blood and gave me a shake. The killers are a little comfort for their convicted family, who have been victimized by their fair victories. Robert Blake was perfect in Perry Smith's description. The book is also perfectly written by Truman Capote.
