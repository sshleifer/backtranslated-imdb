<br /> <br /> There are spoilers for those who do not know the true story of this movie. <br /> <br /> A civil society that is "innocent from sin to sin"; According to a convincing story of Fred Schepisi's guerrilla, but a spectacular Australian murder trial, Lindy Chamberlain was charged with killing his baby. The story of his innocence was challenging (a dingo was alleged to have taken him), but there was no evidence of his guilt and no evidence against him. But the Australian public was dismissed by guilt and when deeply religious Chamberlain appeared in the press, it seemed creepy (and the media itself was, of course, innocent in this process). Although he was cleansed by the first investigation, he was persecuted and convicted. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, notwithstanding the fact that the circle is finally released, it should not produce any suspicion after finding new evidence that only proves its innocence. <br /> <br /> It was still a national hatred by Meryl Streep, who set out a persuasive Australian emphasis on the "darkness in the darkness" (at least in this Pomo's ears) and who continued Lindy's sympathy. In fact, the imprisoned scenes are simple, but heartbreaking, because we really believe in the characters. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the accuracy of the story's story I will not be able to say anything, but the broader issue of this film will be addressed with respect to everyone in the past with the knowledge of the British press. a sad habit for the reader to apply directly to the least charitable instincts. No legal system will be perfect; current crying against asylum seekers in modern English tabloids comes from exactly the same bad pit as sounds far from Lindy Chamberlain. I'm not religious, but the Bible is still in some killer lines. "Do not judge, do not judge" is one of them.
