The best thing about this movie is fun. This innocent Pecker (played in an attractive way by Edward Furlong) is full of symbols and exciting situations that love to photograph everything you see in everyday life. Pecker's friend Matt ("he is a thief, but a really good man"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (sugar addiction) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother found Mary's sculpture statue in her room. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on how many people make a living every day, and it does not bring much weight to it. There is always a danger when giving messages about the value and dignity of "the common people", but on the contrary, if you shift from one type to the more proud, "Pecker" prevents these traps and allows you to get points when allowing viewers. <br /> <br /> There are enough breathing rooms for viewers to compare this topic with their own ideas. <br /> <br /> I come to the movie very much because it's fun.
