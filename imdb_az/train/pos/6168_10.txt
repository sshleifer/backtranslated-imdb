Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, plays a secretary in the main character bank of this movie. There is a lovely scene with a restaurant in Roshan Seth. There is more information on his website> By expressing my personal interest in the film, I think it's a good movie - I have to say that it was moving, funny and beautifully drawn.
