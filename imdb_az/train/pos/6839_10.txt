What should be one of the most freeze-dropping films, a transvestite man is killed in New York City, and people who do everything can not be suspicious. You can see Brian DePalma's Hitchcock's camera launch and its effects on the product. Michael Caine plays the most thoughtful character while Angie Dickinson is a wealthy richer than largely ill-haired. Keith Gordon (later played in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the film. But you really did not understand this movie without seeing it. After seeing, you will never know whom you can trust. He also plays the lead role of Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
