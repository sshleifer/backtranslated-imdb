I have been able to watch this movie as a whole and have been deeply moved by it. I'm not sure if it's really a comedy or a drama - both of them have elements. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both looked beautiful, and the image of our 60-year-old women has changed since the point! They are alive, beautiful, sexy! The only disadvantage in this film is that there are no other symbols in the 'MTM' or 'Rhoda' show in the 1970s. I thought that at least in New York City (where Rhoda was located) would do whatever she could with her sister Brendan or Julie Cawner. Great on Apple. <br /> <br /> I hope ABC will make this a series and will bring back all the performances of these shows to the guests. By the way, what does this combination with CBS, or a subsequent erroneous error? Does the MTM and Rhoda network show?
