It's not the best Bigfoot, but it's the coolest thing that's going on in the Sci-Fi channel, the movies that hit the movies. There are some moves, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but I also use some practical F / X. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is an admirer of B-horror / science-fan and should be corrected. <br /> <br /> <strong> Better than Sasquatch and is not a continuation, so do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than you think in a movie and leadership is more than adequate. Wait a little bit like symbols "developed", but you know that you will receive everything. If you are watching a DVD, you can skip one chapter or two.
