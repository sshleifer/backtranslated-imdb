Generally, I love light and entertainment, so this movie should not appeal to me. But he grabbed me. The story about family choices and challenges is clear, but repeats these questions: "What was my family, the choice?" I cried and laugh because people really felt. It was hard to watch, but it was harder to turn. The story is right and life is sometimes difficult to watch! The film shows how filmmakers can do without sex, violence and special effects: a good story is a good story. These are all the best and most unexpected stories. As with real life, you will really know what happens next, or what people do.
