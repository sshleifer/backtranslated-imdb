Keeping Grace is never strange, but it gives me some good laughs and I love her very much. Brenda Blethyn is a good actress and she does a good job of describing the widow Grace, who has been growing up to pay for her massive debts. Support for the party is also a wonderful thing. French actor Tchecky Karya played a very small role. Just prior to applying. The development of an over-the-counter woman and the idea of ​​a cigarette pot are quite funny. And the movie now and then play around with a thorough premise. Of course, as the two-year-old woman approaches Grace for the marijuana tea leaf and has started to pull the childhood antics in the shop she works, there are straightforward moments. It was a pretty stubborn stupid drowned. The sound of the movie was lost and sometimes disappointed, but I'm laughing enough to give this advice an English import. <br /> <br /> My Account: 7 (from 10)
