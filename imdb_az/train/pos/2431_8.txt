The celebrities were "famous" in the style of tension and animated film-style, where the semi-major character was in danger of being rescued by the hero in the last second. I remember these special Casper deaths really one side. <br /> <br /> In the animated films of popular studios, "virtue is always victorious". Popeye always falls into spain, Baby Huey is always fox foxes, Little Audery always "learns the lesson". <br /> <br /> Some FS cartoons are really dark and troublesome. <br /> <br /> We need to give them credit. As I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry," I do not think anyone would like to put a cartoon product better than Paramount. Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharples), editing, sounds. They were consistent and the best example of the form of art.
