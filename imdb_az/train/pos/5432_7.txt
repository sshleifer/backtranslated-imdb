On the contrary, good deeds have been done - in fact, it works for me to attack the evil opponents in their pockets, stop a small Big Horn style and save lives through the collapse of the water. <br /> <br /> So, how is it played on the DVD after 66 years? Like me, the West, angered Apache or Sioux, for Thugs, and the imperial US Army Cavalry as the British Army. This perspective is very colonial, you know? The white man's burden, and all this? Kipling would certainly be confirmed. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen are doing this as widely as possible, so they put a friendly friendly rifle between good shooting and dragons. (Joan Fontaine, I did not think of a token army spouse - did they leave some decoration rooms?) Very short - nobody was targeting Oscar here - in fact, Grant was the best on a few scenes - but sad, still working. And would somewhere Ben Casey wind like a bugler? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. If you want adventure and pseudo-Western style antics, check it out. <br /> <br /> <strong>
