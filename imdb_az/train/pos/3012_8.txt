I have never seen one of these films - so again you can see it for the "first time". The books of Van Dini are still enjoying - but are blooming by many. This film is the best film adaptation of his works. William Powell William Powell - now I say. Land is complicated. The story is moving very fast because you want to keep it. Enjoy.
