When I was on CBS, I saw this sad movie, which was living on 10/11 in 1979. I did not know there was no theater. To evaluate a child, I would give her 5 children 4 because she was a little "gorgeous" because she was a young kid at that time. <br /> <br /> It's a bit of a trouble when the newspapers walk through the light of day, but you get something like that. <br /> <br /> When I re-discover Blockbuster Video in 1995, I have to look back again! Although I still looked a bit old, I liked it. <br/> <br /> <br /> So far, you can even have a DVD, at least I hope that. One day I want to share with my children! 10 stars here is still a great baby movie. (end) <br /> <br /> Lastly, a VHS copy was found! Woo-hoo!
