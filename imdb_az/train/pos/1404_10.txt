HOLLOW MAN is one of the best films of the past decade. The subdomain is original and the main area is better. Special effects are brilliant and maybe the best I've ever seen in a movie movie. <br /> <br /> In 1933, Kevin Backon was suspecting the world. Kevin Bacon shocked us with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror films. The action is tight and the shakes are correct. If you're watching a stormy night in the dark, you can actually jump yourself. Includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. All this is exceptional. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team found the secret to invisible. After animal tests, they go to the human test. But someone should be subject to it. Volenteering, Caine turned into invisible. But if he can not bring his band back to visibility, Caine is fragile by looking for revenge ... * latest spoiler * <br /> A memorable shock sequence has been created in the film and becoming a classic helmet in the next century. You are the foundation for a strange joke on POLICY FILM 2, this movie takes you through the throat and you will never go. The first 45 minutes or slower, develops characters and shows how their experiences show. The second half is an exciting and most appealing action and horror fan. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks to an insane invisible person. And then change the water to fire and explosions. Rehashing a killer shark movie. It's interesting ... HOLLOW MAN takes 5/5.
