Actor Paxton killed the director with a horrible, dark, and mature creature, a living merchant (Paxton himself). He created two children to participate in lifeless bullets, chosen by God to destroy their victims, not the devil, and these "demons." <br /> <br /> Therefore, she has been raised by skeptic FBI agent (Powers Boothe) in one of the children (Matthew McConaughey) since today. <br /> <br /> It's hard to forget this movie automatically; It's better than the most sophisticated killer features, it's a curly and annoying tale, explaining at a minimum the level of obviously fashionable movie gimmicks. Paxton, in a humble way, completely shows his blood to the end. Well, she acted especially by the actor of two children (the last "Peter Pan" Jeremy Sumpter and "Spy Kids 2" and "Inner Discomfort" Matt O'Leary). The only reason I have removed from any point of view is that some of them will find the trouble in the stomach. In any case, this is a atypical tension with a good script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
