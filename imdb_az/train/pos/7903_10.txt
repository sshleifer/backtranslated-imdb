This movie was shot in the first seconds by T.R. I saw the sound. I walked on the road - I did not feel the big fingertips on the head, but it was an absurd humor and a striking appearance of both actors - who did not know who the young man was - but he was great! <br /> <br /> The two men who came out in the movie about half an hour later met my friend and was always a test to watch a good movie with one of my friends. And both of us were laughing very laughing - sad about "real police-normos". both of us are admirers of the T.Robbins books ... I found it a good idea - I thought Robbins would agree, though I like the movie or I have no idea ... <br /> <br /> a good yet still feature film that would like to cut the products I heard heard for the first time that the audience (or the manufacturers) of the sand had heard lots of scenes. very short ... though it is one of my favorites all the time, and I know that most people will not look like this kind of movie and people who love these films think what they think ... .... no regrets. I hope there will be a DVD full of materials that will come the next day - hoping to wait for more crispian, keanu - hope, think twice and use it if you choose to watch ... m
