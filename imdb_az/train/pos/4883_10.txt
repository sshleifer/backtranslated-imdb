<br /> <br /> We, like a family, were delighted with the "Blonde Bombshells Son", so we got a copy for our home video library. <br /> <br /> The player A1 and the gallery are many favorite actors and performers. The topic is unusual and the script is well written. Music / songs are endless, and when we play songs on our sounds, we take our youngest days back. <br /> <br /> This is a complete record of the most enjoyable and uplifting production, and we strongly recommend it: Everyone looking for a stomach laugh and many music.
