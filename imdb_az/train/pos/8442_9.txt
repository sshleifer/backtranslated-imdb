The film was perfect, except for scenes with Esposito. I downloaded a series of detectives in the series, and downloaded a series of traps that were not resolved during the series (thanks to NBC). Pembleton and Baylissi were very pleasant to see most people and most important people together. Braugher and Secor did a great job but will be ignored as usual. The fact that this crime is the end of the world is damaging. Memories, bands and rehearsals at CourtTV are not the same every Friday. But the film did its job and, after retirement from Al, presented a great illustration of life and family relationships between the unit. I really liked it.
