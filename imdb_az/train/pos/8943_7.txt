The 1960 television series Bewitched gained an idea of ​​this movie. Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak is Alfred Hitchcock's right-wing film in Vertigo. <br /> <br /> This was Jack Lemmons's 10th movie, and he was also a good supporter of Ernie Kovacs. There are many good things about this in the film. Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie, where he is as good as the Music Man. <br /> <br /> This film is felt in New York City in the late 1950s, and there is a cat that heals in any movie like any cat. <br /> <br /> This is not Vertigo, but I think that after watching this film, the audience did not. is as good as worthy - the happiness seen by William Asher since the 1960 series was created. Glad to see what Ferrell will do on the big screen, this is better than this movie.
