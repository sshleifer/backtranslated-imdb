I think it's one of the best in the Blackadder Third series. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the episodes are funny, but I love the episode with the 'French invasion', but the moody actors <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> MAKBETH is really funny, with Rowan's (English) is the highest level of humor that he can play. Actresses: play; Blackadder: Oh, So I'm saying Scottish Play to me? <br /> <br /> I'm a great admirer of Rowan and I own most of his work, but I think he's doing the Blackadder series very well. / <br /> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue the style, but I think it's already a Bean 2 movie, this year, and I will not wait. <br /> <br /> Give this 3rd Blackadder 9 out of 10 ratings.
