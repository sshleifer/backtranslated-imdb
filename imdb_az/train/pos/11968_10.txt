Full House is a great show. I'm still growing up today. At age 8, I started watching him, and now I am 12 years old and I am still watching. Especially Stephanie, I fell in love with all the characters. he is my favorite. he experienced such a sense of humor. It's hard to watch the show, because there are people in this respect, because you get it hooked. After seeing the first episode of the 2002 episode, we looked at it as it was. This is a really good show. I really think this show should come down to many generations of families. and it's great to have a fit for every age. and teaches all parents how to start their lives. There is nothing like violence or blasphemy. this is really a great sit-com. I'll give 5 out of 5 children. What do you think? OH or the best time to watch when you are sick of a school or even an old office. This will make you feel better. Trust me, I'm ill at home, but I know it will feel better. and everyone who thinks that the show is foolish is too bad for you, because you will not be able to survive even if you are happy in your life. you really should watch it and you will sit there. I said to everyone who started watching this awesome show. I need to go for a good lunch. Remember, look at the house and wait for it soon!
