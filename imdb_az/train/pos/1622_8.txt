I've seen this cartoon for the first time and know the cartoon of the famous black artists ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (Josephin Baker or White was Sophie Tucker), Thomas Fats Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit ) Louis Armstrong and the choir girls are out of the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... there are stereotypes, but that's it ... and these cartoons were meant to be entertaining in the local cinema before the main features. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising was more "cutesy" and more luxurious compared to the standard animation performed on animated films, Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox (later ... we talk about MGM), RKO or Lower Colombia. <br /> <br /> Disney's very early Mickey Mouse had many barnyard humor. Uncle Walt cleans it before leaving Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Disney also had some animated films with a black cartoon ... for example, in 1937, the Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But these are part of a certain amount of time and space. After 50 years ... Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park clips will also be investigated, analyzed ... and will be scared by future audiences.
