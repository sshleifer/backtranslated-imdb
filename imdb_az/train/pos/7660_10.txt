This film is a dark, strange masterpiece. Apartheid is an area I feel for me, so I can be approached. But I would like to say that it is flattened by cry Crying and Freedom of Crying Country. Unfortunately, I have never heard of this movie a few days ago. Inside, it's one of the most erased films of all time, probably a small movie company, I've never heard before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is convincing and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays well in his skillful role. Do not look for humor in this movie, there is nothing. Until the end I will bring true, wild and flawless, sensitive tissue seeds. But such big films are surprising, why not the biggest movies are often heard?
