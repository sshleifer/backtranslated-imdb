It's just the most astonishing movie you've ever seen. I was just thinking of a documentary, but it's really something else. <br /> <br /> Does not try to teach anything in the conversation, shows how life in nature works. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to talk about the quality of the pictures because it's not clear from other comments. <br /> <br /> It's funny, tense and sad on the earth. It can laugh, it can cry. Sometimes at the same time. This is not the first time you are upset for the animals, but the first film that makes the planet cry, and you understand why we are good, but we value it a bit. /> <br /> This movie should be compulsory in schools. This is the best movie you will ever see, so go and see. Who knows, maybe our planet can be seen in such a way ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I can easily appreciate it.
