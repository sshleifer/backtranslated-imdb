This is one of the best films. This is a realistic illustration of the life of agriculture, which is a major part of American history. Setting In 1906, Wyoming is a place where life has not changed much since the last century. The movie keeps interest without adding Hollywood myths. The whole family may be interested in seeing this movie and seeing how life is when it is a peasant nation living in America. With this film, you will save and witness everyday life 100 years ago. In a beautiful, scenic environment, you will see the heavy physical work required to survive, as well as the constant pressure and anxiety of the elements and the market pressure that will make a difference between success and failure. Watch this movie and follow the experience of our lives as it is for most of our nation. This movie is worth your time to see. My only question is why are there so many movies?
