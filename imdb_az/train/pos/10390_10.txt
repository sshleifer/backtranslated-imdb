It is one of the biggest fantasy films beside Star Wars and the Oz Wizard. This is a real shame, which is not known as old movies (perhaps it is like a story based on legends based on legends or a story based on fantastic settings and is a smaller market for movies) <br /> <br /> Like all major family movies, There may be some kids, adults and even young people to use the movie (I'm 18 now), first of all, classic films. I absolutely love this movie. Miklos Rozza's (perhaps a favorite classic movie account), John Williams's fast, but sensitive tempo, beautiful sets, dialogue and color usage (both sets and cinematography), by Star Wars, won Oscars and featured the latest Oscar-winning special effects (for the time and some are still confused). Of course, June Duprez's chair appears to be the opponents of Princess Catherine Zeta-Jones (which also looks like Jones!). <br /> <br /> As a result, this is a favorite movie (next to Robin Hood's adventures) and is really worth the attention. <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <
