Mario is invited to a cake for the Princess Peach Castle. When Mario goes, Bowser sees him kidnapping! Mario must rescue his day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can look at everything he wants. She just walks around, climbing on trees to seek 1-Ups, secrets on levels, and more. You can spend four hours on one level. There is never. There are 16 universes with a number of stages and star gates that need a certain number of stars. After entering the gates of the stars, you have to go through a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the scene. You need some stars to reach some worlds. You'll take a picture of the world. There are so many things to do and there are many hours of gameplay, so I do not see everyone will love this game. This is beautiful. This starting title is a game that provides players with a good life of the N64. Every 3D Platt form we know is a common thing with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are commonly used examples. Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3D games. From 10 to 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find out, because nobody sells this baby for $ 5. Perfect 10.
