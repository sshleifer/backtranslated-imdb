I'm a Jehovah's Witness, and I'm working in an emergency room. People have taken part in numerous conferences on bleeding-born pathogens due to haemolytic reactions, and I have seen that several patients are seriously ill with transfusion-borne pathogens. When I refused to accept a few Witnesses of Jehovah, and 26 years later, I did not see that I never saw that they would not die and asked, "Is refusing to accept blood relatives is really groundless, or is society really beneficial in this regard?" Jehovah's Witnesses issue is moral . "Beware of Blood" is not a statement. Thank you for this movie and allow comments on it.
