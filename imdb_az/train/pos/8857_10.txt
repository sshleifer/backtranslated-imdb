The director created some masterpieces such as Sydney Lumet Network, Dog Day Afternoon, or Serpico. But his recent work did not give him much chance. Gloria (1999) was strange, and the film "Find Me" was an interesting, but unsuccessful trial. Now, Lumet has brought the best film and the true masterpiece for decades to come: Satan knows you are dead. I think this movie is like a revival for Lumet. This film has a deep story, the end of the movie is perfect. The performance is brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman brings a great performance and is surely one of the best players in our days. Etan Hawke is also an excellent actor, but in my view it deserves it. The performance here is great. The remainder of the mill (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors are simply the Frustrated Oscars. Part of the film has a good level of intensity. With its glorious fan, he sees demonstrations and parts. Satan is a real masterpiece that perfectly fits in the direction of the Dead You Know, a great scenario and excellent performances. We need more movies.
