<br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie and I have to agree that there are some strange moves as well. <br /> <br /> She is an illusionist who follows the adventures of a young man she wants to be in the popular Las Vegas and partly part of the dream about the dreams of others and all the dubious travails is about. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ Br> </ br> <br /> If you like movies about the trip, not for everyone, you look like this.
