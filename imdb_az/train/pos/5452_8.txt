Stunning a pre-code playing a speakeasy slut, lying in the road with Stanwyck. These pre-code flicks allow you to really have nothing left to imagine. Stanwyck seems to be the daughter of a speakeasy owner / father who is more sold into his bosses like Lilly (johns) .Barb for the better things for a big city After Barb is dying (well!) go upstairs John Wayne is a poor "community" and proves that the actors are aging and the player is improving with a coach. Among the actors I liked cheerful and strong lines. I want this movie to be a must for all films and watch Stanwyck, beautiful and beautiful, like Lilly.
