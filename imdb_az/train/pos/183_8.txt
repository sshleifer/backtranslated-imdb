Marvelous comedy played by Marian Daviesin (gentleman William Haines). Young Peggy comes in search of a stardom in Hollywood. Cameo's performances featured details on many vintage film details for the "MGM's stars in paradise" on the famous commissioner scene. Pik da Davies holds for the best stars of the day (its Swanson's beauty!) For the famous, bad, sarcastic bouquets. <br /> <br /> Peggy takes on himself when faced with popular celebrity star Marian Davies turns tennis, nose and descriptions, "Ohh, I do not like it!" <br /> <br /> My print was perfect. Story, direction, must be an original attraction and all silent afficinados.
