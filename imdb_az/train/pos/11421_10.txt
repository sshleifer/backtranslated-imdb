I did not know what was watching the previous review, but despite this, the analysis has its own taste. The film has drifted deep into the film, a deep film, and many senses. True love, guilt, hatred, frustration, public control, time and classes, and lack of racial communication, revealing the love you have freed yourself in the flow of the film, the emotions themselves show, the defects of the characters, the bad pearls, to demonstrate that it is cruel, is not as slow as it was shown before, to stream it to a movie!
