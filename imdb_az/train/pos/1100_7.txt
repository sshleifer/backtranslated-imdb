- Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in his country for his wife and children - New York City has grown tired of racial race and dense living conditions. She hopes to find a simple life. But building a house can be a simple thing. When headaches and invoices begin to ridicule, you laugh. Will not he go to Mrs. Blantyng's dream house? <br /> <br /> How special this movie is, it plays three key roles - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. All three can take a film, so when you combine your talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been my favorite in this kind of role. She is very good at putting her husband. Loy is always happy to watch. The Thin Man films made by William Powell are perfect. And Douglas has become my favorite for the past two or three years. <br /> <br /> - Douglas also appeared in the Old Dark House. I get a shot of imagination when you can build two bathrooms, three bedrooms, four bathrooms with 15 thousand dollars a year. <br /> <br /> But there are many things for everyone who bought or built a house. and Blanding's commitment to finding themselves is relatively easy to deal with today. And the comedy is where it came from. How many people have seen some of the stupid things in this movie to put an end to the spending of couples more than they expected? - My biggest complaint about Mr Blandings is the subpoenition of "the best friend of his friend". There is really no need for this field and is beyond the scope and is worried.
