FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. His influence was felt for more than a decade. At the same time, some of the elements of this widescreen entertainment, about 50 people on the average, now have very few history and the film's sometimes unstable pacing does not help. However, the foremost central idea of ​​the story of the ancient, cold Krell civilization and the story of Id's monsters has not lost its appeal and continues to make the film "Need to See". What's interesting here is that this DVD is awesome for this movie. The film really did not look good on the home video and saw its need to restore its elements. Hopefully it will happen soon and we get a special copy of this SF classic.
