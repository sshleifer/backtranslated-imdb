The film may be a bit wrong to look at in terms of other movies, but I think this is the best way to get the choice in the gangster genre sequentially. It works together in the same place between Godfather and Kinji Fukasaku's Yakuza opus The Yakuza Papers (AKA Honor and Battles Without Man), but at the same time romanticized and realistic, dark and strange. But the film also has a movie, and it has a different touch of Hong Kong Auteur. <br /> <br /> Every year HK Triad chooses a new boss. Only one candidate is not satisfied with the result, so he decides to take matters into his own hands until the Triads and the police are angry. In short, this is a story, but there is much more behind it. Like the Yakuza newspapers, planning, back stabbing and loyalty (sometimes called something by phone - one of the most memorable scenes I have seen lately) have a lot to do with merging and relocating to create an absolutely dramatic drama, but an interesting plot and good character confrontation. The fans of the Gangster genre are highly appreciated in this regard. The election is not in line with expectations; Despite violence. And I'm not talking about a striking, seductive version of Hollywood violence. It's dark and dark. Cameras in the scenes of criminals and victims who are cruelly exposed to humanity as well as humanity; <br /> <br /> Pacing is relatively slow and intentional, according to Qafqazinfo. Cinematography is great, quiet, and dark in equal measurements using mixed colors (brown, dark green and orange). Proper tracking shots add a quality to it. Finally, the election takes a special place. This is not a definitive character research, and it's not a gangster-focused film. It explores a situation (the election and its subsequent state), but it's in style and is both realistic and romantic (especially Triad ceremonies, especially the echo of the father of the eastern lady).
