OK. There are people who have not seen this movie. <br /> 1) If you do not like Satira or black humor, do not see it. 2) _The If you're offended by Watchmen_, do not love it. 3) If you are a serious superhero movie, do not see it. <br /> <br /> Stay away, do not go, see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's quirky, delightful sending every superhero clich√© known to this man. The occasional shooting of little-humorous humor does not destroy the main entertainment of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller, and Hank Azaria, and some entertaining little by Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Louise Lasser also started working). I laughed all the way. Totally unusual, somewhat strange, but good.
