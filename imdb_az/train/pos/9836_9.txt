Like the classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2), it's not creepy, though I really like it better. It's faster speeds, better settings, and cool 80's soundtrack. It is loaded with action and has a sweet effect by Lucio Fulci. ZOMBIE ZOMBI 2 does not look as bad as it is, but still looks good. This was pretty good, but it has a share of fresh accrual; For example, some zombies move really slowly, others become faster than ninjas. some are in braini, some say funny lines, but are awaiting sequence when it comes to Italian horror? Even the flying zombie head! What does it run? Surely it should be for gorehounds and zombie fans. it would probably provide fans of action films. See also Zombie 4.
