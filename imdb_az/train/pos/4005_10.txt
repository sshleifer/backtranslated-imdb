At one point, I thought it would turn out to be a vacation, and I have to say that Mother did not do an excellent job to explain the sexual desires of an elderly woman. <br /> <br /> I'm very glad to have Hollywood never would have done it, even if it were, they would destroy it without losing time to develop their character. <br /> <br /> The story is slowly and realistically. Acting is superior, the heroes are mistaken in believing and the dialogue is sensitive. <br /> <br /> I highly appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> I highly appreciate this film. And I have to admit that I will look at my mother forever in a different light!
