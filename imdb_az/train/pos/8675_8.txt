<br /> <br /> Everything begins with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (with whom). here it is called "Butch"). They beat each other, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and surprising decision: he stops the fight and thinks he must all be friends. <br /> <br /> However, all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends ... they will not last long. <br /> Meanwhile, the three become compassionate, patient and kind to each other. Even when one's life is in danger, they save one another. It does not matter, but a great steak appears, and all of them are in a hurry. <br /> <br /> One of the parties is still a really happy and grateful experience to see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, as an interesting fact, two songs from the "Oz Wizard" are played in instrumental versions: "We are going to see the Wizard" and "The Rainbow in one place".
