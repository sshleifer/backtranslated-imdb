'' 40-year-old Sister '' made me laugh. I love the many jokes and scenes involved in this movie if it is considered a very comedy. Steve Carell is perfect as sisters nerd Andy Stitzer and I consider Andy to be the one of the most beautiful, especially when it comes to real-life scene. <br /> <br /> The majority of actors and actresses in this film are so popular or popular now. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitser has a peaceful life. He is a little strange and collects a lot of toys, but it looks harmless. One day, while playing poker with colleagues, they are actually discovering Andy ... virgin! She's 40 years old! After this stunning unit, all his friends are trying to sleep with Andy and a woman ... the problem is now in Andy's confusion, especially when she begins to love Trish, a DVD player in the shop where she works.
