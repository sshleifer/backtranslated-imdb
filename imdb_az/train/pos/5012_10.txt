In April 1965, CBS released Barbra Streisand's monumental television special. The show was not just a success of a leakage rating but also a 5 Emmy Award. It's one of the most memorable moments of the 1960s and, unfortunately, is a special type of television that they no longer produce. It should look at the beautiful songs and those of all those who are interested in early television with this exclusive Streisand fan, full of spectacular performances by Barbra.
