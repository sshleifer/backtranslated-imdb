I just bought a revised version of the movie I was fond of from childhood, and of course, preparing for a fun afternoon. Bedgings are definitely more full of meaning, and deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) effectively co-ordinate the events. The way to remastered the scenes of a bit of anxiety. Certainly, the soundtrack for these images was lost or damaged, so some sparkling sparks in Disney decided to connect the scenes with a new dialogue. Half of the value was so indestructible for the surrounding people (for some better reasons) and even for everything. Some of the lips combinations are pretty weak, and David Tomlinson's voice is dubbed by a block unlike anything like David Tomlinson (in fact, there is a sign in German). However, it is good to hear the full version of all the songs (although there is still no 'step in the right direction') and magic moments still shine in this movie. When I looked at the young Paul Angela Lansbury and Coos so innocent you challenged you for giggling "But what's with my knob?"
