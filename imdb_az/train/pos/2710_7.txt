This is not my favorite WIP ("Prison women"), but one of the subtitled genres. It was developed by Roger Corman, who has already produced several AIPs. The film tries to play with the defined formula. The film is most noteworthy in WIP films, not in the banana republic, but in the US Prison. I am not convinced that this is a wise act, but it is a rapidly acceptable change. Writer-director Demme really gets into the job by getting new ways to present a really familiar scenario. In fact, he is less ambitious for his good. The film expert creates a few surreal dream sequences that are fictional, but it is fun to see how hard it is to put the film above average mercury chains. But do not worry, Demme is still operating within the sub-genre settings. There is so much ugliness and violence, something that will provide hardcore fans. The film is a bit slow but very entertaining. Casting is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP worker, so there is no need for an entry and Barbara Steel is like a crazy guitarist engaged in a wheelchair. Pam Grier missed though.
