When two writers make a horrible version of the breakfast at Tiffany, you know something goes wrong. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are the perfect actors. The FBI agent was a terrible player. Patrick's look at Holly was downloaded from top to bottom as a kind of object. Drew Barrymore is too hot. Sally Kellerman's Infinite Strangers were a great part of it. The strange dry worm was just strange. Nathan was a very beautiful cat. What was the scene when Patrick Holly threw out and Mr. Gooding attacked him? Dr. Wallace scene? What is the climbing around there? Like Sally Kellerman, there is not a single woman in each person. It was strange when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew next to Victor.
