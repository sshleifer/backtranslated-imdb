Wow, I liked this movie. The latest Hollywood blockbusters could not have the financial and advertising, but twice the emotional blow. This story is about a family from Utah and the relationship between people in the family who are faking film. The main lead (Giovanni Ribisi) plays a very good role, never leaving you to believe that he is moving all his emotions. Although his brother Elias Koteas who stole the show for me. When they were in two scenes, they separated from each other and gave fantastic performances. Great cast, big movie.
