Vincent Cassel plays a part of Paul, who has been assigned to an office workplace that responds to Carla, a secretary who has heard a lot of hearing aids. (played by Emmanuel Devos). Together, they help each other grow as humans. <br /> <br /> What was the complexity of the characters that were particularly interesting about this movie? does not fit open stereotypes. Paul seems worried about the office environment, will he be cut off for work? <br /> <br /> If this film works and shines in a workplace, that belief will be eliminated. <br /> <br /> The film has an amazing impression of me, and although we have shown how easy it is, <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a movie full of both great theatrical and jokes. The first is that Carla is babysitting and a baby who screams is trying to relax. Is he going to scream? but only for hearing its ears.
