I've seen it as a child in the eighth grade and must say that Galaxy Express is one of those films that have long been imaginable. Finding this movie may be a gold ticket to Otaku if you do not understand the Anime application. <br /> <br /> The story is sensitive and poetic like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant style that portrays the great ability of Star Wars, Dark Crystal and Leiji Matsumoto, one of the unique children's films, to create character design and visual storytelling. <br /> <br /> I offer this movie at a very high level. The Oz Wizard, who has completely overcome the status of "Family Entertainment" and has a unique cinema classic.
