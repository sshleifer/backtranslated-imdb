Korean cinema can be quite surprising for a strange audience because you can find sounds and genres in the same film. In a Coreen drama such as "Secret Sunshine", you can also find some funny tracks, tension scenes and romantic times. At one point in the film, a song depicting Song Kang-ho, says, "Life is not tragedy but tragedy-comedy." But I'm not mistaken, the film deals with heterogeneity of these genres, it adds sensitivity to the experience of the rich filmmaker. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there is no union: on the contrary, it is rare to see such a dense and deep portrait of a painful woman. <br /> <br /> Shin-ae, her son in her hometown's native city, really gives all the different faces of the suffering that this film unites. This real part is erased by psychological depictions of all stages of the poor mother. Religious, missing, anger, faith, depth of reality: The film reduces all the passage of character and resembles the psychological catalog of all painful stages that a woman can survive. <br /> <br /> Only things that seem to be a conceptual experience (the woman is wearing the mask of the tragedy, the man represents your comic relationships), and links the film's art with you. Some part of the film really said that it really did not really help me (especially especialy), especially Chang Jouan, but at the same time the suffering was getting me feeling up to the end. Nevertheless, some kinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising (the place where one body is discovered at a great shooting is surprising). Such scenes form the "Secret Sun" movie horror movie or "The Host" melo equivalent for "Memories of Murder". These films are truly striking, original, aesthetically incredible, and give other dimensions to genres related to them. "Hidden Sunshine", "Host", something that is forgotten to be scary, cries its audience: a bad point for melodrama, but a good point for a good movie.
