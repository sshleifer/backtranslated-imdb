Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best excitements of 2005. A great twist. Big-eyed candy. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest films, besides Scream and Nightmare on Elm Street. This could be the best. The site is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. A hotel director who fights Lisa Reisert (McAdams), controls a red eye coming back to LA. The little one knows that Jackson Ripner has been followed by AKA Jack Ripper (Murphy). They had a few drinks and they ended up sitting on the plane. He then shows that he was a conspirator sent to kill the Homeland Security Mystery at the Lisa Hotel. And that's what's with Lisa. Maybe if Ripner does not kill his father, he will have to take the room to the upper chamber so that he can bomb Brian Cox. The twisting and bringing of the story really adds extra zing and side symbols and side jokes really. In general, it is definitely one of the best excitements of 2005. <br /> <br /> 4 stars 3 1/2
