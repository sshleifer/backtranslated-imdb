For the first time about this movie about 20 years ago when I was a child at the classroom (!) I heard that I was only one day in class encyclopaedias, and cinema (or cinema, I do not remember) was a few steps for different films from an overall film experimental film one for OffOn. <br /> <br /> After 18 years, about 18 years later, the American Library Archives Treasures, released by the National Film Protection Foundation, were available for all 4 DVD sets to pay for public library. So when I read notes on a DVD for a set, I'm glad to see you're on one of the OffOn discs. After all these years, I will finally see the movie! I did not wait long after waiting for him (I thought it would be a more organic-looking movie, it was not a bad thing, but I was expecting it to be more electronic aesthetic). Scott Bartlett used to shoot the film and filmed himself in one of the scenes of the movie (video montage ), IMHO was still an effective film, considering the techniques used to use video equipment. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the methods used in this film were quite elegant for 1972. That's why I'm still one of my favorite short / experimental films and it's a creative inspiration for me ...
