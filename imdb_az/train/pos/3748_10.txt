I've been looking at many times and planning to buy full features. I love Jason Still's whole comedy. It is very different and unique and very pleasant. Now I love movies and it's just great. The plot is strange, but very funny. This short film is about a Spatula called Edward. The commands of the events are somewhat surprised, it is very interesting to watch this movie. First you see Eduard who fights brown brown, but then his attention changes in his life. This is a groundless film, but of course it is still great. It is recommended to watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. Very funny. Humor does not suit everyone's taste, but can be watched anyway. You only get 16 minutes of your time and it's free. SPATULA MADNESS GO WATCH!
