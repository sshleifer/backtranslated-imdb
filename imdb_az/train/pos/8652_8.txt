I had seen California before (about 10 years ago) and I still regret it. That's why I wanted to see him again and, almost ten years ago, when I came to the movies, I still did not lose it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> California, writes author Brian Kessler and his wife Carrie Laughlin, a photographer who wants to move to California. But when they fly and fly to the state, the rain is never said, but instead they choose to drive. She wants to write a book about America's most popular series of tracks and she will make matching pictures. However, as the car used a large amount of gasoline, they decided to buy another pair with them, so they could spend the trip costs. Only one pair responded, and they will be automatically lucky. However, they did not get to know one another and Carrie was shocked when other couples saw their first trip, when they started their trip. Without wanting to be sensitive, she can only conclude that the Early Grayce and Adele Corners are a poor white trailer park debris. He does not really want his car, but Brian does not decide to take them with them and he decides to stop them. At first, the pair does not seem to be bad, but slowly Ear Grace turns into an unshakable killer from a naked hillbilly ... <br /> <br /> The story is not very impressive, it is derived from our four potentials. Brad Pitt is incredible as Early Gray. His performance in this movie may be the best. It's the same for Juliette Lewis. She plays with childhood and loyal girl, who does not want to hear bad words early and really works very well. But David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes are also a surprise. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Forbes is a psychological tension with a very powerful story, but graphics I can not think that everyone can be tired because of violence (although I do not see how an incredibly serial killer will be described). Personally, I liked this movie very much, and violence did not bother me (this is part of the story that is very important for staying in). I award this movie 8/10.
