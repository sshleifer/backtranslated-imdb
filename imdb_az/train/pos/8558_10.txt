Always with Drew Barrymore's best actors and in this movie he is performing a very good performance. Here's a very difficult young castle (Holly Gooding), leaving in 2000 in New York and heading to California to share a flat. up and coming writer George Newbern (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", '96. A very strange thing is that Holly begins to work and when she kills her father, she tries to find her brother in a mental organization. If you get closer, you actually see Drew Barrymore's mother as her mother in this picture. If Drew Barrymore and George Newbern were not a good player, this movie would only be on Halloween Night! Nevertheless, there are surprises in the end!
