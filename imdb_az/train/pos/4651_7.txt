He did not set too high expectations for this film, which was a pleasant surprise for me. The story is sometimes a little weird, but there is generally acknowledgment. Event scenes are pretty beautiful and accompanying music is used to create a sense of patriotism for US films. This can not be the best movie, but it's not uncommon for Sweden, and I hope to see something more in the future.
