<br /> <br /> This movie is a big movie about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family! <br /> <br /> This is not an idealistic film, but as it is in the 60s and 70s. The main story happens. Heroes are beautiful, but there are some "dark sides" that you believe are real people. A great movie with great actors to show that life is not always funny, but you'll find happiness as Gigi's main character is "fire and passion".
