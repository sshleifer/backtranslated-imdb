This low-budget digital video movie is strong in the right places - writing and moving. In addition, digital photography is the best thing ever. In poor working conditions, the characteristic video umber is dominant, but not surprisingly, the brightness, clarity, and saturation of the movie are competitive. The best grass roots movie with a Midnight Cowboy charming dialogue about grifters who see everything they need to live in San Francisco.
