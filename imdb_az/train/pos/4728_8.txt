<br /> <br /> After seeing the 'Break A Leg' film at the release party in Vancouver I thought it was a very unpleasant movie. <br /> <br /> I had some laughs and some girls (especially Eric Roberts) screamed. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it's basically a tool for symbols and situations. The scenario is smooth and flawless, the sky is developing smoothly, and the toy is still comfortable. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This movie is one of the 10-15 movie festivals earned a little prize.
