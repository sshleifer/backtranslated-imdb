The Wooden Horse was one of the first "big" escape stories from the Second World War, describing the true story of Eric Williams and others, who fled Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I love this movie, it has been shifted from Amazon UK to VHS and PAL format in the United States. When I saw some part of the movie in the early 60's, I read it at a high school. escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than the tracks of the escapades described in the Great Escapade. This film is a treasure to be more affordable for American audiences.
