Of course, I know why this movie is such a big "flop". Sharon Stone is, of course, a "core instinct", and has not lost any charisma and "touchscreen". I gave 10 films to this movie and why I said: The game opens in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in BI1. Again, it proves to be the main manipulator of its class - it's cautious. <br /> <br /> As for the technical part of the film, it is only real reality: Catherine is the crew of the B degree of actors. Sharon Stone, in the first part with him and Michael Douglas, and others. Compared to it, the only big name in the stone. I thought Sharon Stone was a little young though I would have been better at BI2, but still his appearance was pretty stunning and just developed in his charisma. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < that easily spreads these days. The plot is great, technically easy, half the part of the movie is not snoring, and most important - it's tidy.
