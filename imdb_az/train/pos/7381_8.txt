IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are a company with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first is ESTEVÃO (at least at the very beginning, I tell you very well). When the man takes this and gets his money, he starts blackmailing his two partners, looks at his company, and wants a job there (he says if there is a supervisor or something?). At the same time ESTEVÃO gets acquainted with her daughter MARINA (Mariana Ximenes) and gets acquainted with her! <br /> <br /> In such a story crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail are handed down, no one can be innocent or victim, except that the exception is MARINA. He knows what's going on and does not betray anyone? <br /> <br /> This film describes the sad and brutal reality in the major metropolis, like São Paulo, in a place where it is brought up every day. ANISIO (singing by the brilliant Paulo Miklos) may also feel irony that blackmails and even kills the guys who pay them without fear! He really must be a monster to do something like that, but of course, do I know people there, Brazil or somewhere else? <br /> <br /> This is a very good film, a cruel but sad, sad thing! Acting is great and sounds.
