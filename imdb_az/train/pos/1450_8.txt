Excellent political tension played quieter and slower than in other genres in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how can they get this wonderful career out of the show? Friendship, father-son relationship, corruption and deception story. The two actors came together with amazement, and Aiello and Fonda's support were particularly effective when Aiello was not brilliant, especially when the paper ran to the press. Instead of focusing on a mixed corruption scandal, failure creates beautiful characters that portray humanity as political bribery, and the final scenes are beautifully written and acted upon with each of the main characters.
