After all the fruits of Hollywood (and Indians), we can finally get a movie that has some fears. There are some clich√© moments, but I'm not sure if it's possible to make a complete original movie right now. There is nothing new here ... only good things have been done. <br /> <br /> Be careful and be careful: "gentle" fear comes often and often. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie to watch during bad eating. <br /> <br /> This film has a very red sweater and, unfortunately, plays a very bad role. Cheri Christian does not just impress Julie (spouse / mother). For one thing, it is absolutely spotless. I know, I know ... he had a traumatic experience. But the audience does not recognize it as it usually is, and the relationship between her and her husband is extremely uncomfortable (in any way). I think the director intended to be a bit sincere to us, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a finger is also concerned about the end to end. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but a good, old thing. scary movie ... something very rare these days.
