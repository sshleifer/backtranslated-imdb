At one time, Cassavetes was not offered by Pauline Kael when he did not think as an actor, but as an actor. Kaelin was a lack of competence as a filmmaker, Keeping this comparison will never make me feel like Cassavetes manages himself in a movie, like Cassavetes in his own work like Orson Welles. Cassavetes is like a genius like Welles, but more important than a real artist (against a technician or a r√∂tori). It's like a cross between the Italian passion (although the Cassavetes are really Greek) and Scandinavian introversion. <br /> <br /> Internal jinn have not been physically exposed. <br /> <br /> This is the secret to being, exercising and acting. Like the Haunted Skip James record, there are echoes around the ghosts around. From stunning, stupefying and almost operative from Cassavetes, Rowlands' breakdowns are accompanied by a splash, unsettling piano. Who is this dead girl? Metaphysics is endless and it's incredible to find such things in the Cassavetes movie, and only to expose the intelligence (there is also a short time before the noise). But he was always clever, he would never take it away because he was not worthy of praise. This is not "adaptation"; <br /> <br /> Here, the truth and the art and drama blend are not to be foolish, but to show the inner turmoil and confusion. <br /> <br /> Very much goes. Clean, joyful love when Rowlands greeted his goalkeeper; she is horrified when she hit her ... When talking about how the girl devotes to art and art, one scene is one of the most impressive demonstrations of what one means to be a fan of someone. A part of this can be seen as A Star Born, and Almodovar has borrowed "All About My Mother". I think it's a little disappointing because of laughter, but it's almost as painful as preparation. <br /> <br /> You will shoot me, but alcoholism is a relatively small point about the film, despite its relevance on most stages. <br /> <br /> It is a living, breathing thing, for a while: it can go in any direction. As "Cherry Taste", we also recall that "it's just a game." But it's dangerous: when Rowlands calls this line, is that a huge drama? How will the audience do it? Is he reflexive or simply concerned? His character is similar to that of the audience and, ultimately, to the film, as Mrs. James Dean witnessed. 10/10
