One of the most popular films of French adult sex lovers, starting with Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere, is also extremely sarcastic. <br /> <br /> Along with that, Blier is one of the many dark psychological dramas of the 70s, such as Serie Noire, Buffet Froid, Beau Pere. I want the previous comment posted on the film: The English-language title is too far from French. Both heroes are "going to places", but can be translated into French by "vals dancers", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles.
