Although Kristofferson is good at this role, who does not want to see Elvis Pressy instead? Drug addiction and high frustration could have caused Elvis's agent to be out of the film, and that was a mistake. It would be a perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from terrific, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job to create an original soundtrack for this "epoch" piece / music. A little story of love is a gift of grace and a gift of purchase. Like most tragedies, the hero of the story was dead. Also, Gary Busey is perfect in a more perfect role.
