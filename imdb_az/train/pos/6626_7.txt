Pixar has lived in a very good way and has been very successful, though their movies are technically awesome and a visual mosaic, but there is a story that suits their style. And often very moving style: impact, charming and cross-generational. Many Anime (speaking extensively) and many other cartoons do not match their technical virtuosity with real material, and I think (and I'm also wrong) partly, that is, the producers are not disturbed by the character and the plot <br /> <br / > It focuses very much on the sound and the image, or efforts to capture some cartoons are so great that it does not have the energy to create a really exciting story. <br /> <br /> Renaissance can not be called. There are defects in his field, but then I'll get it. At the same time, these drawbacks are not reflected clearly: Renaissance is no surprise now. Ultra high contrast images (sometimes such a high contrast face or a light is not something visible) and incredible detail is always impressive, always a joy to see. Fairy-generation Paris Blade Runner and Brave New World's sad generations; dark, dark, very rich and even clean, but intrigue is covered entirely with the wealth of the corporation (the capital of the king) and covered with a complex, complex architectural sculpture of its labyrinthine transitions. <br /> <br /> This is a charming environment, not entirely original, but also great. The film's multi-moving 'action-capture' technology and the ultimate focus on human and design minutiae result in images that die for black and white photographer. It does not interfere with the excitement, as Christian Volckman sets up a series of beautiful activities: skin care trails for hell, a few terrifying killings, a few hairs in the dark, and bad dust in a strange apartment. There are plenty of places (I would like to visit the night club). The central character of the karas is your off-the-shelf maverick polish, and the other two women characters (sisters) are the true motors of the film. <br /> <br /> Talking about the war in Eastern Europe, war products, diaspora and the products of your family, they are an entire metaphor for Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is great atmospheric, - the chamber moves and the tone for a great experience. However, the plot ... It is never more interesting than the first bead, and after removing Karas from the street, it is necessary to find Ilona Tasuiev, a dead, magnificent and progressive scientist. "Avalon" (Avalon Corporation is never bad), its "secret" projects and searches spit into Hell, and shortly thereafter, Karas's official pressures, dead bodies, cigarettes /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Noir, in other words, but I love the film more than Sin City (like the past), the plot and the resolution are elegant, the immortality is raised, but the subject of Avalon's CEO, Paul Dellenbach's highly-sophisticated shenanigans toughens dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> Some ideas are fictional genre material, and the view and the atmosphere hide secular materials. <br /> <br /> Along with this, although the film is clear and perfectly relevant, sometimes characters sometimes feel like excuses for technical wizarding demonstrations. But this is the projection of life in Paris in 2054, the vision of the society and the creation of another city, which makes it possible to see something. I can take it very seriously, and if I'm in this situation I can at least say something very nice, very entertaining (very mature) and nothing else.
