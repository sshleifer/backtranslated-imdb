a weekend that I watched this comic movie. and I love it very much. All the children are reminded of my childhood with this stupid thought. is a true entertaining movie for a group of family on the weekend night. The humor of children is always working. There are also good behaviors. A simple story, but a cool shot. a nice job to find your way to a child. As for the child film, I think "12 and hold". this year was different, but it was different from the world of reality and the cruel childhood. awesome job H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood and family needs. p.s. Twitch, I think, Nemo's voice from "find Nemo".
