This movie Errol Flynn has even made me think. Although Flynn is well known for being a good savoir-faire and sprezzatura (a few loud falutin 'throw in the European point!), This movie is a great ego that allows you to linger as an actor (though a bit though) unstable public spikes with a nervous feeling. Support is very good; everyone seems well-selected for their roles. <br /> <br /> The story moves very fast and, of course, entertains and ensures, though not particularly profound (perhaps deliberately avoiding the possibility of giving a social comment about the mass unequal distribution of income at that time). Since I met Jim Corbett, the story is very loyal to history. I loved the great portraits of San Francisco in the 1880s. Generally, it's very little to dislike about this movie ... it is very valuable to watch.
