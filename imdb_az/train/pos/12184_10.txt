In most of his films (Citizen Kane, Hidden Report, Bad Attack), Orson Welles gave her the role of joyful men. I see him holding the role of a victim in the Prince of Prince. The rogue's role was given to Rita Hayworth, so I love her. So it's an interesting movie. But I find the story very well. In this direction, as always with Welles: the two scenes are particularly bright: with one in the aquarium and the last mirror. This movie is brilliant. (10/10)
