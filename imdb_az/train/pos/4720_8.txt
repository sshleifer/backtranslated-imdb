If you love a beautiful movie, especially the horses, the WWII films, and the Hungarian Plateau. Story of courage, compassion and loyalty to generations. <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch this movie again. This is a family movie and I highly recommend it. Good '' Family Nite '' movie. Despite some violent scenes, Hungary was occupied by the Nazi occupation. The indigenous people stopped their seats, despite the death of a speaker who had personal reasons to hunt Brady. A hauntingly beautiful movie.
