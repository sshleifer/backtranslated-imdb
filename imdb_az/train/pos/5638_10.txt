I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is an excellent role model for teenagers and should be more appreciated. This movie follows your dreams and means what you can do or punish and criticize. Holly fulfills her dreams like Britney. <br /> <br /> <strong> While looking at this movie, you have to admit that you are special and whatever your desires that you will understand. <br /> <br /> Thank you Britney for encouraging me and our friends to follow our dreams. He will not know how meaningful to me. Bravo Britney. You are the greatest!
