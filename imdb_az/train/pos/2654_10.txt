Everyone should see this movie completely! Fear was scared, but the crazy "head-on-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" thing does not happen. This is really great. See this freaking awesome movie! Director Stanley Kubrick is the greatest director who has ever lived. Each of his films, including masterpieces. The Shining belongs to a family traveling and snowing to a hotel in Colorado Rockies as guards for winter. It's a home scene. The child is psychic. Her husband is easily influenced by poor haunted hotels and ... well ... HILARITY ENSUES !!!! Not really. It is a confusing movie that has been thrown into the audience from different perspectives and is frightened. Not just a classic, "Here's Johnny Here" scene. It's memorable, but can not talk to all movies. The words are one of the things that he does not explain enough, and you just have to see it. So go to Netflix and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
