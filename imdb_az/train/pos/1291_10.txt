This is a good movie. Something that pleases the watching of money should be blown up, especially in terms of a child. That's why it's a fun little movie about a child's dream and a kid can do with $ 1 million. Do not like it, do not watch it. They film for the audience, and people who do nothing better then complain about their lives.
