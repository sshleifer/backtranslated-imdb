"How to lose friends and alienate people" is not tied to Tiger Woods's cursing. A romantic comedy based on the experiences of Toby Young as a journalist covering celebrities. The film's stars include Simon Pegg, Sydney Young, a well-known British journalist working in a well-known communication journal in New York. The young man is around all around the shenanigans, so he is concerned about getting the movie title. He is heartfelt, courageous and moronic. However, it is a bit unpleasant for some surprising reasons. Sidney fellow journalist, writer Alison Olsen played with impressions by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sydney is particularly fond of Sophie Maes, a sexual player singled out by a fantastic woman Megan Fox. This foxtrot activity is obvious, but it's a high level of "eye candy". Sidney has taken all kinds of crocodiles to move journalist ladder to magazine collaboration. The film's highest comedy moments. However, director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan have lost some viewers by setting up an incredibly romantic scheme between Sidney & Alison and can override original rom-com material. Though Team Weidstraughan has made an interesting statement on the contrary. Pegg cuts off the phone icon with his hilarious performance as Sydney Young. Jeff Bridges again built the "Dude" bridge with the miraculous supportive work southern Harding, the magazine's protagonist. But the rest of the film is not worthy enough to attend. "How to lose friends and alienate people" should not be alienated, but if you introduce it as a romantic comedy, you may lose some movie friends. *** Medium
