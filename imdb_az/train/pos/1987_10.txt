This movie was awesome! I can not get their songs. I think it's a little old for music, but this movie deserves some credits here, guys! My special love was Jack Wild. Because of being an English actress, you can not deprive me of all these beautiful-looking, fresh faces, young people. I never knew that Jack was in the movie sixteen! She's got eleven years. She is short, helping. Try placing your answers and posters on it, and I can relate to your experiences. Oh, and Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think the pilot looks really familiar. Any ideas you've played before? If so, please let me know really.
