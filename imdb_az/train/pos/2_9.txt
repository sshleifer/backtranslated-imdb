Bromwell is not a high bright thing. A student at the public school in South London and this irritable parody of a teacher leaves her as if laughing. Flawless, provocative, clever and sharp. Characters are the intersection of the British society (or any society in which to be more accurate) is a superior cartoon. After Keisha, Latrina and Natella's escape, three "heroes" to ask for a better period, the show is not shy about parodying on every imagined subject. In each episode, political correctness extends from the window. Bromwell is not disappointed if you enjoy the shows you are not afraid of the entertainment of every taboo theme you do not want to know!
