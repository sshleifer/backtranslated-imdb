One of the things we got at Hollywood Video was Zombie Bloodbath. <br /> <br /> Life is the source of a housing project built on a nuclear object bulldozed, plus the underground layers are simply covered. Residents in this neighborhood find a covert facility when some children fall into a pit within a cave. <br /> <br /> From this point of view, this is a heap-city. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's not a great art, but it's a joke, and the horrible things that we have to do is our favorite. evening.
