I sat down to watch this movie very excitedly and with little hope. It is impossible for this movie to fit into the subject. But it was completely, and then. First, it is necessary to say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job like John Lennon. Sometimes Harris seemed to have Lennon sewed. This resemblance was often the case, and she had learned Lennon's behavior and vocal entertainments. Aiden was pretty good as Quinn McCartney, but also a striking resemblance to the Macca, though sometimes Scouse scouted. <br /> <br /> This fiction work is well written and well directed. Of course, it was a pure fantasy, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur passing through a key darkness in this union. The multiplication scene was particularly active, because McCartney said he did not hear Lennon as a child - she was worthy and important and could not blame her parents for abandoning. <br /> <br /> This is my only complaint: I was not sure if it was a suit as it was, and I, too, was a duplicate dance park for the Reggae band, which was reflected in this stage of life in her life. He was in a very good position in his inner state and was known to be really friendly when he approached the fans. <br /> <br /> A few years later, he was very friendly when he first came to an assassination for a signature he signed on the day he was killed. <br /> <br /> In this film, these emotions have been a little longer for John again. Beatles are sure to be back in a single stage. <br /> <br /> Lennon and McCartney would also be friends today. I'm sure, VH1. <br /> <br /> I will always follow him. <br /> <br />
