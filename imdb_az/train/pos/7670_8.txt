I really liked "Dr. Mordrid." It's a low-budget movie, some leave some, but I have nothing to do with it. I'm more impressed with this, I think it's more fun than Hollywood's every year. He did not get the freedom of theater too bad; I do not know about another, but I would like to see in theaters. "Doctor Mordrid" is a fantastic science fiction movie that everyone can do, although they are fantastic. Why I do not see the R-rated movie; there is only one f-word and there is no terrible death scene or blood. The magicians Anton and Kabal (Anton Kabal wanted to use their power to save human heritage when he wanted to robbery), the timeless competition between wizards Anton and Kabal added the story to the astounding mythic plot character. Basically, this is just an entertaining movie to watch the movie. There is one thing to do in this movie, though: Jeffrey Combs sees a ragged blue hat and a straight face while wearing a suit. It makes me laugh when I see it every time. But I respect ... Anyway, the player is great; The main heroes (Anton and his lady friend Samantha) are very pleased; Anton is sympathetic and hospitable and Samantha is friendly. Plus, the settings were fine. The other flying island was in a very cool state; Although we only looked twice; it would be nice to see more scenes here. The setting was also very clean; Anthony's view is very extensive and has a number of cool installations, including the monitoring system he uses to track the world's events. She even has a blend of snow that she holds in an apartment called Edgar. Generally, this is a great movie; was fun to watch and made the roles of playing a major role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
