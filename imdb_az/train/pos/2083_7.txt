This film was an interesting form of Hollywood with the same novel by Pearl S. Buck. Though it was thought that some day racist stereotypes were provided, Chinese heroes believed that it was also moving forward. I saw that white actors played by Chinese were not as bad as I expected, but it's not Asian black. There were no Asian actors in the US (even George Teyny did not work) and Rainer did a good job with his own part. This is not the biggest performance I've ever seen, but it's a nice job for the pre-school method. The locust scene was shot very well and had a convincing effect. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the release of the great Depression type will make this movie allegory. <br /> <br /> The film was parallel to the style of John Ford, but I think the Eastern influences also affected him. . If this were a western family, the locusts punished the farmer because he was proud, heartfelt, and in love. But here he learns his lesson and then earns.
