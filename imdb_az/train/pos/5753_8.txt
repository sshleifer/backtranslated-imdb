*** 1/2 Out ***** Although I'm not concerned about where this is an English dubbed version, as I mentioned some reviewers, it seems to be experiencing a lot of Quebecois native breasts. But this was a movie that I was a child, I'm a very fond of admirers; Given that you are now preparing for the children, I measure it on a relative basis. The story builds an awesome snow castle for their children in the winter break, and moves to control the luggage with arms and snowballs, as well as snowballs and other designs, as winter leisure lessons. If it were my children, it's definitely a movie that I'm going to try and play, just like when I was young as a Snow Maiden, and even if kids today agree with Pixar and the whole computer animation, maybe I'm not history I do not understand. In addition, the film's message is beautiful allegoric and positive for children (and also for adults).
