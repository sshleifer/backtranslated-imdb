It is good to see Jorja Fox in a place where she is very smiling. He also heard his read. A wonderful change to see him from his CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was fun, but many explanations were made in many sections. A few characters seemed a minute and a happy one, and you had to imagine why. Although each character is weird, in some cases I will see what I will do or I will not hear the next words. This film is not full of squeaky clean people, but rather complicated real people who can make mistakes, think bad about themselves, and then find a way to fix them.
