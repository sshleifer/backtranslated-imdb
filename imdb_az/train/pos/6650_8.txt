I do not want to explain how good the movie is or what's wrong with it, because I'm not a professional film critic and I do not have enough information to shoot. I do not know first of all that the making of such a film is a great achievement, and I congratulate the Director for it. However, in some of the studies I have read, critics have complained that the relationship with Hiralal's brothers is not important and that they are completely removed from the story. Now, I would like to point out that, like the film's title, there is not a film about Hiralal's brothers, but a film about Mahatma Gandhi's relationship with his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing less. If we start complaining about some of the characters in the movie, it would be a little unfair, because it does not fit the picture, no matter how dependent it is in real life. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it would be better if we were committed to the main idea and satisfied with the criticism in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
