I feel compelled to write a review for Space Cobra because I've got a good 7.3 star rating, but when I wrote, only a few reviews were positive. It's a strange situation and hopefully my positive view will turn people into this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. The cosmic cobra is a smuggler and a weird strange tale that deals with an evil force that seeks to use the power of the three sisters and planets of the ancient and dead planet. It's an old movie and animation show, but it's nothing new in the modern world, which is created by the abundance of charm. Space Cobra helps a lot of western audiences and watching. There are few references to specific Japanese culture and traits to watch and enjoy anime traditions. Space Cobra itself is ready and delicate. I can not say how much this is for the Englishman or the manufacturer's intentions, but this is one of the few comics of a really comical comic. Style is a very sophisticated Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colorful and creative and there are constant moves to move along the story. The striking aspect of this film begins as a comedy and ends with a very low dramatic note. I do not think of another Anime or a movie that can do it directly and convincingly. But you realize that this is happening, but it looks so subtle and beautiful. You also really feel the characters have gone on a journey and they have changed with all the experience of life. Check if possible.
