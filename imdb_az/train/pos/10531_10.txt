I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I traveled with local Hastings because we wanted to rent something we have never seen before, and we flee from this beautiful movie. I had no idea what would happen, but it was spectacular. 2 finger up. I liked how the movie was shot and the actors were very laughable. If you are looking for a funny movie that will often make you want to run away from your local video store and find this movie. I would say some of my favorite parts, but I'm not the one to destroy the movie for you. This movie is definitely in my top 10 movies list. Indeed, nothing is bouncy?
