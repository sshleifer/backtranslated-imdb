I love Kurt Vonnegut, though I'm not interested in spy stories and I did not know it. The only reason I follow is Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors since I've seen "Champions Breakfast" and "Hotel Rwanda." But the movie brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was very nice, but that was a plot. There was relatively little political intrigue and more attention was paid to the moral issue: by reading secret anti-Semitic radio messages to Americans, actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and later emerged by Americans) against Jews or Hitler. What is the weight, the service to his country or the unconsciousness of anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent because these words are never talked about or even narrated. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a man who has learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not even open his memories. It is almost impossible to describe the internal conflict of such a character - but with the help of excellent action and photography, this movie is directed. <br /> <br /> There are other moments as well as the mockery of popular and romantic clich√©s (like the White Christmas song), which differs from the Middle American films. I recommend everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.
