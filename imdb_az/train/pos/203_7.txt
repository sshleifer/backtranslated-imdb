Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys, starring Walter Matthau and George Burns, is a funny comedy with a staggering fate of life and jealousy, but laughter is always a bitter taste. You can only feel anger and blue when you see two great comedy comedy players, Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns), now flawless and persistent aging. Willy has never been sacked and continues to look at the job, while Al gets retired for his daughter when he is tired of the players. Older couples were really funny and consistent, but they did not talk about going on the scene and discussing them and their fractures for eighteen years. If they work now, they should return to each other to perform one of the oldest sketches for a comedy TV show. Meetings are free for explosive and old questions. The scenario of Neil Simon gives the story a certain corrosive spirit, and a great pair of gags and laughs are Walter Matthu (like the Nomination Academy Academy Award nominee) and George Burns (Won Best Support Actor Oscar Award). Two actors are very convincing and true, and their harmony seems almost realistically intertwined, and seems to be a realist among them. As the story tells, the story is very touchy for all consumer realities and the Love-Heat report, which connects two actors, is a totally realistic part of a strange but at the same time commonly understood. Degree is 7.
