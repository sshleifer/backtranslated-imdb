Something I always liked about the excitement of Robert Ludlum is just a different direction when you think. This movie has a lot of twists and turns, so I have a hard necklace to watch. <br /> <br /> I also love something about the director John Dahl (Again Kill Me, Rounders, Memorable) <br /> <br /> Now, Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT- option. Walsh plays with players and they have a story that will keep you interested if they all play the perfect characters. Dahl seems to bring the nation the best, and it will keep you interested and guided by the end.
