Like women in Salazar's Piedras, women have never seemed charming and miserable. Despite the editor's ability to help with the film and the film, Pedro Almodovar's recent films are intriguing and delightful. 5 different men are fighting with male partners and their families. Starting with a number of different stories, such as SÃ¼bh, Salazar portrays women's characters with the same neurotic and frontier behavior as Almodovar. Kleptomaniac is a cabin driver with a smaller shoe, a disadvantaged daughter, an old drug addict dancer with an old lover, and a caring husband who cares for her husband's marriage mate, well-prepared in all of the streets of Madrid. Using some of Almodov's actresses, the director succeeds in making her first film to deepen all the characters sharing the film and create genuine sincerity for each one of them. Women control the plot line, and men are separated into one, and eventually ... The first movie is surprisingly good and requires some time in the standard. Given that Salazar has been hesitant about some of the guides in the actress, Monica Cervera, who has played on her screen, especially in her previous short film, is shown to be an effective action. <br /> <br /> It is pleasant for Almodovar fans and everyone.
