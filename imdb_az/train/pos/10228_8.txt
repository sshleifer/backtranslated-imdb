Being a giant monster would not necessarily mean that I had not seen Yeti, especially after hearing a lot about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, that is, a cheekless giant monster flicker. As soon as the eti is very quickly, it starts quite quickly and we present it to different symbols. <br /> <br /> Yeti is like a long time ago. <br /> <br /> Yeti is a long-standing, a few treacherous, some and a girl. - The guy who slipped through Woodstock's concert really is, after all, that he is not bad about a friend, especially when he is familiar with the world like something funky cage. Gozzilla is not - notwithstanding his awful awakening, he will not even be saddened (in fact he rarely destroys something in all its forms), but when he tries to understand something, his appearance looks stupid. <br /> <br /> Yeti understood English very well (my version was in English) and she knows who the good guys and the bad guys are. <br /> <br /> But we want to see something of the giant Yeti, the whole movie looks pretty much, and the typical little budget seems to vary in size depending on the scene, and there's only a few shots of "fake feet" standing there. <br /> <br /> Yes, special effects are not the biggest, but there are definitely good ones here. Yeti's outdoors are very good and, in the other, use the windows of the building as a "stair step" - breaks every paw with his legs and shocks those who often enter inside. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" does not believe anything like "APE". In fact, the only time that is approaching true silliness is that the beautiful girl's Yeti's nipples are shaped up, and she raises her brown eyebrows. <br /> <br /> There is something like this in the movie, but it is not surprisingly boring - maybe it's not bad, and it's kinda also a laugh from the audience. <br /> <br /> Yeti may not be in the upper part of a giant monster, but this is definitely better. other King Kong '76 APE-like rip-offs and 'Queen Kong' are too far away.
