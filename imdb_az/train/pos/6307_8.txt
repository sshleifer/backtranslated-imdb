Although he had a relationship with George Klooney, I did not hear about this flick (his company produced and it appeared in a very comic support) and Director of the Ocean Steven Soderberg. Finally, we have chosen it for a discount of $ 4.99 (including Canadian Dollar!). What a great, pleasant surprise. But then I think if you're here, William H. Macy, you're not disappointed. It was very reminiscent of the Ealing comedy from England in the 1950s. Okay, more blasphemy. This is an oddball and sometimes it's a funny movie that splits the intestine. The real heist would cry me so laughing. Perhaps the most enjoyable use of the clothes in film history. Maybe I had many expectations, but I watched and blasted a group of people. The best I've ever had is $ 5.
