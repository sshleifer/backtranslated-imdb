When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I thought I was real. <br /> <br /> When I look at you, I read that you did nothing with fangirls signals. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child Cheese, there are moments of delight, and I was surprised for more than a few days. <br /> <br /> I think it's impossible for Geck Camui to escape a person who is unrecognizable because of his foolishness, but it was generally pleasant. <br /> No, cinema is a genius, but very entertaining, exciting, entertaining choreography, tactile score and a fun game. I know little about the Japanese cinema, but in fact I will not be able to evaluate the actor, but given the fact that language or excessive joke at one point or another, and some of them will almost never work, I <br /> <br / > A good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, watch this movie. Rent for at least part 1. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, there is zero homosexual / homoerotic content in this movie. I did not even see many subtext. Do not let the people you read so much destroy you.
