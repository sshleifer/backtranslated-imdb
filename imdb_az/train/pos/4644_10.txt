<br /> <br /> This flick shows all the clich√©s and then some of it! Extreme bad (Downs Syndrome) actors. Very heavy self-important dialogue. Scenes that need to fall into shock but should be flattened. Editing Jarring. Effective dots. <br /> <br /> Discrepancy and indefinite psyche in the audience are strikingly fraught. <br /> <br /> It specifies the intended ones. The thrilling satir of these grueling movies prepared by those who need help from the swollen young needy show them what their parents have done over the past two years! "What is?" Before taking the Cannes Prize, it became clear that leading Verner Herzogh said that the film is actually part of their movie! Probably flipped the information. So far he has refused to discuss the event. <br /> <br /> In any case, look and laugh, it will have humor classics for many years.
