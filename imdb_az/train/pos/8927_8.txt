Clair Denis, while still living in a narrow world of Nenet and Boni Marseilles, still protecting his family from the uncertainty, in spite of Louis Trebor's investigations, definitely in the The Intruder, us far from the French-Swiss border, half the world, Korea and Tahiti. Again, the film begins with the middle half, struggling with the heart of the patient, with Louis, in the sixties, trying to maintain a high level fitness. We find out that Louis is nothing but violent, because his booth is a place where smuggling and firing occur regularly. He lies with a rifle with a big knife near the pillow near St. Louis. Denis does not hasten to take action, and we have patiently shown Louis's everyday activities and one son, including Sidney (Gr√©goire Colin, a mustache, recognized by long hair) as a "lunatic". There are many short scenes to create an impression on Louis and his surroundings, though unconvincing. Ms. Godard's camera work is fun here. The metaphor of the meteorologist, Lucius, is a heart transplant, and he goes to Korea, then to Tahiti to search for another son and denied him as his new heart denied Sidney's old. In Denis's film, we got used to taking the stage in a short time: Feeding Noniet Boni with a spoon; Boni's father shot an image of a gunshot wound on the driver and then Boni's head; a scene from the Sydney body, which is a transplant scandal in a rooted morgue. The latter two results are a real or imaginary denier by a father who kills something that is not determined by his son.
