When "Beat Street" gave a national look, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" was just a dance scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That's why Beat Street was better. <br /> <br /> The only film that can compete with Beat Street looks like "Footloose," because both movies have drew people to dance to express their feelings. <br /> <br /> The Beat Street came in the middle and at the end of the flick. And I loved it all. Almost all of the breaks sounded on the assembly scenes: jackhammer, flames, head spins, suicide sitting, crazy legs, fatal, forward-looking, figure four - almost everything. /> <br /> Like "The Warriors," Beat Street hip-hop has intense violence in the world ... but less severe than the past. Only Big Battle scene of Beat Street was graffiti artist Ramon (shortened as "Ramo" in the film) when he was being pursued by a rival band in New York City's Underground ..... The third railroad, as well as the electrode on that railroad He dies. <br /> <br /> They will meet their spouse. <br /> <br /> The past scene ended with a catastrophe, although they were better off dead than the blood of a gang of blood. <br /> <br /> Most of the gangs in the gravel were graffiti-related hip-hop culture and rap music. Hip-hop members used rap music to direct the negative aspects of the bell to life, and many rap music came from nakedness. <br /> <br /> Even though it did not respect the hip-hop culture, the thematic song of the film, which covered the curtain, also respected Ramon's death. In the hockey orchestra conducted by actress Rae Dawn Chong, under the name of 'Tango, Tango' in the dance, a female drum, Sheila E., creates a wedge appearance.
