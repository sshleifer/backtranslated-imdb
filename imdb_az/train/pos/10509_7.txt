I have not read the novel, but I understand that this is a bit different; it's not really my genuine truth that I really love, I'm not afraid to read a book. Although he did not read a word from Austen, I can not compare it with any of his works. I can say almost every line in this dialogue is intelligent, virtuous and good, and this is the biggest source of comedy. This laughs loudly for me, with excellent English and oral materials. Each is a place where it operates, and Paltrow is totally a kind of roller coaster. The characters are well-written, reliable, and consistent. I found a few of them very disturbing, and at least some of them thought I was laughing, they tend to recur, and it was not fun as it was for the first time. Editing and cinematography are beautiful and everything looks great. The area and the pacing are great, you are never bored. It really does end in a clear fashion, but this is why the audience predominates. Well, I can not argue that this is not what I was doing, from the very beginning it started and I was watching again. There is a short language in it. I recommend this to anyone interested in romantic stories. 7/10
