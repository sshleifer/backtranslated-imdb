The best black black comedy in some major hygienic films that Baby Jane will watch. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicts who escaped to hid in Hollywood ("Tightening" node). They manage a school for a kid movie tots that hilariously untalented a bunch of people involved in sad scenery moms. Debbie takes tots in their concert at her gorgeous blonde shine ("I Harlow, More Marion Davies", says Winters) and earns a rich father Weaver. It also delights a funny tango and gives it a superior performance, unlike anything previously seen. The atmosphere is a funny and intoxicating blend. Great time looks with details (30). Very nice swipes and terrific film tot in Hollywood. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as a drama trainer: 'Hamilton Starr', he is 'two r, but it's a prophecy'. See it and love it.
