In the past I've seen a lot of PPV but it's the most entertaining, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. DVDs are worthy of the appendix, because they show how wrestlers behave after the show (like Chris Benoit Interview / Out-of-House Interview), some details about Monday night, gold and some promotional speeches. <br /> <br /> 1. Tag Team Table game: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley - Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 It was a pretty good dash game to start the show. He could not save too much and only clean raw physicallity. Spike could save himself on board games, and Guerro and Benoit gave good wrestling skills over the rug. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight championship: Jamie Noble / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 Kidman did not press a shooting star and really did care about the wrestler and did not care. Usually, people are expecting a very high flight in the cruise championship, but it was very small. In fact, it was so bad that when noble hit his finalist, no one even cared and knew (you can say that the camera is not blinking). Last but not least. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy - William Regal 5/10 I like regal like no wrestler, he has no intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but he really played a good counter and added that the match should be accelerated rapidly, but he did not give a chance to show high flying moves. It's perfect for the match, which ended quickly. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena - Chris Jericho 6/10 Cena returns to the first PPV, how it moves, how she was dressed, and how it looks (watching her interview, it's pretty funny). It was a good match with Cena, good holdings, supleks, counters and some weather indicators. Jericho was sub-par, but Cena helped start her career. Cena is winning. 5. WWE Intercontinental Championship: RVD - Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very busy and good match. Both wrestlers' styles were really well-integrated on the screen, with Brok's pure power and raw energy, RVDs were able to achieve full motion and sensitivity. RVD looked good on this match (then better than the outsiders and cena) and the whole game accelerated rapidly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-family: There are no disqualified matches: Booker T v Big Show 7/10 RVD match, but still another match in a good follow-up match Although booker T was always effective (always with a great show), the actor acted in the table and the player was awesome. The end result was a great deal and it made a great move to Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge Christian vs. Lance Storm 5/10 This was a mediocre match. but it is still good for PPV. <br /> <br> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> /> 8. Surely Sha Thousand Thousand Drift Match: 10/10 Rock vs. Undertaker - Wolf Angle. <br /> <br /> Probably easily in the match of the year. This is one of the best triple threat games I've ever seen. There were recent falls, many cups, stolen finishes, raw energy, intensity, and fast temp. No one could predict who would get out of this one. I'll buy this DVD, and I would buy it for sure. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a PPV with many extra goodness to watch over and over again. Although this is difficult, I have to pay for this DVD just to pay for it.
