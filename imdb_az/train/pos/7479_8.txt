"Sweet is never sweet, no matter what." This price is mainly for my film in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who gives everything in his life. He takes everything into account and this is exactly the same in this great film with a perfect twist. <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> <div style = "text-align: justify ; "> You can not evaluate better things in life unless you see as bad as in love. <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the film is too tight and really hard to understand. I think the last is perfect. I recommend watching it and seeing yourself.
