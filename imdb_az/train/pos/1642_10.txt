I did not see the first released film, but it was memorable. Performance by Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell was excellent, photography was an excellent, moving storyline, and everything about it was the highest standard. But they have not been forgotten. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the UK is not a single market, but I did not see the movie in a sad TV or video. <br /> <br /> If you see a very good historical drama in the United States, have you signed up for more success? <br /> <br /> I always think 50% of a good movie is music. theme theme was simple, but moving clarinet solo was "our friend in Jesus." The film then continued to deny it! Am I right or wrong?
