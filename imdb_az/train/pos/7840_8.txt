BOOGIE BOÄžAZI was a fusion movie for nearly thirty years, but I saw the movie a few days ago and ranked among the best rock films of all time; music (T. Rex cream) and visuals are always exciting and unusual. Ringo Starr, who has done a good job here, has left this watcher following the past leadership efforts. If you love music, Marc Bolan will be on the T. Rextasy because he is really a fabric, a front, and a star of the center. Some of the recurring songs, such as different places, costumes, musical arrangements and strange visual concepts are different tissues and are used to give a very happy humor 'is a concert movie on the other hand. Since it's full of rich and full BOOGIE, there's only one full-featured movie that lasts about an hour. There is only one criticism - the video packages say something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claimed that the movie was 67 minutes, but it would take 61 minutes to appear.
