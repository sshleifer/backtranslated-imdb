<br /> <br /> I saw Big Bad Swim at the Temecula Film Festival in 2006, and I had a considerable amount of protection. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a group of adults around the life of a class for swimming for various reasons. <br /> <br /> How real was the truth that surprised me about this movie. Rarely, the ensemble pieces are well-designed. I liked scenes in the classroom and the drama abroad was tough. Nothing has gone beyond the ground or character, and ultimately left a very strong feeling of joining a school or summer camp - when you quickly find friends, build strong bonds and discover discoveries about yourself, you have to leave very soon <br /> < My only complaint was that Paula was a very powerful and unusual application of the character that asked you to talk about a little bit more about it. I think you do not go to classroom with anyone, though ... <br /> Besides, I found the film very good and very comfortable. See if you get the opportunity.
