Fraidy Cat, the fourth of these cartoons, is a good thing. At least I love it, so I'm surprised that it gets mixed visions. <br /> <br /> Although the moments of comedy, this is more than a comic story. The atmosphere is dark and insulting. Thirst is another powerful element. <br /> <br /> In a short time, Tom is listening to a creepy radio show at night and is totally horrified, because it's something about ghosts. Tom Tom was afraid of his death, Jerry watched everything and could not help, but laughs all the time. In fact, Jerry often finds her to be more tortured. With the help of white shirt and vacuum cleaner, he creates a great "dream". <br /> <br /> Tom experiences terrible experience. Jerry is capable of being funny, even though Tomu scares without a good reason. Additionally, there is no violence here because it is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest animated films. <br /> <br /> Tom will not lose his last life. <br /> <br /> Finally, when Tom tells Jerry that Jerry's plan is and Jerry says he is a clever, Jerry is "hand-held in a lizard" (deserves to be discovered). However, Tom shows incredible patience before reacting. She stares at Jerry in an angry moment. Smile, Jerry invites Tom to laugh with her and Tom takes about half an hour to figure out a very serious face. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a different, surprising and noteworthy experience of Tom and Jerry.
