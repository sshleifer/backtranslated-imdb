I thought the Grinch Stool was a pretty good movie. It was not terrible, nor was it great, but it was nice to watch. Jim Carrey felt like a little annoying. a special educator, all the things he needed were bad and ugly, but still he had retarded some sort of thing. I thought in the Grinch's cave, not the decor, and I thought it was part of the laugh but in most cases it was just annoying. If this film changed the identity of Grinch, it could have been more "SO" and they had more laughing scenes because most humorous things were not funny. I liked how Grinchin surprised Christmas, but it's not exciting to see.
