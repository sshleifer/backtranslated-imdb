I saw this morning at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City. <br /> <br /> In this film, the level of user satisfaction is basically based on the acceptance level of Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> Along with this, he is well-prepared, well-behaved and beautiful. If you come to Salt Lake City, you need to see Legacy Theater. I have never been to a beautiful theater, like picture quality, sound quality and ambiance in all my life ... It is surprising that the church will allow Batman to watch! I'm a LDS and I think that Joseph is a prophet, I've touched a few places and you've been touched several times ... I think you're waiting for the tissue before the movie starts! Anyway, they tell me that this movie is available in more than 70 LDS Hospitality Centers in the world, if you have 70 minutes or if you have to believe in Joseph or not, then tell an interesting story.
