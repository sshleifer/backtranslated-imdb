This movie is one of the best psychological excuses I have ever seen, such as a budget that is low. If you acknowledge that your budget is budgeted, you can evaluate how well a story is, how well the script is written and how much money it can produce. <Br /> All the elements of the big movie are here. The visions were digital, but the places were beautiful. The strange, sleepless part of the movie was especially well-kept on the stage with the talking dog, the scene was just beautiful. This is a trippy piece of work, but it is not done in an ambitious way, and I respect this film because of it. This is a unique and charming looking thing and recommends for everyone who is very different from the recurring movies that are there.
