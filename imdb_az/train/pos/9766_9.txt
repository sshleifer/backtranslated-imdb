Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy FILM about the dolls coming from the time when people are not around. In this adventure we have to get rid of a kidnapped French puppet named Babette, captain of the bandits. While traveling on their way, they are traveling Deep Dark Woods, Taffy Pit, and even the Looney Land. Will his new wife's assistant Red Knees and Deva slow down with heroes of her comrades who can help them? How to get rid of the king of Kookoo and his chaos! What does Marcella say when he sees his 7-year old doll with other toys? <br /> <br /> Not all the interesting results are possible: Story: 8 - Very cute. The puppets who came to life when the master was not around. Just because they go to different places, they will only be able to do something in a dream world. It's great to meet new symbols, find new friends by going to different places. Do the heroes work so well and do not like pirates? Actor: 8 - Each character is compatible with its own voice. Especially Marlon Brando taffy pit enemy, The Greed. The French puppet has a very strange French accent, wicked Hitler-esquire King Kookoo (Simpson Sideshow Bob has a similar hair) plays very well in his role, and the old black male voice of sadness works perfectly. Why was old animation better than new ones? Music: 10 - There is nothing perfect here. Songs have been around for years and I look back in about 20 years, remember each of them and now know exactly where these melodies are. <br /> Qafqaz> How long have we walked by Raggedy? Many events only follow each other and there is no information about other puppets and toys as you have never seen in the real world of the film, but it follows a number of ways, and as a result <br /> <br /> <br /> < strong> A number of issues were discussed to attend the conference held at Qafqaz University. </ strong> <br /> <br /> How much will I try? Mainly scary parts. Probably, the older films were so much cheerful about the animation of today, but this is a freaking factor. <br /> <br /> There are some good cartoons outside the South Caucasus movie and some Disney movies, or something that is not so rare. <br /> <br /> 8- Its classic. It is desirable to get a good copy, but the VHS copies are probably now. The DVD version is always sold on Ebay and will definitely be something you'll watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If anything happens to the "Nostalgia Goal" <br /> <br /> The total price (not average) : It is a beautiful piece of music produced in the late 8th and early 70s. His symbols are unique and the songs are great. In a magnificent way, you can regain your time and time again. Put your favorite pet today! Reviewer's Insight (Including Approach): This is not like the Raggedy Ann TV series ten years later. It was a darker and real world. The effect appears to be more than 70, especially as many other cartoon-animated cartoons, other than Yellow Submarine. Nevertheless, I remember that I will never forget and still can affect this day. It's not easy to find, but it'll be a treasure to keep my DVDs and videos alive forever.
