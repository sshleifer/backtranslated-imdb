Why does this novel have another movie version because I'm somewhere? While watching the film, I have seen this movie again and find it difficult to find a change in the movie - the little boy in the novel has no appearance and the end has been changed. They kill him in the film, but for all these years, Eel was afraid of the events in the Marsh House, but he remarried and eventually put the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is more sympathetic in the novel, and Kipps is shot in the movie scene and the constant appearance of a toy soldier to express the child's existence is really creepy but meaningless - Kipps is abused by a woman who wants revenge rather than a child. I'm sure that I've seen a novel and a really good and close-up movie really scary. Did I just imagine it?
