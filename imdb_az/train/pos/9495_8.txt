Superbly trashy and miraculous 80's exploits, hooray! The previously opened sequences give us a wrong impression of a serious and modest drama, but you do not need to be afraid, but ten minutes later, we get up in our mouthless chain battles, rough punches, lurid dialogues and illegal nudity! Bo and Ingrid are two orphan brothers with unusual close-ups and even slightly corrupt connections. Can you imagine your sister encrypting the naked body of your sister's naked body and looking at her turtle gender for several minutes? Here is Bo, who succeeded her and talked about her dubbed laughter, she never cried. Patient, dude! In any case, the children ran away with their parents from Russia, but bad soldiers brutally killed their mother and father. A friend smuggler was detained on them and even handed Bo and Ingrid to expert traffickers. The genuine plot is 20 years after the mythical and incredibly precious White Horse diamonds are accidentally looking at their main target, as found in a mine. Only a small part of life can give the meaning of the White Horse as a plot and narrative structure, but it is a lot of fun to watch. I do not know who for whom and for what reason (and I understand the actors less) but no matter what! Violence is awesome grotesque and every sphere is a delight. Scenario suddenly goes beyond repair? Why can not I disclose it? For Bo Ingrid and Fred Williamson, the mouthpiece and black fingers on the local prostitutes who need to be swapped into the scene with a big cigar. Bo's main opponent is a large breasted Italian chick, but a fluid highlight, plays at least ten times in the movie, but the song of an unhappy but attractive subject is the compulsory assembly we are in "disappointment" and other burdens! God, how brilliant it is. The true French name converts herself into "life to live", which is unique, as it is as meaningful as the rest of the film: Yes!
