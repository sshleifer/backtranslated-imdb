A beautiful documentary filled with beautiful pictures and a great story in the race. IMAX Cameras provide you with a very broad perspective as the DVD movie is perfect. Every speaker who works almost every time you hear, the movie does not accelerate, and only gives 230mph a natural feeling. Of course, there are some sound effects, but I think I'm good, they give depth to driving scenes ...
