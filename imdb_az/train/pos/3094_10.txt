The best and most original show in these years. I watch more, I fell in love with her. Casting is great, writing is great. Personally as each character. Everyone has a lovely character because there is a good mix of personalities and funds, as in real life. ABC has refused to give writers, actors and potential audience a chance to cancel it so quickly and not to advertise enough and to achieve the following. Most television is terrific, so there's so much to watch over. In my opinion this show was my favorite of My Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Brothers. In fact, I think that for the siblings and sisters the same audience will love this show even if they know it. Why is it that every time you lose, it's time to earn so much time and show that you have a great potential that you always have to throw away the show? I'm talking about the truth, I do not watch one of them. It was very strange to have a new idea for the show, and then to hire the perfect actors, this show has promised a lot. The last episode was the best, everyone really got into their parts and the show really started to do. Please watch this show on ABC's video and let ABC want to take this show back.
