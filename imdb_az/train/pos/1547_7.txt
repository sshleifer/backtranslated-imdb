Like anyone else, who commented on this movie, I just can not help wondering why this video does not appear. <br /> <br /> I remember remembering that I was in the "Ship Show" since 1972 at age 12. I remember the toxic gas attack and the weird horses. (I do not remember the horrible bits I mentioned here, they could be restricted to television viewers). But the scenes I really liked were those that HMS was related to the death of Lord Kitchener in Hampshire almost 90 years ago. <br /> <br /> I remember that the scenes of the convicted cruiser approaching the fertilizer area in the storm really wounded. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the music account, but the comments of others are interesting to me. Get a video from this video!
