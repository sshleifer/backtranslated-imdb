For the first time he saw this movie while drunk in a motel in Canada. The sailing through the canals came to Easy Lube. My boyfriend kidnapped, but I told him to go back. There was nothing wrong with his name. The rest of the film was followed by cursing. He left some credits and looked at the house. Chevy Chase's first film. I did not remember her. I did not remember this much, so I rented it and gave it to a second blanket. Very funny and very graphic. It's not funny, just like Kentucky Fried Movie. I love fingers, easy algae. Dealer's steering wheel is pretty cool. I'll give it 6.5 or 7
