This chic move has been released about 5 years since flick.I released. This movie was watched about 10 times and was a great effort by Gautham. In my perspective, this movie is virtually impeccable. Surya, like ACP Anbuchelvan, surely played a very good role as Michael Ciotika Maya. Cartoon is very good. The character of the cinema was Pandia. Jevan Pandia has played a very good role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style "Gautham" Harris Jayaraj BGM is all chart-busters when adapting the film very well. RD Rajasekhar is rich in cinematography. Peter Hein stunts choreographed well.Anthony's editing is accurate. Above all, Kaakha Kaakha is the right dose of action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood films can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... undoubtedly.
