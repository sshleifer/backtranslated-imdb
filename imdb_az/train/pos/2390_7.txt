My 2 year-old loves the show Doodlebops, and he keeps watching for a while. The characters are lively and interesting with the main colors and everyone. There are not many educational content that can benefit from the target audience, but they have a show on every subject and I like it because they are trying to teach children about sharing, respect and other. It is well-produced with high production values. But this is really a showdown on TV on most of these days. We are not involved in trade, and our son is wearing Dooblebop everything. If I came to any city, I do not think we would spend money to go to a live show. Going to the Zoos or Science Center is a great experience for everyone, and in my opinion, more money is spent.
