I saw it at Mill Valley Film Festival. It's hard to believe, Mrs Blom's debut, a beautiful pace and sounds. A great hero hero, Anne Tyler, had come out of the novel, which is worthy of the back story and the potential future, no flimsy notes, strange occurrences between uncertain worries and problems on earth are not quite realistic. When you see the "best of the youth", you will know how the characters are drawn through small moments, as the story is tense. I hope it's spreading in the United States. I live in a very sophisticated movie market, but I get rarely any Swedish movies.
