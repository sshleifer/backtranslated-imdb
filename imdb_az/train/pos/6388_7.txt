What I Know About Atlantis Before Watching: <br /> <br /> - Disney's first official animated film, fantastic adventure. <br /> <br /> * - The preview looked very damn damn cool. (I like nitpick), but I'm not sure it was interesting for the first time I was interested. <br /> <br /> As you can see, Disney said "Stop" and "Spy Kids" will be re-released. <br /> <br /> What do you say about this movie? <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am a charming attractive musician for fantasy, all CGI shots are shot, so the animator has almost the impression. <br /> <br /> In some cases, those who are indecisive (probably not the ship's health director), and the plot is a bit boring , but this is not a movie watching for art. <br /> The controversy surrounding me is that the film's "failures" ("just" counted as five hundred million or something) is compared to the popularity of Shrek, See "Monsters Inc." as evidence for the traditional animation death I do not think that's right. "How do you think" South Park "is about" Final Fantasy "? Indeed, story and craft is not a method, but everything. I do not know what Disney's return film will be, but I still do not think it's a picture.
