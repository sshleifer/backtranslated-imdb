This movie is hard to get your hands on in the United States. I found a rare video dealer, and of course it was worth it. Without a doubt, the best film is the best movie of the 1930s during the Codex period. Master filmmaker Frank Borzage made beautiful films about depression and created a fairy desk between MAN'S CASTLE and the challenges of the era. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful chemistry between Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy, and they help make this movie a beautiful romantic. Young Trina is sweet and hopeful, Tracy Bill is closed and closed. Dynamics amongst the character creates the most difficult, but at the end of the film creates rewarding relationships. <br /> <br /> MAN TEXT is the softest pre-coded movie I've ever seen. Borzage uses a charming and dreaming technique to transform the village of Bill and Trinini, a villa in a palace. The difficulties of depression can never be seen, in fact they are not part of the film. But Borzage's movie seems to be less tough, as the mastery of a fairy tale tale, the love between the characters. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Only if more and more people would see it.
