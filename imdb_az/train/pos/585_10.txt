Once again, this time I've been watching this movie since then, this time I was superior to my preference. Imagine being beautiful. The characters are very precise. Brad Pitt is just as superior to the son of a rebel. Other actresses and actresses are equally beautiful in all respects. Robert Redford creates a beautiful epoch of the 1920s speakeasies. This d√©cor is an extremely beautiful view of the western Montana mountains and streams. <br /> <br /> You need to see this movie! <br /> <br />
