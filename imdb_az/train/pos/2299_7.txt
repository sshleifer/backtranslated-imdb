Who said the horror educational film genre? Thanks to this magnificent Hammer short film, at least in my house, I never knew to offer a salty bread in my own home with a strange visitor and a salt bread, because he could be a hypnotist, and that combination would give him my thoughts and forever! Thank you Hammer! I was looking forward to the 10th episode of the Heroic series, mostly for the guy who was in the director's seat, Don Sharp; He was one of the best filmmakers in the UK, but he is still sad. Sharp was responsible for some of the coolest Hammer films like "The Vampire Kiss" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" and responsible for a series of unreasonably independent production such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania." The contributions to the Horror House are easily the best of the series, an intricate but interesting plot character, and full of unpleasant hidden topics. It relates to two ancient dealers who run on a strange object similar to a rear mirror, but an ancient carving device that can actually be used to call Choronzhon; the devil guardian of the cliff. The mirror is desperately demanded by a devout devout, because they need their rituals, but Michael does not want to sell it before knowing the true value of the device. Michael's secret conspiracy deepened when he chose a clear-angry daughter fleeing from the pious to avoid being sacrificed. Devil's cults and good-luck victims of young women are typical of English fears, but David Fischer's scenario is never fun and presents very neat tips between highly inventive peaks. Unfortunately, there is tension to surprise, dialogues are clever and actor performances (especially John Karson is really heartfelt as a leader of the cult). Recommended!
