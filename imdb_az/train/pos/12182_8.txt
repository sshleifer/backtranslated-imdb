I did not make any research on the film before the first look because it was part of a recently purchased Welles box. I basically bought a box set because I wanted to have A Mana for All Seasons and wanted Waterloo to be re-evaluated. So, the player remains Orson and Rita, and I treat class and confusion equally. <br /> <br /> The story on the surface seemed a simple thing, a man gets acquainted with a beautiful woman and keeps him from a couple <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the secret of murdered devil and very shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) does not know what he really is, he is just as confused as a spectator, and it's nice to watch as everyone is filming. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The beauty, <br /> <br /> Very nice things in the movie, Welles has a visual style, look at a scene in a beautiful aquarium, and the sequence of ending in a fun home is remarkable. The story from O'Hara is a mysterious mood, and we have substantially illuminated good light relief processes by court case with Everett Sloane. However, the film is a strangeness, and in fact, it's a strange look, because} studio bosses cut the film for about an hour, and that's not just a disappointment to the viewer, but the injustice of Welles's vision. Tho, we have a very good and interesting movie, but it's a divine movie that just gives me a great deal, but I'm glad to see it again. 8.5 / 10
