The next episode of Star Trek's third season is a feature of the excellent and extremely maligned final season. In fact, Spock, McCoy and Kirk conveyed a massive library presence to Sarpeidon and the entire population of the planet, except Atos Ato, a mass librarian. All 3 Trek characters will soon ride into a traveling car at random at different times in Sarpeidon's past. Spock gives a persuasive performance like the Ice Age Vulcan, which is lover of Zarabeth, Kirk rebuffed his unhappiness with his time travel - "city of witchcraft" - when he was detained and arrested before his arrest - see Sarpido in the current period behind the door. Finally, all 3 Trek symbols are stored in Sarpeidon a few minutes after the Supernova passes through the star of the Beta Niobe star. <br /> <br /> <strong> Economy> William Shatner In his book, Star Trek Memories, we note that this show, after considering Leonard Nimoy's no reason, provided some controversy is the source of Spettin in the Lisettein script because of its emotional behavior. Nimoy directly sacrificed his direct sacrifices to Fred Freiberger, the executive producer of the show, not thinking of being in love with Vulcans. Nevertheless, Freiberger argued that the ice age setting allowed the Spokesman to feel emotionally frustrated because the Volcanoes were still not completely converted to the present-day state. This was a good evolution example of Freiberger's fragmentary fragmentation to maintain a medium-level script for this particular episode. Shatner notes that the lower quality of the script for the third season, while playing Spokes on the Eden Road with the Hippies, sometimes reminds you that it was hurt by mastery as it was forced to cling to Spoogo Plato, it was more convincing here . Spock, acting here, was perfectly as Freiberger appealed to Shatner. (p.272) Only open space hole, after spending thousands of years ahead of Spock and McCoy, McCoy should become a more primitive human rather than the Spokespan. However, this is a guilty mistake, taking into account the 3 episodes of the season, the striking Spock / McCoy performance, and the specificity of this script. Who could imagine that Sarpeido's present-day travelers would escape the destiny of the convicted planet? This, of course, is what we expect from the Classical Trek in the best way - a truly inspired story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In Memories, in the 'Memories', some of the best "unusual and high-quality demonstrations of the season" include "Enterprise Incident", "Mushroom Day", "Beauty in Truth", "Tholian Web" Sacrifice and Paradise Syndrome will be. (p.273) My personal thoughts, "Children Sacrifice" is a very difficult episode, and "All Our Uses" are certainly the top three season star list Trek TOS films. I'll give 10 to 9 for 'All Half Days'.
