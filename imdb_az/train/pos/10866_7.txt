Johnnie To's SELECTION has some wonderful music from these Asian mobsters, who have a kaleidoscope and solemn style writing or a sacred thing in the design of opening credit and beautiful opening credits; In fact, the whole flick made a good goal. I found Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and wanted to see the film very much. The SELECTION I started is exciting and interesting and is currently moderately intense in terms of standards; moderate and substantially severe; an Asian canvas planning story, elements of a puzzles game, fierce facts from mobsters' life, race for cunning, realistic details and Coppola as well as some of our morale glamorized mobsters are right and beautiful and likable. <br /> POLICY, in a good way, does not care about Hong Kong passengers. bitter, painful, straight, and scaring children.
