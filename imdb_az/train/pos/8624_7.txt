What is the best way to review a movie like Der Todesking? <br /> <br /> I just came to watch this movie and they started saying that the pictures were still burned to my brain and I do not think they will move anytime soon. <br /> <br /> Probably, it would be fair to say that you have a good idea if you have access to this page. If not, this is not the average budget budgets that have been abolished in "Darkness" for a number of years, nor is the low budget, schlocky, "fun" B-movie. What is the low budget art that is presented in a simple, but harsh way. This idea is a simple one - seven story, returning around and ending interspersed suicidal with images of a destroyed body. Is it simple, even dull? It is not. The words can not really describe how powerful this film is, as it is more than half; <br /> <br /> I can talk about technical improvements and shortcomings in this direction; maybe the scenes are striking the obvious super-8 cameras and occasionally shaking. <br /> <br /> We can show that several sound effects do not depend on each other to compete with Fulcine, but at the end of the day all these are unimportant. I've seen increasingly difficult things like extreme movies, and Der Todesking still considered me to be a "free", though many people were in control, in particular protecting and having lots of scenes. In fact, the most troubling scene I found was the final tale. I will not destroy it, simply the character of the character emerges from the screen and gives you sympathy for the failure. Of course, this is not the best movie, and in many places it seems raw and maybe a little amateur, but despite these conflicts, Der Todesking is an experience, a charming movie. It's not what you are looking for, if you are a person who is comfortable watching or who loves "beautiful" movies or simply does not want something tough and meaningless to something. <br /> <br /> Whether you like it or not, you will not forget the hurry.
