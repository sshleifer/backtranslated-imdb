Although the style of this film was like a simple version, it is still a very good film, though it is more accurate and realistic. In fact, the best picture on the first day was nominated for Oscar (Return to WINGS) and was regarded as the best film of the day. <br /> <br /> I think WINGS is a premier movie, but it is good, even though it is overlapped by Emil Jannings, a little bit direct. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general general of Tsarist Russia living in the last days of the 1920s, adding a few dollars to Hollywood. It seems that the success of the Empire for the Russian general who fought against the Communists during the Revolution has changed as it turned into a casting call. Of course, this is not a moving fleet, but the old man also begins to think about the old days and the revolution <br /> What happens straight away? This is a pretty good movie - especially at the end. By the way, seek William Powell as a Russian director. Despite being set up in 1928, most of her subsequent films with makeup do not look younger.
