*! - CLAIMS - !! <br /> <br /> Before I start this, I also have the "authorized version" of this movie on the big screen, <br /> <br /> Both of these advantages overestimated the "The Shining" version. <br /> <br /> Also, let Stanley Kubrick be retelling this story, and read Mr. King's book The Shining for many years over the years and read a book and a very big screen. and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to deliver movie psychic terror. In the direction of the film and the script, he himself got Magus for the question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The film world lost its great director when he died in 1999. Other unusual loans include: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and more. <br /> <br /> The Torrences (Jack, Wendy, his wife and Danny, son) live in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack was hired as a guard. It is his job to control the storage of the hotel in a few months of hard snow, although Spring is reopening its doors. <br /> <br /> There are many rich and miserable tourists going to the Colorado Mountains for a summer run. <br /> <br /> The hotel was a beautiful architecture and preparation. The darkness, at the same time, has given the atmosphere of "self" to the atmosphere. Furnitures and furniture were all epoch (late 70s - 80s) and landscape filmography is approaching the hotel on the opening scene. <br /> <br /> The presentation of Vendy and Danny's characters is a hit, because it's a genius, as well as providing an approach to repression. Danny's "imaginary friend" Tony, you got all the story of his past, and Jack's story of alcoholism has entered this beautiful, neat entrance area. There is no need to extend the film's history over two hours; <br /> <br /> <strong> I've seen since Kubrick's beginning. <br /> <br /> Closing day. <br /> <br /> The mountaintop of the hotel (this time with his family) is a mutually unpleasant thing between his native driver Jack and Danny. <br /> <br /> The look is breathtaking, and even if the "staff" activates everything, you'll be able to see spectacular fireplaces, high cathedral ceilings and expensive furniture, homeowners and architectural examples. "They have done a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even "staff wing" is well-prepared and beautifully structured. <br /> <br /> The maze was a spectacular touch reminiscent of the Labyrinth where Crete was the Guardian of Minotaurus. When Jack Nicholson stands in the maze of the maze and looks at the center, it's a magic moment when Wendy and Danny are being seen; Immediately tells you that he has heavy energy at home; There is something wrong with it, it is already beginning. "If it were not for at least an hour to find my way, I would not want to go there." (Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was real and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. Believe that you really are at the hotel, you are touring Wendy with "Kitchen" and "Doc". The explanation of Danyne's "glow" was surrendered very well, as Tony talked to the child about the hotel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> much for the film's atmosphere. It also points to the 'half-hell' point of view, so to speak; turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duvallin mastered Wendy Torrence's description. Before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What's the Olive Oyl! * Lol *" (Popeye was released), but it really shows its rich diversity! It was brilliant after returning from the film's beginning. That Fiend says it's the best performance ever to date (Steve Martine's "Roxanne", despite my love for it in 1987) br /> <br /> Once you see Kubrick after pearl bit information, Tomer's past, Danny's broken weapon, Tony, Hotel's Danny <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Former guard Delbert Grady (Danny's girlfriends, family-run hotels in Tony's home before leaving her family) were Danny's identical symbols and at the same time frightened. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's Toni was written as a servant spirit, just as a spiritual guide. Danny showed how and where he was killed in a very graphic and material way. As a result of his arm, his body was abandoned by his father. He was a "little boy living in my mouth." At the end of Danny's finger, he would speak physically and speak to Danny and Danny. As in the book, I am aware that Tony was intended to be a projection of Danny as an old child for Stephen's king to rescue his father. Kubrick dropped this small twist, and Tony was afraid somehow, "Danny ... is over." <br /> <br /> Danny's idea of ​​returning herself to a minor self is not scary. <br /> <br /> Like a young woman and Billie Gibson (who seems to have suffered from credit deficits for previous or previous works) on the "Shower Woman" scene (I can not find any other credit about), by Lia Beldan, or because it was doing something that was charming and disgusting. It was dramatic and frightening. Terrible and scary. Nicholson looks at the mirror and sees the rotten flesh beneath his hand. <br /> <br /> There is something to confront with his wife. The degradation of his character is carefully documented by Kubrick. An instant friendship with Jack Lloyd Bartender (only those with alcoholic beverages, mentally ill and addicted to drugs) describes the needs of the atmosphere used by Lloyd; that is alcohol ... ... the dog's hair has finished me. (Jack Torrence) In the case of Jackin, it's free for burbon on Jack, Jack. "Home orders." <br /> <br /> Wendy's Jack's "scenario" is more than 8 or 9 different creative styles, but it's more than a rewritten page. .. When asking shades, "How do you like it?" and Wendy screams and shouts with baseball ball in his hands ... very surprising. The point where he understood the whole situation ... How bad is Jack's. It provides a very scary, dramatic and powerful presence. Danny's stage with the hotel lobby, along with Jack and Wendy, is the scene of the most powerful scene in the film. <br /> <br /> REDRUM scene. Amazing! Wow. What do you say? What mother would not be happy to wake up to talk with this strange little voice by repeating "REDRUM" while meeting her young, challenging child with a big knife? Even though he did not make any sense, HELL would be scary as well as the seventh level. It was something that everyone (and) remembered. Speaking of unforgettable scenes ... <br /> <br /> The latest attack on Nicholson's little family was perhaps one of the most horrific scenes in film history. His line, "Heeeeere's Johnny!" was a shimmer and one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Kubrick's end was perfect. I understood it well. No glow, no embarrassment, a bit of a foolish end to this movie. Just epitomized perfection. <br /> <br /> This is all I will say about the last topic. <br /> <br /> Who is looking for someone who has produced it? Check out Kubrick's putting the PL. Hire, See, USE. This is a classic and a good cause in the horror genre. IT RAWKS! <br /> Me Me * ... Take this movie, give it to Stephen King's collection and take the King's 1997 "Empowered" version and kiddie division. This is true. .: This movie is comparable to Fiend 9.98.
