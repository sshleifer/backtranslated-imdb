This holiday in Canada, based on Capote's book of 1959, was a black and white film of Brooks and Cinema Hall. Blake and Wilson have a good performance like the killings and Forsythe, a police officer who followed them. The scenes leading to the murder have been pretty dense and cold with a soundtrack of the noisy winds in the real home where the murder occurred. Brooks focuses on many verve and uses several interesting links between scenes. The only complaint is a little lurking, a lie is drifting and promises a little.
