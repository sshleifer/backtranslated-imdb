This is my favorite movie EVER. I have watched it at least 10 times, and every time I cried. My family does not want me to wait, so I'm crying. I love that is a true story written by Antwone, so I love the movie. The player is top notch and perfect for the role of actors. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But my favorite movie I've ever done. I also took care of a boy who was born in prison. He was the most valuable little boy I met. He has been accepted by a beautiful family for two years now. While the war was still on, I saw this movie and did not rely on the future, and I am so happy and glad. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that Antwone was happy and found her family. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about him. I can not say enough good things about it!
