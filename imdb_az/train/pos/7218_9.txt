Deaththrap works as a game in a movie, knows who to do, because it is primarily in a set. A star-bearing writer receives a magnificent manuscript from an ex-pupil and plans to fit in with his prodigy and plan for his spouse's (loud) objections. Or you think so for the first half of the movie. After half a point, Deatthrap begins to capture all the surprises and surprises that protect his head from beginning to head, then to the right and then shaking his head. This is a great mystery film that has been drowned in that mind. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a great playwright, plays himself in this film - a little flattering and a very dramatic Brit. There is no surprise here - he does the usual good work. He takes the best line of Deaththrap, perfectly executed: "What is your definition of success, there are crowds in the state prison?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Christopher Reeve brings drama dramatically comedies and drama to an ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. She also begins to show a large number of skins that she should be able to get out of the Superman films. Kain and Reeve co-operate in a movie other than my favorite comedies - Noises Off. At the same time it turns around a game, though this time Caine is the director and the actor of Reeve. The comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers) joined them. Together, they demonstrate disaster in bedding and the crew of the game. On the surface, the film is sloppy, but after looking it out, there are many subtle jokes that require multiple tracking to capture. I want this movie to be on DVD in any movie.
