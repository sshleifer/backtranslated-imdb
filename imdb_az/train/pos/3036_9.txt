The name just says it all. I watched this movie with my dad and, while working in Korea, he made a great impression on the human being. The disappointment of this film is that it only focuses on a short period of human life - it is interesting that all of human life has created this epic bio-pic, and it is surprising to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The subject of the film "Duty, Honor, My Country" is not so much the words of the high-ranking officer's lips, but the deepest expression of all the devotion of one man to his country. <br /> <br /> In the long run, Peck has gained a better understanding of human beings because of being liberal. He does a great job of showing the fearless generals who are tough with humanity.
