You have to take what I want to tell you. I've seen many films and reviewed most of them. You may want to listen to me when I say that I have a funniest scene I've seen in this movie. There is an overwhelming majority of thoughts on how funny this unusual stupid movie is. And good for those who do not, and I can not blame them much. The scene I talked with comes with a 30-minute hint, and John Sandy is a trapped conqueror. Up to this point, the movie was moody, confusing, and I was beginning to lose. When it came to the scene, I laughed very much and made my pants. No movie has done anything to me before. When the project started, "Berserke Git" should have been a SCTV film. I remember telling you that. Over time, the iron was sent to John Candy, Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy. Having been released in approximately ZERO theaters after being released, Universal had to have a regime change. While watching this for the second time, I listened to the lyrics (in fact, it proves how incomprehensible the evidence), relaxed logic, and learned what was happening. Apart from the jury, Berserk Going has many other hilarious scenes to offer it. This is almost 3 Stooges flick, except for the very funnier. Director David Steinberg has a sharp time and laughs all this. When it comes to Candy, which is mainly responsible for it, she never enjoyed it. With all the plot devices and scenes that are thrown out of the window, he runs wild. Flaherty and Levy look desperate to him. There is a plot, but there is a trick like "Animal House" and yes, the script will be irregular and start a little slower. Once you know this, you can evaluate the precision of transpiration in complete SCTV style. Stupidity, but it's a reasonable fool, and we should remember when we see it. See it and discover it yourself if it has the most fun scene of all time.
