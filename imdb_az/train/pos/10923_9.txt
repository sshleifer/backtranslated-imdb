This movie is really good. The structure of the puzzle forces viewer to think and predict will be what happens next. Such a trick brings many surprises and is really a spectator waiting for a puzzle to be settled. The scenes fight is very good. There are different combat styles (although one of the styles is somewhat unusual for me, but my opinion) and there is an interesting show. The only thing that can be controlled is by looking at actors. A little too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies in the 70s and 80s, so the "five Venom" (or other versions) is a great choice.
