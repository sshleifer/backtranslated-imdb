EARTH is a must for children and adults. My son enjoyed watching all these strange birds and ice-bearers. We can learn a lot from this movie and should be proud of the great treasure on earth. Some animals are endangered. Indeed, this problem should not hinder all the authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many exceptional pictures that I have not seen before. Then it is accompanied by a heavenly music. The director did a great job of gaining great respect. Nothing can stop you from giving EARTH the highest rate of my and your family. I hope things will be created later.
