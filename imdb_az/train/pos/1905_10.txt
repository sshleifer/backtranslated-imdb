Very simply the most funny and most brilliant movie-comedy of all time ... of course, on my personal list. This has a solid ten-point scale. The millionth heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged 'child' who refuses to accept the old way of life and moves away from all responsibility. She also refused to leave the bottle. One day she and her personal workman Hobson (Gielgud) are shopping at a Bergdorf Gudman store and include small cops, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Lindane's chemistry give the rest of the power. Hilarious set pieces are aplenty. At such a stage Arthur (the drunken part of the story) knocks out the wrong circle door and announces threats from a human siren ("My husband has a weapon!") Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's lover, his dear grandfather, Sir John Gielgud, -isms (He took Oscar home) and Christopher Cross presents the main song (Oscar Prize "Best Watch") Dudley Moore died last month (March 2002).
