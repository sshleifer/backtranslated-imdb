Robert Roy MacGregoru "Rob Roy" has never heard before, but it's worth seeing the movie. Liam Neeson, who plays the title character, brings the same spirit to Oscar Schindler and Jessica Lange is doing a really good job as his wife, Mary. <br /> <br /> Generally this is good as "Braveheart" (perhaps better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood produces two returning movies in the UK. Very Good. Both John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Fleming play roles.
