This is the best TV show of the 70s, the cycle. There is Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and Simpsons in my book. <br /> <br /> Two major heroes, Eric and Afghanistan, are closer to each other than Donna, two young men sitting next to each other. They sit close together for most of their lives and start to feel more and more at the beginning of the first season. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <strong> Red He was in service, pushing Erici around. Kitty is just the opposite. Although he is very busy, Erica and her friends care about him. Bob, their neighbor is obviously Donna's Father. Bob giggles around with many different women related to the story of the show. Bob is also concerned about the Reds exactly. <br /> <br /> The remaining character is the friends of Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie Ericin. They also play a big role in the show's story. <br /> Well, First Season is great. When these characters begin to feel new things. First Season is original, funny and pleasant. <br /> <br /> The Second Season is good, though it's not good at first. The main sequel of the first one. Eric and Donna are together and everything works great. <br /> <br /> The Third Season is my favorite. He returned and captured the feeling and humor of the First Season. Also, I think that characteristic chemistry improves a team. The show will be even more entertaining. <br /> <br /> The Fourth Season is not good. Eric and Donna Arne together, a bit more. <br /> <br /> Fifth Season has been very pleased with all my travels since last season. The Past Year of the Sword really helps with the story. <br /> <br /> Most of the eighth season is good. It's very funny, though it does not hold the feel of other seasons. Cetin came out of High School, so I believe he did not touch the youth feeling of the previous season. <br /> <br /> The eighth season was part of the season's 5th season, although he did not like the last three or four episodes. All your way. <br /> <br /> Last season was straightforward. Eric did not exist in this area, he destroyed it. Kelso did not help but for most of it. I hated the Eighth Season until the final episode. <br /> <br /> So, the last episode was really good and I thought the array was a fitting end. <br /> In general, if you love comedy, show it to 70. They stopped making new episodes, but there is still a group on television. I advise you to buy 1-7 seasons. This is yours if you want to get Season 8.
