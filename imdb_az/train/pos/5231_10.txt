What is the meaning of life as it relates to the basic things of life in the film? - It is not possible. Of course, the possible answers to these questions are displayed in each film (story), but communication must be directed directly to consciousness. This is when the information coming from the senses breaks our mind, in our opinion, of "entry". Several directors know how to communicate. Tarkovsky is one. His Stalker shows the images of his existence, coordinates his life as he shows himself, and still misses your mind. De Zee and De Graaff do the same thing.
