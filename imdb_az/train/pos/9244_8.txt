If you only read a summary of the plot, it will sound as a pretty typical voice in the 1930s. This story looks very flawless, the topic maudlin. The power and beauty of this film is cast in direct and secular speeches. I rarely have a feeling like Jean-Harlow, rich and exquisite nuances to his face. If you watch the faces of the chapel during the wedding ceremony, there is such a clearness between the main characters. The same emotions are so sincere, so true. The final sequence is almost unbelievable: Clark Gable raises her when she is so happy and surprised, and proudly says, "My child," and I do not remember the birth of Mr. Gable's son. After his death. This is one of the best films during the Depression period.
