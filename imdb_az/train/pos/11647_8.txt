Here are four reasons why I can see this movie: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The four good stories are related to a great scheme. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a miserable reflection of the biggest concern (and many) in this country. <br /> <br /> (CONTRACTS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie in a comedy manner with a good story. the body that exceeds the limits for regular people and is still awaiting their efforts. <br /> <br /> Then, Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second part, which tells the story of the Italian neo-ordination with an amiable "Peter and monster". <br /> <br /> The third story seems to be more independent in this context Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man who was wrong in the wrong place at a time. <br /> <br /> The story of Tlaxuac's past lynx and the tradition of this terrible issue in Mexico has not been renewed yet. <br /> <br /> In the end, Fernando Sariñana is a "great final" that combines the best of the characters in one of the best comedy pieces. Sariñana presents the final lesson on the stage in the center of one of the previous films, Todo el Poder. Give Anna Ciochetti a scene stolen by stripping it shortly. <br /> <br /> After a movie is over, you (or perhaps with a very unpleasant theme) look at a good movie. People in Mexico enjoy their humiliation and this is the best example. This film is a proof of how Mexico is in the midst of a criminal state (and maybe it is) that they want to live between the two fires: the so-called full of criminals and corruption. Even this movie is a delightful idea because almost all good people have been victims of crime and are not afraid of this disease. If you have an attack without a zero then you are lucky. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended that you lose the chance to see this movie. <br /> <br /> There's a wonderful life in Mexico ...
