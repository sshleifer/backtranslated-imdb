It should be said that this is one of the most favorite films of all time. I can not count how many times I see. I have already liked John Travolta, but Camley poured his camera body for the first time after appearing first for Gilley's first visit. Debra Winger, as always, Budun provides a perfect performance as a young, loyal wife, but with a necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hardworking cowboy. If you are not a country music, I have not, it's 1 soundtrack that you have prepared for reading along with every word. If you have a chance, watch this movie - it's not disappointing.
