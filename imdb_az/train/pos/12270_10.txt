<br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three daughters entered a forest looking for a month. killed several camps. The old Vietnamese veteran they were naked went naked (he had killed some of his victims using a gloves with long-term metal finger nails la la Freddy Krueger). As night falls, one of the girls goes to his wife after a short dispute and is killed. After finding the body of one of the group, they all hide in the daytime waiting tents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The seventh body, not many, is a few fine offenses, especially girls, deaths. The children died somewhat flawlessly (shooting at a car, fatal striking, starting with a knife). <br /> <br /> Generally, INFERNAL TRAP is a beautiful movie after the 80s. Nothing new, just good moving, fast paced and a few beautiful lady. From 10 to 10.
