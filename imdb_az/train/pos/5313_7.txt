Since I'm an admirer of almost any post, I warmed up to John Waters for "Pecker. After leaving the underground landscape, Waters released the garbage-lite versions of his earlier works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", "Hairspray"), who looked at their unwelcome fans and tasted like a delicious liquor. "Pecker" is a light, calm, modest interpretation about the vagaries of popular elements, and ambitious artistic world, attempting to tune early achievements. The water is well aware of this issue, because it was also unable to imagine that the most popular pop art, both exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices), could not have been imagined to anyone by the name "Waters". Edward Furlong is as good as Pecker and Waters' non-histrionic style is comfortable. Subject.
