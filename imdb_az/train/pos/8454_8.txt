The second alternative Gundam universe (G-Gundam first) is another view of the Gundam Wing Gundam verse. There are identifying elements, but the Gundam wings differ from their colleagues. The greatest of Gundams is nothing more than just terrorists fighting with an organization. In fact, the series really is not a show about episodes of war up to 7, but really does not happen until the real episode, Eve Wars, and the next episodes. <br /> <br /> The greatest positives of this series are its symbols. All the main characters can really give sincerity to each of the 49 episodes they are joining along the way. Another great plus is the fantastic character of the array and the mecha design. Their designs put some other Gundam colleagues to embarrass. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest critics of this series calls for UC fans to disassemble the original UC epic. If Gundam Wing gets this rap, Gundam Toxus is out of my control when I have a clear UC clone. <br /> <br /> For example, we have to compare the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more in the Union and OZ paths, while the red Comet illuminates the Zeon's symbol. The other big difference is the loss of many soldiers by the order of Zechs, and the other nickname given in early episodes loses as "the murderer of his own men." This label is not spared. <br /> <br /> These series problems are not philosophical philosophy but two problems. First, recurring animated images of Gundam attacks. Heavy Arms saw the attack tanks, MS, and fun and for the first time. However, the fourth re-use scenes are also old. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that all arrays will be held within a year. If you truly think about all the events that occur in the array, there will be many things in just one year. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, you can easily release this truth before you often see others' first lines. As for this rank, this is probably the best of the Gundam fairy tales of the universe and a great introduction to the Gundam world. It was the first Gundam anime to go on air in the US TV.
