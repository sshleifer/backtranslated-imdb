This German documentary, in English, is about Scottish Sculptors Andy Goldsworthy. He is art from the things he finds in nature. For example, in the early hours of the film, we see it as a "serpentine" by taking icicles and combining it with a little moisture. Carefully looks straight through a steep stone. <br /> <br /> Certainly, icicles can dissolve, but this transition is part of Goldsworthy's business. She goes to a site and feels it intuitively decides what to do on that day. He tries to establish "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials that deal with them, trying to work with them. These can be stones, flowers, or leaves or sticks. The statue can last for hours or years, or can not last long enough to complete and take pictures. <br /> <br /> It is a matter of thinking that the film and work are beautiful, inspirational, and thoughtful. It is suitable for the material, it moves slowly, but you have to be sure that you are in a good night's sleep. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What is you can understand what you mean. While watching the movie, I remember some of the things that happened to me that I would still share it with the people you read. First, the transient nature of most of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural curve and the flow of human life. We are born, we live and eventually die. This, of course, is part of Goldsworthy's art. <br /> <br /> The other idea was to fear Goldsworthy's ability to attract his passion and his work to a boasting life. Most of us have the job of being tolerant in the best way, our life is hard to understand, and the more we remember, the more passion we want to spend. Andy Goldsworthy has succeeded in creating a combination of all these aspects of his life that works very well and feeds him and those around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> It was seen on 8/28/2002.
