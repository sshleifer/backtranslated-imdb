Events that took place on September 11, 2001, do not need further human interests after the blaze's flare or the advancement of two French brothers. In my opinion, it would be better to leave it. I think the directors have done very hard, perhaps the events of the day as a background for a story. <br /> <br /> According to one of the cops, it belongs to Disneyworld. <br /> <br /> However, it is forced to describe these events. The filmmakers were in the right places at the right time, and no other day in the day was the games they shot.
