What can you say about the White Fire movie? Amazing? Fantastic? Anxiety? You? These words are not big enough to describe the event in the White Fire. <br /> <br /> Our film begins in the woods of a country in the world. She is hiding from a soldier who does not wear uniforms in a family suit shop. When a father separates his mother and his children, you get the real meaning of the movie you are watching. The dad makes hills in all white clothes and is as kind as it takes people's attention before hitting them, but sadly, the father is alive in a seemingly unsafe, dangerous stunt. Mothers and children run away from a beach with an armed soldier behind them about 5 feet behind. He is a strange "HALT!" In the form of a warning before the action, and then immediately throws the mother. <br /> <br /> So, we build our heroes Bo and Ingred's happy childhood. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, we have been in beautiful Turkey for about 20 years (Ingred has settled like professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something if you are honest about her age, Indred works in a diamond mine she has taken, Bo Boon and Ingrid, who are driving friends around the desert in their denim clothing, and they spend all their time together, and Bo wants to go to bed with his brother, "You know, you know," he says, as he tells him to make a very dynamic duo when he's crazy, and after Bo's Crush, Bo rides a roaring pale grin on the beaches of Turkey. rhysus plastic surgery, which opens the door to Bo's and his sister's relationship with the technically misguided. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to watch almost exciting action scenes, ridiculous violence, great toys, cunning lines. , Fred is a large piece of "Dirty" Williamson (for some reason) and a giant diamond (later bursts) of dirty ice. All this is great, but Bo and Ingrid make this movie special .... really special. That's why I encourage everyone to respect the White Fever. Thank you very much.
