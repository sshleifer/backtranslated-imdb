This is not a deep film; Most aspects of the field are predictable and "worked and true", but they worked well and created some exciting moments about our regrets that we regret about our lives (such as "our mistakes"). I did not read a book, so I did not know so much about the life of a dead woman that she had long ago shared with anyone that had very strong memories. Meryl's great daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays with young Lila, and then looks like the old Lila at the end of Meryl's movie ... along with a nice resemblance (duh!) , the little actress did a great job (perhaps not until the caliber of her mother?) Everyone in this movie was nice, although I thought the character of Glen Close Buddy was very dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is good for girls to talk to your mom or daughter, rather than for children, and maybe start a series of dialogues. How difficult it is to know a parent as a "person"!
