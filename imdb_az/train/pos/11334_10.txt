I would say that this film gives an idea of ​​the trauma that a young person might face when divorce or other disaster. <br /> <br /> I will recommend this film especially to parents or family planning people. <br /> <br /> I've found that the characters will ask many dimensions and are very sympathetic. The terrible monster is not too afraid for the adults, although there is a very realistic clue that a child who is experiencing an unknown terror can create an overwhelming impression. <br /> <br /> I found the movie pleasing!
