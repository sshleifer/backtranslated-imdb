This is a great movie. It's a charming story, an awesome main character, a very good player and a killer movement. It occurs mainly in 2036, but shows scenes that have occurred in the past to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very good and there is no gap. Kurt Russell is a soldier called Todd who is trained to bring up a baby from birth, and all other soldiers have no normal life. Finally, the military offers new, younger, faster and more powerful soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, there is no need for old soldiers like Todd. New soldiers fought against some of the elderly soldiers and tried to think that they had killed Russell in battle. <br /> <br /> Simply, however, when he dropped his body, they realized they were dead, but they did not think Russell was alive. Todd finds a camp that fills civilization on this planet and threw it down. He lives there for a while, but can not adapt to normal life. He rarely says a word and is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. <br /> <br /> Like Rassel's expulsion from the planet, as they are being attacked by new soldiers, they also think they are in danger. Soldiers have forgotten their soldiers to become clever as Todd and other former soldiers. So when Todd is faster and stronger than this new soldier, Todd easily removes them. The military begins to work, and Todd kills all men. You'll see the classic battlefield between Jason Scott Lee and Russell and Scott Lee at the end. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. It has everything you can ask in a movie, including a few lines. The writer did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman, even as she called her "mystery". <br /> <br /> There is no space in this movie, every minute has one purpose and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> A funny man army action movie for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. It is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and fans / actors.
