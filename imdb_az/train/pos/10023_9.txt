After seeing some of Villaronga's films, I had a pretty clear idea of ​​it - forgetting the rhythm of the film, and paying close attention to the personality of the characters. Therefore, despite his good critics, his films have never been the focus of attention of the audience. In Aro, he comes from the same line, but at the end of the film he has improved, especially in the rhythm. It is obvious that I went to sleep during the first part and, despite giving the necessary information in the first part, it was really slow. Nevertheless, the second part is absolutely beautiful and the entire film is made by Villaronga's best film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
