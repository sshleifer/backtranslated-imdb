I watched the movie today and just got away from my mind. It's a real work of art, and most people do not think it's trash. The main idea of ​​the film is to get away from your body and then you will have a real power! At the end of the film was the main battle, and Guy Ritchie showed this in a wonderful way. "The greatest enemy will ever hide in the last place" - do you remember the movie? Because we are in the real enemy - this is our ego ... This voice, which always tells us that we are important, tells us not only to give it but also to give up our aggression. He wants to control everything that creates negative emotions and thoughts. GR expresses this point in a surprising way, and it is the only way to go the right way when you are in control of your control and avoid only personal importance. Beautiful movie!
