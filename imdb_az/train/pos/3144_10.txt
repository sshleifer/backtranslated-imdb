It's one of the better comedies that's nothing on TV. The season was one of the most enjoyable of the following seasons. The only reason I have given it is that 9/10 is a failed last season. The only good part of the final season was final. My favorite part of this show was scenes cut from the imagination of people who depicted the characters from the popular television show or films of over 70. A rare show that liked every character (except for the last season ... it was too late to develop a new character, and fez was not nearly comic). The legs on the red leg were never old, nor were Kelso's fools. Bravo is so long, even longer, to shoot a good show.
