At the Elementary Day of the California Presidency, a spy by Viktor Rovner will send a message to the United States from Kuala Lumpur at 1:00 am midnight. At the same time, the Federal Agent in Los Angeles Jack Bauer returned to his family and had trouble with his teenage daughter, Kimberly, who accused her of taking Teri out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim and reveal that the girl is running away from home. While trying to solve the internal problem, Jack was summoned by his colleague Nina Myers to a terrorist unit and met with President Richard Walshe. He keeps his candidacy for Senator David Palmer's presidency and they need to find a shooter. Then Walsh made a special interview with Jack and made a statement in his agency that David Palmer was a conspiracy and found Jack to be guilty. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a successful start with a successful series of acquaintance with Jack Bauer. I watched this show for the first time and liked what I saw, I acknowledge: a complex and dramatic story with numerous and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect as a reliable tool for the role of a family and at the same time performing three challenging missions: finding a killer to protect an important politician; find treacherous agency; Find the teenage girl who is causing trouble while trying to save her marriage. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">
