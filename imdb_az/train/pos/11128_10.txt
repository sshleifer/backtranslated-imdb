First of all, I would like to say how great this is. This is surprising and sometimes shocking. At least 11 years old, and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely go into a boring movie, but it's a dull thing. This is going to be the path of humanity. His strange realism shows this monumental masterpiece. It's a fairy tale (VOIGHT and Hoffman), two of which form a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) comes to New York to admire the loyal Texan studio by entertaining women. Soon, she faces Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN) but is a poor man who has to pay a rent. Ratso becomes Joe's manager, but soon both of them can not find jobs that result in Joe's stealing food. We understand how difficult it is to work and live on New York's streets. They can not get up until a girl from Joe meets a woman in a party. Joe earns a lot and is soon taking Joe Ratso to Ratso's dream spot to Florida. In the last five minutes, some of the biggest moments of the film break their hearts. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY, we get a stunning and sometimes uncomfortable city look.
