Production quality, cast, premise, original New England (Waterbury, CT?) The local and light John Williams account has resulted in 3-4 star collector items. Unfortunately, everything we received was a memorable, decent 2 star "decent" flick that we tried to pass ... it brings the main movie of an art home style. The story of a small townspeople and an ordinary man is a genre for himself and, if done well, will provide the most adult. Jane Fonda could not hide enough braininess to convince her character. I was wondering whether he worked in Waterbury for a post-doctoral study at Yale instead of working in a dead ending factory. Robert DiNiro's character was a bit too increded. <br /> <br /> This genre is a lonely, lucky person who wants to really get out of Jane's character, Henry Ford or Thomas Edison's 1990 version. <br /> <br /> This genre is more successful in the midst of the 90s and this year (2003) on "Schmidt." I want the main stream studio to do more for posters, and many of these efforts I want them to keep a few screens from movie complexes. <br /> <br /> I will give "A" for the effort.
