Making a movie is not a negative thing. It is very important to have a moment and to watch a painful movie if one of these is definitely one. It's a heartwarming story of a Chinese man and a family where many years of difficulty and abundance are present. However, I must warn you that this may be the most difficult film to go out of Hollywood in the 1930s because it is difficult to say the peasant life in China at least. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to follow segments of poverty, death and illness. <br /> <br /> The only downside is the persistent tone of perseverance, leading Paul Muni. Although he is a very talented person, Hollywood is always a real shame to encourage European immigrants to play Asian players at this time. If you pay attention to your attention, Muni is wrong.
