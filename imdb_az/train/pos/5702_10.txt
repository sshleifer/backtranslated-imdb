I did not expect Val Kilmer to convince John Holmes, but I forgot that I was not a porn legend. <br /> <br /> In some cases, as we have mentioned, look for two sets of discs and watch the documentary "Wadd" first; will provide a lot of background on the story that will be useful in assessing the film. <br /> <br /> Some people are unhappy with the video of the LAPD crime scene on DVD. There are several possible reasons for this: one of them is John Holmes's murder trial, the first case in the United States used by prosecutors. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid; the menus are clearly defined as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage"!
