At the Tribeca Film Festival I saw "The Shadow of a Brother" and two days later I was thinking about it. The story of a slavery son (Scott Cohen), who returned to the family's private furniture business after he stopped in prison, offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama - memorable characters; sharp, observational dialogue; <br /> <br /> It should be noted that recently, something very rare in the multiplex is presented: a discreet appearance of mature sensitivity. The talent of author-screenwriter Todd S. Yelley seems to have been completely exploded, but we can say that he (as his protagonist) paid his rights. He really knows how these people are struggling in the world, and he knows how we want to see it, or at least succeeds in coping with it. Yellin very respectfully welcomes viewers to smile in the end behind us. In the end, we see that Jake's victory is not in commissions, even in the family, but when he "works," he can not refuse it. <br /> <br /> A key topic in a world (and especially in the film industry) that can not go beyond the "bottom line". This film deserves a wide audience.
