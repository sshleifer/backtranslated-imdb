This film contains a part of all the revenge films and it is a real feeling. Sorry, love, laughter, anger. Many emotions were thrown into this film. From the start, this movie is very attractive. The paper on the paper sounds like a garbage dump, but it's not a mistake on the face of the audience, but it's strong. Washington has always been a great performer. <br /> <br /> In brief, the plot is suffering from human depression, the young girl brings her life, the children run away, the man wants revenge. It does not sound like something special but is better than any other similar movie. Instantly, it is a similar movie, but if you compare them, FIRE MAN ON THE HANDS OF THE HANDS. Heroes are involved and everyone is a great performer and leadership is great. Mexico City feels alive, looks like Mexico City, smells like Mexico City. Everything is brilliantly described. the style of the way I liked and brought the best of Mexico <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies you can take once to watch again or to watch the family and friends that you are asking for. It is rooting for the main hero of the post-start era, making it a roller-coaster ride. There is enough activity to keep you happy, there is enough character to ask for there, and then there is Washington to smile your face. Look at this movie, you will not be disappointed
