I do not remember much detail about the show, but I remember how passionate about it and how determined I was not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately, there was never a VCR, so again I did not see the series again. But I remember very well how thrilled I felt when I watched him and every time he was excited. Sam Waterstone is my favorite actor in recent days (I almost love it) and he remains one of the most beloved actors of the day with his appearance in the series. I love this hometown / kidnap / download, still think again and go to big lengths to get away from one child ... Any idea? Who knows a site dedicated to Serious or has episodes on the tape from the first airplane?
