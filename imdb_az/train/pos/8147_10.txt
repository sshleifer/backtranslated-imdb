The fear of a black hat is a cunning parody of the hip-hop culture. This is funnier, as if it were funny like Spinal Tap. The actors are incredible and the documentary style is superior. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a great ability to play a great role in the film. This movie is a real cult classic!
