Takashi Miik's "first family movie" - probably by people who do not see Zebraman. OR DAISENSO also enhances everything in the family friendly way of watching darkness and cynicism to create a great fantasy fairy tale. Young boy is chosen to save the world from monsters and horrors. The film is a bigger budget than Miike, creating a fantasy world by CGI and single creatures (YOKAI). Perhaps the lack of extreme content is a result of more frustrated investors, but maybe I think he wants to do something different. He is not really a single trick, but is often charged - maybe YOKAI is designed to silence those critics. At least, it's a great project for Miike to sew her infinite imagination and inventions. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki has a lot of cartoon feelings for the production of ideas in places. Yokai is based on an obscure comic series that has, of course, transformed into Japanese folk stories that affected Miyazaki (in particular the FUTURE). Miike has nothing to do with Harry Potter's movie, so remember that special effects will not work in Hollywood style - some blue screens are particularly clear. Some special effects are good with some of the best animated creatures (CG, stop-motion and puppet sets). For the most part of the film, the little socks around the heroine were meant to look really cheap, and that's all for the cuter :) The young guy who is the hero of the movie really does a good job - 9-year-old Ryunosuke Kamiki is really a talent (I see sounds in the last 2 Miyazaki !). Mai Takahashi is delicious as part of the Chiaki Kuriyama piece, although the pixie-eared River Princess - makes it even more impressive as yum yum! They will not come to find another violent, perverted gangster movie, but will be very pleased if there is a fan of Miike's imagination and mind. And you have the extra bonus you put on any company you are lucky :)
