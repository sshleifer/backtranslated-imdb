I really enjoyed the pilot, but it was as good as I had hoped for. Patrick Warburton was a rule, but at first I thought I would not stop his character. He and Megyn Price There was a small chemistry, but I hope they will relax one another during the season. Megyn should have been strangely enough to be a star in the last show [Collected for Life], becoming a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson look really new on the entire Sitcom scene, but in time they think they will improve. David Spade's character, my surprise, is not at the center of attention of this pilot. The way to convey his lines is different from what I see on television, but I think it's his style. <br /> <br /> I think that couples, even alone, will be involved in all doubts and fights, and you will not be convinced of the decisions that this show is about. <br /> <br /> Heroes just feel like real life, and most pictures are not covered with sugar. <br /> <br /> I hope all actors give CBS a chance to them. This show has the potential to be one of the best series if only luck and time have been provided.
