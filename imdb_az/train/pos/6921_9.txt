I think I'm a fan of the genre, but for the first time I've seen this movie for the first time. It's a miracle for me to look at all this. A better movie for me then a very respected "High Noon". It is a great player with a great player and a great story. DVD is beautiful black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you like the West or James Stewart should not leave this movie.
