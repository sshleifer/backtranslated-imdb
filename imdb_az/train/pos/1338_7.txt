It was a bad year for Indian movies because of the lack of quality and imagination in filmmakers in 2000. Nothing except the Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai were noticed. Due to the funding of the film, CCCC hit the film and did not know what the film was. It created good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film in India and abroad. The only information given was a voltage tension. The film was released in 2001 and the film was amazingly amazing. The main plot is linked to the Survey and is well managed. Salman and Preiti Salman can not take on any form that gives a good performance that they really can not really .. have a special effect! Rani plays Salmans' wife, but later plays a slightly less demanding role compared to Preiti, who plays the prostitute, who later became a surrogate mother. The three main reasons are, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, a solid and screened chemistry screen (in appearance) confirms. The perfect Salman lady plays a very important role as a successful businessman in the film and is used as a wannabe comedian in other regrettable films that Mumbai is at a very low level in the movie industry because of his choice. Rani's character does not know that Preiti is a prostitute until the end ... this has left him and the rest of the family ... when I say the rest, you have to find it as if it would ruin the movie. All of the songs, including the song dehne walon and the main song are depicted. Other supportive actors, such as the Salmans loving family, have a minimal but beautiful effort. Abbas Mastan pulled a hit and made the film subject sensitive .. Go and follow or say everything you prefer!
