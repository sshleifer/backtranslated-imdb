Two things follow you through L'intrus (Intruder): who is a film or dream to whom? The latter is so shocking that after a while you see a loss to answer both of these questions. The attacker acts in different scenes, in different situations, as different men who do not belong to the scene, so they are left out of the scene, friendly or horrific, but often without emotional appeal. The main character, Louis, is a modest man. He means rough roads, a job, and does not have a heart. He needs someone and then goes on. She has a heartfelt heart and then decides to build a new life. Can this man succeed in searching for caliphate? A boy can cut his throat in the hat. You know it, but Claire Denis does not encourage him to criticize him. Sometimes there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl living together between heaven and earth - who judges her. It can even be punished. But not Denis. There is a character played by Beatrice Dalle, who does not want any job: Do not touch me, he says. But Denis makes this man his own, attracts him in his entrusted search. I know what movies are not heart or mind, but the basics of the traditional plot. Whatever the movie, you get it at last. Who do you know, "unreal men", why, you know more or less, and some scenes come to your mind exactly. But is it a movie or a dream?
