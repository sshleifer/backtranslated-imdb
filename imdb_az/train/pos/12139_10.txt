Although over 70 years of age, this movie is still a very moving, powerful movie. Bette Davis is totally convincing, as complicated, bad Cockney waitress Mildred. It is still difficult to watch his performance. He looks at the audience as despised and at the same time regrets. Leslie Howard's poor performance, like obsessed, obsessed Phillip Carey, is not strong, but any player is Ms. I do not see how Davis behaves against his performance. She takes the stage on every stage, the show is completely stolen. This is a film that seals its own stardom, and it deserves to win the Oscar, but it has lost. This is a somewhat dated, yet still excellent film, the shock of pregnancy, numerous sex partners, and the legendary language of Mildred, which does not depend on daylight. Mildred is still one of the biggest players I've ever seen in the movie to see Phillip as he really thinks about him ("You Witch, Dirty Pig ....").
