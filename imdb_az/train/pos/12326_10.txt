I first saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival and I have never seen the Hong Kong movie before. When I was sitting on a roller coaster I felt it was too fast, and there was no boring moment along the film. There is martial arts, love, special effects and fantastic space. My favorite scene, the Taoist drink, sounds and fights for itself - is one of the many scenes emphasizing the extraordinary music component of the film. This movie should definitely be!
