When I was a little girl, I was watching this show. When I think of it, I just remember it. If you ask me, it was a good show. In some cases, I remember the opening sequence and theme song. However, everyone is perfect. And the writing was very strong. The performances were of a high level. Hopefully, we can see every episode that some network brings back to her. Before I do so, I would like to say that although I do not believe I've seen each episode, I always remember this show in my memory. Now, if, as a result, if a network brings it back, I hope you'll spend the day out for a good weather.
