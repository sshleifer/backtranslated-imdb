As we have explained in the chapter 'The Second Beginning,' it shows us the beginning of the end for human race. Shortly before the Matrix exists, this short anime, written by Wachowski, shows us the world of 21st Century, which shows us our infront, not the distant future; the second renaissance turns into general issues with human behavior; envy, power, control, emptiness, etc.) Rob or the use of artificial intelligence like a slave or a servent is very popular among science fiction / fantasy stories. The second renaissance does not give any possibility to this concept, but it is not a machine mechanism for a simple man, but the story explains the struggle of the machines to confront the world in which people are driven. When the Matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations talk to both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second renaissance part answers 1 + 2, many questions brought by the original Matrix film. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > As I do not want to destroy the experience for prospective viewers, I will not give too much of the story but I do it for anyone interested in the world of matrix or just Japanese animation (anime 9/10).
