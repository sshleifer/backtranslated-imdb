Great black and white night cinematography and most of all stress that this real life account, in which all of this family was killed in Kansas in the 1950s, was killed by two people. <br /> <br /> The story is written by Truman Capote because you will receive the message of the death penalty in the end of the ridiculous film that knows the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play two atheist losers who have been wrapped in life and killing unnecessarily this beautiful family. <br /> <br /> It's a story about the beginning, despite cinnamon twisting, and cinematography is even more interesting. Famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job about it. She wants me to make a more modern black-and-white movie. Watch on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and all the supporting players here are good. For the third time, this film was blamed for the murder of a spouse in real life in April 2005, shortly after Blake. You will not be able to look after Blake and this movie anymore.
