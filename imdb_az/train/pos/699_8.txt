I have never seen Insomniac's Nightmare for the first time, and I want to say that I'm very good. If you are an admirer of Dominic Monaghan, you will love it. Hole is happening inside his mouth - is it doing? Everyone moving a little flies and shakes and cuts off some of them, but works at the end. Extras on the DVD are as great as the movie if it's not bigger for Dom supporters. There are tons of phrases from this set, speeches and a great interview with the director. Everyone who creates an independent film tries to take this little triple creepy movie if he wants to watch Tess (director), Dom and a very small personality for everyone. I really liked it and I'm so glad I got it.
