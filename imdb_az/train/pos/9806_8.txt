I agree that the capital city should be on DVD. I watched this show only in 1994, and liked Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial sector for a change. I liked Rolf in this role and liked every role I was in. I just do not believe in a 13-episode show. William Armstrong liked him as a charming friend in Hudson's series. It was always late or off when it was broadcast in New York City. The show is less than an hour. I felt that this show lasted longer, but the shooting changes in the second season were a bit more interesting. I did not care for Sylvia in the previous season, but I missed the actress Julia Phillips-Lane. This show took a chance and I felt that it worked often. He showed Americans living and loving in London. American characters did not become arrogant or tried to fulfill their British counterparts. In addition to fulfilling all the British, I liked that they were trying to internationalize the international level. I like to watch Julia Ormondu play an early role. This show lasted longer. Although demonstrations continued for less than a few hours. They were cast into New York, and this would be a hit in America.
