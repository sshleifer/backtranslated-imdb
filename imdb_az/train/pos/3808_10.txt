I voted 10 to 10 because it's the best animated story I've ever seen. The animation is striking. The art behind each landscape was beautiful. It is not standard industry until color is illuminated. I was surprised. To move on the screen beyond the beauty, you are instantly immersed in a timeless and at the same time a fresh storyline. The development of the character is short, but these tendencies are necessary to tell viewers why and why and why they come to the place where the character is based. I'm fascinated by all the work, and I think it's all about seeing the family.
