Film is a fantasy. The story line is gentle, but some nice songs play and serve as a beautifully-constructed structure. (I do not believe such attractive and attractive people can read these words). Some of the dialogues are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Since 1942, suits seemed to me when I was looking at a high fashion show. <br /> <br /> Films are for different purposes. It is designed to indulge and of course. If you have a negative comment, Nelson Eddy was also a bit more than a nice sliding number. Some of your loved ones bother me. But he still could read and read great things. However, Jeanette MacDonald was always bright in advance. <br /> <br /> This genre is good before my time and I'm new to Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy movies and related conversations. The music of this movie is beautiful. As I love classic rock music, which is full of contemporary movies, I think this music is simply clearer and more memorable, tastier, better built. In this film, stars are more strange than those I've seen in cinemas today. Beverly Hills plastic surgeons and Jeanette MacDonald were more beautiful than the stars I've seen today. Why I do not understand why many other posters do not apologize for this movie and more generally for love of this movie group. They say they are dated, and they try to explain what it is. Dislikes are not very good, but why? In my opinion, this movie will be a fun game when many other films have long been forgotten. There are all kinds of quality in this movie to remember and dislike. I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates great talents, great beauty and great music.
