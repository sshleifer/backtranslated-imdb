This is John Cromwell's well-featured film, which is not a great director, but some of the coolest films including Zenda's 1937 version. <br /> <br /> Simply Hollywood has settled in London, where he can not handle anything in the atmosphere, but in reality he is a story and love story from Somerset Maughan's novel. <br /> <br /> As I have seen before on DVD, Bette wanted to see Davis as a great admirer of his role as one of his early elders. I bought it. Well he looked good, but I'm sorry to say that the London Cockney accent just tells me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest actors in the movie, did not make a mistake, but did something here. His character can not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' approached as a cockney accent, but was not close. <br /> <br /> In other great role was Leslie Howard and did such a wonderful thing. He was a subtle and intelligent player. Respecting Mr. Davis despite his vocal gymnastics.
