<br /> <br /> While looking for green pastures in New York City, Jon Voight is a young optimist from Texas, Cowboy (almost like Forest Gump). Big Apple does not take long to completely absorb himself and his ambitions, and soon Joe is targeting both the cold and the streets of New Yorkers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> tagged as drama , in my opinion, is best described as a tragic comedy or comedy tragedy. Moreover, it is a beautiful film that captures the modern hippie-vibe work with the Warhol-party cinematography that began with violence and brought ultra city to New York City in the late 1960s. The film connects Cowboy Joe Buck in one place, thus emphasizing his position beyond the ground. <br /> <br /> We are struggling to earn enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy has brought tears to my eyes because items and projects are very rich. I think this film should also inspire Forest Gump to have a pure heart and irreplaceable lead character, and somehow it is equally humorous with Timsah Dundee - cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitan. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
