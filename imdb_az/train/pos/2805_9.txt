Wow, I do not believe that I've been expecting to see this movie for a long time. I just never had to watch it. The site has nothing to do with me. I do not know anything about soccer (football). I was an American idiot without any clues. I did not see David Beckham before this movie. It was released in America when I was around this movie. It's enough about me. <br /> <br /> For the truth, it was a mistake to not see the paradise that shot this little movie. What a fun movie. It is full of color and charm. Throughout the film, I had a dark bravery on my face. Parminder Nagra is very sweet and cute, can not help her, but root for her. American television show E.R. it does not surprise you why it leaks. I gave a new assessment of Indian culture. Those people know how to have a good time. The wedding scenes are beautiful. <br /> <br /> I just pointed out that I talked about some conversations and dialogue in English. I was convinced that I did not miss English subtitles. (This is a critique of the film!) I believe that massive television around the world understands constantly changing arguments in American films. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect movie. Rocky has a great sports field and has a strong sense of feminism that reinforces women. I watched him with my wife and sixteen year old siblings, and we all loved it. I highly recommend this.
