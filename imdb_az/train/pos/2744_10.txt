<br /> <br /> A realistic life of a small city family is a remarkable, worrying film about investigating the life of Dick Hickok and Perry Smith, who was murdered, murdered, and then murdered. <br /> <br /> It really follows many tragedies: tragedy, cruelty and misery. The killing of the Clutter family is a decent family in a small town in Holcomb, Kansas; and Hickok and Smith's lost, perverted and miserable life. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting point in the film: none of these two immature, scary, little criminals is anything. But, together, they created a dangerous, destructive, collective personality; one who feeds the needs and pathology of each one. They push one another to "prove" one another. To do so is enough for people to realize; nor does it want to be as terrifying as to finish the big "account"; they have brought an unsuccessful and dangerous remnant of alien life. They were two great children living in the criminal world; You have to prove your personality and obedience. <br /> <br /> This film contains a somewhat syntheticized appearance in the Clutter family, but it's a point. They were a respectable, law-abiding, small townspeople who did not deserve this terrible fate. The film also shows us Hickok and Smith's young lives. Perry Smith, full of life and safety from the very beginning, was scared as he set out on a tragic journey to the family of alcohol. <br /> <br /> <strong> Hickok is too weak and close to his or her device, so it's not possible to see it fit. <br /> <br /> Interesting, and perhaps first, look at the death penalty and we hope to achieve it. If there is nothing else to kill such a murderer in a time when there is no such thing as predators in the midst of us, or to put these children at the end of a rope, is it really a perverting against the childishness and cruelty of men? Is it possible to exclude cases where everyone who is involved with radar-related deceases believes they are deceived? To be punished, you must believe that you will be caught. Is it possible to prevent these men who believe they are smart enough to be arrested? Hundreds of minor crimes committed and escaped with them? <br /> <br /> When he was stung, he found that he did not find his charm and found agents to be the merchants selling them at the store. Smith, who believes that he is worthy of such a fate, nevertheless tells the story when he learns Hickok's cowardice. Hickok first shook his eyes. <br /> <br /> A clever chicken game between two weak, dangerous, dangerous men. <br /> <br /> An interesting psychological tension that describes the story of a terrible crime in the history of this nation. Surprising drawings by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles made their career.
