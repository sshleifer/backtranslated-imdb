Miss Lemon was quite agitated in a series of casual, seemingly insignificant theft in her brother's boarding house. A ring, a light bulb, a carpet, a lighter, a stethoscope, a shoe? it seems that there is no kinship or cause. Miss Lemon asks employer, Belgian great detective Hercule Poirot. But what Poirot saw is much worse than Miss Lemon's imagination. Poirot's killings are confirmed by one of the students living in the boarding house. <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickory Dock is a sturdy but spectacular entry in the long run Poirot series. I appreciate Agatha Christie's original story, how loyal to the script. I know that some liberties should be taken, but still thank for the effort. Is mystery the main point? small theft, boarding house, students, a torn carpet, and, of course, the ability to see things that actually happened before Poirot actually happened. With a few exceptions, the layout of students is almost as I describe them. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd were included in the group. I always get a real shot from episodes with Philip Jackson's Inspector Japp and Pauline Moran's Miss Lemon because I enjoyed David Suchet's Poirot. This episode is a real treat as Miss Lemon is more than just a screen shot. Finally, I used the current mouse as an observer on the hostel's activities. Hickory is an entertaining game in the title of Dickory Dock. <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickory Dock's reputation in the highly-stylized Italian mysterious films of Agatha Christie's or Gialli's 60s and 70s. Take the case of Miss Nicholas's murder. It would have been something that Giallo would have done directly before the 70s by multiplying the graphic nature of the scene. In fact, the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock can be used in a Giallo. It just works and is quite interesting.
