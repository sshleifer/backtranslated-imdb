In my workplace, I sometimes associate with independent filmmakers who want to introduce their own films. Whenever I can, I look at these little budgetary films and think that Hollywood will go to dogs in the future. After a while, filmmaking has been created to remind the film industry, there is still a film of pure passion and desire, as is the case with films. <br /> <br /> In just 20 minutes, BROKEN does not want to say anything vivid (but true), because Alex Ferrari's short film is really , surprise and a second look. back story. The audience, in the middle of the action, did not find any clues about what happened. The young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up to hear a weapon from a ghost and was later kidnapped from home. When he wakes up, a comic book is surrounded by a group of robbers who seem to be at home. These bad guys and girls are bigger than life. All weapons and knives. <br /> <br /> The kicker here does not play like a low budget movie. Since the very beginning, it has been drawn, edited and produced by professionals. When Wachowski jumped up with his brothers, Quentin looked at Tarantino's agenda as something else. <br /> <br /> This movie is usually better than what I've seen in these little movies. Polay and Paul Gordon (Duncan playing the murderous head) were selected well. Two of the few talking roles in the film are up to them to carry the movie. No matter what a special impact, though, it would save you from this bad act. Fortunately, Polay manages to bring real fears and Gordon is trying to get out of the real psycho. Some of the limited roles seem to be full of less talent but hard to point out. <br /> <br /> The downside is only 20 minutes. The story ends with a Twilight Zone twist that looks a bit faded and looks challenging. While waiting for it, I felt like there was an epiphany, but it was just a feeling that I was hoping would be much more confidential. The film works hard to become one of those puzzles that leaves the audience chatting for hours in the local cafe, but it becomes unpleasant. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
