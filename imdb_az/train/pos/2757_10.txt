If you want to see a different movie, if you feel the love in your heart, this movie will be yours if you miss the Lord. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can eventually explore the love when it comes to your brain. I'm not susceptible, but this movie feels like a person. The film is as good as Forrest Gump. Foreign movies are sometimes more interesting, but there are not enough ads to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" by Majid Majidi is an example of almost the same delicious foreign films.
