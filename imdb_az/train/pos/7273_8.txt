Carlos Mencia was good at this clock special. He worked hard to show everyone that he had a real deal. I do not know if people were stolen from this special material, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy as he wants, not as he wants it, but so good. People at Dee de de say that he is not funny because they still do not know a part of his moving part and do not want to do so, but in any case he brings it and creates people laugh. There is a message here for all the enemies there, Carlos is here to stay, there is no point to bring it down.
