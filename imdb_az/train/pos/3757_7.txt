As with a group of kids at school, you need to give this one finger. Even Grim Ripper smiled at us. These two alien jobs made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the most entertaining entertainment of the whole film. This is better than the first one. And yet, for some reason, I miss something. One thing is great. Something's important. Made a better home and girlfriends. No, I would say bad guys. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I shared the gut. Splat, I'm not sure about these aliens. What are they? Scientists? In no way.
