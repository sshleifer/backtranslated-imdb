I enjoyed watching the Cliffhanger, she was full of terror when she slipped, and I thought that when you saw, the nerves in your body were a terrible scene, as I thought you could see it frustrated and the heart faster. I watched Cliffhanger, I think Silvester Stallone is a great player, and I believe he'll play Rambo and Rocky.
