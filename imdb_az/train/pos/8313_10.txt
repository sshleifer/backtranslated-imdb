Above all, the following statement for a site similar to this is not worthy. Obviously, you have no taste and do not respect the taste of others. It's not a history lesson, but you have to do it. Black actors are just as successful as others. If you're not part of the "Black" race, you do not understand the quality, creativity and vigor of the old movies such as "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High." Unfortunately, you are not Black, you are not used to feeling the feelings you feel when watching these classics, so you have to shut your mouth and just keep up the dance for you to dance. Thank you.
