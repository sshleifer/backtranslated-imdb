I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where he stood up! This movie has never been told - that is, a story about a German tribal woman who married Jews during the Second World War, without any information about the Rosenstrasse rebellion in Berlin. As you know, this is a unique story and I have seen that there is only one movie about the Holocaust, which indicates good Germans (for example, Anne Frank Nazis, in fact, to resist the immorality and cruelty of their country during the Nazi regime The actor is excited about the New York's interesting and complicated frame story, the scene of Von Trotta's masterpiece and the perfect cinematography on every scene, and the New York family can speak German, with many immigrant families living in this country the film is a common phenomenon, so criticism is unfounded - it is possible to spoil and practice, but the film is long, but it does not look at my watch, but some distribution is North America, and I hope this movie is not a masterpiece, Hitler because it's all about animosity against Germany, it can help people, and if this movie is playing on your pitch, I do not want you to see it! You will be gladdened!
