A hearty movie. Recently, John Thaw was an ordinary superpower. He was always so modest. <br /> <br /> He can be remembered for the role of Investigator Morse. Jackie Regan, Sweeney and Kavanah QC, as barrister in the 1970s TV series. For my collection I need to look at the whole family and the big DVD. Filmmaking will bring back some memories of people who remember the evacuation in London to bomb England and, of course, bombarded Germany. Interaction between the two main characters. Full and boy William really acted well and was fitted to the book by Michelle Magorian.
