CAROL'S JOURNEY is very pleased to watch many reasons. The Clara Lago movement is so surprising for such a young person, and he is one of the most prominent actors who speak very much about facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film that lasts for a long time and therefore accelerates the pace. Angel Garcia Roldan's screenplay is the story of his story, although it is the ultimate goal of films. The area is unpredictable and the events that are still going to resolve are completely unreasonable. Perhaps the best feature of this film is that the story of the Spanish Civil War is affected by the people. The 20th century was a great event, but not every American knows it. In fact, I was about a semester about a student who was studying at a university for about 40 years, and everyone who could say something less about it - and a large number of student scholars - all talked about American censorship. So in a film, this movie is a good way to start learning a story, that is, when it's a theme, it's a big part of history. The evaluation of this film, therefore, is directly related to the amount of knowledge. I missed the movie completely to see this movie as an old-age movie. The Left Arrow Index evaluates seven aspects of the film - operating, production sets, character development, consistency, dialogue, film durability and mastery - on a scale of 10 for good, 5 medium levels and for one person. CAROL'S JOURNEY is higher than the average of all counts except the average rated dialogue. The LEI average for this movie was raised to 10 when it was equal to 9.3 IMDb. I recommend this movie for all ages.
