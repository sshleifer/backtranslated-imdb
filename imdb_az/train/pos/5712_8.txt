<br /> <br /> This movie has some of the greatest looking images you have seen in the 30th movie, though all of these are clearly visible, not realistic places. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film were silent, old fashioned, complicated moments. Often, if a character falls into a camp or very aggressive, the whole gang would move. This shows that René Clair's true heart is silent. The overall humor is really great in this movie. And, of course, the musical moments were more. It's a really nice light and simple, pleasant, early French music. Although the best moments are silent moments, it is not full of some great humorous dialogs that are very well classified by the film's main actors; it's good for the atmosphere that does not have a common style and good dreams, which seems to be the scene actors for me. <br /> <br /> This film was actually so good, based on the scene by Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> This is technically a great technical film. adjusts, creates some quick and convenient ways to watch sequentially with pleasant speed. There will never be a momentous moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such an intelligent manager who was able to build and plan funny moments in films. <br /> <br /> For the last half an hour, I always feel like a film that is unique and unfounded without any loss, especially without forgetting it. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are one of the biggest and most creative moments in early comedy films. Of course, the film is really full of very unpleasant characters, of course, it's very stereotypic and unreasonable, and it's obviously clear. <br /> <br /> You will see one of your favorite movies! <br /> <br /> 8/10
