A few months ago, "The Sarah Silverman" is amazingly surprising, surreal, immature, ridiculous, and do not listen to painful critics, who are still bitter players from Silverman, who have been giving them the Spike TV Video Game Awards a few months ago. Adequately adapts to an Mature Swimming Line. Silverman dropped the jokes of the young "doodisi" and underestimates the dark, mean undercurrent, the show is so far the only point that we can have the greatest religious comedy since the canceled Strangers With Candy. But the pilot is just a tough, striking, unusual dark comedy / musical, but looking at the great potential. Silverman has created a childlike character - a beautiful, younger, Jewish American princess version of the merciful Jerry Blank, and the show is one of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical imagery. A gay couple I've seen on television. Early review suggests that the next episode be superior to the pilot, so I will not wait to see how this show will go.
