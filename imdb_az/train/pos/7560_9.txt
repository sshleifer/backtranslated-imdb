Starfucker (reading Starstruck in my box) was the most beautiful film I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best films I ever saw. Why a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy, in this dark side of Hollywood, proves to be one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look. I was forced to each other to watch the movie, and all agreed that this was a great flick.
