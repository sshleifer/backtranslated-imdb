Goldeneye will always be one of the legendary games of VG history. There is no doubt about them. <br /> <br /> Although this game is quite different, it may be a modern Bond champion. <br /> <br /> This is a bond game based on the material of another item. It was completely new; scripted game. There was even a theme song! <br /> <br /> In contrast to the majority of games, in these games, games or movies, they have shown their toys against heroism. It gives you more kinematic feel. <br /> <br /> You feel like you're in a movie as you are in the game with a lot of 'bond'-story. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, it is pleasing to every aspect. Even more will be done after hitting the game. Achieve it with rank system and unlockables, but also with multiple player missions, this is a prominent game. Even though it's pretty old, it's video game years. A good game that you can choose and play when you think you still need to get a little more Bond in your life. I still think about it, there is a song I have in my head. Such a great cast and well written story. <br /> <br /> The story is alive in the screen, almost as if the actors are in front of you and the entertainment itself. Magnificent, the true garden is made up of fashion. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasians, if you have not played yet, you will be missing!
