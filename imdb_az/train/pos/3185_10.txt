my lover ........ gave ten votes against all the averages for my age and sex ... all this is not very comedy (though I'm quite a bit like myself). Musicals is not a fan, it's probably a little too much for me, but they give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing anything. Perhaps Harry's yearly version of Sally talk? Ahab is nothing, but in this first ten, I love this movie. it's really a warm thing to remind you of what it is and what you can do to romance. my summary is very well described in very few words ..... very attractive
