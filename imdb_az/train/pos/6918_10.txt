It's a very enjoyable movie that has done extreme things and reflects the characters who want to emotion and revenge. Casting is very good, there is much movement and Stewart gets his daughter and revenge at the end (with a twist). I've seen this movie a few times and always see when it's on AMC or cable. Be advised ...
