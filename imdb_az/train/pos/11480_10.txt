Grief: This is one of the coolest, most powerful films I've ever seen. Some movies have left me. <br /> <br /> I was watching on the screen about a fifteen minutes trying to find a way to describe the power of this movie, and yet, it was just a failure. Any aspect - the documentary-style video diary format, the unprecedented picture of events, and the power of the characters - just seem to trivialize them all. Someone laughs that any killer can be characterized as normal. But then all the murders are not mouth-foaming lunatics. Many are quite regular, disadvantaged. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, perhaps, this is the most amazing thing.
