When I was a little girl, I was watching this show. I do not remember much about it, though it was a pretty good show. And I do not think I've seen each episode. But if you ask me, it was still a good show. I really appreciate the essence of the topic. Everyone was perfectly designed, the suit design was great. The performances were of a high level. I hope every single network will bring back this series one day, and I'll see every episode. Before I do so, I would like to say that although I do not believe I've seen each episode, I always remember this show in my memory. Now, as a result, when this demonstration is brought back to the air, I hope you keep it a day before it is released into a good atmosphere.
