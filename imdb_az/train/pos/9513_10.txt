Another father-son cameraderie with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) is directed to this beautiful film, which shows the starry cast. Mendes has done a very good job. It has done a great deal. It's a great legend. Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig are also active. The support is very good. Sorra is pretty good. You get a great picture of the 1930s gangster. The set of 1930s, which, of course, is a genius of all the gangster films of this era. The surface of the film is pretty good. A magnificent flicker showing what a father has shown to protect his son. I liked it.
