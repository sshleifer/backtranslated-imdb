In my opinion, this is a good example of differences between two cultures. It will be a great movie to show in the Sociology class. I thought it was pretty laughable, and I have to say that this is a plotter for "I'm alike and do not do anything". Apparently, most people do not understand that this film is not just a comedy. It also has a few dramatic elements and I think it's a great mix. In general, I give it strong 8.
