In the Christian Duguay film, Hitler: Raising the Rain, Hitler's early life and politics, some small history errors and some exaggeration have shown successfully. The main purpose of the Hollywood movie production is quite natural to include things like revenue from the movie. While some members of the audience believe that the book should do everything, the members of the audience can overcome these mistakes, but most of them make the film more relevant and more interesting. We should not forget that this film is not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure throughout the film, very easily angry and passionate about his ideals. But he was not depicted as a subtilty of ugliness, but as a very ambitious politician. The fact that the movie does not pollute with a negative feeling is a good perspective and I made this movie a bit objective. Yes, he was a little crazy and his methods were rude, but he is still not as insignificant as described in the "Intriorious Bastards". <br /> <br /> I think that in the realities of history, with some irregularities, the film is more realistic. <br /> <br /> The stream of history is beautifully reflected in the audience. Despite the fact that the film was around Hitler, we also had the chance to see events happening in the country with the songs, newspapers, and people in a Jewish cabaret. Also, the reaction of the society was reflected in the film, but it was very limited. Journalist Fritz Gerlich and the ironic games played in the cabaret were entertaining and interesting, but that was all. <br /> <br /> Another thing missing in the film is the knowledge of the origins of hatred for Jews. At the beginning of the film there were some ideas on this subject, but it was quite superficial. A moment ago, he was a politician who spoke on the necessity of the killing of Jews. Hitler: The Rise of the Rescue is unacceptable, unpleasant, as a beautiful film that everyone loves. If you stay tuned for cash-changing filmmakers, this is an interesting movie that successfully reflects the Hitler's identity.
