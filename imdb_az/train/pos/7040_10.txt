This movie was very good for the following reasons: 1) It had many backgrounds and sets. 2) This technological equivalence showed the equality of a war-torn environment. 3) John Cusack's player was terrific. He describes very good angst. 4) He showed everyone the weaknesses of the war. 5) Describes what will happen in the future in many ways. I was also very impressed with that. Hilary's player, I found most stilted. It deals with the morals and values ​​of everyone in war. Liberal journalist and conservative businessman can do something in any situation and is unlikely to be unexpected. Great things. PSP
