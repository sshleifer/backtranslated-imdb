Ice Age is not just an animated year (in my eyes), but also the best animation feature I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Teaser last year excited me and very happy hours web site. Scrat is cool! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Your heart truly is a symbol of this movie. They have good dialogue lines and are well developed. <br /> <br /> Their journey was laughter, tears, and surprise. Nothing could have been forced. The feeling was really dramatic in the second half, especially. The last film that influenced me was Anastasia in 1997 and was Fox Production. Earlier 1988 was the "Land". All of these have a real charm and those who want to enjoy all the listeners are not just friends. 10/10
