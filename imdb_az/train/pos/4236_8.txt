What makes this film a duplicate, a completely different approach to the same concept. This is not an epic as the original, but rather a popcorn tension. Sight, incredible. Everything else was something else. <br /> <br /> What's this, I think the movie is awesome, but I love everything Burton did. People should be calm and do not act as this movie is the end of the world. It does not need to be rebuilt, and it is not. <br /> <br /> The latter was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
