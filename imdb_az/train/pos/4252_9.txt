this movie enters itself in the first moments and takes you to the end. there is a very humanist story and very well selected music. Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) are satisfied. It is recommended for people who want to get away from the movies and get a good movie.
