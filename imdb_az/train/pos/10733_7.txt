Looking back at this movie, she really brought back some great childhood memories. I am 34 years old, I have not seen since 12-14. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I watched it lately, some scenes tear me out! This little robot "Jinx" (always friends!). It was like repeating my childhood. It was a great experience for me. I always like it for this movie. I hope some readers may be involved in my experiment, not for the film, but for the film you have not seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading
