OK, this show is nothing more than AWESOME! There is a great story line and structure, and great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is very hott and perfect for that role! Hollywood is a great sin. There is a bright future in the future! This show will last for a long time because I love this show and I hope this is a great success! It is so interesting. I was expecting it for about 6 or 7 months, and I'm finally here, and that's great! I also charge. Now I can watch it anytime! It's too bad, even once a week. I wish that if it had been at least twice a week, I'd like to have it every Tuesday! <br /> <br /> I hope you all like this show! <br /> <br /> Ashley ~
