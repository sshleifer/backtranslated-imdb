Sabrina, Teenage Witch, was one of my favorite T.V shows in my life: When I came home from school, I used every day to retrieve episodes. So far, at least once, and we have watched the entire series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl / witch with normal teenager challenges that may be associated with us. He is ridiculous, smart, wandering, witty and more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick are in a very good part of Sabrina's trajectory. Zelda, a clever scientist and Hilda, creates a perfect balance in a delirious and illogical Sabrina life. I have to admit that college years are not as good as a high school year, but that does not mean it's not good at all. I think the latter was awesome, though I did not hope it was logical and I liked it anyway. :)
