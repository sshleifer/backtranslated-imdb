At the beginning of a major action star at Nicholas Cage, he was a great actor. This little-known movie is one of Cage's best performances. "Red Rock West," a small budget, was almost an unrecognizable movie, but I'm one of the most popular films of all time. I discovered that he was going down the video shop and wanted to look with Cage and Hopper (who is also in the movie). Go, this is one and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
