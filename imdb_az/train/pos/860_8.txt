Audiard made a very interesting film here. It begins with the description of a deaf young woman as a secretary in the working universe; he is ignored, angry, rejected ... Appointing a trainee as a helper looks like a way to find someone in his life: but the guy leaves the prison. Both of them are rejected by the community and gradually bring them together. The description of the character deepens, is detailed ... both begin to help each other; <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful way. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: This is very convincing, even if finally converted to a movie, especially when it comes to Audiard's shooting." Emmanuel Devos The actress must be a Candidate for the Actes Cesar Award, and the move toward the end of the film is a simple "etude de moeurs." In fact, it's strange and fun: 8/10.
