This is one of the best works of Sam Fuller's film in 1953, and it is not a sad thing that he could not continue to work with Hollywood studios. The story line goes to something like this. A harsh tough width (read whore) slips to the metro on a hot summer day and gets a pocket book selected by Skip McCoy. Skip (and the Iron) does not understand that he also has several micro-spies related spies. This opening is shot without dialogue and, in many ways, Fuller enjoys a lot of beauty in the intense approach. Jean Peters, a child known as Candy, is a better and invisible thing. He forgets how beautiful he is and plays a very good role in this. The Pickpocket hesitated in 1947 with a terrifying scramble with a creepy laugh with the Death Kiss, and though it was a little "gentle," still scared. These harsh characters are here and there are soft spots, but its noir and nasty all the way. The magnificent performance belongs to the beautiful Thelma Ritter who plays Moe to save his dough for payment for his funeral. Ritter received a good Oscars nomination for his performance, but read Donna Reed's "From Here To Hell" movie B (read prostitution). While a good girl goes bad Hollywood loves them and their performances are generally terrifying, but she loves them Oscar. For example, Shirley Jones is set up in Elmer Gantry with black and white photography and some very good art by Big Joe MacDonald, between New York City's docks and dives. Near the Metro and the Widmark River, the villi of the piece made of the height of the cold war and red fears is more commonly a criminal offense than a criminal, but a common crime. is trying to build a life and, above all, a loyal American.
