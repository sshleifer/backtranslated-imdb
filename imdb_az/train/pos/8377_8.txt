My girlfriend and I have something for Robots. I'm trying to find movies with robots. And there are robots in this movie. Adults. They gravel and beat each other, with the fate of dependent nations. It's really cool. We must forgive this film, and when it comes to having a tough budget, we should try to see what the director and the technical team can do on the screen. It's hard not to like this movie. Due to these great robots. They seemed like Transformers and they were fighting like wrestlers! This made my girlfriend smile. And that's good for me. Special words from veteran character Paul Koslo should be made: Like a maniacal Russian man, is he intimidating his unlucky opponents after complaining of his proximity to his vagina after his long delivery or bar? he has a ball that "tastes like" (which, in a pleasing way, provides a Bela Lugosi accent on the camp bottom), always gives a great advantage over the screen. This is a little flick that is worthy of religious belief.
