Oh, I liked this movie. I think that's all. This laughs me several times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I'm writing a girl's perspective. I think only 5.2 points in the rating. Will many people vote? It was on other romantic comedies. As a woman, I do not like all the gorgeous squirrels, but rather prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be neat and they are not as funny as they want. But as I said, this movie was almost in my opinion. Great script, good liners, nice action. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character recalls Gabrielle than Desperate Housewives, what is it? It was spectacular. I feel this movie rainy days, days down, and I'll need some laughs.
