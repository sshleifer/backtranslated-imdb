A TIME FROM THE DARK IN THE DARKS I was expecting a movie to feature an extraordinary performance and a fun movie from Meryl Streep. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <STRONG> </ strong> </ strong> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> is built on every level. <br /> <br /> The movie is classic. <br /> <br /> The film is very slowly open, and the audience is sitting at a comfortable pace at Chamberlain, and is basically an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (director), Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) chose random moments to capture a family by pointing to the remarkable grace of Chamble's children. <br /> <br /> Famous line "A Dingo took my baby!" Today has become a punchline, the movie was not near the smile. The true death of Azari was seized terribly. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film is held in courtrooms and is aimed at persistent struggle to prove Circummen's innocence against the press and the court. <br /> <br /> Lindy is suspected of murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that we are talking about the innocence we describe in the beginning provides for more tension. As a spectator as a member, I fully spent the grip on Chamelea ... and when it looked so awkward by the media, it was really angry and damaged and sad. But at the same time, the media / public opinion is clear. <br /> <br /> I liked that the media did not have any tools to make the effort, but there were always enough reasons to keep their opinions. <br /> <br /> The final line of the film is very deep and a perfect element of this movie is different from other drama dramas. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, those who really matter in this movie are Streep and Neill ... and all surrender. For me this is one of Meryl Streep's best performances (if not # 1). Streep, of course, is very effective for all the craftsmanship of various accents, never loses the heart and soul of the characters. I think it is one of Streep's more delicate performances, and it pulls him out of the park. And Neill, an actor who never influenced me to be characteristic and attractive at JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect spot for Streepin's performance. This is undoubtedly the most beautiful thing Neillin ever had. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that the actor is an actor whose nomination is not recognized by the Actor. With Streepin ... b / c, both play brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies are more emotionally captivating, and also incredibly durable ... THE ONE ANYTHING OF THE WORLD was more than my expectations. I advise people who know only the film as Meryl's "Dingo took my baby". <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
