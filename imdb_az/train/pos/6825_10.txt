I was totally blown up by John Cassavetes' Opening Night. The first film he sees is a wider appearance, so it feels even more, but he still does not feel himself more preoccupied with his earlier films. Perhaps this is so intense. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes, who is also a career director, says there is nothing to worry about watching the movie, saying it is an ideology behind her camera. <br /> <br /> Here is the expression in front of you. The character of Rowland, middle-aged stage actress Myrtle Gordon, will not be able to play in the role of the upcoming production, so as to follow the impulse after evolution, giving the scene a seemingly chaos and finding the right thing to do. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is unable to handle a congenital steering wheel during an emotional cleansing. No one knows why Myrtle understands most of what he's doing. It is portrayed as a seemingly destructive thing, but it can be the best thing to do. This can not be a crash, but a cleansing. A withdrawal, a cocoon, a rebellion, all this is a collapse. Cassavetes welcomes his character with a painful real touch. It aggravates the fact that he has nothing to do with his nature at an early stage, but he is afraid of calm but emotionally corroding fear. <br /> <br /> The final scene, the two-floor performance Myrtle plays with a characteristic part away from him is one of the most exciting, entertaining, challenging, striking, enlightening and entertaining moments I've ever seen. movie
