When I see what I look at most, it is called "a single accident for Eddie Murphy." These critics want to look at some of the things we've been doing these days, and maybe they're gentle backward ... The Golden Boy is not too funny, but thanks to some shooting, the old new life breathes Cliché and Murphy into one of their best roles. I do not understand the lack of "love" for my efforts. Probably the simultaneous release, knockabout, excitement-a-minute adventures have been released at one time? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; It is unfair to commit this sin if its greatest sin is completely harmless. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's foolish, but sometimes the observer must understand that Hollywood's idea of ​​mysticism is "ridiculous" when it starts and ends. What's even more important than conviction with such a story is to entertain the tour guide, which is for the audience to show them mysterious places. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy are eligible for this ability. I advise you to buy tickets and ride.
