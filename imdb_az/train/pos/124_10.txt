* There are spoilers for me to describe some movie techniques, so read it at your own risk! <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. Using some images in color is similar to the life of an old photo. I also enjoyed the projection of people on the back screen. For example, Leopold calls on his wife at a scene, and is predicted to follow, not on a typical split screen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ em> </ em> <br /> <br /> <strong> he approached face to face. This reminded me of the Battleship Potemkin, which, in its tense, steadfast style combined with a red-era eruption, carried very horrible tones. When Katharina found her father in the wind, the same thing as the event ... you can only see the red water on the side. <br /> <br /> The use of the text in the film was unique, as was the case with Leun, this is one of my favorite things about Von Trier. pushed the word, "Kurtadam". I have never seen anything like this in the movie. <br /> <br /> In this film, the use of black comedy was good. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is as big as Leo's uncle. It presents the snickers (Riget) from the roles in the Kingdom. This humor builds absurd anal retrograde of train conductors, regardless of WW2's awesome background and all chaos. The hospital administrator remembers Riget as he maintained his normality at the end of a part of the party when everything went crazy. It shows that it does not really forget the horrific events around some people. But some people, such as Leo, are regulated, but they will not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Well-developed voice by Max von Sydow, very entertaining. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> the side. I do not speak of the character of Bjork, and I see the same idea used in Dark, Dancer, ending with his own disgust. In fact, once Von Trier wore the Wave and the Dancers and wore the woman over me, but now I know her men's characters are not good! At the end of the dancer, I found myself, when I wanted to re-think the actions of the main character, but of course, never!
