Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler's stories have been portrayed as a fox in a movie theater - in fact, this is the only way to create a contemporary American genre and style - the Golden Age artistic titles but any impression. The problem with books such as Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, or SS Van Dine (whose work is based on this film) is their degree of movement or diversity, while Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe moves on LA streets, working classrooms, bars, offices, rich hosts , thrilling threats and all forms of violence, Golden Age fiction, the scene of a murder scene, usually a luxury country, and is limited to investigations and clues to the suspects. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, the Golden Age stories, which, like anything else, are engaged in a society that is opposed to ideological, change and action; romantic novels, separating themselves from the reality of a city (both from the power and the city) by dividing itself into enemy, unmanaged and illegal camps. Another problem with the Golden Age fantasy is that we can not access the motivation or emotions of the characters identified by the potential needs of the hero because he can not answer the murder. <br /> <br /> One of the most popular films of the Golden Age books is to work for the era, which, in contrast to prejudiced special eyes, is detective, simply brilliant and perhaps a little eccentric. The merchant is looking for rest and silly at the Ivory / Jane Austen school. There have been successes like the Ellery Queen and others' radical reworkings by Claude Chabrol. There are really two people in the English-speaking world. Alistair Sim classic, "Green for Danger," works for the parody of the case, in fact, does not betray the secrecy or interests. <br /> <br /> Before that, Michael Curtiz's brilliant 'The Kennel Murder Case'. The narrative is pure Golden Age. A kickback character that presents a potential suspect to kill him is presented. He fell into a locked room, murdered properly in a sense that he committed suicide. Cartoon cops are desperate for food. Philo Vance, the gentleman and the amateur detective, is an intellectual stimulus that neither the old nor the fat, the tips are read more deeply, and the corpse is somewhat inconvenient to eventually get out of the room. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this detective is just a dissatisfaction with all the solutions - though less fun and funny stuffing. There is no real attempt to 'overtake' the look of the perfect detective - there is an exciting scene where a single sergeant threatens to coerce a suspect without objection from Vance, but that is it. <br /> <br /> Classic 'Kennel' brands are its contemporary. Curtis is not generally regarded as a great auteur because it has no consistent themes and no evidence of artistic development. But Hollywood's greatest artist, and here he is in a form of sensation. If the Golden Age Detective story is not just a puzzle, Curtis's idea is logical, extreme in the source, narrative, character, and geometry, and cuts off a beautiful art deco set. <br /> <br /> This treatment is a story that decisively rejects the reality, which is an example of a mirrored mirror of two detectives, with a ghostly camera movement that flies directly from a static composition and an angle of angle or "the innocent mysteries" of the original crime. Eastern remains ("Moonstone" shadows), unknown Chinese servants, old consumers, dog-loving chips, Runyonesk police, a perfect living environment for those Vents, who know the social world of those people, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Therefore, he is the 10th largest American comedian, Powell, boldly destroys his own humanity. <br /> <br /> However, if treatment rarely occurs, the peaks are accusing them. The police and the detainee intended to prevent crime may be accused of inciting one another.
