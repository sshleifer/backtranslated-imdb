At the end of the best part of America in Paris, Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the longest ballet sequence of a few great artists. Kelly was originally set up as a pianist in Paris, so consistent life and energy are the source of music with Gershwin melodies, and leaves members like Georges Guet√© and Oscar Levant. Kelly was the best here - it was a bit different from Singin in the rain, and the effect of the whole movie as a ballet gave him a certain woe factor. After all the other MGM musical moments, 'This Entertainment' has ended!
