JACKNIFE Stephen Metcalfe's Strange Snow (scriptwritten by Metcalfe) is a perfect adaptation of the long-forgotten effect of the war against veterans who have been severely harassed by David Hugh Jones, who are constantly damaged by the horrors of accidents. <br /> <br /> Returning to this movie in 1989 when watching the treatments we received at the War Veterans and Veterans Hospital in Iraq, Three friends went to Vyetnama War and only two people returned: the problem was that both men suffering from a battle were seriously damaged by a David 'Highschool' Flannigan (Ed Harris) post traumatic stress syndrome, is a drunken vacuum in a very harsh way, with her sister, Martha (Kathy Baker). When David's friend Joseph returned to the city to help 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro). During the events, Jacknife helps Martha and eventually should be present at Prom Martha for two days - in David's pumpkin, she's completely destroyed, ruining the school and scaring the city's population and students. When Jackie lost her friends, Downie brought the moment in Vietnam and brought it to a point where David could be rebuffed. All three actors give amazing performances: Ed Harris offers one of the most prestigious roles, De Niro and Baker have high standards of their career. This should help more people to revive this forgotten movie. Because wars are a small warning to the men who fought against them and to the families who received them after the battle. Be advised.
