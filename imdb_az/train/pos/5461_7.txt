Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, simply betraying), departs from a branch office in Gotham, the largest city in the world by escaping from the burial of her father, who died in the blast (and speakeasy waitress). When Lily's new lover (and Lily's new lover) kills a lapeled lover, Lily knows when he writes various relationships with a diary and gentleman, if he knows that the sky limit will accept his paper, if the payment does not come to him. The Bank's new president, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of rubbing many doughs, but soon he finds himself mad at the end of various encounters in Love City. It makes Lily's mouth water to succeed now and enriches the way to richness and reputation. Although there are conditions that will make his decision to threaten his lucrative path to achieve his wealth ... Now his wife, Trenholm, is sentenced to prison and has lost a bank. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is not the whole movie despite the usual Warner Brothers. Filmmakers created during the pre-codenamed period allow them to imagine that they can lead to natural disasters as well as to women who are sexually exploited for success. The good direction of Alfred E Green shows the subtle tricks in various behaviors and speeches, doing well with Stanwyck's attractive performance, and can actually do something without showing the obvious movements. Clearly, the film shows that money does not belong to everything, and that jazz, like love, is in the heart of Lily's dead heart. Lily's miraculous metamorphosis ended up in love, and she did not tell me right. He has spent all that time on the platform to fall into a person who is different from the others he used to.
