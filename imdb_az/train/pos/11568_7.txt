Bob Clampettin, one of the many animated Merri Melody animated films during the Second World War, portrays a hobo piri placed on the dog of the Elmer Fudd's portal, The Time In A Time. The little man becomes a real sadist when building a dog behind a dog, but Elmer warns the dog: "Once again, I'll give you a bath and give you a bath!" Meanwhile, a dog creates dynamite! * And that's not the end! On a scene I saw that Elmer bugs read a comic book with Bunny and Porky Pig. Of course, Elmer and Bugs are often a co-singer, but Elmer has never played with Porky ever (you have very short "any bonds today?"). But Elmer's thoughts of reading other famous characters from the same genre, though he does not appear in this animated film, is the metaphysical nature of his world, as he knows his existence in the universe. <Br /> <br /> Of course, in my analysis I am very far away. I am sure that the cartoon is designed as a clean entertainment and, of course, is fun. As for the line "I can be like this," it sounds like scenarios do not allow, but it's something they've missed quite a bit; First of all, I did not know exactly what to say. Was it sex? Until the end, I saw everything and thought that I would have to seek more than what the cats do (even though it's a neat trick). <br /> <br /> * Children behind these cartoons had something to do with TNT, did not they?
