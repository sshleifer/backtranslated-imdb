This movie surprised me. Some things were "clicheish" and some of the technological elements reminded Will Smith's role as the "State Enemy" film. But the most part is very entertaining - a good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief). This is a movie that you can watch again ... when it's nothing else on Wednesday night. I gave 9 for the value of entertainment.
