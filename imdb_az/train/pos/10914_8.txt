I saw the series Thin Man - Powell and Loy are definitely great, but with this flick, there is something very complicated about Powell and Arthur's chemistry. Looking at the powder, Jan Arthur SHINES. There is a situation where they can not be leaked between them. This movie may not have the Thin Man series's mind, but it certainly undermines the charm. While I was watching it, I thought I was doing off-screen work with Powell Arthur. My friends thought the same. This is a movie that I want to come back in time (with Pauell to lock and lock your lips!) No end to his favorite playful barks! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man". Okay, this is a very sounds, but I can not help myself.
