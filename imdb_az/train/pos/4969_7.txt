It's great to see Shane Meadows already having an international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT ROMEO shares a room with one room for ROMEO BRASS: overwhelming but moderate, unseted father, abandoned urban environment, failure, challenging secret fascism that supports the modern city life. <br /> <br /> If Meadows is an expert formalist, Mariage sells pictures and cools it, compositions, delicate surreal, monochrome frames, like Meadows, from the highs to the disaster in seconds. <br /> <br /> There are leaders and clicks, but Poelvoorde is an ordinary man with a compelling argument, ordinary ambitions; attempts to implement them are dangerous; while individual sets are popcorn / pidon explosions; Since death and uncertainty, maintain the best of the marriages - avoiding despair.
