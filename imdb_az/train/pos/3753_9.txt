This short film, which soon became the full length feature - Spatula Madness - a hilarious piece that fights many writers like cartoons. Short film stars are dismissed, and Edward Spatula joins the fight against bad spoons. This premise allows some funny content near the start, but not available for the rest of the feature. The 15-minute operation of this film is made with a number of comedy and a small music number. Unfortunately, there's nothing else to do below. There is no time to really show the plot. But there is something better about it than many budget Hollywood films. It's worth watching at least a couple of times. Do what you can for this and do not expect a deep story.
