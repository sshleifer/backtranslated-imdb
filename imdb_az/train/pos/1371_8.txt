This film is a pleasant, light hearted look on both sides where the "club kids" rave scene is blended with New York's art, music and performance art worlds (everywhere by a Missing by Miss Bunny). This is the "Torch Song Trilogy" for crazy post-teen girls. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is based on Miss Posey's very stylish platform heels and it is perfectly designed. As it works many things, it can not be too deep, often unique and good, posey ... but all work. <br /> <br /> Mary is a fashion designer of a surface party. <br /> <br /> Mary is a superficial party maker. does not prefer to steal a designer's dress from a friend's cabinet or to be carried out by someone else's lover. At a deeper level, it is a story about a girl and her friends of all other people, including those of other people; and the learning process of care is essential to life. <br /> <br /> The Scenario is a well-groomed, witty and dishonest work that has a very versatile and sensitive role; a more nuanced performance would deepen the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... this is a comedy. It is a staggering deep roles that give the film a look at some items and the world, a swelling that sells her lover. We are all fortunate ... Is it for Mary? or someone moving away? <br /> <br /> I estimate it as 8, because it's not a big memory of movie history, it is not classic, and it's not a great art (it's deeper and deeper into deeper). Like "Susan Susan," it reflects many truths about the time period, but it can not be associated with time. Still, it has everything you need for a fun movie, and it's worth watching alone for a few times!
