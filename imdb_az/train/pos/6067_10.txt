Though I'm forced to agree with the comments of the people you've seen, I feel ashamed of it. It is not always possible for such a large meeting to be on the edge of Wham since the 1980s! video, so it is very clear (one night at Â£ 0.79 in my local store). "Hero" Keith Chegwin and many looks like classic lines like: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "Finally, we meet with Kor ... Watch out for monster's suit, insanely clear seams and zip ..." Kor ": "It's strange, is not it?" It's strangely unusual that the video box is a security film with a beautiful hero like the castle images surrounded by dark seas and a dangerous hawk - Hero's "exciting and attractive" suggestions no one is actually happening.) No, I'm not joking ... a sea or a strange bird, this is something that interests you ... in my opinion, is classic.
