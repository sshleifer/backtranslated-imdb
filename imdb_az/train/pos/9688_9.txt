I'm interested in films that talk to animals. For anyone who is as beautiful as Babe, Homeward Bound becomes equally poor as an awesome update called The Incredible Journey. Or, in the Cats & Dogs case, there is a great idea for a movie that is inappropriate. When I heard about Paulie, the foundation of a clever carnage did not fully trust me. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Russian worker Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) is starting his research lab. One day she sings a song from the basement. And when he examines, he finds a little parrot in his chest. The mice can admire the bird, especially when the parrot can not. Or a few phrases. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> wondering how the intelligent bird of the world was set up in a dusty basement, Misha Paulie agreed to tell the story of life. All of them began at infants and took care of the stupid five-year-old Marie. <br /> <br /> Marie's parents were worried about a close friendship with the bird, and they thought it was far away. Finally, after Marie Paulie's training to fly, she finally made himself wound up in a fall. Paulie begins a long way in the US to create confusion for joining with it, which involves many new owners, flies at long distances, and even ends in bars. <br /> <br /> Paulie is one of several talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> Paulie has succeeded on a number of levels and is a wealth of intelligence, despite the fact that Paulie does not have the same recognition or box office success. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's stand is in line with Paulie's part. Even though he is part of the clever Alecin, in fact, no part is likely to play. <br /> <br /> Paulie's secular, but it is also naive in his path. <br /> Because she should wait for the first time she lives with Marie. And when he fell into the hands of different owners, Paulie believed that he promised to reunite with Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is usually a little episodic. This is followed by Paulie's eclectic people, and he gradually approached Marie and how it got closer. He turned primarily into a pawn shop where Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a spiritual woman, teaches the meaning of morality. <br /> <br /> She gives Paulie's sympathy and leads her to the RV in America to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is sometimes a very touching movie. The scenes with Ivy are the best. Paulie's beautiful moments read Tom Jones's shoulders. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scene of the Prophet . heart beat <br /> <br /> The Great Canyon is a great place where you stay with them a few hours after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> A sad moment, many laughs will happen. Paulie falls in a Spanish outdoor restaurant with a parrot group. As the four birds make a perfect choreographic dance number, animatronic effects here are very good. And Paulie is even a romantic one. He was hit by a small thief (also played by Mohr). This can be my only complaint. <br /> <br /> The scene where Paulie learns to steal money from ATM machines is a bit of anxiety. I'm surprised that DreamWorks was given the opportunity to include such a scene in a child's movie. And Paulie's diamond robbery is too complicated to miss. <br /> <br /> According to Michelle, she said she had been sent to the laboratory for her animal test since that day. Of course they find Marie. But the last unit is a scene of such a shock intensity, and I was quiet for a few minutes. Paulie can not take a long-lasting Babe, but I believe it's a brilliant movie. The same laughs. The same impeccable effects. And the same amazing prospect. <br /> <br /> A small stone.
