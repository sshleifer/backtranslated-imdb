Now, for some time, I did not wait for some of the things that I saw as an admirer of Andy Goldsworthy's art and with some of his books. What I received was absolutely satisfying and a bit more than expected. Being an artist (working from clay), it is important to be inspired around us to create good art, and something that has been mastered by Andy Goldsworthy. For a year, the director who directs him has a nature that is related to nature, nature, and loyalty. The film is embraced and drunk. If you are an artisan who needs inspiration or anyone who needs an uplifting experience, you will see THIS MOVIE. I do not know that Andy is in one place. Fight with nature forces, dance, wrestle to make our world more beautiful.
