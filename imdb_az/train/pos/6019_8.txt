ZP is closely related to the dream of young people represented by the hippie movement. At the beginning of the movie, college debates are related to the cultural situation that causes this movement. Daria's imagination suggests the collapse of all social structures and hence the development of all major transgressions of society, and ultimately the death of Mark, in anticipation of the Movement itself. If we return to that era in life, the film will be easier to understand. During the 1960s and 1970s, young people were in a position to move into deeper research for change. One of the more significant changes was to keep sex secret and I think scenes in the desert are not an orgy, but sexually explicit men and women are in hypothetical condition. no one will hide. I watched the scene where the couples slipped into one another, and this was a spectacular way of describing how it could not continue to conceal the basic human instinct. Repression was the way to "control" the social crisis in that period, and this was the way police used to stop students. This society suffers from hypocrisy and it becomes evident when students pass all weapons and go into weapons. The dialogue with a college professor, who is unchallenged by the police, shows a part of society that is interested in the youth feeling and is completely uninteresting. While delivering the flight as a more accurate symbol of freedom, the stealing of the aircraft reflects Mark's internal wishes, but his return or return (segun) shows the difficulty of being released from these gardens, and A describes the death of the dream with these difficulties of the game. To remember a movie from my point of view.
