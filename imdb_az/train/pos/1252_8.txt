The infinite boundaries of our hatred, in our turn, amaze me. This is a terribly insulting and mostly irresistible story of an ears-free population that is compulsory, well documented, and angry. As an American, I always insult the behavior of my country and this is in our long catalog, which has been discussed internationally. We breastfeed. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I've ever seen, but I just wanted to see what to do with me. My only complaint and just 8 out of 10 films, Pilger shows us this trafficking and the terrible cooperation between the US and UK governments, and we demand that our viewers / our citizens take part in our actions ... but they do not offer any help. I did not know about Britain, but it was not possible for American citizens to participate in government affairs. It can help these islands that move in the right direction.
