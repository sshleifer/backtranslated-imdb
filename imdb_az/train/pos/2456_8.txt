When I went to watch this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I would be watching a younger flick many times, but in fact the plot was interesting and well executed, the player was somewhat convincing - especially Melville who actually showed his ability in this movie, this film deserves more recognition for the audience. It's a movie that can be seen by the whole family - perhaps not a small kid, because there are many rude scenes. A movie about love and problems that may arise when you are against family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is like "bending like Beckham", but in fact I think it's a better way to film.
