As I read a lot, many people have been disappointed in this movie compared to Part 1. At first I could understand it, but after thinking a little, I think they are wrong. Soderbergh continues his life based on truth, which began in Part 1 of his life. Part 1 tells a story of a revolution that has succeeded as a result of unexpected beginnings. Part 2 explains a revolutionary story that goes from unexpected beginnings to a totally unsuccessful conclusion. Soderbergin is not guilty of these two parts of China's life that have completely different consequences. He chooses to speak boldly and quite simply. The follower may feel better after Part 1 after Part 1, but in my opinion is not the fault of the director, but the reality of Che's life. The movie is far from perfect. Probably too long. At least part 1 saw the various aspects of the war as the guerrilla successes. In Part 2, they can not keep a break, and we see their numbers constantly in death and retreat. Che's capture and death are solved in a good way. The film is greatly enhanced by the Spanish-speaking dialogue. Benicio Del Toro is better than charismatic Argentine. So, when you see Part 1, you will see a very similar statement about a very different story in Chapter 2.
