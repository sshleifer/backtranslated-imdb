This film really feels like. This story is simple and realistic, perfectly reflecting the happiness and concern of adolescent love and sex. <br /> <br /> Actresses, like figures in a documentary, are as convincing and charismatic as native, old-fashioned performers. Dialogue was fresh and honest ... and gratitude was not filled up with pop culture references. Also, the cinematography immediately brings out a gritty and beautiful, Lower East Side setting very clearly. <br /> <br /> I have realistic films like the great Italian neo The Bicycle Thief and La Strada because I love this movie at an artistic level. The movies are rarely felt as "real" ... or as a bicycle thief. Another film I've seen on the same level of sexual intercourse is Eliada Elian Kazan's Splendor. Writer / director Peter Sollett deserves a great praise. This movie is a great success. <br /> <br /> I am pleased to see a film that loves and respects the members of American society at a personal level. As an Italian-American, I do not hate the movies in my own people's cinema (racist, feminine, genius episodes that irritate genius episodes), and in this way, my hardships are sharply sensitive to other groups and their terrifying silver screen. Especially the Indians and Asians, cursed in the West, and those who play in the motion films are cursed. (Good thing Gong Li did not try to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks to the upsurge of indie and Miramax's effects, we have taken a few more pictures. ethnicity here and there ... But Victor Vargas's development is one of the best. I really love the great Fat YUNAN wedding, though it is also very funny, though Victor Vargas (with exaggerated and extravagant characters) is made. Finally! Notable Latino character. <br /> Of course, this is a beautiful picture of a family from the Dominican Republic. Now, Peter Sollett, Soon A Movie about Italians! :) - Marc DiPaolo
