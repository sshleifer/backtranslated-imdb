Another Woo masterpiece! <br /> <br /> This is the best wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except for some Hollywood moments). John Woo is a great director of the century. <br /> <br /> Perhaps hello is more intellectual than the Greater Managers ... But he is the lyrical and moral idol of all free people! <br /> <br /> His films like the great poet! Woo is a Film Sugar! Woo is a Movie Anyone! Woo Bloodshet is a Mozart! <br /> <br /> In Woo movies IMHO violent directors are not bloody, art tools. The theme of Woo movies is more humanistic than new films.
