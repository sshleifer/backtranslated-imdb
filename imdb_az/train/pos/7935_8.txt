There were so many things to survive before the launch of the Dead Lights. First, any game on the "dead dead" calls Mr. Romero, who respects Holiness, and is a high standard that many films can not be abused. Secondly, my friend, watching my movie, would have preferred the horror film Hoodda seminal Leprechauna of any city. Surely, we were settled to watch. <br /> <br /> We were awarded a surprisingly sincere and good-hearted zombie film. Oh, of course the budget is low and, of course, the fans of directors live in castles, but loves Living Dead's Hoodu zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes. But when it's cheaper, you can see the place where LOVE is stored together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in the lab during the day and comes to his younger brother as a parent at night. He wanted to leave Oakland. However, before the scheduled run, his brother was shot and killed by the driver. Ricky's sophisticated scientific idea offers a choice of CPR or 911: injections of the experimental restorative formula in his lab. Unfortunately, a small ambulance woke up like a bloody Oakland zombie! Chaos and Mayhem! I think that eating more than taking revenge on your enemies is much more economical, but still I consider poor urban life as a poor judge. (How bad is Judge?) In response to an erroneous scene covering four people, "Ah, yes, white t-shirts for everyone showed that from the economic point of view, I used them in their scary film of our own budget." "Jordan" replied, "No, it's a sweater. <br /> <br /> Many of the film is a living room, so there are many things the zombies have to wait and expect, but the characters are sympathetic and the film is sincere - the budget is superior to the spirit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < is the first zombie movie I've ever seen with my boots, and the real zombies are increasingly infected with an ordinary stain, but quite unusual headscarves do not work - killing heartbeats, and zombie strikes prove that their absence is a real death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lovely zombie: zombie certainly!
