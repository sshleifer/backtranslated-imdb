Possible Spoilers: Late Chamomiles <br /> <br /> Rarely, in a movie, there are very nice and memorable actors (almost completely actresses). Although it seems to be a few people, each one is a screen. British people acknowledge that this comedy and real spouses are better than IMO, so most actors were Brits. <br /> <br /> Music is great; (Leslie Caron really plays good, maybe who knows?) However, Clio Lane was expressing himself - his hot visceral voice is still becoming my crank as a few other jazz performers. <br /> <br /> An old musician like myself, of course, is not so old, of course, a heartwarming film, though not in this class, a great film for anyone interested in whether it is in their profession or in the past . no matter what kind of avocation. And of course, scene life is a big celebration. <br /> <br /> I missed a bit of landing, but temporarily 9/10 - and of course we want to see the whole thing.
