About a man in Michigan who was replaced by a defective father (Gunnar Hansen) by his past and was not perfectly corrected. In fact, he is totally bonkers but tends to be very clear. There is also a little beside him, his little devil and the angel who followed him. Demon says a word, but really does not need it and it's Max Schreck-creepy. Let's just say that the elder turns his wheel just as he deals with things that feel good about himself. It's like "releasing" those who need it, mostly beautiful young women. This is a worthy illustration of a madness and you treat yourself to some of the things that have been taking place for a while, but I have watched this movie since I was very attentive at all. In some areas there is some shortage, but I really can put my finger on it. If you like scenario scenes of serial killer, it is a good effort and worth seeing.
