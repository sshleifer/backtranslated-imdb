Have fun with a dark and stormy night, and get ready to have fun, get angry and afraid of it alternatively. It is incredible to have an incredible old building around a ghost train, when it dies at night, to a single English village to go through, but that's a very fun thing. There are some nice old clicks, such as "QAZAN", where people can remember, but will not talk. But first of all, the film is a tool for the comedian Arthur Askey to demonstrate his vivideville-style humor among the fears. The dark humor of Aske is not very fashionable in these days, but you have fun. This is probably the best of Askey movies.
