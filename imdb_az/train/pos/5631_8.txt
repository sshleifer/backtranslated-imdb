Kudos could play Fawcett's role as controversial. <br /> <br /> Favcett is just a follow-up woman and then kept by actor James. Russo. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarvid has a little role as a companion at home, like Alfre Woodard. Woodard, the victim of aggression, is concerned about the legal consequences when Fawcett takes revenge on the guilty. Russo is a classic of hot oil, which throws a frying pan, and the striker deserves it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Recommend. 8/10.
