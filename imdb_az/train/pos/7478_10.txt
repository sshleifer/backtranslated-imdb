I am Romanian, I will try to speak English. I want to talk about this whole movie, it's always my number and it will be. You've seen at least 30 times and you'll see this over the years. There are all the little things I love in a movie, and many touches me crying. It reflects many twisted love and questions about the true things that are important to love and reality and to different people. This is the most important thing for me, that is love, the spirit of man, the inner being and I see it in this movie. Perhaps there is more for me than a movie, this is a proof that you really can exist and that you can benefit from the best out of every time you live with your spouse. This is a fantastic catastrophe, but .. if. Will all capitalism disappear and if the economy falls, it will fall? We will be worried about all other issues, and I think that the bigger thing you remember in the deathbed is not wealth, not adventure, the countries you are visiting, and people who remember you. But true friends, the true love and the hope of your dying, the curse of God will be perfect, and people will be better and more careful. THIS IS MOVIE AND I guess it will guide me for your life :) I greet Romania
