I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought tickets and evaluated the IMDb ratings. I'm concerned about seeing a bad movie. Well, I enjoyed watching movies. <br /> <br /> Buffy means Vampire Slayer was almost as terrible as that. <br /> <br /> I do not consider it a bad movie. This is not a big movie. It's just a pretty horror film. It does not rely on camera angles, action or music, rather than special effects. In my opinion, the player was good. Sarah did a pretty convincing job. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> br> <br /> The horrors were often predicted. But not always. I've seen some horror and now I'm scared, but at least twice. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> The movie's garbage tracks in the movie, simple special effects for ghosts, the boy's eyes, any noise-causing cat, gurgling dead boy, and his mother. <br /> <br /> You want to see Sarah in another buffy episode, because it is very different from buffy work. Do not go if you just want to see films that collect Oscars. A good horror movie, a decline enough. I gave him 7.
