UC 0079, The War of One Year is almost over. Neutral colony of Side 6 Cyclops is targeted by the Zeon working group. Their goal is to build the new Gundam just for Newtypes (probably originally built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam epic). Al Izuruha, an admirer of Zeon MS, feels friendly with the new pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman when faced with Zaku after the end of the colony. Two good friends are recognized as honorary members of the Al Cyclops team. Thanks to the show, Berin Al (his father is always working) and Athletic Federation pilot Christina McKenzie appear to be an invisible father, but ultimately to respond to the battle. <br /> <br /> For just 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is well illustrated. Mobile suits are extremely well designed and animated to look at the history, but really show emotions in characters. If you like 0083, check it out or start a new Gundam world with a good show. If you look at a show for drama and character development, this is something for you, and then pay more attention to the mobile costume fighting. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War in the Pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
