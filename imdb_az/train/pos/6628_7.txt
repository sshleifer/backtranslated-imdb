I saw this movie in an avant-garde at the Imagina festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first novel four years ago and from now on I was waiting for the final result. <br /> <br /> This is a full 3D 3d film with high contrast black and white. Inspired by some comic books like F. Miller. In this optics, R. Rodriguez's perfect "Sin City" adaptation goes a step further. <br /> <br /> The massive use of Motion Capture is not a Gray or Medium Color, but a graphic style this time (almost) not really seen in the animated film (wait for the scanner to darken). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The futuristic story (Paris 2053) is a classic science fiction film and keeps interested audiences. until the end. <br /> <br /> Despite a classic basic plan (a study far away from its initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring issues (genetic, definite power of certain companies ...) are of great interest to this film. this is an animated film, it's not obvious to kids. No funny pet or foolish family here can not find a spiritual, just cold reality. <br /> <br /> I've found that this is one of the best sides of the film: we still feel good Parisi, but with a nice touch Futurism. <br /> <br /> However, I want to make a few mistakes. The assembly is sometimes a bit flat, one or two clich√©s slow motion effect and some bad dialogues. Although technically good, in some romantic sequences (a bit like the "final fantasy"), it shows its limitations. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is very little. <br /> <br /> Generally, if possible, watching is a successful artistic problem. Director, Christian Volckman knows how happy he is to avoid potential traps (probably they have not pushed John Woo to work!). <br /> <br /> Reading, explosion visuals, a clever story and beautiful art direction. <br /> <br /> Forgive me for spelling mistakes.
