This is a perfect movie for women's bodybuilders and women's movements! I think Sue Price has done a great deal in this series of films (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great warrior. There is a very striking look and iron will to resist powerful springs (Nemesis 2). Even though it's not a movie that's got a perfect movie and Sue Price's best-selling experience, the movie itself is a priceless stone for the fans of the women's bodybuilding movement! Some parts of what Nemesis 2 have been copied by other well-known fantastic movies such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. Here, A. Puyn plays a very powerful bodybuilder in the film, so he can show his energy and body talent the best we can. I really enjoyed this movie and watched the same excitement with Nemesis 3 (pretty dull sequel) and Nemesis 4 (more than 3 interesting results). The impression that has not yet been shown is :-(
