Marion Davies is traveling with stars named "Show the people" in this gigantic comedy by MGM in 1928. Davies plays with his father Savannah (Georgia) sea pool, Dell Henderson (Hollywood in Hollywood). They are a nail to the jalipia - Davies are like a charming southern costume. Davies works in the slapstick comedy, not his desires, but brings success. He meets William Haines, the son of the physician, who was immediately caught with him. Well, Davies begins to work in a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and hires extreme period numbers. A beautiful but fraudulent actor (Andre Telefair) shows his ropes as his typical ambitious Hollywood star. Davies left a spouse and a father for a good life, but of course, he really does not know who he is. Mary Davies, with an excitement - a "serious" actress needs a sense of emotion. William Haines is his usual comedy and Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other well-known stars of the day, including film director King Vidor. Sound pictures are a silent movie with a few "sound effects" because they come to their senses. A movie treasure.
