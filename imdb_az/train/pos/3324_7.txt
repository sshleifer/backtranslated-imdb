One mastered the difficult assignment of uniting romantic sports. In fact, it will go somewhere like sports and romantic oil and water. So, to put one on a good display on each other ... well, it is equal to the splitting of the atom. I never thought of that. I generally do not like romantic comedies ... first of all, I like most sports and sports. This movie was a good mix of both. To be a baseball fan, I appreciate the comedic test of Boston, a red fan of Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon). Everyone who knows anything about baseball knows 86 years of Baben's curse for neglecting Redsox, and they know how many Redsx bosses are inferior to. Farrely's brothers did a good job and made it a good comedy. It was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
