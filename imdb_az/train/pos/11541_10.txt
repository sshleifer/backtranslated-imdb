Matthau and Lemmon are the best in this movie - everyone in the movie is great. The dialogue is excellent and very, very clever, and the scene where Lemmon's character is trying to erase their sinuses in a restaurant round me down with laughter whenever I see it. Anyone who has seen a great sequel should not return from the original. I would recommend this beautiful movie to anyone - I just love it. And Jack Lemmon plays his character straight forward with tragic overtones, just in my opinion is hilarious. These two big guys come together and film, but this is the best - undoubtedly.
