Tea Leoni plays a serious photographer Nora Wilde, who has a bad divorce. He wants his freedom, but it comes at a cost. He wants to legalize the photos, but he hires to work as a paparazzi for hats. His director is performed by beautiful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was often well written. TEA's Nora has become a very memorable character, but the network just did not support the comedy, and it did not happen yet. When they brought George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes in casting and symbols. The show was beautiful at the beginning and accustomed to the audience, but the network was bent like a bad plastic surgery.
