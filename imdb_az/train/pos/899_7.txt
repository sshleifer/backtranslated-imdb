I watched this movie together with my whole family. When my younger sister has recently married, we can keep in touch. The film comes out for the classic touches given to romance couples. Fortunately, this time Ranikhet Almora and so on. All local cities, such as the city, have already been contacted by a large number of urban residents. Dialogue dialogue is better than what Umrao Jaan Ada has. Background music enhances the "soft focus" of the movie. Sometimes I was justified by reminding VV Chopra's "Kareeb", neha and Bobby's character. Here, the pair of lead will not be visible or inactive in any department. Support casting is very good. I appreciate the actor playing Bhabhi in the front line. The situations in which family relationships are described are real and smile when you find yourself in one of the characters. The songs were very appropriate for the scene, and the film was good. <br /> <br /> Although Ravindra Jain's film is up to Ramayana, I did not see Ram Lahman badly. <br /> <br /> There was no double collateral (Sivan category), bikini, no intrigue or nonsense. . If you're already busy, you can easily watch the movie with your parents. Here, I would like to express my sincere insistence on the fact that Syrian marriages offer not only families but individuals, but also their approach to their individualization. The movie just happened on Prem & Poonam, the remaining characters coincided. Art that believes in art? "Peripheral characters" are passed on to the background and the only heroes are leading pairs. <br /> <br /> When it came back, everything was almost great. Except for drama part. The tragedy has been artificially created. The result, sacrifice and heart changes are not heartwarming. Therefore, the purpose of this type of events is to have no emotional punch. In order to pass the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a "feature film," a fairy tale was needed. But I was waiting for the coup and never came. Mohsen Bakhal's and then Alok Nath's condition went out of the country and went on top of everything. Maybe this is a tax-free situation. <br /> <br /> After the movie was over, I had a lot of questions in my mind: Did the film really end? 2 Has the movie ended?
