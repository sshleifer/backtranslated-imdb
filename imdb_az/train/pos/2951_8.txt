Yes, this is a chick pee and it moves a bit slowly, but in fact it is very good - I consider myself a person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Small, seaside summer decor is beautiful and plays well with it. The main theme of the film. Uncertain (at least not known to me) actors and actresses give realism to the film that draws you and draws you. In general, I give it 8/10. Go see it.
