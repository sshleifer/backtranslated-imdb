MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is an adorable B treiler from Joseph H. Lewis, one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood in 1963. This 65-minute Gothic stranger from Columbia Pictures, the West's poverty line after Lewis's long-term apprenticeship, the Eastern Side Kids comedy, horror melodramas (INVISIBLE GOST, the incredibly bizarre Bela Lugosi shocker) and standard studio B product, a CO-ED privacy , BOMBOURS BOMBS, SAN FRANCISCO FALCON, etc.) --- all of this has put a very good stage to come from Mr Lewis, who is highly skilled and inventive. MY JULIA ROSS (FUTURE FUTURE), presented a masterpiece that quickly and efficiently quotes a scattered and scattered tales on rare and sensitive artistic budgets. The subsequent production of Lewis, based on GUN CRAZY (1949) and BIG COMBO (1955), in spite of the expanded areas of their narrow structure, was based on realistic, clear camera work and effective low-key lights. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The young woman (Nina Foch) accepts a position in the home of an old woman (Dame Mae Witty). Two days after his arrival, he awakens in a strange house and is quite mysterious, with a new personality - an old woman's father-in-law. Stating that he says he is a victim of the nervous breakdown, he tries to understand the obvious and apparently hopeless nature of the distress. But a long time ago, it began to unravel the strange and disturbing fact behind the dark mystery that his "husband" (always dangerous George Macready) actually killed his real spouse and was duped to participate in harrowing and bad programs. Many things that distinguish this modest miracle are the undisputed touches that Lewis brings to the production and mark it as one of the really serious work of a film director.
