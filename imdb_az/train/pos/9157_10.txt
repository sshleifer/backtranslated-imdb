Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I drowned in the movie version of the late 90s, I was ecstatic! The best and most complete version of the movie's book! This version lasts a little longer, but costs a bit. Timothy Dalton is as beautiful as Rochester. I'm glad like a glamorous person, not like a normal-looking actress (Zelah Clark) Jane. I love the sets and location. This is the version to watch for anyone who is the true Jane Eyre fan! For those interested, I found this version on the DVD. I was thrilled to find the DVD on the VHS copy for almost a break.
