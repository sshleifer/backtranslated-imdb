I must be honest and say that I bought this movie for content, but because David Cubitt is in it; I know ... shallow, or not? <br /> <br /> I do not know what to expect from watching this movie, I would like to read another article, but it was almost excluded from the other websites, so I went to the world of my brothers. David Cubitt, Theo, and Colm Feore believe that Ryan is acting as the two brethren of the family, and they begin to try to recognize each other again after the death of their ancestors. While the scene where Theo Ryan found homosexual was brilliant, he literally walks on a stage and seeks to leave Ryan without notice - of course, he has. <br /> <br /> The film is very well researched and therefore incredibly sad, moving, refreshing, and celebrating life on the sections. I was away from the sad feeling that Ryan had done, and we know he was given hope and poor love by his drug addicts Teo. I told Theo that I agree with another reviewer who found the scene that said he would be the father and would go a little further because I sang his thoughts in Royan, he brutally teaches: Being a father and Teo simply says "You." <br /> <strong> <strong> Riyan> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> directive, post and so on. I will not find anything else to talk about this movie, except that it's really hard to believe that one's loved one is dead, but this is done in an extremely beautiful way. Responding to the subject and disengagement of love (oppressed and forced) speaks volumes in this world of living today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know, but this movie is incredibly animated considering the subject.
