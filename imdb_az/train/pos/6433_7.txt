Several posters, Renuchu Ingrid Bergmani, expressed his desire to show a smiling film to the camera. The short answer is a tough reality, but there are only a few choices. At this stage of his career Bergman could not be caught; In 1949, Hollywood left for a picture in Europe, fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never moved. After five cues in Italy, he was probably ready to open an artery, but after Renoir's return to where he was, he returned to Anastasia with a booty Oscar. This is one of Renoir's three d√©cor paintings, and it's better off balance than the tough Gold Coach and French Can Can. Renoir may have come out with a couple of leading wooden men with his going to Bergman, and in both cases Renoir, Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, chose two doozys from two essences. The site is actually based on a true story in the French history, but Renoir once concentrated to alleviate it once and to rebuild her father's paintings after being set up. Pastel colors resemble another film of Les Grandes Manouvres, which is not a bad thing. All this is a pleasant surprise that shows a beautiful and charismatic actress.
