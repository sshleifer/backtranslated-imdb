Hmmm, yes, this episode is too underrated. <br /> <br /> Although the bad writing is most partial and functional. I think it's good, it's getting worse. <br /> <br /> I love the orgami fragments. I love this scene when Michelle meets Tony. This is actually one of my favorite scenes on Season 1. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated Reincarnation episodes, but I always loved them. We're not good at writing. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ strong> </ STRONG> </ STRONG>
