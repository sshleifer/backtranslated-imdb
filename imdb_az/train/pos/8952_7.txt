Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. In secret, he attracted pretty normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). He splits out a magic spell in order to leave his fiancée and fall for him. Gillian is doing a great job, as long as he does not really see this man as good. She decides to speak to her secretly. But how will Spy act when he says he is "deceived" by Gillian? <br /> <br /> Deep comedies of the 1950s are increasing, Bell and Damascus are good, but there is nothing spectacular. It is quite watery enough and should apply to almost everyone who is sitting with it. Do not go to the movie waiting for the biggest thing after sliced ​​bread. The film is sometimes cute, funny and touching to the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart are doing their best and have some real chemistry. Novak (as seen by others) may seem simply unusual. A player supporting Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester, often sounds laugh-ridiculous and draws attention from Nova and Stewart. The biggest problem I have ever seen is that Bell Book and Kandil can not decide what kind of movie they want to be. Is there a vocal comedy? A romantic comedy? Is this supernatural comedy? When filmmaker Richard Quine stayed alone, the film could have been better and more memorable.
