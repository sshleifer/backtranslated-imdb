I love the old Burt Reynolds movies. They are funny and do better with each other movie combined. They could stop filming after the Cannonball Run 2, but how did they know that nothing would be better? Make this movie a good guy. Burt Reynolds needs to dress up as a chicken and drive around a race bus, and the luxury Andoron looks extremely hot in the eighties. Burt and Loni were in these days! Loni Anderson took this magazine for advertising this vacuum cleaner. Because I love the ad! The film, shot by Stroker Ace (Burty R.), is a part of the film that angrily shows and shows that a person in the audience is bending and holding his finger to show his excitement! I was very laughing, I almost went to the night! You can find this movie, rent it! And then do not look at another movie, because now I tell you: there is no point.
