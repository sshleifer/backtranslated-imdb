"Technicolor Cinematography" (Special Technical Achievement Oscar winner) is really magic. <br /> <br /> Add an infinite variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic film ghost band such as Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the actions that are exposed to the explosion are desirable. Still, it has never been this Technicolor movie (1936), and this breathtaking visual experience, which has been so small since then, has become embarrassing. Filmmakers who love color filmmakers will be disappointed in the fantastic work here by Robin Hood (1938), Jesse James (1939) and Gone With the Wind (1939). "God's Paradise" is always synonymous with bright color cinematography.
