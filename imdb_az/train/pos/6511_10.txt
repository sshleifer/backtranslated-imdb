I grew up here with a large number of Scooby-Doo. Unlike here, I love this show! I think this is a very good and thought-out. Everything is said to be a spin-off that is not intended to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - a parody of other animated films that a good man is trying to be better. Using the popular Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters, it's easier to attract the audience to parody humor from the start of every 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> Always Scooby-Doo is concerned about supporters who have been spin-offs. Classic Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy Shorts from 80's. These spin-offs were replaced: new content was sold, new fans were allowed, and Scooby-Doo's property on the shelves kept. "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a Task!" An action-packed show that focuses on traditional Scooby-Doo characters: I always wanted Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts. Good features of the show: animation, sounds, attention to detail, bad guys, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo's "Best Friend" connection, constant humor! Malicious features: The Invincible Mystery Machine is sometimes quite close, though. <br /> <br /> Applied Warner Bros Animation! One of the longest smart cartoons!
