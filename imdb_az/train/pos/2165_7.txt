"Impulse" is a very happy experience. Unpredntable movies are so rare, when you come up with an "Impulse", it is something to cling to. The scenario is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give incredible performances. It may have been a zombie movie, but the "Impulse" is superior to any dull "zombieefest" and the originality shines through almost every scene. Despite the fact that the scenario is a true art, you feel like something really is happening. From the opening of the earphone to the credits, you will be amazed. Very entertaining and definitely recommended. - MERK
