Cuban blood is one of these bed films, which is a great deal to talk about in the traditional way of life. I actually watched it while traveling around a Cuban cruise around Cuba. It reflects the lives of a 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959. Until the Socialist regime arrives and takes the boy's father's property until the end of the revolution, much of the time is not spent. The majority of the film is the relationship of the boy and the age of everyone in a small city where everyone knows. There are some powerful scenes that everyone is related to. A classroom film featuring art and directorship. It is a film that describes a story that has no special effects or great schemes or real roots. A film about people and their lives, mistakes and victories. Every year, a good movie worth watching a few times.
