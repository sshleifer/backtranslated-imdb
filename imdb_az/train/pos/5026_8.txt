This is a great movie that everybody needs to see. <br /> <br /> <strong > Why watchers have to read some kind of movie to educate the religious crime. This is a work of art. In the end, not surprising, so-called. So what? I think this movie is very good. USE OF YOUR HAVAN'S FILM LEVEL. Throughout the film, the audience constantly shocked how Paxton's character was affected by the illness, the impact on children, and the behavior of the children. And then at the end, it's true. God has set up a mission to save the demons from the world. Paxton is not a clairvoyant as other viewers have suggested. Of course, he is informed that he does not know anything else, but the film goes even further to show that he is "safeguarding" God with a better video quality problem and the lack of a second FBI agent's memory. The film does not defend Christianity, but it just keeps waiting for a very unexpected path.
