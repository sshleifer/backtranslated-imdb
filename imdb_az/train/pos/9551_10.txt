I said that I was surprised by the quality of the movie. It was better than I expected. Scenarios and movements are pretty good. The director did a good job. While some scenes seem a little quiet, it's a common movie. This idea was absolutely brilliant and did not reveal itself until the end of the truth. The atmosphere of the mental hospital was quite good. The area was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may be a little bored because the storyline is being taken seriously and some have taken the time to develop character and story. The story is moral, a decent film for this genre, and this is a surprising thing.
