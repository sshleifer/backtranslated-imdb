Although not a horror film in traditional sense, this creates a creepy little movie. As you can see, the vampire is empty in a small German city that drain the victims of blood. Police Inspector Carl Brettsnayder, Melvyn Douglas, one of the early roles, is suspecting a vampire amok, believing a terrible murderer. Only Ruth Bert (Faye Wray), who believed in her, was a laboratory assistant for the author's girlfriend and Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill). Apparently, a prominent scientist goes to the theory of vampire. The city's population is suspected of strange Herman Gleib, played by his anger, by Dwight Frye, who is very entertaining in his role. There are some humor that helps reduce the amount of intensity related to all the murders in the film. A funny part, Hero Herman has a Ruth Bertin Aunt, Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), thinking it's a dog, not a dog turned into a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye are a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This budgetary film comes from Dr. Calamari's Dr. Caligari Cabinet, Dr. Niemann, using the power of the proposal to implement a somnambulist. the author and daughter of the "Dracula" laboratory, after making everyone believe, using human blood to order life from Frankenstein. These elements are mixed with a well-measured comedy by director Frank R. Strayer. Works interactively. The revised version I looked up was used to enhance the spooky atmosphere. If possible, try to see this version.
