Honestly, I thought everything was the best fighting version I've ever seen. It was funny, but I was educated, learned all the film, and could do it if it was in the movie. My most beloved soldier was killed in the robot and another one came behind him. In the latest film war in the world, I think it should be more and more in the first place. but in any way I give this movie 2 fingers. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
