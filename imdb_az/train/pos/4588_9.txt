He assessed PG-13 for violence, short-term sexual humor, and drugs. <br /> <br /> Police Story, Polan Story, is the best film of Chan since the 1980s. He did not like the other police movie he was a protective star. Because I can not compare, I did not see the defender. The player is not too bad and the field is very good. I saw this movie back for some time, but I remember this movie, which is a very good move, stunts and comedy, what a good Chan movie is needed. Because you can find the story of the Police and you are a fan of Chan. Take this movie! <br /> <br /> <strong>
