The movie is okay, there are moments, music scenes are the best! Soundtrack is a true classic. It's a perfect album, let's start with Let's Go Crazy (it's a great party song and is suitable for beginner as a very templi), with U (a fun pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (a funny (R & (something that is closest to it), Computer Blue (slightly angry anthem against Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of Funniest songs ever called, very unusual Appolonia entertainment), Doves Cry (The Climax Me 4 U, Baby I 'A Star, and, of course, would die of Purple Rain (really classic, a very appropriate end to this classic album), both movies and albums are very good, I highly recommend them!
