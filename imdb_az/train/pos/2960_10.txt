The main reason for watching this movie is that it was made by Matt Stone of Trey Parker and South Park glory. When the film did not begin, laughter began to emerge out of my belly. True to the joke of true gestures, along with the constant endurance of a very sensitive innuendo, a clear toilet humor. This film is one of the most difficult people to threaten the poker face, let alone his poker luggage. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest burns they miss out on the jokes described in Hollywood, and they are constantly being bargained with criticisms. <br /> <br /> Only Trey Parker wrote that he is not too disturbed by the old player in the game. I was surprised at the amount of this movie. However, it is not possible to use the Internet here in the UK. <br /> <br /> I look like this and I'll shout at my camp sometimes pointing to funny laughs of all my friends. If you're an admirer of an unwanted comedy, it's a good movie. But it does not have a sense of humor about foolish or rude things! But I am sure that Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth may be gurgling through these prejudices.
