Using a set of sets, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create a highly atmospheric cheap, missed, and treacherous texture, it is a great invention. The story is obsolete, the actress is simply functional, but shows that imaginative effects can develop all the visual artwork. This film is recommended not for his story, but for his mood and tissue.
