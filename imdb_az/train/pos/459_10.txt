It's the best I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not help thinking that I'm just my love - a series of my favorite 6 episodes (and more coming next year) and the constant flow of cookie-cutter cops shows that episodes will never end. The reasons for the new Tricks are very successful. Scripts are good and a mixture of characters is superb, the player is on top flight, and a mix of comedy and drama treats. Stories are not unimaginable, but the reason I follow it is not like this. <br /> <br /> The theme song is cute and we're disappointed to find that it does not exist in any edition. Great things, a triumph against the BBC's appeal (there are no young brothers on the edge, and even if that's the case!).
