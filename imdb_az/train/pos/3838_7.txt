The fourth person (Paul Verhoeven - The Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> Based on a romantic movie by Gerard Reve, works well as a thriller. <br /> <br /> When he read the "Fourth Person" job, it is surprising that Reve has about a hundred pages to cover nearly a small area. <br /> <br /> "The Fourth Man" is the heaviest of symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is often very busy proving something very modest to critics, and I'm not sure if he's trying to prove it. He generally lowers his audience and explicitly explains his story, quickly withdraws from the original idea or the story, and does not forget about things that can be seen on the screen and why it should be lifted. The "Fourth Person" did not disclose it in detail, as did sex and nakedness, but in the majority of his films, the open-air story that the audience would not buy is probably mixed with conscious nudity and graphic sex scenes. There is no scenery without sex or full frontal nudity, the majority are so embarrassed that they break another good story on your face. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Verhoeven is entertaining tension, especially with the exciting players and good performances, especially with Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√© when you can experience a pretty clear satire approach. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
