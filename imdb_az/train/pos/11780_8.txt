It's a documentary that I accidentally encountered on the UK's More4 TV channel and I thought it was very interesting and thoughtful. I'm also looking for a book that is the source of this documentary. Professor Jared Diamond's theory about why some parts of the globe are primarily developed and others are not. The controversy he introduced was new to me, and the wealth of the right plants and unpleasant animals is certainly attractive. Documentary is narrated with re-created scenes that spoil a good shot and a good many modern documentaries for itself. Diamond, while trying to send messages to the masses, also helps to blame many intellectuals. People regarded his theory as a Marxist, but they did not buy it and did not see much more social geologist. It was also strange to listen to the theory of evolution of society that is not around religion. I highly recommend watching.
