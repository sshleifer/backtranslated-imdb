Most of the films about New Orleans are bad for laughing and laughably go wrong (examble: "The Savage Bees" remember? But I would say an exception to "Tightrope" almost remained alive). <br /> <br /> Well, it's definitely not wrong. The accents are not so bad (yes, the emphasis on "y yacht" is more than the Brooklyn in the south), the city of 1950 was shown to be without mandatory "tourist" shots and well understood drama without trying to make everyone quirky southerner. <br /> <br /> One of the few films that will be a good movie for justice and filmmaking in this city.
