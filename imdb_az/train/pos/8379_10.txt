When I was 12, I remember this movie, it was fine ... I remember the memory of the day, but I did not try to get it, but like a horse shit! Anyway, although the play was a little chewy, but the story was a nice B movie, it was amazing to watch the scenes with an incredible budget and event, I have not watched it about 20 times. It was a very good movie, and I liked the idea of ​​combating giant man robots, making a defective spin on "Crash and Burn" and, unfortunately, do not watch the movie with this pants! If fans of a real Sci-Fi film watch it, it would have been a winner if it was done again today. I really would like to see a remake or even release a DVD.
