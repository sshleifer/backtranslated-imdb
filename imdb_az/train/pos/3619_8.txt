Notwithstanding Disney's best efforts, it's a disgusting thing to follow your desires. I was sorry that this did not mean that I was very sensitive; this movie played fairly. Dennis Quaid was a very good actor who said something for a sports movie. I do not remember the many strange movies that worried me; Everyone here is part of it. This movie is surprisingly good and does not require stopping the viewer to predict that the G-rated movie will work as stunning as it does. Ebert, on the contrary, this film is a success.
