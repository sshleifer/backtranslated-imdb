The worst part of the film was the first half hour. I really mixed up who it was. For example, Bill Pachson's character was long-haired and he wore jacket. When all the men came to the camp, there was a character like Bill Paxson, but it did not happen. Where's Bill Paxson? Then there was a boy with a girlfriend. She said she was 21 years old. It was the most memorable 20-year merger of the camp director (Alan Arkin). Later, the same girl talked about her experience and camp experience. It did not make any sense. He would be one year old. That is, the film appeared to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was a beautiful man who was always tasteful. A boy was a complete narcissist and a beautiful girl lost her husband. Alan Arkin was interested in being an old-style camp manager who admits that he has come out of contact with modern youth. The best part is that none of the adults have had success in their lives. None of them had a great career. It seemed to be a real life. The movie was compared to the Great Sill. In some ways it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but more realistic. Thus, although the film is not promising, the film has become very good.
