A beautiful early music movie, prepared by Rene Clair, is fun and delicious as her silent "Italian Straw Hat". Using voice only for dialogues and influences, Clair influenced early music in America (opera night on Opera, for example, strongly influenced by Le Million). It will be (but will not) be done by all cinephiles and is as good as you expect from the DVD criterion. There are a ton of extras, but many of the DVDs I've seen have useless hairs and I've never seen Clair's interview on the disc. Get it right now.
