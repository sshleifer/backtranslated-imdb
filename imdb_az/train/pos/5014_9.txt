In 1964 Barbra Streisand was still interested, and CBS signed a 10-year, $ 5 million television contract (probably never today). But more important than this, Barbra and his manager insisted in creative supervision - they deceived her. He had taken the path of this special movie, and most of his intelligence was intelligent, horrible, and incredible. Streisand races with headlines (especially for those of you!), Through poetry poems, "I'm late" (from Alice in Wonderland!) - he keeps even the fuzzy ears on the line, and heaps and "a lot of time for shaving" !); It's a totally charming, strange, choice - and enjoy, because the TWE soundtrack did not leave the album. He slows down for "Believe" ("maybe too slow"), but dramatically "How taste of wine?" it's frustrating. "Again, a baby" (Where is Lily Tomley's idea), "Sweet Zoo" ("I'm a crocodile - crocodile, crocodile!"). Surprisingly, "Where Wonder is," she is very cool and elegant, and her "People" number, with an orchestra close to the song. Act II is settled by Bergdof Goodman in New York City. Streisand feels strange in high fashion slides. (He plays with the pupil). The third actor begins with a stronger version of "From the Sun" (Streisand really dramatically breathes) before a studio audience (a fan of a happy fan club) and "Why did you choose? (probably the best early song), very often "My Sweetheart, Return to Me" (originally drowned by the orchestra) and "Funny Girl". The award, "The Holy Days Are Here Again", 12 hours of information, closes the clock with a nice hour. Sponsorship by Chemstrand (a fiber manufacturer!) Is fast moving with black and white gem, jazz structures, terrific cinematography, kicky sets and suits. They really do not do anything like this - it's special and it's about La Streisand.
