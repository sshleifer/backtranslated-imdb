Written by Oliver Stone and managed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE is a painting that is easily forgotten. Al Pacino, like Tony Montana, became a powerful player in the world by becoming a Cuban refugee, transforming himself into an embarrassing performance. The gangster flick must be a tough, severe, high, general, unpleasant and most likely to record a record of the word "f". It's almost three hours and yes, it can be obedient. <br /> <br /> All of the famous actors are Angel Salazar, along with Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Luggie, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Ibrahim and others. Pacino is one of the eldest of his generation. Attempts to bring reality into a powerful impression character. It will not be a movie for everyone, thinking that you're away from a disaster. Is it strong enough for you? Crime does not pay for a long time!
