'Mother' is part of an extraordinary movie - you think, it does not take any fist and ultimately thinks of you. A very clear result about the fate of the lead character. Anne Reid (I thought briefly about her appearances in Victoria Wildlife projects and thought of it as a wonderful comedy) is really beautiful here. The stereotype that is perfect in marriage and in maternity is not the widow's. And first of all this release is not inspirational and adventurous. He just plays the right character (he did it well). Strong casting. Great script. Really Europe Movie Restoration;)
