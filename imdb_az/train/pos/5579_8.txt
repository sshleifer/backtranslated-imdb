I did not hear this movie before browsing the IMDB. I saw that it had earned a lot of horrific views, with so many colorful expositions, as it stood. Of course, this had to see me. I was pleasantly surprised as it was actually a good movie whipped. I watched him with a group of friends and we laughed more often than we have been in many popular Hollywood comedy comedies. This is an independent film, which, in turn, describes the topic (sex and acquaintance) without Hollywood's nakedness. I doubt that this film will be more dependent on life experiences than people's ideas. You will not receive this movie if you are never partially or historically ineligible because you will not meet people like this one. If so, you know a lot of comedy scenes here. In the end it was also good because women did not portray themselves as unreal, desperate, virgin romantic as many Hollywood films.
