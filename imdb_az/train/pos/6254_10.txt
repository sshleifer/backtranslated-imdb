I just saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The job title was 'Dog Days'. The spectator's reaction was mixed. Some people have found graphic sex and real violence quite a lot to them. Others appreciate how good this film is. <br /> <br /> This film is not for the weakness of your heart. It is like "happiness" with less optimistic views on open sex and humanity. <br /> <br /> There is an animal poisoning, an elderly citizen, an orgy'esque 'hamam in a mall, an anal candle penetration and a malicious intoxication. Then this movie is not for you. This film looks like the most hopeless and miserable humanity. <br /> <br /> Seyidlin has no interest in humanity here. And why? This film gives excellent performances from all participants, is always interesting, and is probably the smartest social statement to be filmed for a while.
