That was wonderful. At first, I saw the Japanese version, perhaps the most terrible film I've ever seen. It was not blood and gut, it was heartbreaking, the atmosphere was terrible. When I put the master ghost on the bed in the Japanese version, I had a heart attack ... I thought that the American version would be irrigated and away from the dark creepy nuances of Buffy's original version. I was not disturbed. The creators of this film kept the same Japanese people who acted in actorship with the original film and gave the same direction to the film. They also put the same house in Japan at the same place. In fact, the Japanese director has suffered pains to correct the same film as in the original film, but the difference is the fall of American actors. After bringing the "weird strange" element into a general fear, it actually brought a benefit. They were abandoned by a totally horrible and relentless ghost, and remained in a completely foreign country and had difficulty integrating into society. <br /> <br /> Buffy really does a very good job. She is sensitive and knows her fears. There are not any clever words that are so common in American frightening films or petals that keep them from the general darkness and horror of the characters. In fact, it was as good as the Ring I easily enjoyed. Now I hope that the future of America's horror is closely followed. The new wave of Japan began with the amazing success of Rings. We really get movies that can be classified as "Horror"! 8/10
