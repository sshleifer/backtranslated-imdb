The lowest PRC in fact, this moody hit the gold with a small tension. <br /> <br /> Strangler is a series of fog and shadows, a technique used by most of the poverty studio for hiding or missing Drop sets. But it works well here. Charles Middleton (better known as the legend of Ming) kills those who are incomplete execution to kill churches around the swamp and creates some sincerity from the viewer. <br /> <br /> Rozmari LaPlanche performs her ordinary imitation because her last victim is the ferry girl ..... her anger is not only for those who are directly involved in her fate, but in a coma that goes for homosexual behavior. He offers himself to stop killing, but as a sop to the audience, the drummer sees his mission as a little modest, completing his mission and returning to the Hereafter. Ulmer ("Detour" directing) to "Strangler" will depend on the nearest tree, and the strangers will be working. But who complains? This is not the main attraction but the story of shroud sets, lighting and fabric overall moodiness. It stands behind "Detour" as it did in the best hours of the call
