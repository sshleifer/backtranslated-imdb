Okay, sorry, but I liked this movie. I like all these movies, because you do not see many like this anymore! I want to ask all those who say that this film is just a fracture or evolution, and what is imitation? <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is not a horror, I have never seen another movie. <br /> <br /> Mostly Marty, a Nerdy boy, about a popular group at school, forced everyone to live in hell. <br /> <br /> So, after 10 years, the group of friends who suffered damage to Marty begins to get merging letters to High School. But ... only those who accept them! So they returned to old school and fell by one another ....... Perhaps you know what's happening! <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me disappointed was the end. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
