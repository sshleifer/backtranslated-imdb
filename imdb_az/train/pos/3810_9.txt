I did not want to write about this IMDb, but for now I just have to add 2 to this great movie ... and not to the film artists in any way (yes yes, how quickly it was here before) I've been there in ;-)) FYI has been in my late 20s. <br /> <br /> I have to really accept all the animated films, because imagination is limited to creators and they were quite creative in this regard. In terms of story rather than a very unique and imo new visual style to achieve. Although the heroes are good, they are far from the truth and work well for the film, because it is a world of fairytale. However, behind the backgrounds and generally the world is full of awesome images that my jaw has dropped several times. Blue, a rabbit mini-dragon draws on the show and has some of the funniest moments of the movie, just like the Scrat of Ice Age. The story is not very surprising, but if the movie looks and sounds good ;-) I have to point out that 1 thing is imo film is not suitable for very young children because some darkness is not very striking (you have to go out of an anti-hero group and imagine the biggest dragon) There are scenes and I'm afraid for children under 6-8, that's just a very small scene, but I have to point out. <br /> <br /> For me, 8.5 me 8.5 for me, 8.5 for me was a very nice time.
