Farrah Fawcett frustrates us in a better part of his post-Angel career, sometimes with a remarkable player performance and sounds between Playboy frescoes and Letterman refugees. But when it comes to her, she does not deny that she can move. Not a story of epic proportions, this beautiful television movie is gentle, calm and sometimes moving. Fawcett, a fugitive black sheep girl, is coming home to find just how she misses the last days of her mother's life and is more stable and perhaps more vulnerable to her sister. Brad Johnson plays love, and a story is packed with all the typical elements of the drama drama - but then it always creates confusion for watching Farrah and it's really beautiful. (And, yes, I acknowledge that there was a Farrah poster on my wall). Silk Hope Corkymeter earns three to five and a half stars. Bosley would be proud.
