This is an unknown cast and takes the least space. The Philippines is Thailand's replacement and no one actually goes to Hong Kong. An old airport is a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing stock transition perfect. This film proves that you do not need a mega budget, or a manuscript star, to produce a good movie. This is a tribute to what the young filmmakers frequently stumble, and what is too much. Solid labor from people who know all the aspects of the film and understand compromises between art and box. Excellent piece of work!
