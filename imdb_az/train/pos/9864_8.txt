I watched 'Ice Age' and liked the movie. If there are many deficiencies and scientific errors (for example, if you do not have to be very violent), people living in the same era, soaps, dinosaurs and mammoths, even the place where the story goes (North American seems to have some of the characteristics of Iceland) <br /> < The planet enters an ICE AGE and many animals migrate south to the warmer one. Sid is a stupid rubbish left by his own family and can no longer stop him. When he goes to Manfred, he does not care about how to destroy a moody mammoth called "Manny" or goes to the migration and north. Being concerned about being easily captured, Sid decided to pursue Manfred and found a man with his baby in the middle of the road. Mother dies, but Manfred and Sid take her and decide to return the baby to the people. One of the swords, Diego, helps them to watch and go a short way to the human camp. Manfred and Sid did not know that Diego was a grave gang who hated people and wanted to kill the baby and claimed they betrayed their nutritional food. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
