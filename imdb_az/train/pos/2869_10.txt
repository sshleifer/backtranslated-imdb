First, I want to say that Disney, who finally released the "Cinderella" on the DVD, thank you! Now on the DVD there are Disney animated films (including limited edition 1999s)! What will we do next? You are going to Disney World !!!!! "Yes, technically (ie look at the castle!) In any case, Disney remains magical in the 1950 animated classic Cinderella movie, a fairy-tale movie on the map, Cinderella, its steps, history, glass slippers, "Bippity-boppity-boo!" and we're going to go home until midnight. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie: These guys are in the form of a movie (also in DVD ) is a great old fairy tale !!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
