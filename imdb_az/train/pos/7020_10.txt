* I would like to mention where spoilers are! General Comments: If you can take a serious movie, look it up. You have an open mind and you can do it. Do not leave the theater, because you doubt what is happening! The film sits in a beautiful place in the second half. When my film is officially opened, I take my mom to see me again. <br /> <br /> A few weeks ago, I was lucky to see this as I went around the film promotion. He was great - he spent a lot of time with his fans. Thanks for the picture! About Will's Performance: When you see a movie with an actor who is really popular for many movies / shows, you always think of their current performance, as you think for their past performance. There is no such thing with Will Smith in this movie. I did not see the movie Fresh Prince (lol) while watching this movie. It was completely and completely convincing in a very serious role. He grew up as an actor. In my opinion, at least he will get an Oscar node for this performance. <br /> <br /> About her character: I am very controversial and suffering. He was sad ... accusing ... he was very determined, but he was very afraid. He is very correct. <br /> <br /> Emily (Rosario): Rosario has done a very good job with Emily, with many women on her. taxes. Maybe he's not a glowing star, he's going to be in this movie, but it's very convincing. <br /> <br /> Spouse: I admit that I did not like me until the second half of the film. I did not know anything about the film going to the movie, and nothing was meaningless until its second part. But when things come together, woe. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. <br /> <br /> This is really a lot of things to watch. In the theater I was in, many people cried until the end - even adults. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> In one of the feature films, at the beginning of the film, they hated me and I loved him and hated him, that was a convincing Will, and I thought that I was a great jerk for Ezra, a blind man who was trying to guide the world. Why Ezra treated it in the film, but it is still a matter of course.That is everything in this film: wait for it. <br /> <br /> - I will not forgive myself, it is a good foundation for a great mistake. , while trying to get rid of its fault v or if he really wants to help people, what he's doing is still not clear to me ... I also think a little ... I think he wants to help people, but he's saved from the past. I love his character. You love it and hate it because you understand how beautiful it is. You hate him for doing what he / she is physically and emotionally (like a very good person). It will be a nice job.
