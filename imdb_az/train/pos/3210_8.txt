LIKELY not as bad as many people. I found films like bearded, cunning humor, as in Paul Verxov's Starship Troopers. Adds intriguing and comic-book atmosphere because of lack of dialogue and plus action. <br /> <br /> For me, a special trivia-bit comes to my forehead - Todd has names for several space warfare campaigns, one on his chest and one of those battles TANNHUSER GATE. For those who are there, the Tannhauser Gate, Bloy Runner's Roy Batty's scenario is the last line. Thinking at least at least boggling to imagine that Todd Roy can fight alongside Android gangs like Roy. Maybe the writer writer David was a nostalgic nation? <br /> <br /> I'll give it to 5 out of 5.
