This is really a heart warming family movie. Definitely brilliant animal education and "actor" (if you can say so) (just think about the dog called "Grinch Christmas" ... it was a bad education). The story of Paulie is extremely well developed, very well developed, and in general, the characters are really well developed. <br /> <br /> My ratings are: 8.5 / 10, operating 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, cinema 8/10. <br /> <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - GREAT FAMILY FILM AND TERRIBLE TRACKING!
