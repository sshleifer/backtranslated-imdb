I wanted to watch when I knew that Brian Krause would be in this movie. I saw the original of today and realized that I loved him. So there was more reason to watch. Yes, I was watching. Television films were better than most tracks. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can learn for yourself) and I do not like most of my characters, including Brian. But filmmakers Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) needed to make a shine once again, as well as symbols of boredom and silence. Finally, she cheered for Stanley and her happy ending. If you love the original cabin of the lake or love horror movies without blood, I would like to watch it.
