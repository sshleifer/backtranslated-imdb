Ten years after the actual events and under the Reichstag under the bunker, Pabst's film is completely captivating. Sulfurous death waiting for the world war criminals. I have not seen it in three decades, but it is strong in my visual and emotional memory. Heroes await their destruction in their cave. The end of the dialogue between the two generals: "Does God exist?" "If not, we would not have been." This movie is not so much easier for an exhibition or shopping, because it's Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" ("Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz.
