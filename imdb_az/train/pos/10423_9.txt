Yes, My Sweetheart was the fame of Mario Lanza and is still popular today. His voice was strong and durable, in fact MGM decided to use it in Great Caruso. Lanza thought he was Caruso's reincarnation. He read the book of Kostelanitz, who wrote the biography of Lanza, explains that he has been continuing his experience and vocal classes for visionary Caruso for Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did a great job, but the story is absolutely true; Accuse Hollywood! I had been singing songs ten years ago, before I lost my voice due to emphysema / asthma, and I was very good myself. Being My Love's high note is not easy; but beautiful!
