This movie was pleasant, but for the wrong reasons. Coordination of action sequences is laughable and there are some funny slap stick moments in the movie. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson, come to Williamson's "last boy" to Ginty! There is a memorable event near the end, saying that. I used this movie only for Ginty and Williamson, but it was written behind the tricolor on the four lines, and the rest is probably not for the story. A movie with more than 30 parts has a credit card of only 10 or more. It's strange that no one has a loan in the film, and maybe some ideas about how the finished product looks like. Something that goes to this movie is extremely severe, with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty making a movie worth more than three times.
