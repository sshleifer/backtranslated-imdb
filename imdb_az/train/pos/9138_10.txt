I have this movie and watched it several times after being released. The prince did not surprise us with a phenomenal game style or something, he was a musician, and I feel like I'm here, it's a good thing to tell the story. The majority of this film is simple and young, but the directors / writers are wrong, and still is a great movie with better music. Purple Rain's basics and moral prisoners are quite powerful, and more movies would have a better impact on the environment that reflects the art of art, if it relies on the basics we teach as young children.
