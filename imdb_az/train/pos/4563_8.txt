It's hard to imagine a movie based on a real story, and it sounds like Christy's miraculous fulfillment. Daniel Day-Lewis, it's hard to imagine how much effort he has made to create a disability character. Watching it on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> As I thought before, the film is not too bad, the story is very bright and interesting. <br /> <br /> One of Christy's successes is her mother's support. <br /> <br /> The most important factor of Kristy's success, the more influential and unknown actress Brenda Fricker, also deserves the Oscars for this role, this greasy middle-aged woman uses Christy's dream to be true. Happy to Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is as beautiful as a young Kristy, why a performance for a child! Christy's love story is very good, reliable. Christy wants his love and nothing can really get it to love, beautiful Dr Eileen Cole (starring Fiona Shaw, his role in his Harry Potter series, Petunia and his extravagant aunt Petunia, his appearance from this role really is beyond my mind, but any a woman has her own youth ...) paranoid and insult, for me sincerely, love is a two-legged sword, happiness and suffering, <br /> <br /> Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are good (in America, BOCHER, .) GET RICH OR DIE Trying to know why this god chose to choose this shit! Indeed, a career is sad for him, no regrets!
