Director Vincenzo Natali's Cypher is a complex and creative tension that can be a little thorough and a great deal of entertainment experience, despite the fact that it needs to stop too much concentration. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) - A high-tech company based in Digi Corp, a spouse, an extravagant spouse, decides to add a bit of spice to her secular existence, starting as an industrial spy in Digi Corp. His job is inside the country (<br /> <br /> In fact, speeches are just a cover for the worst case, Morgan is the brainwashing partner with the conference participants, who place them in a temporary coma in drinking water however, they say that Digi Corp's plans are regulated by refugees and internally displaced persons, including shadowy opera-leased Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) Interference: Morgana gives an antidote to the mind-changing mindset, so he can resist the washout methods, which also means that if Digi Corp suspects he is not fully convinced that Jackby Thursby, he will "be eliminated." < > <br /> <strong> Plays next to Morgan and is a rival However, when it comes to a new job, a polygraph test is issued and immediately rumbled as a spy. Fortunately, the Sunways bosses are an ideal opportunity to feed Digi Corp's fraudulent information and Morgan becomes a binary agent. <br /> <br /> From here, things are becoming more and more complicated; consistent shadows and turns, and poor old Morgan is unable to trust anyone. In an exciting finale, it's all clear (but if you follow the events very carefully). <br /> <br /> Director Natalie confidentially solves the legal proceedings and, of course, is a relatively low budget. She tries to get some good performances from her talented pens; Jeremy Northam is a fantastic thing, especially. Initially, he describes the slightly angry Morgan's description perfectly. Cypher is another interesting film from a filmmaker who wants to get the chance and I'm excited about his future projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
