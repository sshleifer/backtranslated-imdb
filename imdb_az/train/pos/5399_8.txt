Goya's latest film, 1960s. For a great purpose from Gosha's films, a decent stylist, weak nationalist loyalty, combined with this nonsensical indictment, merged with Shintaro Katsu (Zatoichi's fame). <br /> <br /> Tenchu ​​(paradise) is the word of the Emperor's faithful men when assassinating enemies or "traitors". Katsu plays his character with a politician who manipulates his simple thoughtful loyalty to patriotic pride. Anyone who asks questions about a politician is called a "treacherous" and becomes a target of conspiracy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the best-selling films, Struggle scenes are often bloody and cruel. It is part of the black colored palette uses the Duplicate images. Gorgeous and uncomfortable. Although personal story is simple to follow, the background of the history becomes challenging, and if you do not have a major history lesson in Japan this time, you can fight without film. The film is part of a shortage of music, its length and Katsu's occasional scene chewing. <br /> <br /> There is a drunken scene on top of a movie, but in fact it is a very accurate picture on a ferry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Downbeat,
