Personally, I could not go into a bright movie called 'It's Not a Love Song' and it's a great story line for it, but I can not see just how much it's watching in both minuses. movie <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, and they come closer to each other. At the same time, I wish that the relationship was more than what it is. Heaton loves violet, but Spike does not love Heaton or does not know how to love her. The betrayal on both sides has a great impact on two men. Both are accused of running away and abandoning one another, and that they really need one another to survive.
