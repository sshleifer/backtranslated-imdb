The full name of this film is' Let it be in paradise half an hour before Satan knows you're dead ', a rewording of the old Irish Toast' You have food and clothes, a soft pillow for your head; You can be 40 years in heaven because you know that Satan is dead. "For the first time, scriptwriter Kelly Masterson (with some modifications by director Sidney Lumet) has drawn up a melodrama that explores how the family can break apart when it pulls out members of external forces to aggressive overtakes, which are often used gradually but nearly full implosion , but here's a very sensitive manipulation of the flashback / flash progression of storytelling.We see all the motivations of the players in this robbery very wrong, suggesting repeatedly the different interests of each of the characters about central events that control the forced event <br /> <br / > Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an exemplary executive, married to emotionally-guilty Gina (Marisa Tomei), dependent on a habit of being married and expensive, her life begins to collapse and needs money Andy's younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke), is a life-span - his naked companion Martha (Amy Ryan) divorces, borrowed from the backdrop and child support, and borrowed money from her and needs money. Andy offers low-key burglary at a small shopping mall-a-pop jewelry store, but also promises safe, fast money for that. The jewelry story belongs to the parents of men - Charles (Albert Finney) and Nanette (Rosemary Harris). Andy gives Hank a cash and agrees that Hank will deal with the real robbery, but Hank agrees with the "safe" plan, Hank plans to become a driver of escape, the car. The blessing swallowed robbery when he gave it to a regular architect, hit him on the robber, and shot himself in confusion. The catastrophe opens up many secrets about the family's sensitive relationships, and when Charles and Andy and Hank (and their partners) are killed, Nanette's death causes disastrous consequences. <br /> <br /> In this powerful, yet emotional acrid film, each of the actors delivers perfect speeches, and when it comes to expecting Hoffman, Hawke, Tomei, Finney, Ryan and Harris, this wise gift is the leadership of Sydney Lumet, who made this movie unforgettable. It's not an easy movie to watch, but a movie that gives some bravura speeches that requires respect, a movie that remembers how many families are fragile. Grady Harp
