"This is not a song of love" is a brilliant example of many of the intelligence genre that is thought to be a human being. Love between two main characters can be more than brotherhood. <br /> <br /> Heaton believes he is in love with Spike, but Spike is so naive to see it. <br /> <br /> I really feel it is described as scenes of coup and letter writing. Heaton Spike shows great proximity. <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-family:" <span style = "text-align: justify;"> The watchman appears to be incomprehensible because he does not even mention the likelihood of Heiko, who has sexual feelings for Spike. Some analysts did not even feel like: "Who is Heaton, what does Spike do with delay?" But this person can nail the head with their words. <br /> <br /> I love this movie as well. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie for me. Even if it is not too diligent. The movie is extremely characteristic, and there is not much dialogue between two anti-heroes until the end of the filming. Stay tuned, unless you're used to watch such deep, charming movies.
