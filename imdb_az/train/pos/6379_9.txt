The movie "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" has recently shone in the wreckage of films produced by Disney Studios. Parents who are forced to sit with The Jungle Book 2 or even the Pokemon movie will appreciate it again. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the few to try an original story; Previous feature films are simply aware of the current stories. "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc". all are identical, but it should be noted that all of them are developed by Pixar and distributed only by Disney. Disney Studios's newest movies have been featured for direct video and are featured on the current successful movie. The quality of movies is based on profitability. A new era starting with "Atlantis" was Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and recently Open Range. Writers have created all the original story lines instead of the stories of the past. <br /> <br /> A good part of the film has been sought to find Atlantis. for hundreds of years. The included young Milo Thatchin, also addressed by Michael J. Fox. Milo deals with a museum in Washington. His father was a renowned archaeologist who dedicated his life to finding Atlantis. It was seen as a waste by their peers and asked Milo to go to his feet. After agreeing with the board of directors to sponsor the expedition, Milo came home to find a woman in a dark apartment. It takes him to the employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Milo's father and wanted to send Milo to find Atlantis.

An easy-to-reach result, most readers quickly understand the difference between these two. Heroes are a believer. There are some beautiful scenes of persecution, and many activities continue. <br /> <br /> The creativity of writers really shines. Atlantis culture is richly developed, including all languages. The film refers to Atlantis as historical sources such as Plato. It is explained that the Atlantis disappeared from the world. By a younger audience, this magic really is incredible. The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magic, but can be best described in this way. <br /> <br /> Despite the level of technology established in 1914, it is not realistic. In a submarine boat that remembers the nautilus of the Captain Captain Nemon, the torpedo fire is completed with the sub-pods. Giant diggers are driven by steam boilers, so they work for some period technologies. Women's symbols have been strengthened in the way that old women play a role in leadership. This is not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite reasons not to have another song on other Disney movies, but never a song. Starting with the first "Snow White" movie and passing to The Lion King, almost every Disney movie is full of singers. It's great and all, Seven Dwarfs say "Hello HO!"
