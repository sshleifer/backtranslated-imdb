I went to Hamlet because I was busy. I thought for 4 hours, it would be great, I'm an admirer of Bran; Again, the Dead, Henry V. It was totally drowned by cinematography moving in the direction of this film. As with other reviews, it runs at 4 hours. Branek does not play Hamlet, Hamlet, born for it. While watching this movie, I always try to find mistakes, look at the go and see them. It's a secret for me to be able to bring the camera into the hall and the hall with all the mirrors. This film was shot in 70 miles. Colombia has not released the Widescreen version of this VHS. I have a DVD player and every day I get through the Titanic. If you listen to Colombia, put it in a way to watch this movie! I do not know what happened in Oscar. It was the best picture, the best actor, the best director, the best cinematography. What did they watch the movies? When I respect Shakespeare on the screen, I apologized to Oscar for Branag. They must respect Branca to bring one of the greatest films of all time.
