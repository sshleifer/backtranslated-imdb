When I started listening to music with all that MJ stuff, I watched the documentary here and there, watched Wiz, and watched Moonwalker again. Perhaps at this age of eighty, I want to bring this person to my thinking, perhaps considering whether I'm guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is a piece of biography that I remember when I first saw it in the movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> MJ has some messages about the feelings of the press, and there is also a clear message to the drugs. <br /> <br /> Sight, but, of course, this is Michael Jackson. We'll probably hate it and miss it. Some are calling an egotist to agree to the MJ's preparation for this film. AMA MJ and most of his fans would say that if it really was really nice to him, it would do for fans. <br /> <br /> The real feature is that the movie bit is just about 20 minutes, except for the Smooth Penalty sequence, or Joe Pesci is a psychopathic powerful drug lord. Why does MJ know that the dead can cope? Because the MJ heard his plans? <br /> <br /> Nah, Joe Pesci's character told people that he wanted to know it, so it's like providing material, perhaps he hates MJ's music. <br /> <br /> A very cool thing like MJ, a car and a robot, and the entire Speed ​​Demon series. Also, when the director directed the kiddy Bad series, a believer should have the patience that usually the directors do not hate to work with a child because they have to perform a dance on a complex dance scene. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, this movie is for people who love MJ at one level or another (I think so many people). If not, stay away. It's a girl who is trying to give it a try and give it a message and ironically MJ's best friend is in this movie! Michael Jackson is really one of the most talented people to grace this planet, but is he guilty? Well, I have given it all the attention .... Hmmm do not know well because people can be different behind the closed doors, I know it for a fact. He is either an extremely nice but stupid boy or one of the worst liars. I hope he is not the last.
