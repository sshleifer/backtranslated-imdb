I was very pleased with this movie and after watching it, I was surprised at how much Caitlin Rose was born. Many other girls were exposed to this type of sexual abuse and suffered by their classmates and were very scared. to open their mouths about it? How can you show how dangerous and brutal a young person is to one another? Because the rights of the film are not the most important, as it is shown in this film, it is popular and is a manipulator of the minds of young people and influences them to cause such illness Tiffani Amber Thiessen presents a powerful performance as a victim of aggression and Brian Austin Green, he is as convincing as a torn man between his best friend. This is a movie that does not disclose. It's beautiful and bright, very good for you to be a TV-made movie.
