A sharp, good documentary film that focuses on the Mardi Gras beads. I always liked this approach to filming - think of a larger, more complex and often incomprehensible phenomenon, leaving the issue more familiar and close. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that he has heard stories about swords rifles and the main motives behind profit and capitalism and the impact of globalization on poor countries (but people feel it). Instead of explaining these topics and not going to a soapbox (except for those converted to documentary films), this documentary simply uses the Mardi Gras beads, how they are manufactured, and how and in what conditions, and then how consumers use it at the end of the process. <br /> <br /> It explicitly and starkly investigates the motivation of everyone involved in the process, including employees, factory management, American importers, and finally the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> as well as by the Mardi Gras prophets, at the same time, the Chinese workers were in a normal and parallel manner (even though they had some objection to the way in which they were managed). The appearance of the street sweepers cleaning the beads from the streets has created a special impression. But that was my reaction; <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentary films on this subject, I do not think we need to be influenced by a particular political idea. This is ultimately a story about people and our relationship with the goods we produce and consume. <br /> <br /> If you have purchased a product in the Ancient East, this should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> Outstanding and highly recommended. You need to see such documentary documents. Kudos, all those who took part in the filming.
