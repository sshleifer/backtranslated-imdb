The thief of Baghdad is one of my favorite films. It is fascinating, beautifully drawn, and the art direction is flawless. Casting could not have been better. The Rex English convinced me of the demons. The bad words are kept as parsley by Conrad Wright. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and I never denied it. This movie is an adventure for all ages. The ghashgard thief leads me to a much more guilty moment ... I saw that for the first time I was ten years old and was able to enter the II World War in the United States. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor in Casablanca a few years later that he could continue with this "evil". And Korda merged, I believe, with Justin and Dupree again "The Four Pearls" .... a great movie!
