If Claudia Black did not continue on this subject, I would have voted 10 such a horrible series! Entering the mind as "Vela" dropped my array to my assessment. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Getting it regularly, including Ben Browder to replace the BMD. Unfortunately, we have just come out of the 'Jack' loss, and indeed this big series has become the new episodes of Farscape. <br /> <br /> I was a great admirer of the Stargate, and I was expecting the movie to be adapted for the first time, but after watching the first episode I have to admit that I'm hooked. I've always been looking forward to new episodes with great expectations
