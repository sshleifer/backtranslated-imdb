The Human Tornado (1976) draws a much better film than its predecessor. Director Rudy Ray Moor knew that he wanted to work with and work with restrictions as an actor. A more technically efficient and moving fun movie. The performers do not take very seriously and everybody around this time jokes and goes in the stream. Rudy Ray Moore looks more comfortable in front of the camera and is not as rigid as Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I loved the film and I strongly recommend it. As his first film was catered to a particular audience (I'm trying to expand audience at this point in his career at Mr. Moore). <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
