<br /> <br /> <strong> Raw was really bad for the first PPV 006. But the last one was really shocking to anyone watching at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-RIC FLAIR VS. WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP EDGE W / LITA Not a bad start-up, these two will spend a lot of time in a wrestling match with a big match in a serious manner. After Edge, Flair gains by his DQ with his MITB bag. 3/10 SECOND MATCH-TRISH STRATUS VS. WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP FOR MICKIE JAMES This Divas is not aware of the fact that he was facing the ring for the first time. Mickie is going to have a modified Chick Kick, but his Chick Kick nails for Trish duck and his win to save his title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH-TRIPLE H VS. ALL THE SHOW This game was really good. The entire match was aimed at the HHH Big Show's damaged arm, but the Big Show is still back. Later, HHH can jump to the Big Show and cut off a generation for victory. 5/10 The Fourth MATCH-SHELTON BENJAMINE W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {It was a bonus match] It was not bad, it was good. After viscera fell, Benjamin's mother retrieved a bag (bricks inside) and shot three times with Visceri. Viscera stood up to be caught with a spinning shot by Benjamin for the victory over the big man. 4/10 <br /> FIFTH MATCH-JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Is abrasive, slow and frictional. Both did not really make much effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop to win. 2/10 <br /> SIXTH MATCH-TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE THE FIRST BEST WOMEN IN THE FUTURE MATCH It was fun for me. Ashley (I think) ended up winning Candice for the first time in the Women's Dress Up game. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI WWE CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHIN This was a cool removal camera game. But nothing will be the best of last year's Elimination Chamber. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito Masters is back on top and gets a roll-up to eliminate it. In second second Cena, Carlito, takes the three roles to win the Handout Chamber and protect the WWE Title. But the night is not over yet. 7/10 After the game, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Cena for the victory. Vince McMahon says his night is not over yet, and Edge says he has the opportunity to meet Cena for the title of Money. <br /> <br /> Eight matches - JOHN CENA VS. Going to the Liga, Vince gives her bag and Cena goes away from the rings as if it were a match tonight. <br /> <br /> JOHN CENA VS. in eight games. WWE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR EDGE W / LITA (Cena on the open in Palais match) Edge, Edge, then jumps on a spear over Cena, goes to the cover and performs his shocking Cena breaks. Edge has three coverings for another spear and shock because he beat Cena and won his WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Year's Revolution was better than this year, but it was still good. <br /> <br /> Official opening ceremony of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 was held.
