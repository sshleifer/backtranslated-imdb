I do not have a director who likes Mamory Oshii more. But, unfortunately, he has directed several films that have a great international attention, but there are still few films that have escaped the shortcomings. Taciguishi is one of these, and although I liked it for some time, it's hard to see how distracting it is to distribute it in the West <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Among her big and serious films, Although Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category, Oshii is outdone itself with it, creating something that is hard to classify as a freaky Japanese flick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < eliminate food, support food and support Japanese cooking level. Osey's approach in this regard builds a close relationship with Dai-Nipponjin, because he is faced with the fatal gravity of the subject, and the images on the screen may seem ridiculous. However, it was not all that, but rather decided to use it with a new visual method, baptized with superstition, not merely to shoot his insidious Ossetia. Live animation, photography, digital animation and a strange blend of puppets in the bar. <br /> <br /> As you probably imagine, the project will have as low budget as possible, and implemented by the best animation industry in Japan (or, if you like). you only know that the movie has a great deal of dialogue, which makes it a good companion for innocence. The influence of grippers is analyzed in all cultural, political, and even philosophical aspects that open fire to the audience through the continuous flow of monologues and dialogues. And, to further worsen, the entire film is completely unfounded in Japanese history and custom history, so it is even harder for foreigners to get a good business deal. <br /> <br /> In other words, it is said that the film is a follow-up of a certain level and is already quite fun. After the war, various emblems such as Japan's most influential historical figures are used. The film plays a serious documentary film as you expect it to emerge from another important figure, but the big and sad animated cuts of photographs do not make anything significant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oshii's regular Kenji Kawai has said that the sequence of the presented characters is sweet, Shinji Higuchi, while enjoying fast-food chains with a wheat gourmet, a ridiculous and funny, an account until the account. <br /> <br /> Unlike the rest of the movie, there will be more fun than lots of noise and effects that complement the animation and totally contradict. The visuals are very atmospheric, although the animation is pretty small and effective, but sometimes tonal remains to get hyperactive strangeness. Taciguishi is not a bad thing to see how much this dialogue is. Nevertheless, the film is still a prominent masterpiece because every frame is completely lighter and the overall atmosphere of the film is adapted to adapt and develop. <br /> <br /> Although Tachiguishi is demanding much from the audience. If you do not speak Japanese, there are so many books to read and there are many cultural references that require some attention. Moreover, monologues in the movie field are quite extensive and can be difficult to watch. The film still does not have English subtitles and I am sure that despite the fact that it's all about French, I miss the most beautiful points in the film. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not easy to access the film, but only half of it reaches a full vapor and does not allow it to go out. I still hope to see this one again with English or Dutch subs. In a word, it would be great for a movie like this (like a container), but I think it's a bit too big to ask a good quality anime. <br /> <br /> All of this I said to congratulate Oshi on another beautiful movie. It's rare to find a movie that combines and combines many styles and effects in order to create something rare and still functioning. The film is smart, visible and sounds and full of creativity. Even if it does not hold all the details at first glance, it's funny. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi serves a very special audience, and it does not lead to any injustice. The rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) is still waiting for a sign of this film, and I'm not surprised by the French release. But for those who like Oshii, they can appreciate the dry and dead humor and seek creative spirits, although this is a film that can not be missed, although it may also be a fatal fire. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
