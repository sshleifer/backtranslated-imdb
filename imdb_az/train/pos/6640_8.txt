This one-minute film is, of course, the first film to be prepared. Other inventors had previously acted as Edison's actor's photography, but the Lumiere brothers made medium-sized advanced equipments. At that time, of course, their cinematographers surprised their peers, including their subjects. This is primarily a record-breaking employee leaving the factory, and some try to hide the information they are aware of. Lumieres is trying to make the movie more fun by introducing animals and bikes, but 'La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere' does not fit the inventions of their subsequent films. The most interesting part of this short film is the selection of the ritual of the familiar working class of brothers. Their choice is the first evidence of interest to all peoples of the world. This is a quality that demonstrates their experiments today in a very striking and attractive way. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
