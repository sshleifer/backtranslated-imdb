First, imagine that this movie is about fifty years old! But it still remains one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> I am interested in how long the cellulose production will last until 2050. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but strong enough, and the effects are not so great for the day. If you see your contingency coming into the force-protecting ships and for the first (and only) time, I can watch it as a child for the first time. If I were trembling with fear, I can tell you. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the tiger now show their age. <br /> <br /> At the same time, animation will have a great impact on the way through the Krell gates. <P style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen (better remembered for Airplane and Naked Gun movies) is a young, but still amazing person. It's about 80! <br /> <br /> All this is a good movie.
