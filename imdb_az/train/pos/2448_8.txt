Yes, in a row, yes, a bit klich√©d and yes, Constance Marie is a total babe and worthy to see again! Sugars and shades may be old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still entertaining to watch. <br /> <br /> US President Barack Obama said at a press conference that he did not take him seriously and won the show. I am convinced that he did not intend to be a part of a serious or moral nature. <br /> <br /> I have to say that Benny is a big, dark, painful place. I hate character ... as long as I have been silent for more than 30 seconds, I do not need to listen to him. There is nothing about his dialogue or joke. <br/> <br /> <br /> "One of those who met me was very important to me." When I see Ben, I think: I see something better than watching the Bill Engvall Show. Now you have a bad sitcom ...
