An excellent film showing how Mardi Gras was associated with the merging of people. The film is more than a comment on globalization. In fact, these Chinese workers, the plant's owner, the distributor of beads in New Orleans, and even guards at New Orleans. And above all, the ability of the director to describe a difficult story in such a simple and attractive way is complicated. Another interesting aspect of his wonderful introduction to the plant is interesting and I just wish he knew how to inside it. This is a wonderful story without sensual or related innocence, and ultimately, people are hoping to abandon alienating feelings.
