No other movie has ever felt so much to me ... I do not feel bad either. I do not want to refund my money, or I do not feel bad about not going to use this watch for two hours a day from a sunny summer day to watch this movie (9 months). The reason I say "_____" does not come up with a phrase in seven languages ​​that my film is about to sum up, despite the difficulty of my brain. I did not know what all the time and half way through the movie I wanted to breathe. No movie has ever been given to me before. I never wanted wheat, milk and baguette in my life. Thank you very much. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * Cleans the throat * There is no word. I have no idea. I dont know. I really do not know. - Cait
