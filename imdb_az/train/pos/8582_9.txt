I love the characters and the story line. Many funny movements. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great speeches. I enjoyed Griffith and Career's dynamic and funny interaction. Donald Southerland plays very striking and surprisingly sympathetic, burned a cunning man. All three actors are among my favorites and are designed specifically for this film. A nice addition to our extensive DVD collection. I love this movie. If you want ... Mr and Mrs Smith, Changing Killers, L.A Secret, Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and All Nine Yards ... You'll love this movie.
