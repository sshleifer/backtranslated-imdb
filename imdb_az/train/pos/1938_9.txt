Great bad swimming, low budget, feel indie. I'm starting to watch independent films with really good reviews to find out that they are an ambitious date since people have voted for the idea of ​​the movie and because they forgot about the film have been voted by people who are very curated <br /> <br /> Any message in a big bad swimming or if he has a higher meaning or metaphor, I will not know if I missed him. <br /> <br /> Since BBS survived, it was easy, warm, and human, no major drama or meaningful concepts, and I simply contacted the characters. <br /> <br /> As I ended up with all the good movies, I felt sorry when I got closer to the end when I lost the connection. <br /> <br /> If you look elsewhere or look elsewhere, deliver more than you can. BBS offers a solid, pleasant, realistic experience and I felt rewarded and saturated by watching it.
