<br /> <br /> For the second time, I was watching my movie (with the French version of the Italian dubbing against the first version in French) and I feel it improved in the next meeting. <br /> <br /> A characteristic investigation that is beautifully drawn in a simple way and equally effective in Paris's settings. In the long run, Polanski is not a high-class, and I'm number 9 in his filmography, but still a striking, often confusing comedy. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm a bit of a sudden need for Trelkovsky, but a good form, in a good way, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. previous rents "change"; apart from the owner of the cafe opposite the apartment, Simone asked for it everywhere (as far as I can distinguish), where he did not want to be used unwanted! Okay, he found Simone's belongings still in the apartment, but how did she dress her clothes and turn her out (even if she did not see it as unconscious)? After a rude appearance in the bathroom, the last part of the movie (Adjani's disappearance) is almost anti-climactic - a night that operated by the host and other tenants to commit suicide, 46 years ago by Jean Cocteau in the blood of a poet ( 1930) is a concept used! <br /> <br /> The latter is awaited and unresolved: this special flat jumped out of the window?!; I also remember this fact at first glance at me, and now I'm not sure if I'm sorry! Think about it, the first two thirds of the film is very strong, but I wish Polanski to rely less on the areas that he did not hide in all areas.
