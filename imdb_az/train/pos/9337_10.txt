This series is "something different". Sometimes the European series is less accurate than the US, but in the meantime, the authors have come to the right end to create a smooth mix. Edel & Starck shows a great story, smart, witty, always well-delivered lines, all the stars and a beautiful theater show of beautiful pictures of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It's fun to see how other things work in the United States in the field of justice than in the United States, and that once the old Europe is busy with life. A good comedy to be seen in the coming years will come to Kudos for all castles and crew. Watching in German is superb.
