This second movie is as interesting as it was before, it is no exception. We know what to do and what happens, even on the screen. Then enjoy comes with just the different tricks and their consistency. We know that there will be a dynamite inside the car, the wheel has lost, crashing the car, just talking about the car. And what happens. Now the details and information to find them in the movie. It is clear that some beard can be refreshed by a woman, and she has to come, but we know that she already knows what she's seeing and dragging her into the trap. How will it go now? You need to find yourself. And do not worry about getting the main merchants, but how else is the story. The boat is not compatible with the occupied dome in the river. We will be wounded. At that time, they did not know what bullets they had with bullets. Certainly, it has been recently discovered that some IRs have no such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insists that hunters are not hunted and that they do not see the problem of blindness. But the film is a perfect example of how this moral forces can stand in the way of this moralist attacker. Why not simply legalize these goods because they can be monitored and controlled? It's less fun to use them if something is not illegal or does not want to push them off the road. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques Culardeau, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
