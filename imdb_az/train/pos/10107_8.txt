"Ardh Satya" is one of the best films in Indian cinema. This is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema, directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, and it was a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is inspired by all Indian leading filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The film represents the real-life scenario of the 70s Mumbai Police. Unlike other cities in India, the Mumbai Police is a completely different system. Govind Nihalani creates very practical Outlay with a realistic approach to the environment of Mumbai Police. <br /> <br /> The family of the young bloody Kop Anand Velankar, one of the poorest filmmakers, is among the police officers and co-workers. His father is a harsh Police Officer. Anand suffers from the ideology of his father's father and the events of his father's fire. Anand's immediate reaction to crime is an inert aspiration for his work satisfaction. The film is here in an area where Anand's constant efforts to commit murder have been trampled by the elderly. This can lead to frustration when it can not achieve any satisfaction. Anger caused by distresses is that it is expressed in extreme violence in restricted rooms and bars. <br /> <br /> The Spirit inside him constantly fights the system continuously. It is aware of the Metro system, which is linked to the extreme end of police and politicians. Negotiation against non-ethical practice is negative. Finally, it is stopped. <br /> <br /> Direction is a basic piece and is a comprehensive heavyweight foundation. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand's Underworld gangster is in Rama Shetty's home, when she pauses to capture her, and after a short, fantastic conversation. On many scenes, the movie has a lot of hair growth. <br /> <br /> The practical approach to the scenario is a great blow. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Impact, Courage, Deceit is all an integral part of the Mumbai police today. <br /> <br /> Finally, movies are about a man's show. Om Puri describes all the feelings of Anand Velankar in a brilliant way.
