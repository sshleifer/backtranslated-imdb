Discovering a journey, this movie is a dream of British Columbia, following the lives of a family living in the island city. Attacking and dreaming, residents are happy to allow them to walk around life as a young, fresh-faced teacher bringing new ideas and life from the continent. Slowly, their awkward state awakens, the father (and the local school principal) is looking for the youngest, the most aging daughter of the mother, for the sake of excitement, stability, and the power. Although it is not an incredible or elegant movie theater, the film is quiet and good for a tired night when wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone can get to anyone outside of Canada.
