The material of this documentary was so strong that it brought me to tears. Yes, I'm telling my tears. This popular struggle of the traditionally exploited population should encourage all of us to oppose our rights, to demonstrate greater public goodness, and to avoid dangerous pretexts that the organization does not object. Chavez, in a weak and surprising way, was in the same way that Bush was the face of dirty companies and the capitalism faded. Indeed, Latin America is re-formed, and the marginal majority finally cries for more than five centuries. In California, the election was openly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not far from him. It tries to change to allow the constitution to govern indefinitely. They can not believe it. To be content with politics and return to the film; Breathe in speedy moments and deeply philosophy to others. Ch√°vez describes him as a famous hero because he challenged the US hegemony and domination of world resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing stops doing his homework. An important message of the film was questioning information sources, as the losses of those who were shamed by Chavez's supporters were clearly shown. Venezuela puts American embarrassing democracy into embarrassment. Patient return!
