DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a great surprise. It performs perfectly (especially underrated Callan), beautiful cinematography and an attractive storyline. <br /> <br /> Kallan is a fashion photographer who is dreaming of killing his models at a time when he is merged with a psychologically alive brother. (it does not lose a leg and a leg). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the dreams of Kallan's death are actually turned to death, the photographer begins doubting his foolishness ... but there are more pictures than the picture. <br /> <br /> This movie is not always a praise. Most critics and cinemas combine with slide-watching clips, but this is at the top of the regrettable majority. This is not something that can be said about most of the genre movies, but also a passionate and playful thing. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a kind of ship.
