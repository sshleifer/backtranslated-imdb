Japanese animators have a unique freedom of animation, so they can act as movies, ending with anime fans' hard-drive and college studentships, but completely ignored by anyone outside the country of origin. Cat Soup is one of the movies that have to be experienced or deeply analyzed by Western eyes. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is just a nice detailed surrealist trip. <br /> <br /> Subtitles have nothing to do with an easy dialogue to move to other interested parties without interest. A cats and her half-dead (brain dead?) Sister is traveling through various imaginations and imaginations. The water has a general theme, or does not have them (perhaps because of the possibility of cat choking at first?). There is an interesting kind of creation. You have a pig that's eating it. An elephant made from water. And this is a wonderful, seductive, exciting and funny thing - if you do not watch around drugs that do not look like anything in comparison to a pickled trip. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie itself is turning itself into a process that adds another attractive self- <br /> PololarisDiB
