One of Cary Grant's most comedian comedy, Mr Blandings, builds his dream home. Despite its size, living is a dream home today. <br /> <br /> The reason for this film is that, despite the fact that Cary tried to create a slogan for everyone, it was a good life in the advertising industry. The difficulty of the Second World War era was well-known. Gazi veterans claimed their rights under the GI Laws Act, which returned home from war. Unfortunately, there were not enough homes to meet the demand. During the period of the Congress, which was very popular with the book and film by Eric Hodgins, Truman signed Taft-Ellender-Wagner Land Law and put the government first in a home-building business. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there was a uncle and aunt who built their own houses, which they were transferring to the early days. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy had two daughters and wanted to leave Rochester. <br /> <br /> Their place is not as strange as a home of eighteen-bedroom houses in Connecticut, yet the rest of her life was most likely to be as Cary and Myrna. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was expensive and the expense only threatened to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna came to Melvyn Douglas to advise, usually too late. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is simply an extension of Nora Charles. <br /> <br /> You can imagine the relocation of Charles to the country, and William Powell is headaches Cary Grant, the film will still work well. <br /> <br /> Blandings Dream House still works as a comedy, because the situation is universal. And this review is dedicated to Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate, who have lived together for 40 years in my dreams house.
