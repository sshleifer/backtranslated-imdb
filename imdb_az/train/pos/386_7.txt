Tsui Hark's visual art work was featured in this film. Unfortunately, Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt his desires to drown while watching it, that's bad) is a terrible act. <br /> <br /> This film is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I saw it for the first time, my jaw had dropped a few times and I thought that I had never seen anything but how to do it to approach the mythical world of Chinese history kung fu novel! No doubt, the best-known Chinese history is the epic of kung fu. But, unfortunately, Tsui Hark did not get much better at the writing department, and the story and dialogue did not help the young guys (not to see the bad guys with foolishness or excessive long term images). This film is too bad to worsen. They decided to use the "hot" famous Hong Kong idols, but, unfortunately, both Ekin Cheng and Cecilia Cheung are totally unacceptable for historic kung-fu dramas, because the embodiment of these symbols has no delicacy and mysticism. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin are infinitely better in 1983. <br /> <br /> One day, I wish Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Harkin Tsui to join a force with visual mastery and shoot a movie. With Zhang's written and conscious poems ...
