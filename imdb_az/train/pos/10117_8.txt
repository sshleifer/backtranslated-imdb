The story of a drifter, his sheep twins and patron's daughter is not for all tastes, but still very interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand among the coastlines we are well acquainted with with other regional films. <br /> <br /> This movie is Regan, and is a fan of this day. In the cast, Bruno Lawrence is probably remembered by the movie "Smash Palace" by the best American audience. Terence Cooper's daughter, Regan, is a farmer who has little interest in her. <br /> <br /> Grieving, he made speeches in an unforgettable way from all his performances. For the first time, I've seen this movie in the late night television in America, but I believe you should not miss the unexpurged version.
