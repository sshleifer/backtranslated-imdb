This film can only be Black and White, though this is not necessarily contrary to modern times. The main purpose of the film is endless. This movie has great actor, beautiful song and dance numbers, great design work and movie shooting. Follow the track, there are funny, funny moments, moments to laugh, but craftsmanship only takes you to the scene. Despite how this film is set up in a decade-old way, how can it affect our day?
