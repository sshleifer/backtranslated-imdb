Me and my groovadelic 20-thing pals just can not get this awesome Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on DVD, but it does not look like it - very bad, I'm sure the features would be "extra special"! :) We all come to the single home of this uber-cool comedy flickerino, even for a single night alone! It can also be a seductive type of movie to watch with a cat, or even to the end of the "Party Girl", as in a favorite, huggable, charming Parker Posey film. Oh, and be watchful to end a flaming and HILARIOUS surprise ... pull it aside, the Sixth Sense, have just outdone you out of the radder movie! Sorry, no fault, just call it! Take away the old flick, the comedy does not get better than Parker P with "Party Girl"! Feel it! Yours, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
