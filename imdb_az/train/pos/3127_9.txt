I liked this movie. I knew that the original series would be chocked full of camp and silliness. I found a great deal of warmth to re-gather Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar. Everyone who loves the Batman series from the 1960s must return to Batcave. You can tell the actors that this film, especially Adam West, is very entertaining. And I would not like that, she would gladly compel her with a Batman suit. I told a few friends who chose not to watch this movie ... Now they wanted it. The VHS has the original 120 episodes. Now this movie will be in my collection. Thanks for the ordinary Adam and Burt.
