In my opinion, the first episode of the first series was really good. It was really fun and the actors were brilliant. I think that is a bad sin for everyone, because it looked at the right time. a Saturday night is not a fun show, it's really frustrating to say that people are historically not correct because the suits and settings are not just a drum history document that I think is true. A brilliant beginner and I will love the love of what is coming! I talked to many people in my school and love the show! we all think it's great fun and there are great stories to go with.
