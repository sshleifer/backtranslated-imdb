I never saw Richard Thomas playing a bad man. I was not sure if he would ask him that way. And I was not sure he could pull it off. But that surprised me. He waved my waist and forced me to look closely at the street people. Film is non-smoking and fast paced. Bruce Davison is convincing, but he's a beautiful guy he really can play. The true talent here is Thomas. It was a little calm, but perhaps there is a way for real people to fight ... If you are a fan of Thomas, we should see here to see him in the worst possible way!
