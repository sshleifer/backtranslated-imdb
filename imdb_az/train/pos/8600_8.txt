There was a hesitation in part of what this movie was offering. For beginners, casting did not look right. Kiefer Sutherland had already done a very good job on 24, and the preview did not offer anything to him or the audience. <br /> <br /> After finishing at the end of the film, I would not have been more than happy to see a decent tension; the responsible parties should be careful about following the narrative gaps and paying more attention to character development . We have seen these kinds of threats before and made the writers more confused. As spectators, we do not want to sit back on the same old story. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger's delicious first lady. She has enough grace and sexual appetite to make her part memorable. Michael Douglas has been and has done it before. Unfortunately, the president is a lot of things that he does not even care about his destiny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sutherland equates 24 "tough guys with enough power to make bigger screen bigger, and Eva does not work as newcomers. <br /> <br /> I do not expect too much twists and fireworks like some classics (like North by Northwest and The Fugitive come to our minds). Release your expectations and stay connected. O.
