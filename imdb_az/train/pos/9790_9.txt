<br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < br> <br /> <strong> Her oldest and beloved friend, Taly's funeral. Because Yaara lost her own sister after living with her husband's parents practically after her mother's death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She decides to solve the mystery of a blind girl in a protected situation. this is death. Invisible, though, has the concept. Although he does not, he can find out what is more than the "normal" people around him. Yara remembers his relationship with Talia, reminding her of her family's home, bands, diaries, and Talia in the past and present. Yaara, in terms of Yara, looks at what the film looks, believes, and conceives, as it appears from its point of view. The solution to the mystery is quite conditional, but the search for such exquisite care and response is so beautiful and foolish that the moment of forgiveness is easily forgiven. Truths do not yet emerge in Talia's life, but clarify their relationship with Yaara, which is not yet emerging. Tara Sharon, like Yaara, effectively uses her mobile face and voice and is totally convincing both as a great and a teenage girl. <br /> <br /> With the end of the film we will fully recognize his ability. <br /> <br /> Places and movements are small, but not duplicated by minor changes, by small men, and an interesting decision to represent Talian as just a teenager. With Yaara's final declaration, we stand along the edge of the cliff along with Talia's last spouse, Gadi, but the appearance of this trip is as interesting as it will not be seen for a long time to be recalled.
