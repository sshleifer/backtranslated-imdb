The introduction of Lily Mars is a delightful little movie showing actress Judy Garland's comedy skills, reflecting her standard song lyrics. This structure is labeled for the great break from Lily Mars's producer John Thornway. I think the comedy is light and there is nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie for everyone. Judy breathes in this role!
