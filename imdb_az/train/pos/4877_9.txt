In fact, it does not refer to the fact that a person / character is "not there," but rather refers to the power of my film. <br /> <br /> This is achieved without all the fantastic camera movements and / or big production kits, but it's a great story that takes the story (arc) and is achieved by very convincing and good players. <br /> <br /> The piece accompanied by great Japanese movies / movies (for example, the story of Tokyo) is, of course, not very wise, more mood! The nuances in strongly performing performances really carry. If you do not want to experience a carefree story and do not want to touch a movie emotionally, this is something to go. As you can see (as many of my reviewers) I am not into the story. There are places you can look at in IMDb, I'm not the one to spoil this story!
