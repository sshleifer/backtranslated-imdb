Norman, are you? (this is all the third party, so taken with a salt grains) was adapted when a African American family took a Jewish, stage and screen transition. Also, she was one of the start-ups in the film, so the footprint of the theater could not have been so beautiful. The reductions of Redd Foxx and others were still pretty good. <br /> <br /> I wanted to tell you that the movie is a TURNED PICTURE: it reflects the attitude towards finding a boy or a daughter in your family in the early 70's. For this reason alone, it is quite interesting - it's not a bit of a "hollywood". Do not believe me? Check lines on curtains and so on. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But the movie really shines in several areas. Redd Foxx, with his brother (!) Ensenada fled, trying to find his wife, on the one hand there is a split scene. Phone conversations along the border are truly memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie when Wayland Flowers and Madame used to make gay bars and nightclubs when her gay day out. For the best I know, it's the only time taken for a regular movie. And, a little purified and much shorter version is called to me. Still, this vintage is Madame and should not be released. People still steal lines from Wayland; The man was really talented. Enjoy your movie!
