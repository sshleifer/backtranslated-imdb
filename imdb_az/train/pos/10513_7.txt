If you have any information about the production of Jane Austen then you will repeat every novel: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made from novels are a bit boring, but I love Austen's characters, because they all have a personality and typical words that they want to repeat as in Emma. What's good for Emma Gwyneth Paltrow is very good in his lead role. Also, each of the characters in the film is not something to think about, but how does it become a good partner, and the sooner marry the movie?
