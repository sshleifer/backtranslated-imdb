Adam West and Burt Ward enjoy parody by themselves and have fun while doing this, the best combination is special. Especially the feel of the 1960s, Batcave set, Wayne Manor, suits and West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! It is worth your 90 minutes and is pleasant to all the fans of the classic 1960's "Batman" TV series. It should be noted that the videos of "Batman" were from the film and the series itself is probably not legal limitations. Sincerely, the show will be held on DVD for three seasons.
