This early circle melodrama, shot in black and white, is a small film, yet demonstrates the ability of the German director to transform accidents into something similar to the art scene. Established in 1910, Barbara Stanwyck is the wife of the small town for the charm of the Chicago scene and her sinner. She has never fulfilled her ambitions and is dropping her daughter back to the city she left with her daughter's letter, which is the love of the theater (secondary school). In his old town, he is once again opposed to a smaller thought and should deal with the eldest daughter of a fierce (drunken) husband (Richard Karlson) and an old lover. The area is not something new, but the Circus breaks apart by creating separate logical compositions, each frame is carefully drawn and behaves as Stanwyck's lead lady. It works 76 minutes a bit, and this is good, because the material does not have the feet to really go further.
