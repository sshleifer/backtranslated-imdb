Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to shoot a documentary about the New York City firefighters. They were the only filmmakers in the World Trade Center on September 11. <br /> <br /> Before working with Jail Hanlo's ladder company, Jules set off with captain to check and repair a gas leak, leaving Gedone. An interesting incident occurred in the fire case. <br /> <br /> A plane flying low over the city drew attention to Jules and drew a few seconds after the plane crashed into the first one. <br /> <br /> Jules's captain wanted to take him to Towers. The first thing you saw was two people in the fire, something that he refused. <br /> <br /> Brothers Naudet's film has been very careful not to be overly frustrated, confused, and heroic. But a language from firefighters is a bit strange, and CBS has shown many balls that are censoring. Brother Naudet is a mixed footage with individual interviews that can explain firefighters' thoughts and feelings at special moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a feature film of a similar address, most of the money coming from DVD sales go to charitable organizations that are 9/11. So far, the best documentary, which is completely deprived of emotional, moving, and political propaganda.
