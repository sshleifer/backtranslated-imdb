I bought it a while ago, but I did not watch it until last night. Although I'm not indifferent to Brad Pitt, I love Juliette Lewis. <br /> <br /> From this point of view, he must admit that he is a great actor - his character was completely convincing and I never thought Brad Pitt was. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I am David Duchovny. I'm an X-Files fan and wanted to look twice to confirm the history of this movie, because I thought a few years later. I love Duchovny, but only a few-dimensional character here, except that she was frustrated. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a cure. <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm sorry for the "Mulder" agency. Why did not I see it before? (I'll look and see this in the other roles I've seen in these works) Lewis, I am concerned about stereotyping this movie and the "Natural Birth Killers" (company-loved). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Even though it is interesting to see the reflection of the heroes - the film is almost continuous. It was perfect, except for the character of Duchovny, who did not appear completely (and probably "washed" by Pitt). I enjoyed the end - I was glad that innocent heroes did not die, but for the first time I was forced to suffer. <br /> <br /> If you love NBK, you love this movie, on the contrary.
