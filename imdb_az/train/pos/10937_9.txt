For all films, respect and recognition, this film is taken from Kung Fu historians, yet it is not remarkable for a few critical areas: action and struggle scenes. But this plot is probably the best and most original in the martial arts. Without a doubt you should see five deadly poisonings, not just a movie, but still watch; but I must say that it would be better after watching. It does not want anything, or you want more. Producer Chang Cheh builds up a story for potential masterpiece, but does not follow up with more actions we want. The fighting styles in the film really capture and display the audience (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, Toad), but the battles are very different. Toad and Snake styles are especially interesting and should be demonstrated much more, in fact, Toad is killed in the middle of the movie. Interestingly enough filming and lack of battle leads to the development of a large area, which is actually one of the few kung fu films that you are interested in and the result of the story line. There is a dark and similar tone to this movie and you are drawn to vibe. Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the film and add movie feelings. He takes us to a dark dungeon to launch the movie and introduce Chang's Cheon of Poison Clan. The scenes of ending struggles are certainly good, but suddenly you have been expecting more. Still, this movie is the best and most enjoyable of Shaw Brothers. My overall impression of the film would have been: The styles of the warriors used were simply shown and not shown in detail; it is simply that the director has something extraordinary on the tip of your fingertips, and has not expanded on it. I wonder what happens to this movie, it's still one of the best. 10 to 8 in size.
