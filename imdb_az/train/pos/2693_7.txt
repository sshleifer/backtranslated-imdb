Although the story is routine, the end of the "surprise" is nothing more than a bad jokes of the audience - you can see what attracted the good actors to the project - they are the roles that good actors can shine and they shine. The film is perfectly designed - in a timely manner. In 2000, it was called "We're in doubt" and only if you want to see a version of the story (all of which is truly worthwhile), the latter refers to the points that Hopkins is looking for in the modern direction and more clearly than the original. However, coming to the end is still a blow. (** 1/2)
