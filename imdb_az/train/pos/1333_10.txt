I love this movie and have watched it for a long time. I do not understand why everyone thinks this movie is not good. Maybe I love you personally or anything else. It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm not Indian, but I love it. It could be a little like Pretty Woman, but I did not see it and I do not think it's better than that. I do not know why it's all about frustrating, but maybe you've got a good reason, but I've been telling it enough, but I love it and I do not think it's okay. I'm so glad to anyone watching it, so I'm glad I did not like it. When it comes to Rani Mukherjee (I think you've written the last one), she's a very nice and beloved actress!
