About 50 years since the release of a film about romance and mysticism. Only two films I thought were "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films are not the stars of beautiful actors. In both films, all actors gave their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> Enchanted April is the four British women who are happier after WWI and who are happier in Italy while striking. A beautiful "Magic April" was made in 1992. It is a pleasant classic.
