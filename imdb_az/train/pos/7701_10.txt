This is always one of my favorite movies and will always be. Over the last few years, I have been in the 50s / 60s scientific philosophy, and then we have gathered all the good. I love so much more than just how to make some of them technically correct. The magnificent colors and gangs love me too. This is pain when re-creating some of the old good movies; they almost always fill it - just look at the last time On the day when the earth stood, it's completely rubbish! The Forbidden Planet is one of the critical space films of all time, and now I'm trying to do it again and trembling to think about a new thing! In my opinion, some things like fantasy classic films are just for them not only to be left alone, but also to classical examples of great attempts to explain simple stories and to excite people in this process. Now, when we add all the techno-crap, the movie looks more like dog-meat than the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing is special. By the way, the form of astronauts on the Forbidden Planet has also been used for the "King of the Outer Space"! The budgets were a bit lower, did not they? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... In this film, Leslie Nielsen plays great roles in the role of Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (always my favorite actors), Earl Holiman and Robby Robot Of course! <br /> <br /> Special effects are fantastic and the story is not too far away. This is a great fantasy experience!
