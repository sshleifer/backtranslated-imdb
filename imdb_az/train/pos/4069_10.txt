Listening to noise at present is a very powerful look for a dry eye, which comes back with a vigor. <br /> <br /> I saw Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and they have always been less than transparent. (It was too early for Nausicaa, even in the non-cut version, compared to ultra-manganese). Nevertheless, sometimes their weakness is intensified, because they tend to achieve a very clear / positive (Chihiro), or even more nuance, to a certain degree of Mononoke. At least, compared to the other Ghibli master Takahata (Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But that's not it. <br /> <br /> Laputada, Miyazaki, has been collected for centuries and is perfectly integrated, but with a completely transcendental atmosphere, as well as Totor's humor and entertainment. Each main character is perfectly described with doubts and fears and qualities that help to overcome their difficulty. Pacing is so perfect that I will not know anything except a black hole that can handle all of your existence. The story reveals itself as a mysterious mystery, but when the girl descends from the sky, unconscious, the stones begin to float, and the main theme begins with a large part of the great mystery that you have emerged, but the story is then settled on carefully chosen scenic movements and neat beauty and gradually dissolves builds an unforgettable summit of complexity, hope, beauty and will eventually see the horizon in a clear morning. <br /> <br /> Looks like a bright white light in your skull that we can see the distance, but with a smile, part of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a technically new example of Miyazaki, although it can be more difficult. She is undoubtedly a masterpiece for me. If you take a second part to understand that it was re-done in 1986, you can only conclude that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a visible 200-year-old star. Of course, this is foreseen in advance, but this is just a movie I can only show for the simple fact. If you miss this job for a lifetime, you will die with a big void - unfortunately, the coffin's price is the same.
