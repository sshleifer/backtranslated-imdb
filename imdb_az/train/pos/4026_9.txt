Pinjar is really a work ... Thinking is a thought-provoking, thought-provoking and questioning of our culture. Undoubtedly, the best Indian movie I have ever seen. This film should be shown in film festivals around the world, and I believe it will be a serious contender in Cannes. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> This is no prejudice or it does not have prejudice and the division is given a human story. No country here is depicted as good or bad. There are bad Hinds, bad pagans and good Indian and Pakists. Cinematography is excellent and music is melodious, meaningful and exciting. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the move just took my breath away. Everything was perfectly thrown.
