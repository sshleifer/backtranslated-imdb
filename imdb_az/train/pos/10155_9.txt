I do not understand the negative ideas about this movie. Yes, a girl who meets a typical boy is romantic, but only flies at this point, this is done with charm and polishing. <br /> <br /> <strong > Two reasons; The movie is very lively when sharing a scene - too! You see them ready to go somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Do not see negative comments - if you feel a little blue, look at this flick, you will feel better. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm still looking for the 33-year-old, the UK and the hopeless romantic Prince ...)
