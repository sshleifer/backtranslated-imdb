I saw this series when it was released at the Toronto Film Festival in Toronto. The idea behind the film was united and said that a filmmaker from every country wanted to shoot about 911 films. Until the project ended, these directors never met, and they saw how they looked at each other. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very strong, and some were controversial. If you're an American, some parts may be anti-American, because you do not like it at all. But I know several Americans who love this series. The piece I found the best was from India. A Muslim family living in the United States had two children and one missing. The Americans gave them cold shoulder and assumed they were automatically involved in terrorist bombing. He improved my mother's hopelessness and humiliation of these accusations and cried out to my eyes. Finally, we saw that many of his son died while trying to escape the towers. It was a real story, and it was so real. There were many emotional and powerful pieces and the African part was one of the best. It was as powerful as the others. I have a vision for everyone and I hope that America will oppose it and play in its own countries.
