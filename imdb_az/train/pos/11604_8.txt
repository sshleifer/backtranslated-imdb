Well, it's rare to find something that is approaching to brand a far-away brand, in an endless quest that is looking for good-looking horrifying films. I must say that I was surprised to say that when I switched the channels in the US cable network, "Sparkler burned". The goal is quite simple. In 1692, the youngest Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most vocal witness to the alleged witches, and makes unfounded accusations against those who want to win his dissatisfaction. Reverend Parris (Peters), who serves as a court instructor in manipulation witchcraft and devilish matters for his own purposes. Ann becomes complicated when accusing members of the Goodwood family. Salem (1980), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) will have extraordinary visions shortly before visiting the Salem Witch Museum. In the seventeenth century, a strange man tries to get there and reach the building. When the strange incidents begin to attract more, he continues to keep it. Soon, she gets into the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, more illustrations will be drawn and will go too far. Although the film is not aimed at action and does not show little interest to many audiences, speeches are good and the dialogue of the XVII century used in the majority of films is very convincing. Production values ​​are possible except for some special effects. In an additional note, the film's technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Well-trained, atmospheric, but watching a horrible film, viewers can appreciate it. Writer / director Bert İ. Gordon has created long-term fear and science fiction films and has been known for his work on "many mistakes" and similar works a few years ago.
