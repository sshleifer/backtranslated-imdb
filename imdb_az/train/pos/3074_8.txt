Recently, I grabbed this little ship of a movie on the cable. It took me to surprise, though it should be expected from the team associated with this film. <br /> <br /> Henri Bromwell has convinced and shows this film on the one hand. There are always miracles about the hidden life of the killers. Perhaps you do not have to get too far away to understand that your neighbors, public friends and even your friends are; <br /> <br /> This story is a cunning character who does not hesitate to remove everyone at the right price. <br /> <br /> He was bound to his son, even to his grandson. <br /> <br /> Alex is a man who lives in confusion. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly begins to grasp the outcome of his deeds. Someone should be able to help him find peace. Dr. When he goes to Parks, he tries to find absolution, even though he can not find it. On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns who should be killed. <br /> <br /> Alex, surprised by William H. Macy, disappointed us. He believes he is not just a fantastic actor, but also a man. One of the best things in the film is the late John Ritter. <br /> <br /> As Donald Sutherland is perfect as a dad, it's equally as convincing as the mystery of Dr. Parks. He is a natural actor in everything. Neve Campbell was surprised by Sarah's main role. She shows an incredible abilities and range. Tracey Ullman, suffering husband Martha and does not see much work. And Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is a grandmother from hell. David Dorfman is a delight in the film. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
