I loved this movie! I am a true Tom Hanks fan and I always regretted all his work. Cast Away, The Green Mile, Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, and Philadelphia. For his hilarious roles like his A League, Turner and Hooch, Can Catch Me, Lady Killers, Big & Definitely Toy Story. But in this film, Hanks is not the only great actor to illuminate the screen. Tyler Hoechlin does not provide a great starter and a great performance in the Hollywood co-stars as Hanks's son. Certainly, he is waiting for his career, I believe he will do great things. Paul Newman always gives a brilliant performance on the screen. It is really a legend. We can not forget people who do not have such great roles in the film, but still help to become a great helper. Beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bastard Out of Carolina and Single White Woman I will never forget, the film brings Hank's wife as glamorous and makes a great job. Another treasure was found in the film Liam Aiken. With such a small role, Lemony plays Snakes, Sweet November, and has done a great deal of work like the African Dragon, which gives a great performance.
