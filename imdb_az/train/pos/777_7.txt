I saw this movie at the Chicago Reeling film festival. According to a former reviewer, the film's claustrophobic feelings and closed colors make me feel overwhelmed, and the limited space, the architecture of confusion, the general feeling of hardness of the majority of people in Eastern and Central Europe. How will I describe a small scale housing project style, and how many people live outside larger cities. I do not want to say that I know Romania and Bucharest where the movement started, but I have been living in Eastern Europe for six months. <br /> <br /> When visiting Russia as a student for a semester, the whole group was forced to drag the seven stories of the bedroom as the hero, as the hero did, because the elevators did not work. However, I agree with many reviewers that Bucharest had not made many films in this movie because of cobalt and silent colors, unlucky or historic buildings, parks and squares that you can find in any city center of Eastern Europe. For me, watching this movie will make me feel good during my stay for half a year, feel good about classophobia, get trapped and limited. <br /> <br /> Also, given the homophobic climate, you say that if one wants to immigrate and get a better life, the two young women in love with the United States in the 1980s are in a very special issue forced to hold; <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this strange-themed movie, even in Romania, has been filed and I have received a complaint from the previous reviewer on a poor film. quality is very informative and patronizing. Most filmmakers and producer films have accelerated government support and funding and did their best with limited resources. The actors were good enough and convincing; <br /> <br /> This film offers an extra twist to the love banned by two young women. Kiki is an energetic, entertaining free spirit. a mystery (an insult, a disobedient brother, a love and affection for Sandu) fell in love with Alexandra, a brilliant, literate, idealist young woman who encouraged Bucharest to start college education. Opposites are attracted and seem to complement each other's personalities, but ambitious, diligent, intellectual Alexandra and Kiki, have some tension, as their parents seem to participate in a satisfied college. It is difficult to control the love that is hidden from their parents, although the tension required does not make sense, and we will never see or see other disciples - it's hard to believe and the tension that keeps them in love. The main danger to her love is difficult to drive Kiki's brother and her relationship with him. But does Kiki's love for Alexandra give him or her the power it needs to end violence? <br /> <br /> <strong> Kiki's love is a "illness" for another woman, but it is her lawlessness, her passion for her brother. Thus, loving a woman who loves a woman offers potential cure for her illness. <br /> <br /> Although these feelings are choking and claustrophobic, Kiki and Alexandra are extremely limited in their interaction, yet they are still acting and watching, so I'll give 7.
