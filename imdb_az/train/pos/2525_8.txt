The Tony Hawk Underground series came to a point where it really began to lose its grip, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not meet expectations, and Neversoft and Activision were so cool that underground for the Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans to create a new world presented the story model. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Neversoft has also improved in a matter that has started with the Pro Skater 3 and has a long line of designs. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were very good because the levels were good and had some long and some hidden features. Pro Skater 3 and 4 have been shortened due to some additional extra features and systems have pushed many boundaries. In this version, these features have been shortened, there are not many people who are interested in the streets, in fact there are almost no levels at some levels, and graphics and scanning physics are a bit less, though. <br/> <br/> <br/> In this game there is a con, storymode is a little short, of course this can be understood for the first time by the Neversofts Tony Hawk Pro Skater. However, it is said that you will definitely finish this game within one day. <br /> <br /> Generally, a very striking addition.
