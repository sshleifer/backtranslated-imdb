At the weekend I saw two films, one was "Kaal" and another "Waqt". Both films are shot in Bollywood, but the worlds are different. The main difference is Story and Director. Vipul Shaw made an indelible mark with Ankhen, one of the best comedy Indian films. Casting of Charecteres is perfect. A story from a Gujerati Play is awesome, with some exceptions to treatment. When Bollywood is filmed, a Bollywood director is proud to be a music director, and he has to win six songs to fulfill his contract (mediocre Malik). Like a good director like Vipul Shah, Finacier and his grandchildren have to use these numbers to relieve those who can not get enough. No music director can clearly sound his songs without grief as it is clearly evident in this movie. There is no melody in any of the songs, and in addition to background music and the western version of Bharat-Natyam, they openly interrupt the story story. Dueling and role playing Father and Son are well-operated by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes seem clear. A good director covers himself with good players and is ready to wait for a good story as it is in this super movie. Then we have a cheap unmanufactured producer, such as Sharukh Khan, who, like the Kalik, will come down like a shamelessly deployed and distributor to enrich himself with the value of art and cover themselves with boundary abilities. Investing in the beginning of the word. Bollywood Locksmiths, most of whom are in the Media, who earn the audience to win the Film Farce Awards given by Bollywood Camchak.
