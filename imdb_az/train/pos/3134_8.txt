This is a well-written story of the Batman Sitcom, and it actually brings together heroes with a great deal of research and presents a television show history. Unlike Brady and Partridge's documentary films, we just do not just look at the past and present life of Adam and Burt, but also want to go back to them. With Batman, Kapow and the cat and Riddler (s), Batman has not only been satisfied with having a hospitable outcome for the Batman series, but in all the Hollywood stories, for 35 years. <br /> <br /> Kudos!
