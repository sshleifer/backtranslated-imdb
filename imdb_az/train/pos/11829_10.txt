I've been watching Dick Tracy for many years and eventually became an important part of my life - it was with me in childhood and often saw him. Now, a very good movie, seen as an adult, is a dark, satirical and incredible mistake. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beatty, better than movie, to handle the noir comic book of a movie that is better than no movie .We are breathless when looking at a scene from the film. <br /> <br /> A really funny community, included in a place like Dumbin Hoffman, "Mumbles" and I do not think there is no defect. <br /> <br /> Generally, a really nice movie that has been misinterpreted for years after being released and is incredibly humiliated by only 5.7 / 10 Average on IMDb. Criticisms are very positive (See RottenTomatoes.com) and it's hard to see why after seeing the film again - the essence of this comic book, until eccentric mm…ôl an example. <br / <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
