There are numerous films about WW2, but Mother's Day is quite different: In this film, we meet an American living in Berlin, Howard Campbell (Nolte), and we are married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee). More precisely, a CIA agent, Major Wirtanen (Goodman), accepts Campbell, who has become a Nazi propaganda to enter the highest levels of the Hitler regime. However, the contract sees that the US government will not accept Campbell's role in the war of national security and therefore hates Campbell in the United States. After the war, he tries to conceal his identity, but reverses the past and insults him. His only "friend" is Wirtan, but he can not do a lot for the collapse of poor Campbell ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply touched because we are watching the Campbell tragedy, though a great patriot, It is upset by everyone involved. At the same time, there are many secrets of those closest to it. Vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere, reflects Campbell's hopelessness and hits the audience. <br /> <br /> Nolte plays the role of my life in my opinion; It is better than Affliction, though it plays scandalous figures to destroy itself in both roles. Sheryl Lee is also very good and generally can be said for all shooting. <br /> <br /> I have not read a book, so I can not judge how the movie is comparable. Anyway, it does not matter here: My criticism is linked to the film and the film is 9/10 heartily.
