I did not expect much from it, but in this movie I was laughing several times that I had to admit that I was rolling over. If you do not insult the first ten minutes, it can be a movie for you. If you have an hour and a half who want to watch Amanda Peet mixer cards, this is certainly not a comedy, but it works with this masterpiece, taking into account the indy genesis as a whole. To compare the playing field, cut off all of the studio films in total by a factor of 100 or imagine what you are getting! Kudos to see this through Peter Cohen and his network. We look forward to his next move.
