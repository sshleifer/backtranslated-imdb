The "great bliss" introduces us to the Holodek adventure first, in which case Captain Picard creates as a private researcher, Dixon Hill. These episodes create a number of standard examples in the TNG, as well as several times in DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the Holodeck, something goes wrong and characters play a game (they are not represented by Holodeck's unsuccessful security program), but should deal with the program in different ways. <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend Star Trek's capabilities and to provide some genre mix. Picard's Dixon Hill stories are examples of crime in the 1940s, and their representation on the screen is often referred to as the film's notorious stereotype antihero (for example, Chandler Marlowe's stories or Polanski's all-time classic "Chinatown"). Star Trek has never paid attention to the story (basically it's a simple "how-do-we-get-out-of-here" scenario), but the actors give a different approach to their characters. The Holodeck "games" are often used for recreational purposes and reflect the personal interests of the crew members. Therefore, technically it is always neglected, and stories are never silent in this respect (but Star Trek is technically, scientifically, and some utopian definitions). "Great Farewell" Comfortable Patrick Stewart shows that McFadden and Data are some of the great scenes that appear better in a Star Trek episode (at least in the early days), although the fact that the lamp is actually coming out of the wall would be surprising, because he had been researching at that time and his custom). Wesley continues to make peacekeepers as potential killers (why not they hijack her and kill her pirates?) But all this is fun ...
