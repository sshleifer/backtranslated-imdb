Woody Allen's second film was set up in London. Tha Tarot Card kills the whores in London. Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) journalist Peter Leyman (Hugh Jackman) gets one end. She begins romanticism, but soon falls in love. <br /> <br /> I love it more than last year, the name "Press Point". It was shorter and moved more quickly. The area is old, but it was a hospitable guest and it was predicting me until the end. It's not really a comedy, it's a secret of a few good comedy lines (above all else). <br /> <br /> <strong> Alena is not the best, but worse than worse <br /> <br /> Acting is basically very good. Allen is bad, but he has played this character a million times and has gotten tired. But Johansson and Jackman are just great - they look fantastic and give two attractive convictions. And Allen (surprisingly) strives for their sexual orientation - there are a number of them in their suit suits to show their attractive objects. Only real debt seems to be invalid how Allen still shoots London. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < <p style = "text-align: justify; I'll give it 8.
