The trapped characters inside a room spread throughout his work and, as time went on, would be more capable of describing their desperation and terrorizing the audience. <br /> <br /> Griffith achieves claustrophobic effect in two ways.

The dramatic "ride-to-the-box" here, then became a standard summit for Griffith's pictures.
