Paul Reiser did a great job to write this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It deserves the Academy Award. It was one of the most horrific and funny films of the year. Reiser's smart is fantastic, and he's so good, and like his long-running TV sitcom, "About You Mad". Peter Falk did a great job as his father, and now 78-year-old Peter made us laugh and weep. The support was equally splendid to the position of beautiful gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. This is a movie for 2005. We believe that everyone of all ages and religions will love this movie and in this way will belong to each other. There are such mothers, fathers, and siblings in the film. We all lived together in good times and bad times and wish all the same but different things.
