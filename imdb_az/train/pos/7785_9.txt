I just watched 2 Pang Brothers movies, Eye and One. When I looked in, I was disappointed about these two boys. I heard good words before them. The film has a really bad script, it ends, especially in childhood, clich√©, and in my opinion, but still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to get acquainted and did not disappoint again. Still have great photography, stunning looks, MTV-style design, cool music and this time the story has many indie souls, logical and beautiful, with a few small terrain holes, but this is a storyline. The only problem with this film is that I get a bad DVD.
