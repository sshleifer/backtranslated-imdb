I should not admit above, I am not a big fan of "family" movies today. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental shit. But this is Pixar's previous movie, like TOY STORY. The two leading characters were perhaps a little too soft (especially compared to the two potentials in ANTZ, but this movie is better), but the rest of the movie is more than that. The animation looked great, but humor was always good (especially Hopper's line, "I do not want to kill you if I did not kill you in the mangel of death, I would kill you") and the actors were terrifying when sounds, except two potentials (Denis Leary animated film, what a concept). And like everyone, I loved the outtakes! I hope the video has new ones.
