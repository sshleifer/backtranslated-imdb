Critically, people say Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed the bug life a bit more. I can not remember another Pixar animation except for two Toy Stories, so I was very laughing. Animated is pure, the story is original and propagandistic. Voice overs are doing this movie. Dave Foley is a serious anxiety disorder. Hopper, as well as Haydn Panettiere, is always a superb character by the beautiful Kevin Spacey. There's much support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I can continue. The scenario is fantastic, very funny and sometimes even touched. Antz's lack of social messages, but we have rock solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
