I'm asking those who do not care about this movie. Some analysts say that this is not enough, some are too long, and so on. They say. Do not listen to them! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely like this movie! <br /> <br /> Night performances are perfect! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are all superb and Liam Neeson is doing a sinking job and is a very important character for its size. The cinematography was bright and windy. <br /> <br /> This is in my life (with Shawshank) casting, directing, writing, acting, etc. Top 50 or 100 films have been reviewed. I felt very passionate about the fact that I was registered with IMDB so that everyone could know the real wish. I've seen this movie about 10 times each time with a different person and everyone likes it! First of all, you need to wake up for a few characters, and be careful about the first 30 minutes. If you pay attention to most of the children in this juvenile with reviews on movies on this site, it's more than you love this movie! Come on ... 3 The Lord of the Rings in the top 9 movies and Matrix # 32!!! <br /> <br /> This is the best 50 films!
