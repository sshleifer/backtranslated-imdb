If you're an admirer, you really love it. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca, or Seduction Cinema, it's not a movie that starts with this movie. It is very sweet, ridiculous, girls are warm and entertaining to watch. There is no sex until the end of the 45-minute movie, but the score is a trippy cheese and the plot is not a common hole. Misty Mundae's makeup is filthy in this movie, and her hair is unusual, so it's not as hot as it is with others. But her panties are pretty sweet (the movie is really strange). If you love it, you'll probably enjoy those of "70's Virgo", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (slightly more sexually-graphic). If you choose to watch Misty or Esmerelda in movies less sexually, more horror / exploitation (lower budget), see Factory 2000.
