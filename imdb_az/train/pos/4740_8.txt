Okay, not in any way a perfect movie, but I do not agree with the general IMDb ideas that it's really bad. In the 1990s, I watched many Hong Kong flixies and loved the tour. I have never seen the Black Mask and have just seen it for the first time last week. In addition to embarrassing weak dubbing, the movie contains the energy and bravado that penetrates Hong Kong films during this time. Still, my guns do not add a magic element to any Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale, or Mission Impossible screen, regardless of their budget - I think it's not spontaneous and it's very regulated ) will never succeed. What is this? The filmmakers were not afraid to avoid some spots to learn the lesson, and they experimented with what they did and did. For me, watching the movie is more entertaining and dangerous.
