Just do not doubt the big movie. Great story and superb performances, Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindu film industry goes shameless with Mallika and Co., this film is entirely dependent on Indian society, which is relieved of vulgarity and therefore fails vulgarity. But the message and concept that this film has made is absolutely superior. Anu Malik (dull copy-cat) escaped and could be used as a musician in Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmiya. I think Vipul Shah is a little affected by music, especially Gujarati. Anu Malik is the worst musician around, and he considers himself a popstar, but this is not a required movie - it looks just like Govinda's style. With some good Ghazals or sad songs, I felt some pretty serious music that made this movie more memorable.
