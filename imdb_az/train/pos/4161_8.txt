Galaxy Express 999 (Guinea tetsudô Three-Nine). Developed in 1979. Managed by Rintaro. <br /> <br /> I know how little GALAXY EXPRESS 999 is, and was published in 1970 as a famous manga and was created by Leiji Matsumoto. GE999 Matsumoto is set in the same Star Wars type of the same space universe as other famous cosmic manga: CAPTAIN HARLOCK. In fact, the pirate Harlock and other characters (including Queen Emeraldas and Tochirô Oyama) appear on the GE999. GE999 has succeeded as a manga and has also followed a series of popular anime series covering over 100 episodes. It was broadcast in 1978. A year later, this anime film appeared, which included the main points of the story, not later in the series, in a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> The story has made it possible for travelers to travel to different destinations in the form of the future Star Wars type. Future people can have mechanical bodies that can live for hundreds of years, perhaps forever. Hero, Tetsurô Hoshino, is a young man who witnesses how the whole body is made up of brutal Mecha's mechanical parts, how Tetsuro's mother was killed. Tetsurô gives revenge and convinces only a mechanical body. To get it, he must travel on a remote planet to Galaxy Express 999. However, Tetsuro has no money to buy an expensive ticket since poverty. By accident, he meets a beautiful young woman, Maetel, who gives her a deadly mother. Maetel offers a condition that he accompanies on his journey to Tetsuro. <br /> <br /> The first film I saw last October, six months later and again yesterday. I must first talk about something that is most disturbing to me in this movie, so it fled. What then can you expect from a 2-hour movie that is trying to explain the main points of the long series of more than 100 episodes? Whatever the situation, the situation changes rapidly, and Tetsurô meets the other important symbols in the story with pure luck. I think the artists should not leave anything or be in an additional 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Besides, GE999 has nothing to claim to be anime classic. The animation itself is very loyal to Matsumoto's manga style, it's detailed and beautiful to watch. After about 30 years of his speech, this animation embarrasses many anime movies that are "beyond date". If the music on the film was somewhat "old" today (over 70), it was nice to listen. I have not heard the English dubbing of this movie because I can only comment on Japanese voices. Voice actors are excited and give life to the most memorable ones, including Tetsurô and Masako Nozawa (mainly known as the Goku voice through the entire Dragon Ball Saga), like the Mysterious Maetel. Supporting characters do not remain in the shadows, but also have a life of themselves, the most memorable waiter for me, Claire. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also suitable for those looking for fun for a few hours, as well as those who want to find deeper messages. GE999 is an entertaining adventure movie, but Tetsuro may seem like a walk from childhood to male. The whole film is explained in its terms, so I feel it feels. I can connect many people to Tetzuro because, despite the elements of fantasy, she is a very realistic character: young, warm, principal and heartfelt. When it comes to seeing differences between people and machines, we are following it when it comes to the conclusion that it does not want a mechanical body. On the other hand, Maetel remains a mystery in the film, and in the end, even when it says who is and what the truth is, nothing matters. Maetel may seem like a young adult, always close, but inaccessible. <br /> <br /> There are still questions and questions between Tetsurô and Maetel and are amazed by decades. People claimed that relationships were two friends, mother and son, or two possible lover (Maetel's age was unknown and Tetsur was still a minor, causing many criticisms). Without any means to sound deep, I think the best time to describe them is "soul mates". There is no question of loyalty, kindness, and love to each other, but it goes beyond friendship, family, and lovers. I think their relationship will be filled in any of these categories, and will get something from all the movies and characters. <br /> <br /> Despite the GALAXY EXPRESS 999, the next scene is still very touching and memorable, even though you know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Anime classic of Katsuhiro Otomo's AKIRA (1988) and Mamoru Osey's "SHELL" (1995). The film is directed by Rintaro, a former experience of Leiji Matsumotoun, since he worked in the CAPTAIN HARLOCK series. Later, Rinatro is a wonderful looking METROPOLIS (2001), answering the differences between people and machines. <br /> <br /> GALAXY EXPRESS 999 (1979) is a classic that every anime fan can do at least once.
