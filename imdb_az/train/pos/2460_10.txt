Hamlet speaks of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is the heck of an actor. The description was just beautiful. His soliloquies were breathtaking. It's rare that the movie does not keep my interests, but I'm in that special piece. I suggest this to anyone with Shakespeare and not so much supporters. It's all about what's happening in movies in the modern world: crime, betrayal and deception. Not to knock Mel Gibson's version, Branaughs touches all matters. It does not leave any stone. When you finish the movie, you will feel as if you are reading it yourself. Um how do you say "two fingers".
