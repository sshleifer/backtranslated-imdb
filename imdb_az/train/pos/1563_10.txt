I like this episode. It's so great that 5 of them help LutherCorp and save the world. I like this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are guests! I just hope Clark will enter the Justice League and we will follow this group of heroes all over the world! =) What will happen afterwards because of those who are really excited and interested in the audience. I think that Chloe should join the team, because he does not have super powers, so it will be such a coool to do anything besides the Daily Planet. Also, what kind of types I would like to learn about Lex 33.1, I would be interested in what other powers of the world might have other powers!
