Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almeraya all go to Hamlet, but Branag survived. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth watch of Hamlet, a masterpiece by William Shakespeare and the whole story a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Many directors could not pull out of their audience without drilling, but the ability to use Bravo's bravo film style and stunt casting to the people, <br /> <br /> Along with that, Gerarde Depardieu, like Ranialdo, also took part. The whole purpose of the film was to ask Polonius Leartes to spy on him. <br /> <br /> This was Billy Crystal's grave, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmonu as Marcellous and Charlton Hester. <br /> <br /> The Circular Act is a 4-stage 4 soliloquy camera, which slowly diminishes as intensity increases, so cinematic is not a surprising thing. <br /> <br /> The only filmmaker, who understands the importance of each stage in this movie and knows how to convey this importance, is Stage, which means to start cheering from jumping into my chair. <br /> <br /> This is a must-have for everyone who tells a good story, has a brilliant performance and uses it in an incredible way. This part of William Shakespeare is the greatest triumph.
