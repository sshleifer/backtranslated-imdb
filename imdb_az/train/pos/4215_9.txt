This beautiful Twentieth-Century Fox movie, the metropolis, is a desolation labyrinth of survivors and predators surviving. <br /> <br /> A shepherd has a shepherd's wallet on the underground. There is a microfilm and it will go any length to restore a communist spy ring. <br /> <br /> Both spies and police are opening up two parallel research after overcoming valuable information. <br /> <br /> Anti-hero trafficking is played by mistrust by Skip McCoy Richard Widmark. He recognizes cops as ethical and intellectual authors, and he says, "Obey them," says Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "Throw me in." In this terrible world, police are just a few in the streets. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that Widmark was at this early age. <br /> <br /> In some cases,. The 39-year-old star plays former Skip Skipkoy, a legendary disobedience that comes to an end with his contract with Fox. Today, after unconsciousness of the interests of the romantic companion, it is not appropriate to revive her by dragging her into a beer, but for the severity of lust: and Sugar is a woman who has fallen. br> <br /> Jean Peters is brilliant as candy. Here, in the middle of the five-year B-movie glory, she attracts a beautiful and golden heart as a prostitute. He is a victim of the story, testifying to his beauty. <br /> <br /> The real star of this movie is New York. Haunting city panoramas and snidering subway stations offer an evocation of the city's claustrophobic, habitat, a harmless force. Like drought in a rotten cheese, human figures enjoy the edge of the city. Elevators, subway turnstiles, sidewalks, even dumb waiters, serve as a pipeline for corrupt humanitarian flows. People connecting to any place that provides safety: Moe has its dirty rented room and throws its tall sack on the Hudson River. The characters move and interact with the bridge architecture or tiled arc or are divided into hanging hooks. The city's identity always attracts. The angles of scaffolding trees and crossbeams echo the street plan and the card-index cabinets in the staff imitate the Manhattan silhouette. When Joey is banned from the subway, the city's gravel buckles are as if it's thrown. <br /> <br /> The surprising part of this film is drawn to the extreme. Character area, as needed, accelerates and is used to increase approximation character. When asked about sugar, a close person holds sex between them and denies the hostility of my Father's words. The beauty of Jean Peters is painted in the light of a subtle soft focus. The device is also used to increase tension. The opening sequence, the throw of a bag is in no dialogue: the drama stands in complete close with its powerful effect. <br /> <br /> Snoopers and snoopers snoopers live in the movie. Moe (Thelma Ritter) lives as a correspondent and is housed in a hierarchy, even by his victims. While browsing, "it needs to be eaten" is a routine run. <br /> <br /> True, the New Yorkers are dealing with Underworld traffic on the merchandise, like lamb or wooden boards. <br /> And still stupid doves are superior to Joey and his communist friends. Joey's legs symbolize the aggression of the most basic code of morality on the bed. Joey is not faded. Moe will not trade with Joey, even protect her life: "... we need to draw a line in our crafty business." <br /> <br /> Cold War in the Pickup depth. Richard Nixon was nominated as a Republican presidential candidate, his name was exposed by Alger Hiss, a fake communist microfilm and all. McCarthy show experiments were everyday reality. In the film, we see that the police are against "the traitors who gave A-bomb" to Stalin. <br /> <br /> New York can be regarded as a giant slot of human identities, plotting, and killings. Containers are leitmotif throughout the film. Moe has a trademark garden and a candy bag of microfilm container, engine of the field. It keeps its past wealth in a seawater symbolizing the hidden street wisdom. <br /> <br /> Hudson's barge-covered closed coffers are merely containers of another load around the metaphysis. <br /> <br /> The film is a work of composition. Sugar sculpted above is shown. Jump to the last door of the last, show his moral superiority. When the gun is placed on the table, the extreme perspective appears to be relatively bigger than Candy - violent tyranny begins. Valentines are captured by the shadow of the Stevedor's fork, and are reminded that their love is neither pure nor absolute but bound to the evil city. Eniard is a shadow of a communist wall, or a smoky tube of cigarette smoke. The predatory dreams of the night - it's the only cradle in the trash. Under the heading of taxi halls, camera shovels and hospital shots are constantly reinforced by the fact that we are trapped in the metropolis. We are wealthy in culture.
