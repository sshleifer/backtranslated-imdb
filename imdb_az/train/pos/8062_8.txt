Again morning morning, the TV shows an indispensable rule for movies that can not be tracked anymore. From the morning, I ran off the fourth film, Producer American Film Director, John Ford, and one of the most celebrated people in the movie, "The Informer (1935)". The scenario created during Irish Civil War in 1922 was adapted by Dudley Nichols from the same novel by Liam O'Flaherty. Although born in the United States and is famous for his "American" pictures, Ford's parents explain to both Ireland and the filmmaker's decision. Victor McLaglen plays Gypo Nolan, a terrific, but good sense, giving information about an old friend Frankie McPhillip (Wallace Ford) to pay £ 20 a reward for his girlfriend Katie (Margot Grahame). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Frankie and Gypo, both of which are members of the Irish Republican Army, begin to investigate traitors behind the incident, each clue brings closer and closer to real guilty. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Gypo is facing innocence for his friend's death, and many rivals, The Lost Weekend (1945), compete with Don Birnam. Gypo draws the attention of IRA members, who are investigating their overhead costs, because of a very small amount of alcohol that is stranded by depression. Once in his life, Gypo is surrounded by enthusiastic fans (attractive JM Kerrigan), who snatched him to the back and gave him "King Gipo" for his physical strength. However, these people are quite simple in paying attention to the fact that they have no love for people and that they are exploiting money. No extra £ 20 Gypso could buy a bundle of money from Frankie's death? Indeed, with mock irony, money became possible only through betrayal and loss of one of the only good friends. Gipo'nun a relatively simple person may not have considered the results of his actions as a whole, and as a result, he is offered forgiveness because he does not know what he is doing, but his foolishness should not be impunity. <br /> <br /> Criticism was sometimes created for Ford's claim that a "terrorist" organization was propagandized. Although I do not doubt that the position of the Irish Army is selfless, dedicated and impartial, Irish patriotism, this posture is obvious to the views of an obvious person (I really do not know the history of Ireland's historic judgments). I have never seen. But the main theme of the story is betrayal; An ordinary man who is driven by a poverty-stricken man betrayed his good friend's reputation and regrets his actions. The Magical Gypo is basically awakening, and Victor McLaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a life of unpleasant existence for a lifetime and results in a terrible decision that condemns him to a severe death. "The Informer" won John Ford's first major Oscars and was awarded the fourth prize (six), including the best actor for McLaglen ('Bounty on Mutine' (1935)), Best Director for Dudley Nichols and Best scenario (those who gave up the award due to the Union dispute).
