I fell in love with this silent action drama. Kurt Russell and Kurt Russell just played it very well. Todd (Kurt Russell), who did not know anything but childhood war and war, was thrown into a planet after he was obsessed by genetically engineer soldiers. <br /> <br /> The scene was set up and was born with another classic action movie - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and is totally self-attractive, attractive, and made all people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
