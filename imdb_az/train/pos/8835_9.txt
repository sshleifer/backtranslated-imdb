A sharp political commentary about the coming of a story about age is what this film is about. An annoying thing is to work effectively on both levels. It is not meant for that, but it does. This story of four boys and one girl growing up in 1953 makes the Communist Belgrade hearty. These gentlemen refer to as classic movies. Obviously, since the Communist society of Belgrade was often described in 1953, it is not as tough as dictatorship and fascist environments. You can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is "Hey Babu Riba". However, there are no drugs that can not be purchased and why it is illegal. Unlike the heavy-handed critique of a communist society, it does this by showing how the film influences the lives of five heroes who have shown themselves as the fourth. A girl in the exile in Italy who has a father and a mother who has a passport waiting for her to join her and join her, because of the need for new friends, suddenly giving your piano, home and quarter one of the girls together. The children spend a lot of time listening to music, and it is clear that they are despising the fascism that communism has created because they are engaged in tiffs with a fascist charlatan in Stalin's hands. All this leads to the subsequent actions and the exposure of a time, because this film was brought to the Soviet Union in 1986. It's a great movie again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but it is still no friend."
