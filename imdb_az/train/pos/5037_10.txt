This can be the lowest level film of his genre. I do not remember any commercials or ads that could have been the reason for not seeing so well in silver. However, Frailty is an excellent and really original horror movie. <br /> <br /> The film is among the top 10 most popular horror films in my list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with photographs and news stories that tell us about a murderer who calls himself "God's hand". Then a man goes to a police station and tells the chief officer that he is the brother of a murderer. Two of them leave the victim together to go somewhere in a buried state, which can help solve the problem. During this trip, the man begins to explain the story of a brother and will return when the events start. Fenton and Adam claim that one day God received a divine message that they constantly ask to kill the demon-possessed man. <br /> <br /> He takes a list of the names of the devils to be destroyed from God and asks his children to help fulfill this divine duty. <br /> <br /> This is a totally horrible and suspense film that will keep you out. seat. Tension is high, innocent people (or Demons?) Are killed and questioned by religious practice. At the end, there are many, but very clever twists. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I have a DVD and this is one of my favorite fears and anxieties of all time.
