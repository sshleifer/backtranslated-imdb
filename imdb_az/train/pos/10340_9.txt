It's one of my favorite comedy, though it's been a year before I was born. Redd Foxx is like a father trying to figure out his son's homosexuality. Like many parents, she did not know what it meant to be gay, and what kind of stereotypical genius these gay people are. His son, Norman, is now growing and living himself. When his father realized that his son was gay, he visited his son with the hope of changing himself. One of the most flimsy lines in the film is the name of the movie - When I go to Norman's apartment, the woman leads to prostitution and thinks her son's drifting ("Norman ... is that you?"). The movie made me laugh from beginning to end. Redd Foxx is great. While many things were stereotypic, I could not find anything negative about how the material was handled and even ended up well. Be advised.
