Recently, I've been losing my faith in movies that have been flooded with the typical genre Hollywood movie. The story lines are unsuccessful, and the camera job is simply copied from the last movie of the last taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europa) and my faith was renewed. Not only does metaphorical storytelling stimulate the use of color and black-and-white. Max Von Sydow takes you through a wizarding journey at every step of your way and takes you to Europa in 1945. We've all seen the death of a hundred thousand ways, but how does the beauty of this movie lead you? Every slowly causing you to die. Unlike many films, it does not break after a moment showing a knife, but forces a person to watch the devastating, delicate beauty of the last moments. I think we can get something different from what this movie wants, but it is worth the time to figure out what that really means. For anyone who wants to send me an email, I'd like to talk more about the movie. Enjoy!
