I want to say that these miniatures were the best interpretation of the favorite novel, Jane Eyre. Both Dalton and Clarke are very convincing, like Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but none of this does not compare. It's the best for me. I can not imagine these characters as another human being once playing. Once I saw that the last time I was only 13 years old in 1984. Then I built a book and just read the Charlotte Bronte novel. I've been completely enrolled by these mini-designers and have not lost any episodes. I would like to see it again because it's very good. :-)
