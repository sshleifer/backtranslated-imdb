One word can describe this movie and it is strange. I celebrated this movie one day because it was Japanese animation and old, so I thought it would be interesting. It would be good if the film was about a young man going to get a metal body that the universe could take revenge. On the way, he meets many colored characters and should decide that he does not want his body. Very strangely, if you are an animated / science-fiction fan, you may want to check it out.
