The stock should have earned the Academy Award for this performance. His crime is a crime. How surprised he is to humanize a rich worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone won the Academy Award for Best Performance. In fact, it's all about acting in this movie. <br /> <br /> The area begins with a taxi ride, then begins with an airplane trip, and then continues on an emotional journey that will be of interest. <br /> <br /> But it's just a clear soap opera. One-dimensional, 100 percent speed. It can be called the best table because it works very well on the material. Perfectly moving, well-directed, but seriously in the soap genre. I would not call it a melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Life Immitation"). You can imagine what this talented actor and director can do with a more important topic, although it does not deny the great entertainment value of this movie.
