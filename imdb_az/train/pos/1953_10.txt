This movie was based on the true story of a woman who had two children and was not very good, and was afraid that this truth was real! <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton described her character as having two sons, Patsy McCartle. His performance is to carry out a real-life story on a television screen. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to watch this lovely lady alone, though it was very difficult to watch some of the scenes. <br /> <br /> But that is so true. <br /> <br /> I also thought that it was very risky for those who want to be the director of the film. What happened to this woman? But good deeds have been done. <br /> <br /> I welcome the director to prepare this film. <br /> <br /> I know those who want to learn what can happen if you are dependent on drugs or depend on them. .
