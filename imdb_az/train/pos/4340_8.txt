Perhaps, I enjoyed this movie, so I did not have any reviews and so on. I did not know why he did not splash more. If the story goes, I can relate to some aspects of Paul Reiser's character, and I can say "I see my father" in Falk's character. When I was a child and listening to my dad, I remembered many past times. If you use movies like Grumpy Old Men or Golden Pond, this is your movie. In my opinion, a "bedroom" and one of these lovely stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had very beautiful oral combinations, but nothing had happened. I would say that at least 8, perhaps higher.
