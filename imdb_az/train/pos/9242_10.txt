<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie about 1988/89 or I apologize when I'm a boy. It is said that he lived with ninjas long. The field is incredibly strange and the player is scared, but there is a certain mystical situation surrounding the ninjas, which is a very good atmosphere. <br /> <br /> When I'm a boy, it's better to say that it's just an incredible nonsense that we can see the brightest points. in the film, but as I do not blame it as a martial art film, "sit up with a few beers" is better and better than the American Ninja Style Gems that are produced in the 80s <br /> <br /> Dusty, a writer and director of Sakura Killers, Nelson made another ninja movie called "White Phantom" under the Bonaire movie flag. This is the sequel to Sakura Killers, or the Sakura clan is a key feature, including the same White Ninja, including the same logo and a similar story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a martial artist, an explosion to kill a few hours Give!
