During the celebration of Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, HERE IS HERE FOR HERE? finally came out for a screening. Please note that any movie that we've worked with Weill-Gershwin may be missing from the screens. The length of your account stands out and emphasizes the importance of the material CD, together with Gershwin and Weill. Yes, the film has problems, but it's not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this fantasy fantasy, and Fred MacMurray understands this material quite well. Then the 'modern' segment is weak. AMA fantasy elements are of high likelihood because the two favorite women's work is Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have a charm that these things should work in hopeless ways. Like the Second World War, the film has never been forgotten - it has never been forgotten - the film has come to the forefront of Hollywood music and should be seen and important for everyone.
