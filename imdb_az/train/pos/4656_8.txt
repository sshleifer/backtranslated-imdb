Peter Ustinov is a clever, undoubtedly entertaining tune that forces his career with the sights of the US Congression in London. He was aboxed by foxy (and deceptively sharp) by Maggie Smith and threatened by the jealous company man exposed by Bob Newhart. This is a multi-brained heist film. Ustinov is exceptional as laughable as Smith and Newhart. A real surprise, like Karl Malden, the executive vice president of the pill. Malden was rarely very empty. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in some comic komsomes. Excellent music account is provided by Laurie Johnson. Eric Tillin's direction is tense, and Ustinov and Ira Wallach's writing are first class and very clever. A good time to swing!
