The movie might be great. I only watched last night, but for the first time I do not think I should be honest. The book is better than the movie I'm disappointed with. If you intend to follow the "Human Headset", you will not read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is very good and is more than just Phillipp's love relationship with Mildred, and you can do it again after seeing the movie. I do not ease this demand. I read a book every 4 days and read different authors like Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Human Headset" is one of my top ten novels ever written.
