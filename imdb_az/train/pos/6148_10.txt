DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) delights in his memory <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie for the first time in my 4 years, I was impressed by the story of the Witch II World War II. The scene that affected me most was the war between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was unusual for them to intervene in their journey by seeing these armies without a body walk, making their thrilling songs sing. This film is fantastic for a trip to Naboomboo on a visit to Portobello Road (London's most magnificent place). Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are a really fantastic couple. He is always great, looks like a good man of a family, and David is a great co-leader with his always striking face. We will wait for it long.
