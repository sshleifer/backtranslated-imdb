Another film, besides Soylent Green, is such a haven of despair on the beach. Both films deal with species and the results of the planet's human cataclysms. <br /> <br /> With the ecological poisoning of the planet on the beach with the Nuclear War and with Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some of the optimists have come because we have come to one of the worlds shown in these films since 2007 and we have been so far. As depicted in Soylent Green, there are still about 8 million people in New York City's turn. Environmentalists always greet this movie by showing the outcome of global warming. For me, this is the right to life's ethical behavior. No doubt, there is no family planning in this world. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a NYPD detector who lives with his longtime old friend Edward G. Robinson to remember the Earth before the disaster. Journalist Joseph Cotten is a crime committed by Soylent Corporation, a multinational concern that comes with a food product in many colors to feed the world's population. This is the final product Soylent Greene. <br /> <br /> The investigation finds Charlton Heston his man, and also leads to some terrible truths about Soylent Corporation and the future of humanity. When Heston says that Soylent Green is made of humans, we have become a race that can not be considered a terrible thing. <br /> <br /> This was Edward G. Robinson's farewell performance, and in his memoirs, Heston spoke with Robinson, despite different political views. . A few weeks later, Robinson closed the last scene with his agreement with Euthanasia, and died in real life. <br /> <br /> Hesson said Robinson was the last and did not take part in the last death scene between them. <br /> <br /> This is not the world, despite the extinguishing of the table. Designed by Soylent Green. Hopefully, we will not only create intelligence but share responsibility.
