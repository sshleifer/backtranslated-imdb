I do not just apologize for this movie: there are far, far, wide-angle rapproaches, and if they irritate you with enough fairness. They did not do it for the first ten minutes or so. But then I announced a kind of clash with terrible cinematography; Long before the film's end, I was out of sight. It's a very comedy for a very easy destruction. It's funny, it's virtuoso, the funny description of ALL the body is flawless, but with a slightly frozen, fish-eyed lens, Usher respects each other - he does not want them much - he tries to warm them up. "Mystery Men" is, in fact, much more intelligent than anything else, but also a deeper one. For example, the jokes that occur in Austin Powers are less funny than the jokes here, but they are much less gloomy. The line of "Mystery Men" is whipped up when something is crushed and loosely loosens when it is not. It just does not mock any old thing. Therefore, some of them (ignoring them), as opposed to critics, do not escape ideas. <br /> <br /> The "super" heroes are an attractive group. Of course, they are second-rate, but they are not only the second degree. For example, Blue Rajah does nothing more than throwing a cutlery for people, and it's not so good. On the other hand, it is not too bad. Better than most people in a limited area, he is busy. He is not a belt but gives him more funnier character. Supermann Christ is a hood, Mystery Men is small fruits on the slopes of Olympus Mountain. Very funnier; It's even more pleasing.
