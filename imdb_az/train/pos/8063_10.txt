This incredible Oscar winner (total 4) and John Ford's first Oscars award, is simply packed with a pounding account by Max Steiner. Ford called it a movie, because there was so little money to do with this great story about the guilt and penalty of Ford. But this film is such a classic, neither direction nor surprising photography, fog and lighting is a tradition of German expression, which is different from ordinary American movies and more. And the Oscars performed by Victor McLaglen are just as incredible as the drunken Gypo. Basically, the film is being held in Ireland, and Gypo becomes a friend of the rebel movement against the British to collect 20 pounds to give his sexy companion. But with all these money, he starts to drag all night and the leaders of the movement are trying to follow the information. The whole film is a night in a dark and foggy Irish and consists of a number of memorable characters, but the whole Gypo world is psychologically closed. Perhaps, all three directors should have chosen films for God to live on an eternal island, and John Ford would certainly be one of them, as long as no-one can afford it. What a really nice movie ...
