The Mom Night is one of my favorite novels, and I was looking forward to seeing a great disappointment. Instead, I have a film that reflects the shaking sorrow of Vonnegut's novel, mockery, humor, identity and more. <br /> <br /> This, of course, is the best predictor of Nolten's history. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> Sherryl Lee, Cambell ' as a young lover, left the truth. <br /> <br /> John Goodman from Cambell's "Blue Fairy Godmother" is effective and more effective. <br /> <br /> Cambell's is a mature and lively look at this Pinnocioesque story, trying to become its ideal hero and unwittingly trying to become its ideal tragic villian. In addition, this is one of the deepest romantic movies I have ever encountered. Cambell is an incarnation of both stupid and wise love. And a painful result in the movies, she finally learns what it means to be a true child because the Goddess of the Blue Pearl wants her. <br /> <br /> The trial of those who are struggling against violence in the Caucasus continues. It is a beautiful poetic story deepening our emotions and completely loyal to its original author.
