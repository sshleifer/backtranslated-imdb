You know what they say about the 70s. If you remember that you were not there. One of the things I have mentioned about the 70s was the first hippie and hip social satire, as it is seen from the "underground perspective". Groove Tube. If some viewers look humorous or unreasonable, over the last 30 years, many events have taken place, and the comedy is no longer "fresh" ... but hey! This movie is the first when it comes out ... and some of these sketches are for the first time ... During a time when Nikson was in office, during a period of Vietnam war, sexual revolution continued rapidly. and J. Eckhard Hoover was still responsible for the FBI. This is a movie made before the Watergate break, and thus was one of the first to play a great swing in the structure ... at the same time making hippies and entertainments. And obviously, some skits are still fun fun. If you like Chechen and Chong "Smoke Up", you will LOVE this movie. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what the 70's really is ... Check the Groove Tube ... If you like it, you'll earn the Groove Tick if the Oscars win the same year and think that the TV is right in its monster. .. chooses the subject, but plays in the eyes of viewers. Young viewers who turn television into other entertainment. We raised the word "Let go" in Ã–zzie & Harriet, Father knows best, knows my three sons ... Happy days ... imagine those who tested their new lifestyle smiles if they saw the box being sent out as we see it! Only Uranus Corporation ads are priceless. "Good things come from Urban" .... and when you eat hippie crops, Fritz's Catalog is still one of the best seques to straighten the straight-line animation. <br /> <br /> If you love Kentucky Fried, you'll LOVE this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> a mysterious little movie that will help us remember the memento of the time ... and 70 of us all forgot.
