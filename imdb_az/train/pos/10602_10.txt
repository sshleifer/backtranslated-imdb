I have to say that I absolutely love the movie. It was very unpleasant moments, some heartbreaking parts, and only those around you. Personally I liked the movie because finally it was something related to my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is directed more towards the gay gay population. A young teenager shows how to treat when growing up. All humility, my calling, and I do not know, like all other young women, I always remember and now is a movie that shows how difficult it is to grow gay. So, I'm definitely going to see this movie. Perhaps one person is old and does not really have to watch it until it's enough to understand
