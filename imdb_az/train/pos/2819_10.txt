This movie bufoonery! and I loved it! "Dragon lord" (Jacky Chan) and his friend, "cowboy", were totally fun, meaningful and simply silly. Film is a rare blend of evil and evil struggles and (in some way) growing miracle and fun. Long Shao Ye describes the spectator as a young "dragon lord" (he is called so-called son of a rich family) and "cowboy" uses intelligent, detailed paths to escape learning. (for example, a home doctor, including a tutor), compete with many childhood (and sexually explicit) techniques to win the love of a local girl who is competing in football. <br /> <br /> There are serious moments in the film: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Boys do not lose weight in this exchange, but they really are used against evil. What I really love about this movie is how they ended up. It's not a typical conflict (it's also awesome), but you're good. <br /> <br /> Let's simply say that the movie really keeps the soul. <br /> <br /> Foolish, intelligent, meaningful and nostalgic. big movie
