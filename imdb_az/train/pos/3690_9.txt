Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all people the ability to love the whole world, but because of the size of a human heart, there is a special place where everyone loves more than any other person. It seems to me that the most prominent directors of the day can be the slogans for eternal love for this place and to describe the situation in the lives of residents and guests. As a result, Paris je t'aime, our short films, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne, and others take us through the Paris arrondissements, human emotions, gifts and expectations. /> <br /> Always some other quarter, always at all times as a love story about people, a park, a craft studio, a pipe station. And Paris loves je t'aime - a partner, a child, a parent's love, love for the world, but no longer around, love that needs love, your love comes to mind, as you remember. <br /> <br /> Besides, this film is not just love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion. daily ups and downs. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 9, because some of the stories in the last section? but it's not all that's what's missing me and does not mean a specific reference to the future of characters with "further development". When I touches everything I say it's just tempting. She wants to leave everything behind, run to Paris and live with these little romances.
