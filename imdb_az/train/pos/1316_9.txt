I just finished watching this beautifully designed and beautiful moving / directing movie. I was frosty and tuck as I was going to spend my time viewing my horrorly distracted advertising because of the Lifetime Movie Network movie. Reading the previous comments convinced me to give a shot. After all the bad that may be that drilling can be a long bug spray ad that may fall off in one of the ad. Why did I watch it? Basically IMDB is a movie STATISTICS MEDIA. must be sure hit <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The portrait he made in this movie was a tough but realistic man in a beautiful painting of a police officer. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt, when the scene was promptly witty, when it was inaugurated verbally, she could stand up to the foot with any actor. But he is also skillful in delivering emotional responsive volume without uttering a phrase and expression of the body language only. Without advertising, kill any good movie sustainability in the design, it would end in the real edge-of-the-seat nail. I did it 9.0
