<br /> <br /> This foreign film, made in 1931, should be more frequent and should be used more often. <br /> <br /> We are quietly opening in the village and watching the roofs of the citizens lying. Then we heard something like a party. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the two men tell the story of two friends, two of whom are two selected friends for a lottery, and probably two friends. <br /> <br /> The star in the picture has its number and friend. When asked about his wife, he would share half of the dough, and if his ticket won, his friend did not say anything. In fact, H.E. There are no double hockey sticks! <br /> <br /> So, when he knows that our people know that he has won and that he has lost nothing because of his own sin, he is perfect. Everyone is looking for a ticket, as something like a sign of the "Big Race." Despite all this, I was in the knots at all times and the money-bank that was shown to me in this panorama was saddened by the sadness of the film. Follow Le Million!
