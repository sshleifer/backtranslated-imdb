Bette Davis's exciting performance is difficult to remember other female football players. Davis himself was as perfect as his parts - how much they had. Some reviewers felt that the book was much better - to give it a movie, but there was no need to lighten a 600-page book for up to 83 minutes. The first part of the book did not even bring it to the screen - spoke of Phillip's childhood, and Phillip moved to Germany and Paris where he went to work as an artist. She also gets acquainted with her first romantic, Fanny Price, and can not put the feelings of self-killing while she is performing Phillip. <br /> <br /> This is not a very good movie, it will not read the movie and realize how good the film is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A mediocre artist, Phillip Carey (Leslie Howard) hopes to get her medicine. When he tears, he meets a small waitress, Mildred (Bette Davis). She does not show any interest to her, and mainly looks like dirt, Phillip is obsessed. In this horrible effort, it is difficult to find every effort to find the responsibility. At one stage, he could say, "Why wait in the classroom when there is a class in the waiting room?" By giving a promise to each other, promising to meet in a waiting room in the second-floor railroad? You just want to shake it. She likes her, when she says she intends to marry another man, Emil Miller (Alan Hale). With Mildred, he gets acquainted with Nora (Kay Johnson), writes romantic novels under one person's cufflinks. He is talking to joy in the books of his servants (in Mildred's novel). Nora gives Phillip her love and affection, but she is not able to escape her love. When Mildred returned (Miller did not marry him and he was a baby), of course he serves him and helps him with the baby (the film is perceived as an object - always a baby.) Visit the sick father in the hospital who met her with Sally Athelni (Frances Dee), who began to start her home and for the first time in her life, was surprised, surprise! Mildred returns as a bad kick and surprise! He is trying to show his appreciation for what he knows, and then the worst in the film, "You are crap, dirty pig", "You begged, kissed you," and "I wiped my mouth when you cut my mouth!" In every sense of the word Mildred you are a gentleman "," against me "and" Mr. high and mighty "prostitutes, and as Phillip meets him, <br /> <br /> Phillips (who is really free from Mildred) now loves Sally, but Sally says in her book he thinks Phillip is a baby, but he is more convinced of his love. <br /> <br /> Mildred's "illness" could not have been filmed - even pre-coded. <br /> <br /> Kay Johnson has always called for sensitive, convincing women to play - clearly vulnerable. Nora was a woman with Philip. Frances Dee was one of the most beautiful in the screenshots. Undoubtedly, he is not just a nice face ("Silver Cord" and "Blood Money"), but a number of roles that prove Joel McCrea's marriage. Sally did not limit his talent. As you can see, Leslie Howard did not help Bette Davis on the band - she was worried that she would not be part of an English actress. When he was reading "a book coming out of the camera," he dropped the lines. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to say that a newspaper "run away from childhood". <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
