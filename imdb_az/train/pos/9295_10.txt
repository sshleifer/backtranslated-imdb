It was difficult to believe all of the negative comments about the star's whisper. I laughed all the pictures as I saw the whole family. The film itself recognized as a real-time gangster comedy - players were hysterical - had a good time doing it. Of course, it was very nice and all Everton Dreyfuss Goldblum and daughters, and all the divine in each of the two Falco's about music. Rob Reiner made a big funny limo driver and Gabriel Byrne a ridiculous neurotic. Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, Sleepy Joe character and all the complicated and grave, he reminds. <br /> <br /> Byrne, "My path," a duet performance Vickin decided to bring home happy after Paul Anka was his usual entertaining self. <br /> <br /> I am a funny visit to this movie by Frank Sinatra and his friends; Dreyfuss followed him perfectly. I, too, no one to imitate the actions that take place in this film, no age, no one will not feel - it's humorous, "gangsta" is not a film. <br /> <br /> I "Mad Dog Time," a lot like comedy, I think, less harmful than cartoons on television crime dramas, shows and discussions. I recommend the video for a family party.
