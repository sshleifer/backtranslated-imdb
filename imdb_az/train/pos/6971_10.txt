Of course the average "Sci-Fi" Battle Star Gallactica fan will hate it. This kind of thing makes me happy. <br /> <br /> This poem has won a lot of heat for this show (unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it. I read the Wiki, they wanted to address women and everyone, including scientists. <br /> <br /> This is the most promising show ever since Lost. <br /> <br /> What I love most about the show is that there are many games like a great Anime! The gunfire reminds us of something from Japan (Anime is very embarrassed) from young people working around fire, a very well-balanced and complex script, and nothing better than robots.
