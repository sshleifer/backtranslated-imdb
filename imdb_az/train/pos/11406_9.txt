This surprising effect on the last opera of Wagner grew up on me. When I first saw, I was a little worried about the surrealistic images of most of the films, and I felt that too many things overlapped over the story. But if it can be called a fair amount of recherché "gimmicks", I think that the film is capable of capturing a very strange and secular atmosphere of the opera, especially moments. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not understand the role of Kundry until Edith Clever described him.
