I thought that this film was very well prepared, Heath Leger was very convincing and Ireland's accents were flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and convincing. I just confirmed what was happening, I had no idea, but people have sometimes described it as they did. Maybe the authorities are always violated and interested that more than 30,000 people have signed a petition for Ned Kelly, perhaps more than the first thought in this film? In many ways, it reminded me of Cold Mountain, a good historical film. Generally, I would highly recommend this film and I was a little surprised that they did not do much in cinemas.
