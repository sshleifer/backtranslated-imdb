This movie was simply awesome.It was a very sensitive issue and the movie was superb. This film did not create any controversy in India (as far as I know) and its promotion is kept low. Originally, I just do not waste time because this movie just uses the majority of Indian filmmakers and producers to add a theme, but the original story adds a love story and breaks everything ... Most of India would have thought about it <br /> <br /> <strong> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> If I am, I would like to thank Anil Kapur (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director). Take such a big movie.
