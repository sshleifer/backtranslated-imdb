I enjoyed this movie more than anything else; Here I am going to see other reviews, a full-fledged screen of a movie scene, entertaining and enthusiastic audience. <br /> <br /> I'm fortunate enough to experience this, surrounded by laughter, and had a very good time with this unusual comedy. <br /> It does not shine anywhere as a shining comedy for it. Music is not a special thing - in fact, I did not understand it, it was music, and when it was popped into the lyric, more and more people were surprised, but half the danger, they would meet their spouse and relatives. <br /> <br /> In some cases, like the past, Francesca, a sixth-century portrait, pivots around passing anachronistic hairstyle and fur dresses. The idea of ​​the sacredness of marriage is not limited to Countess Angelina, a long-time offspring, and can immediately announce the story in the doorstep of the door, under the tension of the Production Code, to ensure that one does not generate the hero <br /> <br /> Romanticism takes little space, and in fact the first few scenes very tiresome. But the script and the film are the battle of the following genres when it comes to life. Her conversations with Angelina, Douglas Fairbanks Jr's Betty Grable, are followed by Betty-Grebs-as-Francesca, and she is erasing it completely, resulting in a thrilling fantasy sequence. legs. Although the result of the colonial misunderstanding has been handled with a sensitive touch in the rest of the operetta, the majority of Fairbanks's happy and frightening awakening is greater. <br /> <br /> The goal is totally convincing to creating two different characters, and it cleverly conquers almost all limitations and has a strange place. various oral trials of dialogue are in question. But in the field of non-verbal reaction, it actually coincides with male-supporting devices; Particularly, Fairbanks is an absolute cure for a series of non-verbal sequences that are set and humor silent. <br /> <br /> This film is unmatched in the style of being classic, for a brilliant repartee hackneyed tedium. But in the best way, it's really funny, and as the lights rise, at the end of the audience, spontaneous applause and laughter have come round. It could have failed to drive the modern era - but this show was not really worthy of being canceled by Grable and Preminger (uncredited) director. It's not a masterpiece, it's a fun little thing, and I remember all the ways at home for myself.
