This is an impossible story, a woman witch watching a mortal man in a mortal world. His "community" is open to his members, but he hides gossip from man. Hmmmm ... it starts to sound familiar. LOL. This is not a typical movie. Many "camping" performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things boring. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found his pairing with James Stewart, which is unusual (but not fatal to the story). <br /> <br /> This film, which interests all things in witchcraft and darkness, is worthy of being discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences ...... NOW LIFE!
