<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Yes, this production is long (good news for fans of Bronte! you will not want to watch other versions that are brilliant! > Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester ... it's simple. I do not claim that other reviewers are very nice. Dalton, of course, is not a charming but beautiful boy. In fact, in my opinion, it has a dark, angular darkness of appeal with a mysterious, multi-man, Mr R., and he takes the sad, tortured face of Rochester in a very harsh manner. He calls the scene, but Rochester describes the ferocity that shows tender, passionate, emotional side. (The newest A & E made by Chiaran Hinds - I usually suffer from liking - looks bluster and bulle in its way). I've never read the book many times and never thought Rochester was going to be as unstable snarling animal.) <br /> <br /> When I read the novel again, I see Zelah Clark as Jane. Ms. Clarke looks like Jane (and is described by others) as she describes herself. Small, child, fairy ... He does not care for the actress, though he describes Jane's qualities very well. While other analyzes claim that his toy is wooden or unusual, it should be remembered that the character was aged 8 in Lowood, and he was trained to examine "passionate nature." His main inspiration was his childhood friend Helen. Although her true nature was different, Jane learned to look at himself and look simple in line with the goals of the school for the charity students who would "go into service." Jane becomes a assistant to the rich Rochester family. Of course, he did not speak to him equally. He then recalled how much he was giving, always remembering that he was below the employer. Nevertheless, Zelah-as-Jane sees a small struggle as if he stopped feeling emotionally to remain soft and sensitive, as the book reads - this is a strange approach to production. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is right, I think. No, it does not resemble at least Hollywood (thank goodness, it's not Hollywood), but their true, faithful and loyal romance. <br /> <br /> For a woman living in the Caucasus, love will never come its way, it's a small miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is intricate, and I really like the book that comes from the book. Thus, rich, poetic original dialogue is more. This version is the only one I have ever known to include a beautiful, glamorous "gypsy" scene with more humor features than the other versions I've ever seen. In particular, the mutual contradiction between lead characters comes from a straight book and is very pleasant! <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre was, in many respects, one of the first romantic feminists. He eventually accepted love and independence with his own conditions, and eventually was equally true to the Rochester reality. Simply wonderful!
