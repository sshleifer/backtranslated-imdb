Reny Harlin's first American movie was one of the best films in the late 1980s, for fear films ("House of Death" or "Kreslo"). Approximately twelve years ago, Lane Smith was justly convicted. Now the head of the newly opened prison and the soul of the man returned to the bloodless revenge. This atmosphere and very moody movie have very terrible snow and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder onhand for entertaining slaughter.
