I really enjoyed this movie. When I was in this movie, I was fifteen. This will be a movie that will show my kids' reports to them, and their emotions are normal. It's ridiculous to see how we're going to be as low as we are at such a young age ... We knew we'd be able to jump again ... again a great movie!
