My husband and I enjoy the DoodleBops as an 8 month old baby. We bought him a DVD and a CD, so we can watch and listen to ourselves. They are entertaining, energetic and entertaining. They encourage children to be active and pay careful attention. Along with entertaining entertainment, there is always a positive message. When our son always listens to the theme songs, he soon turns his head towards the television and begins to throw down and down with excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great sound. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops to everyone. The most beloved song - The Bird Song. You just do not want to dance when you're smiling and listening.
