When I have star tracks in DS9 practice, that's what I'm expecting. The smallest is DS9. It was a great show, but in fact, fans did not give more than they wanted. The enterprise is in this show. Though similar to the original trek, it is enough to be original in its own way. It gives us intelligence thinking about us again. And it was one of the original favorite items of the original. Another part of success was the developing relationship between crew members. The audience really cared for the crew. The company also has a lot in this area. Chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. Sexual tension in a show can often be a leaf, I feel the tension of the enterprise can be more and I feel typical too much. I think that even when we deal with such large scale characters of different races or species, we get very interesting ideas and TV. Also, if you want to record the performance, Blalock Vulcan is very convincing, like T'pol and Bacula, which is really a smell and power that gives great performance. The rest of the castle also performed well. This is my only compassion. Subject. It's different, but a bit heartbreaking because I like it a little. We need something a bit bigger. You do not have to be an orchestra. Perhaps something is a bit more electronic sound. And another complaint. They are very additive. They can do this by selling fewer ads or just showing all of them. Otherwise, as Voyager is one of my complaints, we will show that the latter movement is very rapidly wrapped around.
