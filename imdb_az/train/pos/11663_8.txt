Kells' secret is an independent, lively feature that is one of the clever stories covering the Kell Book, which has been portrayed in the four Gospels from the Middle Ages. I did not know that this book really existed, but now it's easier for me to interpret and analyze it. There are several stories and ideas about how the book was written, who wrote, and how it survived over 1000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We get acquainted with an orphan Brendan who lives with her uncle Abbott Cellach (Brendan Gleeson) at the Kells Abbey in Ireland. Abbot Cellach builds a massive wall around the abbey to guard the population and its monks. Brendan does not like the wall and there are no other monks. They pay more attention to reading and writing, there is nothing Abbot Cellach already has. <br /> <br /> One day, a trip from Iona Island to Scotland is coming. This is a very clever Aidan brother who is carrying a book that has not been completed yet, Abbott Cellach allows him to stay and Brendan and his friends stay with him Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First, the book needs an ink, but it requires a special berry, the only way to get them is to get out of the wall and get into a forest that limits Brendan. <br /> <br /> For Aidan's job and she decides to come out with her bullet before coming to hear her uncle's warning about her absence. <br /> <br /> She meets Ashley in the woods, and gives her the opportunity to move to Brendan's shingle and approach her company along the way. He is afraid of threatening to overcome the darkness and warns him of scare There are worse things than the Vikings, where Brendan is facing more difficulties with the book and ensures the occupation's stability. <br /> <br /> I know more about this, so I love the story. The animation gives a perfect sense to know what the Kellen Book is and what it is. I'm convinced that hundreds of years ago, you've seen pictures of old texts and old texts, frilly borders, colorful pictures and extravagant patterns, creatures and postcards. It resembles the Disney's Sword's opening frames on the Stone. The animation here contains many similar designs and examples. <br /> <br /> Life and animation create a very rare sight experience when trying to dominate almost each other. <br /> <br /> I could not get my eyes from incredible details. This is part of the best 2D animation I've ever seen. It is vibrant, stimulating and full of life. Heroes are constantly surrounded by designs, lips and ornaments in trees, on the walls and in floating surfaces. <br /> <br /> This film is developing more and more. It could have been something special in the final move with only a 75-minute working time. It does not give much information and does not address the importance of the book. We remind ourselves of this, but we never understand. They say we are hoping, but why and how. Indeed, this was only part of the film. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; animation so film a short while I do not have a few stories, but an interesting piece of history, and I recommend that you review Kellin's book briefly in order to reflect on what I'm talking about and what this movie is about, and I think it will help your experience more. an impressive and beautifully illustrated film should not be missed.
