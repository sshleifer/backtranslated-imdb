Sarah Silverman is a dangerous magician! He is beautiful, sexy, funny, and talented, dark and devilish. I read in the other "comments" as in this show, the board board and people just can not get it. Nothing in TV is an accident. Too much money, time and work T.V. The show is put on production for incorrectness. This show is fool because Sarah wants to be a stupid one. This show is a small thing, because Sarah wanted to make her young. I thought jokes were great and there was a nice theme like other music numbers. It's a pity, like the Pee-Wee's Playhouse, a staggering smell of twenty something, a lot of Future Pornstars for America in the Valley. Casting is striking. Scenarios and movements are at a good pace. Hopefully this show will succeed because the comedy did not let the David David show off. Who plays Sarah's sister? The show's main page is not on the castle list. I would like to see his stand. Does anyone know the history of the consciousness and the DVDs that can come around?
