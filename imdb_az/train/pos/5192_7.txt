I'm a kung fu fan, but I'm not a Woo fan. I'm not interested in a gun game with gangster films. Now the martial arts; * This is awesome! And John Woo has surprised me by bringing an entertaining kung fu movie here, almost * if it's possible, it fights well! <br /> <br /> Many battle scenes are good (some are good) and the main characters are entertaining and pleasing. The bad guys are a bit unbelievably bad, but they do not have fun. You must see the Sleeping Wizard! He can fight only when he is asleep - it's amazing! <br /> <br /> Along with the recurring ideas, Chivalry for the Last War can get a bit boring and long wave, is not really good. So I estimate it as "only" from 10 to 10. But it really can say "8". <br /> <br /> All this, in one of the best kung fu movies, is the heart of the kung fu cinema. All really good kung fu films are from the mid-1970s, with some remarkable exceptions from the late 60s and early 70s (and fair in the early 80s).
