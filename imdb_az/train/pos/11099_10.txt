Chase created a real phenomenon with Sopranos. <br /> <br /> His wife, rock writer and some great music could actually be the best show. <br /> <br /> All shots are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have won all the mix of Emmy. Anyone doubting this should just sample a few episodes; especially in the first few seasons. <br /> <br /> Many people I have talked to about Sopranos (although I have not seen it yet), Mr. Gandolfini is absolutely severe, totally horrific and still loves himself. <br /> <br /> "I'm not just a fan of mafia films / shows," they say. No matter what. Run - Do not go and get it. Those people are usually referred to as "E.R." but they do not care about hospitals ... This is not about context.
