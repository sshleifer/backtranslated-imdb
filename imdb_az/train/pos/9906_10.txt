YES, the plot is very tough and very subtle. YES, the player is up to the average laugh. YES has been done many times before. At the same time, we are not far from these facts and it is a film that can be more than anything else. Indeed, there are some original death scenes and the tension along the film grows. In addition, you will not be a few minutes away from a strange killing. I urge everyone to watch this movie with an unexpected look and to see what he has shown; Flick a scary, funny slasher with a second theme to anyone.
