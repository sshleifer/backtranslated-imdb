Jon Turturro has once again proved that he is beautiful, and plays an introspective Russian chess giant, which has been transformed into a gadabout fellow (Emily Watson) in the Italian hotel of the 1920s. His love falls on the horror of his mountaineering (Geraldine James) .He is a beautiful love story that can provide a cerebral glimmer of curiosity. However, despite the sources in Nabak's story, this is not. Romantic elements, time and place feelings have lowered the hands of psychological analyzes. John Turturro, "Barton Fink", "O Brother, where are you from?" "Big Lebowski" proves that it does not depend on Coen Bros.
