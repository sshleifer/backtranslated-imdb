Part of the history of World War II is very strange, gutsy illustrates, and most of us have no idea in the United States. I'd like to take this video. Only t.v. once I know, in the 90s 90s. I asked around this movie and most video stores did not know it. All the great actresses around, I wish I could see it again. Top notch series.
