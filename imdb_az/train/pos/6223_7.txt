It is sometimes difficult to watch old movies, from the contemporary sensibility. The stereotype is a great way to look at the floral librarian's glasses and look at how stupid and foolish a person can be. Especially such an shallow and unstable man. Undoubtedly, he is a player who simply looks at women who are attractive and always wants to call them "baby" (ick!) (I will not believe that he is loyal to him). After she has been completely changed for her appearance and life, she only goes to her after being rejected by another woman and Connie learns that she spent all her money to make a ship for her. I did not want to stand up against him, he did not run behind him! <br /> <br /> In a few minutes his sudden transformation was completely unreal, and he did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I love another movie from this subpot. Do not you like how sailors dance with each other? (From San Francisco ...) D) The "dance" dances were greatly denied by Ginger Rogers and the followers were "right steps". The ultimate dance "Face the Music" was beautiful with beautiful costumes and art deco sets. I really liked the point "I have seen the sea" (they have used it as they used to be the best song). In any case, it was very weak, like many music (IMO) - and the songs were okay, but the dance movie was worth watching. <br /> <br /> <strong> Hillary Clinton had several films. </ P> <p> time. I must try to put an end to all my knowledge to immerse myself in fantasy lands.
