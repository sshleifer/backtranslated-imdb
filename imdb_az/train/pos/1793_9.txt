I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this movie. Mamie Gummer (Lila), mom and daughter happy moments, crying for poverty when she gets married to one of her parents, but really loves everything about her because she loves it. I liked these moments because they were very real. At first, I was afraid, because Bobby was hoping that it would not end as it was a huge cast, but it was a poorly written movie that had no real flesh. But in the middle of the film I felt totally different. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you want to see it again in the evening. Trust me when I say!
