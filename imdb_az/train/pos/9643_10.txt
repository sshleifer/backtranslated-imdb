There is everything in this movie. Emotion, strength, love, Stephane Rideau's beautiful naked beach dance ... In any connection, there is a need for true internal solidarity and external communication. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who are gay, it does not mean that nobody has a very good idea. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but heterosexuals are also popular and loved by homosexuals and bisexuals. Mathieu's ability to control his emotions makes it clear that our society does not encourage us to behave in a different way, causing conflict between him and Cedricus. This is definitely a must see!
