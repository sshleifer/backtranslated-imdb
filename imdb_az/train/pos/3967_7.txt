It's not Jimmy Stewart's best movie - I just got it right. But even though I see some films as pure propaganda, what am I doing wrong with it? Yes, as the TV shows the FBI, it is a bureaucratic situation that takes some PR work to support the office. But fun is doing a good job. Of course, a striking film for the time of the film focuses on espionage and more crimes than the Commission. Instead, he is one of the earliest agents and a figurative description of his career. Now that he was performed by agent Jimmy Stewart, he was a good actress and writer - it was a studio with a real budget and a third-degree flick that did not want to star. So it is generally worth seeing, but not particularly great.
