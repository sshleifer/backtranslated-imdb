I'm very pleased with this movie. But I was surprised to see people talking like comedy. Sometimes it was fun, but it was not really funny. If I was expecting a comedy, I would be disappointed in the movie, but I'm going to wait, I find it pleasant and attractive. Maybe as an engineer I'm familiar with the protagonist. I was worried about the main story of a man who was struggling for less inventory or less coefficient and more for his invention. He is less interested in earning money from his invention than it is for productivity and product release. He decisively heroism when he refuses to buy great money and hot women to bury his own invention. It's interesting that people here compare with Jurassic Park; I'm comparing it to Fountainhead.
