I sat down from beginning to end. Great fear comes from the imaginations and organic shocks created to disturb you, but "What are the things I just watched?" All other commentators gave a brief overview of what the film was and I will not repeat what has already been said. I've seen this movie days after telling others about it. After seeing it, I even had a bad dream and I'm not a real horror fan, and I easily fell prostrate like The Grudge or Silent Hill. I felt that I was having a bad dream and I would have been with this child in this cell. What would my personal horror be? my subconscious took me there and was pleasant. What a great fear of my friends! The best part of this film is exquisite. It's not about you, Bogeymen, who missed your shots or mixed tones. In contrast. The horror you create in your mind. The mockery and horror of the four characters are not an external force that confirms their power against them. Just men ask for something they want and get it ... but they do not imagine it. On the one hand, they get what they want from a secret book, but they eventually wish they did not want it. Sometimes it is best to lock in prison!
