You did not have any expectations; I did not hear Jamie Foxx; I knew there were some strong characters in the film. I thought it was very fun; was fun. The field was quite different and unexpected to keep my interests. Foxx is original to me. David Morse is terrific (real, this is not his best role). Film shooting and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and did a good job. I did not expect much, and I was happily surprised.
