There are other assessments here, so it's not worth telling how big or what it is about ... My idea: I've heard it before this movie, after it's shown. Even if I can not remember, I know it was through the internet. Distributors have never gone before hitting! Moped and complained for months. Note that on this page there is a link to get this movie and only the highlighted area is VHS at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Alta Vista to translate Babelfish. I know this PAL format and changed the text on the screen to German, and at the beginning there is a small narration in German, but it's funny and like a camp, it's just funnier !! If you want to see this movie and have a close circle of conversions around you, it's worth it! It costs about $ 20 to come from Germany to the United States. Trust me, it may seem like a lot to spend on the movie, but if you fall into a lizard b-flicks, you'll get a conversion for your friends by placing money on your money!
