The performance of Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashvili Amrapurca and all chemistry is beautiful, along with a minimalist approach to tell and guide the story by Govind Nihlani. Vijay Tendulkar's dialogues are also great. <br /> <br /> I did not see such a movie. This is a whole, every piece is well suited to the field. This movie can not be regretted. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri, Om Puri's teacher, comes as a husband and a "praise". Om Puri is a young man who understands his job and is unable to fight the system. Sadhashiv, Rama Shetti, gives her right touch on the film with her smiling and gentle soul. The first meeting of Anand Velankar in the Sadhashiv region of Rama Sheet is very frustrating. Smita Patil does not play a key role, but his part also does not divert from the mainstream. <br /> <br /> In order to add all this, Kafi Inamdar plays a role as a system and his job. Finding the right things in the right places and knowing how to deal with anxiety. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p> The side of cruelty in police custody. Om Puri wants desperation and freedom in Ardh Satya in this exclusive event. <br /> <br /> Treat all the admirers of Indian cinema.
