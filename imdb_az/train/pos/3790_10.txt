I crashed and confused it on an independent movie channel. I'm a professional player and I've been in the performance. They are completely improvisative, feeling absolutely without feeling. I can not say whether the screenwriter is dead or shot and waits until the end to see the credits, and then spend half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not kidnap her. I see that the director-director drew a beautiful movie called "Everyday People," which I love very much. The embarrassment of filmmaking is that these excellent projects do not receive distribution and advertising that they deserve and under the radar. This film deserves to fly high and proudly. I urge you to look for and follow people.
