To be honest, I had to retrace this movie, but I did not expect much, but hey, I was not deceived, I had a good time. <br /> I have tried to make this movie a fresh breeze, despite some facts, to try to modernize Nancy Drew, but it reminded young people from Europe and Quebec in the 60s and 70s, where there were children who had a great relationship with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager wants to do justice by trying to solve a mystery about the death of an actress 25 years ago. In any case, why does not his father, as he works in Hollywood, rent a hidden house behind the door? Well, at least Emma Roberts is doing a great job here. Kinda first found Nancy as a unique child to support his jealousy, but his grandmother found it cool enough to be closer to him, even when she did ... <br /> The rest of the kit was great, and Rachael Leigh Cookie this time she was happy to see a different role: a single mother (she did this in her marriage, but this time she plays a mature woman ...) Anyway, don This waste, it's fun!
