Can I say simply "I like it" in my assessments? It's pretty funny with bits, has taken great stars and is awesome to look at. Songs (recurring twice) are unforgettable, but they get a healthy ironic treatment (the terrifying Wagnerian version of Miss Grable, just like the fairy-tale Fairbanks); There is no dance with the crinolines of 1861, which has been cultivated around Miss Grapley, and the comedy can be a little bit heavy, but the result is still striking. Photography (including realistic outdoor shooting exciting) plays with different colors of incredible, thunderstorm heavy gold. Miss Grape is still fresh and comfortable in this continent's "old world" comedy. Rita Hayworth, along with the "Earth to Down" line, is inclined to be loved by many people. So many people think that "the lady in her husband" is outdated and full. But this is a fairy tale, and they act in a certain way with a particular cake. My suggestion is merely a work of art, costume, witty and everything that this movie has to offer, and is afraid to complain. The film was released on DVD in Germany with an English-language soundtrack.
