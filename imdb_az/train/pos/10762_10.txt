I'm one of those who are waiting to see a day's glorious Yankee-doodle painting (as it is noted), but not in glory, but in humiliation. How wrong I am. These guys were there, on the right side, and the pictures they returned were beautiful and heartfelt. However, all this took place on September 11, 2001 with a chance visit to the World Trade Center. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers, as a NY ceasefire, produced a documentary about life, especially from a young Shepherd's Ranks. From the very beginning we see the majority of these images, and we are reminded that there is no such thing as a film about terrorism. <br /> <br /> When examining the suspected gas line (I think that, like me, our memory is a bit strange), we suddenly heard and heard a plane. The camera demands that a commercial aircraft be pulled down to one of the towers. What does the camera think this time? <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> </ font> <br /> <strong> FDNY's commitment, their reactions (after the death of the first person the coolness of the confused silence), as well as the collapse of one of the buildings, the latter, the events <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <strong> Unfortunately, images are worth the whole length of time. But it really is the true humanity that brings the audience to the film. We see firefighters without hesitation, people from different races help each other to escape to the wave of coal, and even the filmmakers' anxiety does not reach one another in confusion. <br /> <br /> This movie has incredible scenes and incredible human stories. Hollywood can never duplicate it. <br /> <br /> 9/11 is not a movie about politics. It's not a film about religion, nationalism, or even jihad. 9/11 is a movie about people and is the best and worst indicator we can do. 9/11 is just one of the most important films I've ever seen, and if it were for me, it would be a movie that would be born of it. You can not duplicate it.
