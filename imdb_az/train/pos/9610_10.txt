I watched this movie and wept. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is very good that I did not suffer from any eating disorder, but this should be a very accurate picture. It expresses these emotions strangely. My teenage years were so alive for me. Everyone who has been in difficult times as a child or a teenager will be related to this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Ol√©ander,
