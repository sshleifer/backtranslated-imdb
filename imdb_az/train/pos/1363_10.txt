A great 90's flick! Parker Posey is fantastic in Manhattan, requiring lots of money in this story about nightlife. Posey gives a wonderful performance like a librarian and night dresses. A good, lightweight movie for Saturday night before leaving. Soundtrack rocks, dresses are in this world, scripts are comic and actors do a great job. Decision-Value: When you try, you can just look at this place. I believe that Parker Posey is a PERFECT actress for this character: young, spectacular and breaking. (You need to look for "Clockwatchers"). If you watch the Party Girl, you will be able to spend a good time. Enjoy!
