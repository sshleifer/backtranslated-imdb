Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to companies in the deep south. Joining the navy fleet, he tells his father that he will be back. The father gives an old radio and leaves the Brashear off the sea bus. The most valuable thing he taught her unique father was "never leaving." Following a recommendation from the White Prince Powers Boothe, he was sent to Navy Diving School in Bayonne, NJ, surprising his driver and courage. He wants uniforms and his coach, Prince Navy Master Diver, Billy Bazar (Robert De Niro) and pappy's teamman (Hal Holbrook), "have many empty screws as old as the car" and the prejudice is incredibly strange. The danger of diving is the evidence of a decline in the ship when it loses one leg due to an accident. Despite this conflict, he will be able to achieve his goal and will be trained by Billy Bazar (now joining the commissioner in their afflictions) and despite the high mocking doubts he may be the first black Navy diver with his artificial sign and the suspect captain in the Washington Department of the Sea Department and determined whether these criteria were appropriate.
