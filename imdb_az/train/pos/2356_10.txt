Daisies were a nice show to push. Like many dead people and Wonderfalls, we can say a lot that was created by Bryan Fuller. People who were dissatisfied with theater, cinema, music and a similar person were disturbed. This is not a typical television program and is great for some fantastic ones. These people need some more linear and silenced tones to make them happy. This program exploded with hums in the old movie scenes, with color, eye shirt, incredible music and talent performances. There is nothing casual about choices made by suit from leitmotif. The story is many folds and turns, but conversations are much more accessible than love, honesty, courage, harm, and many things we encounter each day. The only run out was because of the end of the show and Daisies Pushing canceled. Do not approach this as a typical TV show. Think of it as an evening in the theater, then sit down and enjoy!
