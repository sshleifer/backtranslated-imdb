I was a bit scared to watch this movie because of its degrees. However, names like those in Italy never come across, and I love it so much that I decided to give it a try. And how surprised! The story differs from another dance movie I've seen lately, but it's a deeper meaning than just "winning". It is tactile and well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I never doubt her, she is competent and attentive and she is talented (and talent is Rutina Wesley, my jacket dropped to the final dance area). It is honest and inspirational to realize his desire and refuse to do anything. Additionally, he is a typical super-hot chicken (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her really attractive and real. Seriously, why is this film so low? You can understand that there is a good job in the first five minutes. In fact, it's really good. Even at the end of the movie I cried. And dance rules are simply sick.
