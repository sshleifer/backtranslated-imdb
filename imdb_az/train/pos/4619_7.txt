First, I'm a big fan of the 80's and Jennifer Conelly. So yesterday I went to a local book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read back and sounded good and it was a good thing for $ 3.99. So I went home and threw it at the VCR. What a cute movie! Now I'm giving more information about my films, such as the Last Night or the fire of St. Elmo, but I still remember what it was 15/16 and I fell in love with an old boy. And so on. we are young. And if it does not work, we are in the heart and we think that we will not depend on it. But of course we do. Repeatedly. This is really a good quality I've got from this movie. "Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo interesting and well-developed characters. 80s films, especially those who love teen movies, or just want to come back and remember when life is keeping a simple advice to everyone.
