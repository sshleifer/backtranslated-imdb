In 1967, cold blood was probably "real" (imagine: would you really want to see the real thing?) But in a colorful world, it was black and white, and many people even knew what it was and could rebuild television . If you rebuild it, you can actually show some invisible things. Truman Capote was the first non-fiction novel in Cold Blood. Truman's book was actually 100% true. Canadians thought enough for a television movie for Kansas. Look for elements of sex, medicine, and rock 'n': Dick's dance, Perry's an aspirin interest, plays Perry Blues Guitar.
