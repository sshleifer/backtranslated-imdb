8 Simple Rules is a funny show, but after the loss of the episode of Paul's first episode, which has never followed the show at ABC, there is a lifetime lesson about action. Hennessy clan - Paul Catherine (Katey Sagal), girls Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and his son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - Paul looks after each other for leadership and support (John Ritter), the patriarch of the family. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend to one side. Later, during the 2nd season of this show, I'm glad they decided to put David Spade on this show since they were made out of the NBC series with Just Shoot Me! But all and all this show is pretty good. This show is reminiscent of the classic family sitcoms of the 80s and 90s used to be at ABC.
