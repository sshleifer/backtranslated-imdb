It's a perfect stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the most funny person I've ever seen. His work is cheerful and good conversation with others he has seen. I love it very much. Although the history of Europe is a bit slow, the jokes in French are very good, because you do not have to speak French to get it (though still sad). Also, parts of transplant are very good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, it's funny for the first time. If you need them, go through them. It is almost impossible to watch. But it's a funny, funny stand-up show that really needs to be seen by everyone. "Then I was dead!"
