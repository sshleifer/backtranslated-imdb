Eglimata (= crimes) are guilty of being guilty of a disastrous scary scenario. One of the clever Greek serials! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogiani have shown a new dimension to their talents and gave incredible "guilty" laughing moments. Everyone in the audience seemed to recognize themselves as one of the characters in one of their characters or at least what they want. At any age, actors playing big and small parts had earned the same title in the hearts of Greek audiences. My personal favorites (Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis), but many episodes over time. Everyone in the world understands that if anyone has been in Greece for more than 5 years, he will find a way to follow this series. In Greece, they continue to recur in the summer or in the afternoon (ANT1) We will not forget any of Eglimata or casting crews!
