Outrageous, but loyal, great Joe Buck Big Spring, leaving his home in Texas, and splashes Big Apple while looking for women and big money. In NYC, JB's excitement and "Ratso" Rizzo, a scruffy but sincere artist. <br /> <br /> Both teams are alike and resemble each other. <br /> <br /> Both of them were funny and depressing, Midnight Cowboy fled the 1960s 1960s to the 1960s from the era of the 1960s and claimed to have drifted like Dorothy and Toto as the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The film's direction is masterful, the cast is perfect, the actor is the top, the script's sharp and courageous, cinematography, and music enhances all of the above.Sincerely, I won the Best Oscar award in 1969, I considered it one of the best films in the decade.
