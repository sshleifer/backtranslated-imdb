An entertaining and substantial film, Non-Stop, was awarded with the "Run Lola Run". The movie is often turned into a series of sequences, during which the viewers get information on three main characters through flashbacks and daydream serialization. The chase serves as a crucial part of the film, not a fast moving point. During the "Operation," we grew up in symbols, and at one point they forgot about the "maño" roles they deceived and forgot why they forgot what they were doing first. As fighting fights ensures "clarity" of characters working in the Fight Club, it provides the characters of the film with the help of our society to avoid the false values ​​that make society possible. <br /> <br /> Their functioning really serves to taste life from a minor perspective and finds the level of clarity and happiness in all three processes. <br /> <br /> My gratitude and enjoyment were just a few moments before the end of the film <br /> <br /> While the only real problem with this film is, of course, instead of learning from their own experiences, When they think of escaping, they will turn to perform fake maço roles. It did not go beyond Japan.
