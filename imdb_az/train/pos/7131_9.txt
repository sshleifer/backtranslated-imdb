This film made for television is brilliant. This is the best and most beloved role by BAFTA winner John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Thaw) lived in a single village for a while since the widow's spouse and son died, and now has been surrendered to an evacuation called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). When he recognizes this child, he begins to develop friendships. Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants her back. After worrying Tom did not contact William, he went to London to find him. In the end Willaim comes home with Valentine's family (or grandfather). This is a beautiful film set up during the Second World War. BAFTA was nominated for the Lew Award and won the National Television Award for the Most Popular Drama. John Thaw was number 3 on the 50th biggest star of TV. Very Good!
