I love bad movies. Not only is it really "good" movies (like the Caribbean Pirates of Pirates and other Hollywood kings), but it's better than those movies. And I love the Italian cinema in the 1970s and 1980s. <br /> <br /> Ruggero Deodato's director Ruggero Deodato has made really good films, like the Park Edge House, and is a fun action movie to die as a human being, living as Atlantis Interceptors and a Cop. But this is really bad. Barbarians are such a mistake. Barbarian brothers Peter and David Paul, like KÃ¼tchek and Gore, are very laughable because of their lack of charismatic and acting skills. But if they can not move, they shout and scream because they do something important every time. At one stage people try to hang Barbar brothers and run it in a very unusual way. <br /> <br /> Wrong action, bad personal effects, very stupid, bad direction, in fact, everything is bad in this movie. I can not describe how much I laughed when watching this for the first time. Barbarians and company camps, everyone should see once. Plan 9 If you think that there is a fun outdoor space, it will be a real killer.
