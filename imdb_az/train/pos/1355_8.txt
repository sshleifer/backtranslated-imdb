An interesting part of The Apprentice is that traditional job interviews and resumes do not necessarily predict group work skills, job responsibilities and job performance. And, of course, it does not reveal any secret agenda. In other words, a good indication of potential is to see a job applicant who is the aim of the "Chirag". <br /> <br /> According to the decision, individuals who violate the company's position may place a sugar-covered resume and present the best personality attire for the interview. However, this is not the best indicator of strengths, weaknesses, and performance. <br /> <br /> The apprentice includes 16 job candidates who eventually compete for a career opportunity: an investment company of Donald Trump, a real estate potential. "Apprentice" applies to the winner who will earn a paid position, to learn from the master the art of dealing with high prices, and, most likely, to earn a major corporate relationship. The task is a dream for those who want to earn more money from GNP of some foreign countries. For nomination of student candidates, Trump shows his personal jet, private luxury apartments full of statues and works of art, his limousine, the celebration of the celebrities and other aspects of a billionaire angel life. <br /> <br /> The success path is not easy. The group is divided into two teams that compete with each other. Each Versacorps and Protégé Corporation have a corporate voice name. Teams are given tasks that lead to entrepreneurial initiatives, such as creating ads, selling goods, or negotiating. Teams select a project manager that provides leadership and organizational skills to accomplish their job. If they win, the manager gets a lot of credits, especially in the eyes of the final arbitrator. If they lose, the manager can also be goat goats. Execution of some tasks only takes one or two days. Tasks can create television ads or print ads. Others may be required to sell at retail locations or on the street. <br /> <br /> The tasks reveal the best of the participants and the worst. They often show that they are the most reliable, most reliable and very personable. And tasks also seem to be a good team player, who is ineffective and appear to be just for themselves. The tasks unexpectedly reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the participants, and especially the project manager. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, a few days ago, a few days ago, when a potential project manager was appointed. Their real talent, reflecting their abilities, is displayed through a coating that can not be hidden with a $ 100 silk arm or a beautiful makeup. Leadership qualities and / or vulnerabilities often become painful after a few minutes. Those who recognize themselves as leaders of the rise are not always strong when they reach real-life leadership. In fact, "touching your own neck" is always easier than being involved in leadership. Project managers, even winning teams, do not often make a merging strategy. They often believe in the ending of the task rather than spending some time to organize and discuss the task. Not too often, a bad strategy team members move around like headless chickens, and they spend a lot of time wasting away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The losing team comes to the terrific room where Trump is laughing and loses one or more contestants on pieces of a chessboard, which he beat with "Now shooting". Often the project manager is partly responsible for the loss of the team and may be the target of Trump's accuser rhetoric. Each week, at least one person is injured by a lost team. <br /> <br /> My favorite feature of the apprentice is the boardroom. While the tasks themselves reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates, the council of the council often exposes the evil. Unfortunately, the rules of the game insists on a winning team and a lost team, even if the competition is close. Lost team members are often accusing each other of being guilty of being guilty. And sometimes more than one person gets into a fire. I have rarely seen that the candidate is responsible for the actions in the candidate's room. Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were the only candidates who were fully responsible for the missing team and were no longer recognized for this selfless move. For me, Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were the best of all candidates. However, Tramp Kristini was weak and could claim that he was more than a whole lot, claiming he did not stand up for himself. No one should sacrifice his idols for this. Kristi Frank could not be a lamp, but he lived himself, knowing that he did not accuse others of unfairness. <br /> <br /> The strength of the Chirac is also weak. As the team performance is evaluated by the victimized and injured, other valuation options are also ignored. It can block large gaps between winning and losing teams, sometimes losing team, high level teamwork and efficiency. Sometimes I have seen the loss of teams that are better than the winning team. We Americans are often faced with winning and losing, so often we are not perfect.
