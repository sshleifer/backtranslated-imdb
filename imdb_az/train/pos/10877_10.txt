I saw this movie with many friends, and only two of us thought how cool it was from the movie, although others laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Yes, it was not so serious, because it is a film that is horrified, and damn good work. Something like this is just a movie, umm ... Scary Movie ?? Well this is Aussie and the original! Jessica Napier has a surprising performance and a bright future that operates Sarah Kants! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move and Kylie was a better move. Impossible Princess was King of the screen! Raffy, Hilary, and 20 years ago, I would like to see this flicker, as you can imagine.
