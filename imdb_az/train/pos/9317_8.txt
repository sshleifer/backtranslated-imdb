I saw the film criticizing the statement, "If you can pass spirituality ..." It misses the point. Moralization is like the conscience of behavior. This is a decent film that is a normal murder, but with a different twist on the surface from the middle way. From the resolution viewer, "What will I do in this position?" Forcing the question. And I believe that the film's director is exactly what it is. For this purpose and after the entertaining end of the audience, the film succeeds. I want the violence to be on the stage, but I'm out of the camera. We know what is happening; it has not been served only in front of us, and then drifted on our faces with blood and gore dressing today. At the same time, violence is not a point. This point is the moral dilemma of the hero, though it is clever, but it is solved with anxiety.
