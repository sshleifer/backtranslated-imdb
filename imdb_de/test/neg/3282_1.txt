Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy Farce on Loy (Irene) and her fianc√©, played by Reginald Owen, stranded in Labrador as her plane crashes. (That's actually what should have happened with this highly predictable movie.) Montgomery lives there while waiting for his fiancee. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy are getting dressed quickly. The scene with the bear is so invented. We knew it was a toothed bear all the time. <br /> <br /> Complications arise when Clara shows up. Loy wants Montgomery Clara to say they have to split up. If he refuses, she wants to leave immediately. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end. Get away with all the snow, it's just too cold for everyone!
