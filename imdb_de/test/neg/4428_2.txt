Director Lo Wei was known for reading the racing papers and taking a nap on set - tells something about his "approach to filmmaking," huh? The reviews I read fall into two categories: 1) This is a movie that is so bad It's funny, or 2) This is a movie that is so bad that it is boring. <br /> <br /> So we come to the point where we all agree - this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> I agree with category 2. The story is almost incomprehensibly complex and is further shredded and twisted by the remarkably bad camera work and editing, yet Lo Wei was so in love with her that he set the pace slowed down so we can all have one look at the movie, whether we like it or not. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lo Wei was mad at the day (or two) this movie was filmed - he just wanted everyone to suffer, cast, crew, and audience alike. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the agony.
