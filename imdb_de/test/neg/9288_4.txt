It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be confronted with the proverbial "wake-up call". If they survive this event, they will be more deeply involved in understanding and appreciating their special happiness. In the case of comedians, however, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as before. That's the case with Martin Lawrence. Honestly, I pay little attention to celebrities because I have much better things to do with my life than to spend monitoring others. So I did not know what Lawrence had been through before this movie. It was interesting but unfortunately too common. I had the bigger impression that this guy's stand-up act was not very funny. Save the big life messages for a book, just be funny on stage. If you want to see a jolly Martin Lawrence, rent some of the old Def Jams for which he was host. Do not rent Runteldat.
