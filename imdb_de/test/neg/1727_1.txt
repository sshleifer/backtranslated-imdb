Not only the impact and the acting in this movie have bitten, but also the story was terrible. A scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon ... The world leaders ignore it ... he builds a shelter ... then everyone is upset that he is "playing God". <br /> <br /> How lame! He built the thing, why is everyone "access"? Totally lame story, do not waste time!
