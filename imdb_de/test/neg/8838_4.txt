I looked at the beginning twice, could not understand it, and it bothered me the whole movie. <br /> <br /> So, just settle that with me: Wayne (the GOOD guy) jumps on the stagecoach, disarmed The drivers (!) steal the money (?!) and take off. <br /> <br /> Disarmed, one driver is killed and the other wounded by the bad guys. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed her and then watched. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne drops the money in the dirt, saves the girl, drives to the city, brings it to yak (shame about the dead guy), I think) and then later he says he has the money "found" at the scene. And everyone agrees. <br /> <br /> And he is the good guy? I'm pretty sure there were no small flashlights back then. And Bell made his first phone demo in 1876 ... were they in houses? Am I thinking too much about it? Normally, I'm glad to pass judgment to enjoy a movie, but it bothered me. And that's a sign that the move did not really work for me.
