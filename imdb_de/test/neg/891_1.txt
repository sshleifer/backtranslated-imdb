I'm also a house party fan ... House Party I'm my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is a shame for all HPs and for Kid n Play ... This should actually be part of a series. There was nothing to do with Kid n Play in this movie or any of the other veterans ... yes kidn play was probably too old to throw a House Party movie focused on teenagers. But Kid n play could at least have had a cameo ... you can tell how good it was b / c it did not even make it to the cinemas. Immature was in House Party 3, so it made sense for them to continue the legacy ... but they should have been right ... They should have left it at House Party 3. I'm 27 years old and have been watching House Party I since I was 11 years old when it came out in 1990 (16 years ago) and I've been a fan ever since. When I saw House Party 4 for the first time, I thought of what they really think ... There was nothing known about this movie that could be compared to the previous 3 movies.
