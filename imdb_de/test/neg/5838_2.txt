This SOFT softcore / sci-fi B movie is what you would have if you took an early Fred Olen Ray movie and took the fun out of it. Or vice versa, it's like a Uwe Boll movie, but without so much inability. A young convicted chain-gang convict (C.C. Costigan) agrees to perform as a Space Marshal to stop Kim Dawson's crazy plans ... with which, apparently, everyone has sex with everyone else (this disgusting enemy). Everyone who went to this movie looking for serious science-fiction movies got what they deserved because they did not do their homework. First of all, when Kim Dawson played EVER in something other than soft-core Skinamax level. Take a look at Costigan's and the director's CVs before zigzagging and saying you expected something different. Do not get me wrong for a space / action / softcore / tickle movie. This movie is NOT STILL good, but if you expected something in the sense of "Contact," I do not regret it. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz-on-demand (Available until December 8, 2005)
