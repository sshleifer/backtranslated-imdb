I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work a lot, both as an actor and as a director. You could say that I'm Steve Buscemi. A Steve Buscemi freak. I'm taking care of Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing Buscemi's first directorial debut, "Trees Lounge". I enjoyed the movie, even though it was not as good as it could have been. It was - almost - there. It almost scratched the itching, the itching, wanting to watch "little" movies about "little" people in "little" bars in "small" cities. It was close enough to the place where I would say it was a very good movie - one that could have been great with a few tweaks. But that's okay. I like the movie and I have watched it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this review is not about Trees Lounge. It's about "Lonesome Jim". When I saw the description of the movie and then saw who the movie was, I was excited about the prospect of finally seeing the movie that I knew Trees Lounge could have been. But what I actually experienced was no different from leaving one of those little bars with a cheap whiskey belly and an armful of cheap sponge, returning to your apartment with a muddy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably dissolve into reality Alcohol-induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation. <br /> <br /> In other words, this movie left me flat and unrequited, and I'm sorry I wasted the time and money I needed to get into that state - the movie equivalent on the Wake up next to this cheap floozy next morning or, if you happen to be the floozy, wake up next to the foul and fuzzy and unshaven fool. The film consisted of the substance of an old white bread sandwich (with the brand of white bread no less) and the emotion of a carcass. I am not sure what the meaning of this film was, and since it should have some sense and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can go through without one, this lack of a point is a omission sin. Sorta likes these new cars, which are no longer equipped with ashtrays, although millions of people smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). All in all, it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things, and lacking the courage and credibility to carry and save such a movie. I mean, the Trees Lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I blame Affleck a lot. Why do people keep throwing this Affleck shit? They suck life from everything they are connected to. An Affleck was in a decent movie (and that was not why the film was decent), and suddenly every asshole named Affleck stinks out as many movies as possible. And Liv Tyler is not feeling better. Being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people just do not rise from the flat side of the script. People pay to watch movies and they get to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two guys do not have the spark of the old man distributing shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought Steve Buscemi was the guy who would rise above this kind of Pablum, but oh Steve, you let us down. In this movie I want to put you in another wood chipper.
