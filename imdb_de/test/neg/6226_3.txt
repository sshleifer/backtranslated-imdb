This is a new approach to the comedy. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> The joke is that this is supposed to be funny in and of itself. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a French short story in Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The film also plays the same French Frenchmen Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar and the characters behave as in the carry-on films from earlier years. <br /> <br /> I think these are jokes too - to fill those actors who are not trying to be French in any way, to be frolicking in the style of a broad English dance hall comedy, and the whole Secret of flowering unexplained to the public. <br /> <br /> In the Department of Humor, this is practically the Algonquin Round Table. <br/> <br /> The film tries to be charming and whimsical, and I think these features are somehow funny. Not as funny as Duck Soup or Love and Death maybe, but funnier than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It's an example of personal filming. It does not make any real effort to speak and share with the audience, but remains true to its premise and internal logic. Although all situations are unbelievable, they are logical in the bizarre world of film. <br /> <br /> I generally like this kind of eccentric movie, but I found it to be too slow to be dull, boring, and lacking in pleasurable surprises or real jokes. It meanders predictably and sophomorically, wasting some wonderful talents along the way. It must be the low point in the career of any of the big stars who are all otherwise excellent players. I found it the greatest waste of talent since The Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this matter. <br /> <br /> Let's call it an interesting bust and give it as a rental, unless you really have plenty of time to kill. <br /> <br />
