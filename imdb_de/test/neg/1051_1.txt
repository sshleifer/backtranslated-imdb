I got a kick from Reynolds and said to his lawyer, "Look, I did a lot in my life, but I never killed anyone." Obviously, he forgot his career, which slipped down the hill after he started making silly movies like 'Cannonball Run'. Physical Evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to "The Jagged Edge", which was reasonably rejected by Glen Close. The verdict is in, avoid physical evidence.
