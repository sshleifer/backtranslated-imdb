... but of course I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I never thought I would like the first movie. I'm not sure what's going on with Disney's marketing group, but it seems that any trailer they make for an animated film turns me off as being too childish or stupid or dumb, and yet the films themselves are anything but. And no movie for me looked worse in the trailers than The Emperor's New Groove, so I was quite surprised that I really enjoyed this movie when I finally collapsed and saw it. I entered with zero expectations and was pleasantly entertaining. Despite Disney's track record with direct-to-video sequels, I still had a better experience with Kronk here ... but in the end, I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not exactly surprised that I felt that way). There is almost no humor for adults. The original songs are unimaginative and sickly sweet. The animation is not bad, but it does not come close to Emperor (which was not a Lion King at first). <br /> <br /> The main image as such is surprisingly "small" and is mainly used in a sequence of mini-plot flashbacks - in fact, the while-thing felt more like a series of episodes of a Saturday morning episode -Comic series as a well-designed individual entity. David Spade receives about four lines The whole movie and also John Goodman does not exist that many, and so Patrick Warburtons Kronk is far too much left - although he was entertaining as a supporting character in the first film, but as the main movie completely unsuitable lead here. <br /> <br /> Although it may be a bit of fun for kids, the only thing Kronk's New Groove has done for me is to get me to see the far superior original.
