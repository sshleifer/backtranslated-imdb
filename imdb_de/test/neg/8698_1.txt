This movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time. In the first 10 minutes I was already upset because I'm familiar with the right version of the story according to the Torah (5 books on Mosen) ... but I decided to see it to get my money worth seeing how bad it sucked. Well, it was shit ... much more than I thought it would. First, and for the most part, we start with the script and the figures with the skeleton that make up the movie body. If you study Torah, you will find that the story is completely wrong. Here are some of the treacherous mistakes: Moses does not do slave labor because he was in the tribe of Levi, Moses does not bring anyone to Sinai. but the movie shows moses being flogged and aaron and killing himself ... reeeealllly not! When Moses speaks to the Burning Bush, he also knows who he is talking about, but the movie makes Mosen look like an idiot. He says he does not know who the idiot is in the bush ... whatever | Aaron knows his brother well, no matter which aaron was known for his calm, serene and peaceful nature, yet he is portrayed in this movie as angry and arrogant. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie ... how ridiculous ... Pharaoh was the real and ugly dwarf sitting on a pyramid of stairs so he could look bigger than he was, and Moses was more than 10 feet tall and in the movie Pharoah is taller than him and he is hot with bright eyes! The wife of Am Israel (Nation of Israel) covered herself with her hair and bodies and they did not dance or sing in front of men, they did not attend the golden calf and definitely did not dance with a man in public. The movie shows. Moses' wife Tzipora was married to Moses, so she dressed and was as modest as she was, cuddling or holding her in public. Batia Pharoah's daughter (the one who adopted him and rescued him) actually converted to Judaism and would have been proud of Moses when he said that he wanted to free his people with two sets of tablets ... with gibberish on it. .if you put the scripture in the sacred tongue, Hebrew or English and put it on a tray, not two sentences. The bottom line is that the movie is terribly written, directed and the characters are all wrong. Basically ALL is wrong with the movie ... The old one is also inaccurate, but it is more realistic and the actors are believable. Am Israel Chai!
