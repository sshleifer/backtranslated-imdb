Do not get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's films. So, with pure excitement, I was able to take part in the "Rolling Thunder" screening in the French Parisian cinema series with a surprise movie on December 17, 2004. Surprise movie was The Exorcist and most people were in favor (me too). The movie was finished, but the score was ready, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and another movie I forgot (was it Conan?). Otherwise, the film was finished. The lucky few (perhaps 200 people) were told not to write about the film on the internet or in magazines, as they may have had a chance to be selected at the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the movie, then the realization that the movie might not have been selected for the festival because of its quality: I've never experienced such a sense of awkwardness in the audience as people became more and more skeptical and just laugh out loud at the pitiful spectacle. I could not believe how deep the author of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction had sunk. The worst attitude of Christianity by Schrader, not even exciting, just boring (no pun intended) and not at all surprising! Some good locations, but unfortunately deserved or at least did not meet the initial hopes! In the end, I was 100 times happier with the Schrader-Rolling Thunder and wished my 2 hours back. <br /> <br /> Do not believe the hype, even the John Boorman movie is more exciting and original. Oh, and the Billy Crawford casting, the poor man does his best, but what do you expect? He is now part of the little club of the worst casting mistakes of all time! I give the film a 1/5 just because I did not leave the room, but I should have done it.
