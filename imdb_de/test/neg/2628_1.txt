Milo is a complete rip-off of the Slasher movie by Mikey in 1992, if you actually check it, both movies have the same slogan! However, if you want to watch an incredibly funny movie with absolutely no action then that's all the movie for you. The acting is awful and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. The story behind this atrocity is simple Milo Jeeder is a child with serious family problems, his father is an abortionist who kept the unborn Feoutus in a jar (NICE!) And desperately searched for a baby of his own he called him ............. MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from all the bad acting, terrible directing, annoying Milo's voice and the ear piercing sounds of the bell on his bike. If you take away all the bad things, it's still a bad but funny try of a movie. <br /> <br /> I'll put an end to bankruptcy 1 out of 10
