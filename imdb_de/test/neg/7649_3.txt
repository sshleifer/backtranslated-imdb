I do not really consider myself as conservative, so I was not personally offended by this movie, but it was pretty clear that the plot and characterization in this movie were subordinate to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional - either good, freedom-loving Americans or mindless, greedy, evil conservatives. There is nothing clever or creative, just anti-conservative. The political bias itself does not really matter to me, but it should not be the only purpose behind the film. And clearly it is. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the cast is wonderful and Chris Cooper's impression of W is the first two or three times funny, but afterwards it's just the same old joke that's being told over and over again , <br /> <br /> So if you really hate the Conservatives, you're probably going to enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a story that is less black and white then you better look at something else.
