Have you ever wondered why these guys - Seagal, Stallone, Willis, and others - survive all the shootings they failed? I think I found out. The enemies are always missing and the hero is not. <br /> <br /> Here, Seagal has a pistol and shoots half a dozen heavy weapons shooting at him from a few yards away. One of the heavyweights has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them. It does not really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns charging at him, and Seagal would still show up with his ponytail intact. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to maneuvering a mano fight - forget it. The malefactors may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt objects, except Seagal, whose abilities are in Aikido, Tempura or Sushido or Play-Do or whatever it is, wiping them off with some repellent blows. He is not only a master of these Outr√© skills, but also his physical strength is Hercules. More than once he grabs someone's long bone as easily as we would break a toothpick. He breaks a man's SPINE over his knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. (I come here in the spirit of the movie because Seagal uses the line "I tell you something" several times along with "What does that mean?"). These guys absolutely deserve to die out every good Xenophobe manual. They're all black, talking to unintelligible Jah-MAY-Can accents, wearing dreadlocks that desperately need a shampoo, torturing and murdering them with perfection, and - here's the worst. They are unchristian. Right. They practice voodoo. <br /> <br /> In fact, the voodoo element comes close to the most interesting element of the movie. They got on pretty well with the ingredients of the ritual - cigar smoke, spitting rum, the sacrificial chicken. They only skipped the owner's dance in which the ghost rides the dancer. You should have read Metraux on Voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the act adheres to the usual conventions. What Jaqueline Bissett was wrought by the Voodoo practitioners in "The Deep" is done here to a friend of Seagal. What John Wayne was doing when he put trucks in "McQ" is done here at Seagal. Right at the beginning of the movie, when Seagal made a brief speech about having seen too many senseless acts of violence in his DEA career, he's now happily retired, and when we get to know his friends and family, I tried to find his partners If I could find out which of them would be horribly murdered or mutilated to make his vendetta. <br /> <br /> The acting does not require much comment. But Charles, the Jamaican cop, played by Tom Wright, is really good. Wright has a considerable reach. Here he is a companion of dubious loyalty, rather scary. But in "The Pentagon Wars" he has a strange role, which he perfectly accompanies. <br /> <br /> The Jamaicans never flew as movie villains. I do not know why. It is a small film market. And if you go to Jamaica, stay in Montego Bay. However, if you find Jamaican voodoo drug dealers difficult and if you fancy another typical action movie, this should be a satisfying point of view.
