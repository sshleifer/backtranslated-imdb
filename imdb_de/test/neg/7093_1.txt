The moral of this show is that bad eating habits bring bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad jobs and so on. They are obviously unhappy and abhor. However, when they learn to eat broccoli they will be rich, successful and attractive. <br /> <br /> TLC should be ashamed of the obvious exploitation of parental fears and guilt. If nutrition really is so important, they should be able to develop a show with honest and truthful methods. If they really believed in their computer simulations, I'd like to see them do a double-blind test by finding some 40-year-olds, finding out what eating and exercising habits they had as kids, and taking photos of the children's age group. Then compare with the real things. Hey, that sounds like a project for Mythbusters! Discovery Channel - are you listening? <br /> <br /> TLC must stand for Tabloid Lies and Cons.
