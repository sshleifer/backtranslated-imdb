Would someone please explain why someone wants to make a "British Neo-Noir" break movie with an almost exclusively American cast? The accents spoken in this movie are damn bad! But in line with the wooden performances, one fears a game because he set the cast on fire. <br /> <br /> Really, what's that nasty, moronic, cynical guy? Even neo-noir films have a character that you either feel or want, even if they are miserable and damned. At least they have something decent about them, some feel that what they have done is wrong or that a seemingly good plan has gone awry and that they somehow remain responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Not in this stanky stew. These characters are lazy and reveal themselves to each other, themselves and the audience. <br /> <br /> Also note that these are low-life situations. All right, nothing wrong with that except that they seem to live a life of luxury. For a movie allegedly told by desperate little thieves, the keynote is here - ennui. It's all so awfully boring and slag, you do not know. So let's just rip off some people or maybe murder and go to a luxury hotel. What ambition! <br /> <br /> The whole mess on some swamp bottom is: boring uneven tempo; predictable "action" sequences that are not; banal and incoherent set design; TV camera work and editing; forgotten score; and a complete lack of imagination or innovation in production and direction. <br /> <br /> Absolutely unbelievable, unlikely and for less dedicated film observers (or masochists) like me, totally incomparable. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things I want to say about this bad movie, but they would not print it here. Suffice to say that you can probably find something more useful than watching this movie - just for everything.
