Something strange happens in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear and not cold. A giant robot plastic monster appears and kills Scots! What kind of film is this ?! First, I love reading stories about Nessie, marine monsters in general. When I saw this for sale, I thought it was a cheap rip-off of the jaw. No, it was awful! The story was pointless, the acting was 100% garbage, the only advantage was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracies, wrong places and everything bad. Not worth it, just leave it on the shelf (or trash can) on which you found it. Second, this movie was shot in Cailifornia, not in Loch Ness, a big discipline for Nessie fans.
