The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, has awakened the ghost of at least partial revival of the cursed movie's reputation. In addition, the original version, the "long version," was recently featured on TCM, which would most likely feature the movie in front of its largest audience. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when it first appeared in front of Bloomingdales in a crowded movie screening on 3rd Avenue. I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn the following Wednesday. Maybe that was not a fair release, but it was and is a terrible movie. Recently, the long version confirmed this verdict, and with around thirty years more experience watching and writing films, I can better explain why. First, there is the dreaded phrase "Mise-en-Szene", whose definition is so simple yet so amorphous that it still confuses definition: basically, it's all that happens in front of a camera For example, an extra audience may be asked to walk past the sidewalk and find a launch pad, and if the assistant director yells the action, the extra will be traversed, and if there is another take, the extra will return to the starting point and return to " Action. "All the extras do that, then we say a taxi goes to the sidewalk, and the star gets out and hugs another client, while the spectators are doing their thing." This is staging. "In the theater they call that blocking, but that Cinema is much multi-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The definition of mise-en-scene is important because French critics had developed their theory of the author the opposite of an author a MÃ©tier-en scene, even more derogatory than "traffic cop". An author was closely involved in the meaning of a film, and the director's work distinguished a theme or themes. Essentially, the metier-en scene was a company man who reproduces in the film what was presented to him on paper. It's the difference between John Ford and Sam Wood. <br /> <br /> The second point is how director Michael Cimino got into the position of directing movies. Cimino became director of the first TV commercial in the millions. This showed a Chevrolet, which drove down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on a list of the biggest TV commercials of all time and is remarkable only for the high price and the totally exaggerated effect. The effect is like that of a three-year-old girl brought in to entertain business. Her biggest resonance comes when she throws her dress over her head. Sweet for a three-year-old, embarrassing for a thirty-year-old. So Cimino was praised early on that he had spent a lot of money for some exaggerated image, and so he learned. <br /> <br /> His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974), depicts a scene in which Clint plays Eastwood, and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a madness car, driving back and forth, back and forth, until it's over leaves the road and the driver opens the trunk with rabbit, which he shoots gradually. I felt that if producer Eastwood had not stepped in, the scene would have taken so long until every bunny had been killed. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I think if you look at the movie on a DVD in tatters like a miniseries, that can be impressive. This is because scenes are shot with such a dense staging scene that each scene looks like an encyclopedia. It's just exhausting to sit for almost four hours. It's like sex, eventually it's just a whip. There is the opening of 40 minutes, which takes place in Harvard. Brilliantly photographed in Oxford, this is a kind of sequence. Personally, I prefer the artistic way to unfold a story, unlike the more commercial _ "Now I'll tell you what I'm going to tell you" movie. However, the entire preface covers only one line - Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later? All the time, money and effort, not to mention the attention and energy of the audience, just to deliver this almost useless information. Then there's the scene on the street between Kristofferson and Masur, which keeps going with a populated city of background extras and horse-drawn vehicles in the background in constant motion that provides only minute exposure information. It's just so exhausting. There is only one scene after the other. It's like trying to eat a thirty pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations with inconsistent details and incomprehensible dialogue that go on and on and are exhausting and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course, every single excerpted scene looks brilliant. All in all, it is a rich piece to be included in the commendable article. In snatches, with the ability to fast-forward through the boring bits or turn them off when you feel staged, it's basically painless. But do not let it be a good movie. When I saw it in 1980, there was a man in front of me commenting on the scene in which Kris Kristofferson is sitting on his horse and he turns in one direction and then in the other and does so about six times. "That's symbolic," he said, "he does not know which way to go." That's basically the basis of any criticism of Heaven's Gate. <br /> <br /> See if you have to, but be forewarned, this is not a movie whose time has come, this is a stinker that will smell forever. <br /> <br /> HEAVEN'S GATE has historically been very inaccurate. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer about the Johnson County War.
