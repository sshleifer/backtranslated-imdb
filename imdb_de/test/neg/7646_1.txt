Apparently, the film has a strong anti-Bush message ... If so (I did not understand it), that's all. It's boring and useless, period. <br /> <br /> It's sometimes too serious to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not funny, not gripping, not exciting, not cinematic. It's all to be the opposite, and vice versa. I was amazed how bad a movie can suck. Do not even think about looking at it. <br /> <br /> I have seen literally hundreds of films and have never been so obligated to write a warning about IMDb. Avoid at all costs. They were warned. <br /> <br /> Even "The Making of ..." is painfully boring. It's only people who chat with a lot of inside jokes in front of a camera, like a home theater. There's even a part where a guy takes you on a tour of the food consumed by the film crew on set. Nevertheless, the movie beats, I think ...
