Found this movie for a dollar ($ 1) and the movie was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown (Mark Hardin) played a military advisor in South America and captured the leader of the rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungle. After some terrible torture or women and men, Mark steps on the other side. In a scene where Mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes see the sexy long legs of Sandra Spencer ("Shannon Tweed"), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandra have the most extreme minds and passionately love each other very hard rocks, with no time for the comfort of a bed. This is a horrible movie and it's not worth the time to look at IT.
