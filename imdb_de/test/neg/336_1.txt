I am proud to be able to sit through everything. I think "if I paid the rent, I'll at least look at it". I have found the exception to this rule - the planet. I do not know what the exchange rate is, but looking through the other comments, I can only guess that Â£ 8,000 must be $ 150. I'm going to make an appointment myself, but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the 50s. He was a bodybuilder who became an actor. He was in these really awful Italian dubbed movies showing Reeves as Hercules or another muscular hero. As a kid they watched, you could not say exactly why these movies stink - you just knew they did. Mike Mitchell is the new Steve Reeves. That's it ... it really was - a new narration of an old Italian "spaghetti sand and sandals" movie. And I'm not joking, where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie is not that bad, it's fun to see it - it's just bad.
