This is a terrible adaptation of Charles Kingsley's story. The animation is, roughly speaking, awful. And the songs are a shame for the film music, epsektuell the song "high cockororim", which they constantly repeat. I'm sorry that Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of Britain's best talents, are providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins tries his best for this terrible production, but fails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it's the last movie on this planet!
