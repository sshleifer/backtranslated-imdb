The detonator is in Bucharest, where a former CIA government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) has tracked down an arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch). However, things are going wrong and Dimitru finds out that Sonni is working for the US government. After a major firefight, most of Dimni's men were killed by Sonni, of which the local Romanian police are unhappy. Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni back to the US while protecting a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca), who is also sent back to the US. It turns out, however, that Nadia is being sought by Dimitru and his football club, the head of Jozef (Tim Dutton), in order to win her over for a nerve gas bomb that will kill her in Washington and kill millions of people. <br /> <br /> This American and Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chih Leong & The Detonator. The detonator confirms any doubt that Wesely Snipes has joined the tense action movie star club that sells generic products to action films in Eastern European locations, yep Snipes has met with such luminaries as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer and Chuck Norris teamed up. I give Snipes a bit of credit, as he spent a bit longer than the rest with the excellent Blade: Trinity (2004), which is still fresh in many moviegoers (every movie he made since then went straight to DVD). But sooner or later it had to happen, as many of the names I mentioned, Snipes lived from the reputation of some great movies. If you look at his career, he has been in more bad movies than good ones. Like the last JCVD ​​& Seagal movies, The Detonator is pretty awful. The screenplay by Martin Wheeler is so predictable, boring and numbers like everything else. The detonator is the kind of movie you expect on a dark cable TV channel that plays at 2 o'clock in the morning. The detonator is full of clichés, Snipes is forced into a situation in which he must protect a woman and they initially dislike, but in the end they are in love. But his closest friend to the CIA turns out to be a traitor. The obnoxious one of the bookboss, which nobody likes, actually turns out to be a pretty decent guy. The figure of Snipes is allowed to walk around in Bucharest and shoot people, kill and blow them up without it being important. He is never arrested Boring and forgetting, the villain owns a football club, so there are many annoying football terminology and there are not even any funny one-liners. <br /> <br /> Director Leong does nothing to liven things up The Detonator looks cheap with a chase where the two cars never seem to come over the 30-mile mark. OK, the action scenes are relatively well staged, but they are only a few & far away from each other and completely forgotten when a bad guy shoots Snipes & Misses. In return, Snipes shoots at a bad guy and kills him in a way. There is a half decent car accident and an explosion, but little else. It seems as if a part of The Detonator was shot dead in a Romanian football stadium. I think I would rather have watched the game for 90 minutes than this movie. <br /> <br /> With a purported budget of about $ 15 million, The Detonator is reasonably well done, but not that much really happens. Set & filmed in Bucharest in Romania. Acting is not great, Snipes just does not seem to be interested and feels like he's just there for the money I do not blame him for, a Célédie action movie with an actor played in Eastern Europe. Why does Sony do these things over and over again? Not recommended, there are much better action prices.
