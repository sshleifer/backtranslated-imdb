This movie has a lot of potential - it's a great story and has the potential to be very scary. but of course tim burton does not really make scary movies, he makes crazy cartoon-like movies. and I usually like Tim Burton's stuff. but I really liked this movie. The best thing about the movie (and actually it's really worth seeing) was the art direction - the movie has an amazing immaterial quality. the script was not good. it was boring in parts and confusing in other parts, and no figures were built. I've never really cared that people of a headless being have chopped off their heads. I thought Johnny Depp had a good thing about his approach to the character, but since the script was weak, he could not go too far - and I was very irritated by the attempts of a slight accent on his and Christina Ricci's parts. Unfortunately, it is not a great movie and not worth seeing, unless you are interested in the art direction.
