A look at the rating should tell you that this movie was chosen by Shills to artificially raise the ratings of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is ridiculously bad (in acting and camera) and distracted in its plot. The make-up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot. The lines are stiff and timely delivered, with the exception of the bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a movie. The worst offenders are the Italian (Hans), the protagonist Ryn and the lead actor. I have seen a better delivery of pizza flatbed truck. <br /> <br /> This is a self proclaimed "zombie western", but the only thing that makes this a "zombie western" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and is the real name of the lead actor Clint , The protagonist is not cool and mysterious like a traditional Eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero, he does not have the clever attitude to make it. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the fake glowing reviews. This is just another B-grade zombie movie that was made proficient for the budget he had (it has some decent lighting), but it smells like low-budget directing and bad acting. There are a lot of REALLY stupid scenes that make this really amateurish.
