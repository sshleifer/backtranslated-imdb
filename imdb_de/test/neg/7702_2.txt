The problem with this movie is, as with so many other failing films, the script. <br /> <br /> The script is so fuzzy that it fidgets everywhere. What is the story here? OK, it's a biopic, but I think everyone will agree that it's impossible to sum up a whole life in about 100 minutes. Some selection and editing is required, but this script has not picked or edited enough. It did not reduce Hoffman's life to one or two definable key moments or themes that the audience could identify with and "experience" the larger image of the whole man. <br /> <br /> The film moves from a down-to-earth biography of "problematic genius" to semi-docu / mocu-mentary (with new footage that goes with the archive footage), to "true life sob stories" - Film of the week (the whole "I bring up") A son who does not know that I am his father, political conspiracy theory film, etc., etc. He never decides what he wants to be, and the half-hearted citizen Kane likes the narrative structure (reporter) to interview people from Hoffman's past) is soon given up, making the film even more unstructured and flabby as it begins. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments and incidents that do not contribute to the story and could have been cut to give way to something more important. The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio shatters the window and "I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman!" ("I'm fucking, I'm talking, I'm fucking!") Could have been cut easily. All that has happened, the psychiatrist says, "You have bipolar disorder, here's some lithium." And the two women in his life say, "We could see you more often on weekends." and bang! That's it. No more mental problems. It is such a ridiculously meaningless tokenist scene that could and should have been able to easily fall before recording. The scene where they are all in full swing watching news from Vietnam and Hoffman phones GOD? Futile. Do not tell us anything. But when it comes to a crucial moment like the drug explosion, filming is in such a hurry that the situation just comes from the left field and makes no sense to the audience. Suddenly he is dealing with heroin? Where did that come from? Why? What is going on here? <br /> <br /> I'm a middle-aged left-handed guy, and I'd guess I'm a good target for this movie, but even I was fed up with "The Man," "The Pigs." 'The Fuzz' etc. as brutal, accurate, unthinkable, hippie-hating androids. It may have been in 1960s America, I do not know, I was not there, but in movies it was a cheap, awkward polemic. <br /> <br /> After Vincent D'Onofrio said everything, he was convincingly charismatic like the younger Hoffman and I was able to see Janeane Garofalo at everything, even reading a bus timetable, even though she was just not right for this part.
