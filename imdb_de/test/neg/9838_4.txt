Here's a movie that was so pedestrian for 90% that he had no right to end up being so challenging and frustrating. Has the director decided to suddenly become an author, 80% through the creation of this film? Yeesh SPOILER ALERT The thing typically starts with the young people in the 50s going wild. There are drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the friendly old diner manager and the city. Things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end, when the only sympathetic character is killed and the anti-hero is accused (this would not be so unexpected if that were the main message of the movie ... but all that.) Things start and happen during the last roll! Major Curve Ball). Then things get weird. the friendly old coward forms a mob and beats the hero to bloody pulp. The mere presence of the hero's friend somehow draws a confession from the real killer - the creepy, spooky Townnuss (who would have been the prime suspect in any real universe, even if the anti-hero was found) with her body). <br /> <br /> We have a slightly weak "happy" end behind us, which is about as out of the ordinary with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes before. Even stranger is that this movie insists on playing homosexual allusions to the limit, but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight. Perhaps this was deliberately intentional - perhaps Bix's resistance to getting used to the girl was more due to his sexuality (which had to be pretty much suppressed in the 1950s and was therefore not discussed or even allowed by him) rather than a need had to be a child "marauder". If the director intended to spin this as a sexual thread - that the drifter drifts because he feels he is an outsider; that his fatherly consideration for Danny is indeed not paternal, but conjugal; that his inability to stay with Carrie is rooted in a sexual disgust that even he does not fully understand - it could have been made more explicit. Instead, we get this very bizarre alchemy of homosexuality and behavior that is completely heterosexual. These young men sleep side by side, even if they can spread out a bit. When Danny is proposed (and even once in bed with a woman), Bix flies out and takes him away. Danny pays Bix's way (sure, there's another explanation for that, but it's always a chord when you see Danny Bix's lunch buy). In the end, they live together. Since Hitchcock's "rope," homosexuality has not been so obvious, but rejected. <br /> <br /> MST3K did the right thing by taking this decision. Apart from Jack Elam, there is little to recommend.
