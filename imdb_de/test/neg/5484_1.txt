Do you remember that when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 Minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer was there and Once Made Made Canada was a great show. Talking to Americans was also a strange special. But as my friend said, "Rick Mercer woke up one day and not funny anymore," I think the day was when the Rick Mercer Report aired. What is the meaning of this show? Rick Mercer reads crazy fake headlines, shows pictures of bad sheds that people send out, and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30-minute show, goes somewhere and only talks to people hoping to say something witty or smart to enter Watching TV and maybe even making something Someone laughing somewhere. We're interested in seeing Rick Mercer visit a gymnastics team and then try to do some of their moves, and then deliberately suck and desperately try to be "funny." Rick Mercer has grown old or has just lost interest or is just not funny anymore. Even his classic rascals have lost all their bite and humor. You can say that about CBC comedy in general, because how many years did they use Air Farce on TV to deliver the same pointless jokes?
