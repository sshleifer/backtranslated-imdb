It's hard to believe that such a bad movie was not even produced four times! Most movies require some "suspension of reality" to enjoy, but it just takes them too far. The basic scenario is an air force pilot who is shot down over a country in the Middle East. The US government is attempting to rescue him, and has the pilot's son (Doug Masters) on a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with the movie is that it jokes the US Air Force as colossal. In the movie, you'll find that Doug and his Air Force friends manage to secure two F-16s, all the ammunition, the fuel, the Intel for the mission, and so on. Security on this basis seems to be a joke. Nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old boy is qualified to pilot the F-16! <br /> <br /> If that were not enough, you would think the producers would at least try to get the ammo right because people like to see things go "in the air". Not so! Several times in the film, Doug shoots AIM-9 missiles at ground targets. AIM stands for "Air Intercept Missile", which means a weapon that attacks targets in the air. He also fires 15-20 missiles, with an F-16 can hold a maximum of 6 AIM -9. The film also lacks continuity. The plane is configured with one set of ammunition, and in the next scene there is a completely different ammunition package. 20MM does not destroy everything that touches it! An F-16 can take 500 rounds of 20MM and is mostly used for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever, with holes, mistakes and completely wrong information from the movie, but I won't bore you if you are in the mood to see a good Air Force movie Decisions rather low. Most military films deal with either the army, the navy or marines. Until Hollywood can submit an Air Force movie from the series "Saving Private Ryan" or "A Few Good Men", we have to watch films like the "Iron Eagle" series. <br /> <br />
