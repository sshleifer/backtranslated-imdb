I like to believe that I have seen everything. SS DOOMTROOPER. The over a family of Saberzahntigern. The one about a family of Pteranodons. GOAT EATER. DEMON CHILD (a non-animated kiddy gum doll with horns on its head, several SASQUATCH flicks none of which are good, some giant spider / insect flicks, endless HELLRAISER sequels, endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels, endless JASON sequels, one Kickbox Scarecrow AX EM, which is actually a street parade recorded on a $ 199 camcorder, etc. I saw a part of a STV with people stranded on a desert island the other day and died with a bunch of badly animated totems I even ate DREAMCATCHER, just like last night - well, I'd say that I've seen some of it and seen it in all its horrible splendor years ago, but nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, a group of teenagers trapped during a storm on an island, forced to fight aliens arriving in a meteorite The meteorite looks like it came from a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s. Even the aliens do that. The photography and the acting and writing are all the same bad. I turned it off halfway. Good luck.
