Impressive. As soon as I saw the cover of this movie, I wanted to see it right away, because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies just because they are so bad that it will be entertaining (eg Koi Mil Gaya). This movie had all the elements of a gruesome movie: a "harmless gang of local thugs", a badly made motorcycle scene, dreadful dialouge ("Congratulations, I'm very proud that you're a bad boy"), actor basketball as if they are good, abominable songs ("I'm angry, I mean, I mean bad boy"), unexplained storylines, why are the friends Good Boy and Bad Boy ??? And why is this hot girl in love with the nerd? I've never seen such a badly constructed story with such a terrible direct look. Some scenes actually lasted 30 seconds, like the one in which the Good and Bad Boys inexplicably exceeded the Gang Member poker game. Congratulations Ashwini Chaudry, you are a bad director. If you want to watch a good movie, check out Guru if you want to watch a movie that is so bad that it is actually entertaining. Then look at Good Boy, Boy.
