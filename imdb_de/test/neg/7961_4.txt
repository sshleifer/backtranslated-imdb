If I want to distinguish one of the other great reviewers, then I'm the queen looking for strange movies in Thrift and Dollar stores. You can not imagine how happy I was when I found it. <br /> <br /> I can even remember this Saturday morning when * each * station simulcasted it, so get stuck if you wanted to see something else (that's the idea). As a kid I did not know if I liked how the different characters were kept together (there are some crossovers that simply * do * not work). But I think the special had its intended effect. Do not use drugs because you will have nightmares about the Muppets. If you look at this as an adult, you'll be treated to the "weirdest" anti-drug movie on the other side of this page from Reefer Madness. I think I'll just leave it before I get into trouble.
