Woody Allen (whom I must admit at the beginning of which I have never been a big fan) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a jazz guitarist of the 1930s, whose star seems to be a time long shone, then quickly faded. Penn does a credible job in this role, representing a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike Allen himself, which perhaps explains why Woody would be interested in this project), who can not sustain relationships and his two passions (apart from guitar playing) shot rats in the dump and watched trains. <br /> <br /> There is not much consistency in the story. It is, so to speak, narrated by a number of modern "jazz" experts (one of whom is himself), who tell their various theories and interpretations of various events in Ray's life. The end result is a totally contradictory account of the life of a fictitious man who seems to have received from his creators a pretty interesting life story that probably should have done a better job. <br /> <br /> Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy this. As for me, the best I can give is 3/10.
