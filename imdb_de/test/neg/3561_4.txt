This movie is about a grieving woman who lost her husband through suicide. She is tormented by her son, who refused to speak. Childhood grief is rarely explored in the movie, so it's refreshing to see a movie like Addison's Wall. Due to the nature of the film, however, there is no tension or drama. Apart from some important emotional moments, everything in the movie is very simple. The abrupt end, which does not solve any puzzles, certainly does not help the movie to be seen better. Addison's Wall could have been a lot better, like exploring the wall's content, a more intense care program that helps Addison make his trauma. Instead, the film feels very unfinished and uninteresting.
