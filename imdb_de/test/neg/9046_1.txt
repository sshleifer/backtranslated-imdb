This movie contains real animals that were killed, like a monkey eaten by a snake and a crocodile cut open. I find this totally confused and sick and seriously doubt the mental health of the director of this garbage. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stupid and stupid that it has no logic whatsoever. <br /> <BR> There are many breasts and sex in this movie, but do not bother to see this trash. If you want to see breasts and sex, look at a porn instead. There are also rape scenes in this film that I found disgusting, as if women were being raped and dissected and eaten. This film is for sadists and those who get a kick and see how people are cut and eaten. <br /> <br /> Many animals, like the monkey that appeared in this movie, are not in the jungle of New Guinea. The local characters, most of them seemed Asian, and no one looks like they came from New Guinea. It looks like this movie was made on the grounds of a resort, which I bet. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this trash, it's sick and confused.
