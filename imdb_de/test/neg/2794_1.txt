Do not take this movie seriously, hire it from some people who want to play Mystery Science 3000, and you'll probably enjoy yourself. The bad guys are not that scary, it's funny, it's like a 7th grade guy with a sickle in a scarecrow. Acting is funny. I love the occasional self-torture with a poor horror movie, and that really made me giggle. I recommend it on this basis. Of course, recreational drugs will improve the experience. Oh, there is a naked group swimming scene that stirs up a bit of dust on the 5-star system. The male black man is seriously injured, but continues his joke and uses the injured body part quite easily. Enjoy this complete and absolute shame on movies.
