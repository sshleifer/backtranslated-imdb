As someone who loves baseball history, especially the early 20th century, when Cobb was a main character, and a lot of colorful characters, I was looking forward to this baseball movie. Well, it was not a baseball movie, which was disappointing. No, it was just a report by the sports journalist that Cobb was in the later years of the ballplayer, while the two worked on a book. Nevertheless, this could have been a more appealing film than they did. <br /> <br /> Granted, Cobb was anything but a nice guy, an extremely talented player, but brutal because he would do anything to beat you. ... and he was thick, intimidating and had to fight many demons. He was so hated that his own teammates were trying to hinder his chances of winning a title for a year. However, this is an exaggerated portrayal of the man. It makes him something that looks almost like a cartoon. <br /> <br /> If an old man is angry, profane and profane for two hours, is entertainment a conversation? No it is not. One day, I would like to see a real biography of Cobb showing him in his ball-playing time, and if they want to portray him as a bad guy, then so be it, but as they did here with a bitter, blasphemous old man Making an ass out of a reporter is no fun.
