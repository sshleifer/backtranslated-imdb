I have seen this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland," and although his acting is made of wood, he portrays a tough "leader." The same applies here. This film was about a group of young, hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that you absolutely must see. The opening scene was very interesting, with a group of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of prey. Looking forward 30 years, we have a team of divers summoned by a scientist and his crew to explore a cave for unknown scientific purposes. <br /> <br /> There are many clich√©d, useless rumors. The women are too hot for their jobs, let's face it. I hate to watch these women's lips drinking beer at the exploration party outside the cave while drinking beer. I mean, it was like we were in a bar where brothers and students talked about the opposite sex - not a group of scientists and divers. Each character had ZERO personality, except perhaps the scientist who was at least none of the young and beautiful people. The acting was unemployed, but not inspiring. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was pretty bad. At one point in the film, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the leading diver - his iris turns into the wireless cingulate symbol and stays that way. We believe that he has become one of them since being scratched by one of these monsters. Because of me. Above all, nobody says the obvious to him, "What's wrong with your EYES, dude?" Everyone has just talked about how he "changed" and that he should no longer be the leader of the group. And then this guy says, "Do you see how he is not HUMAN?" Huh If they really believed he was a damned monster, why not behave like that? Instead, the group divides into two - those who go with Jack, and those who go their separate ways, I think he's a monster. It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie was that this blonde diver woman crawled along a cave wall and was attacked by this goblin. Her scream was really shitty - but she fought like the hell to send the goblin. <br /> <br /> The photograph was ok when the camera was still standing. However, with all the action sequences, the director has found it useful to confuse hell with bubbling flashes, flashlights, the dark room, God knows what. I wish they would show us a scene from time to time. Just because you move the camera everywhere, the movie does not SCARIER, people. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a lot better if the following changes had been made: <br /> <br /> 1. Each actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Leave Cole Hauser in the lead, it's alright to regard him as handsome. I'm tired of seeing 20 supermodel scientists. Give me a break, people! <br /> <br /> 2. The cameraman was fired and replaced by one who just pointed at the camera and sat quietly. That could be the fault of the director, I do not know. Jumpy Camera (as in Constant Gardener) is getting old, guys. <br /> <br /> 3. We have seen the goblins actually devour people. How about some blood? There is not much else in this movie. We barely saw the creatures - I felt a bit torn off. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was pretty lame. During the dissolution, the British sexy scientist has a secret ... guess what that is? It's a bit canned. The end would have been better if they had all died instead of the black man (Morris Chestnut), who seemed to take some sympathy in his character only through his anxious expressions. All other actors had NO expression. <br /> <br /> I gave 4 out of 10 points because the acting was without obvious mistakes and the concept was quite original. I want Cole to play more military roles - he's good at it.
