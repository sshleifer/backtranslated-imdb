This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot bat with the pretty (and sometimes predatory) wife and the crazy brother-in-law. With this show, it is the fat, listless comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman, who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. He has a pretty wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as a legal assistant, and senile father-in-law Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in the basement of his daughter and his son-in-law. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer-drinking, sports-loving television watching sluts of a sitcom husband who prefers seeing the subway rather than dealing with his marital problems. He also has some idiotic friends who add extra stupidity to the problems of this show couple. Apart from the few laughs that Jerry Stiller's crazy Old Man character provided, this show was generally not funny. Kevin James's idiotic behavior usually caused the show's problems usually resolved by his wife. The show continued a series of sitcoms with the stupid stupid father / husband and their pretty wives, who all seemed to be running on ABC for some reason.
