Roeg's attitude to Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" was not quite what I expected. Although the film is based on one of the most studied and interesting lyrics in history, the movie just got boring. History never manages to capture the viewer. It just does not matter. <br /> <br /> The tracks of the text are easy to spot, but this is not really Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". Benedict Fitzgeralds (who also wrote "The Passion of Christ") uses only Conrad as inspiration and thus becomes Fitzgerald's "Heart of Darkness". It's not worth the movie unless you're particularly interested in Conrad or John Malkovich.
