Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen and a big influence on my life. <br /> <br /> This movie is flabby and horrible and does not honor his memory. The script is cluttered and gets too many lines from the book intact (the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). The performances of the actors are equally ineffective, a great cast is wasted, and the lead role, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's warlike hostilities in a wailing whine that misses the point well. The farce should accelerate towards the end. The Goon shows often had, the novel "Puckoon" definitely, but this movie slows down only when you want the various elements to collapse in a final climax. <br /> <br /> Milligan narrated a slightly shortened audio recording of "Puckoon" in 1980 with TP McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. This is funny. Ten minutes of it is funnier than this whole movie. I think the LP was transferred to CD, but I do not know if it will be printed. <br /> <br /> There is a movie about "Adolf Hitler: My part in his downfall" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It's also a terrible mess, but it's funnier than this thing. <br /> <br /> It's possible that Milligan's mind is too rough for the screen. The other reviewers here are polite and want to think. This film takes virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint.
