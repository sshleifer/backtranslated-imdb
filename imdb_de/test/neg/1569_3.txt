George & Mildred - The Movie lacks the talents of his TV writer John Mortimer, who brings George Smith's class war to life with the Fourmiles. <br /> <br /> The plot is cut from normal spin-off cloth - hit-man / false identity - and has as little tension as it laughs. The producers should have taken a sheet of Rising Damp (also in 1980), which was bought after the demise of the television series on the big screen and kept much of the story in a familiar environment. Yootha Joyce died in 1980, but she should not remember this creaking work that has burdened her illness. Mildred lacks the sharpness of her TV incarnation; The cutting out of pages and the extinction of glances are largely due to Georges libido deficiency. Georges spitting disbelief is lost even in the more expansive sets. That's not to say that they had a lot to scream for. The budget for these films looks miserable; A restaurant they go into is clearly a new, semi-fortified house with Christmas lights adorning the front door. <br /> <br /> For fans of the British comedy of the 70s or for those who only want to visit an old television companion from their teens. This film can not add anything to the experience and they should just stay with the first four TV series which now appear on DVD.
