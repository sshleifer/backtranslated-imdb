The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly have to raise the money for this crap. Yes, the American rip-off was shown in Australia for about two episodes, but not rated; probably from curious onlookers wondering how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and do not readily accept the nuances of the screenplay written in Australia. Bad luck for them because they are doomed to fall with this turkey. My advice to viewers in the US is NOT. <br /> <br /> Americans should be advised to find DVDs of the ORIGINAL VERSION on eBay. Note, however, that some DVDs have a different "zone format" than those that were issued in the US. Otherwise, some DVD players may serve discs from both / all zones.
