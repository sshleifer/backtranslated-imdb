How bad can you make a movie? A good question that House of the Dead 2 can answer successfully. I could not believe it was possible to get anything worse than the First House of the Dead, but the director did it amazingly. The only feeling you get from the movie is that it's bad, just bad. What about overclocking, bad effects and a stupid story. It's this kind of movie that generally gives a bad name to z-movies. Why could not they learn the lesson from the first House of the Dead movie? I think you now understand that you should not see this movie. It's just a waste of time. Check out "Bad Taste" or "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see good zombies.
