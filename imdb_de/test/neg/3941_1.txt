Honestly, I was a big fan of 'Stay Alive' when it was released a few months earlier. I kept telling my friend how this movie has a great storyline - and maybe a good one. Anyway - this movie is a bit below my expectations. <br /> <br /> The plot has great potential, but as the story unfolds, along with acting, directing and the bad CGI - this movie is a disaster. The mind makes no sense, including the murders - it's all too fast and creates a sense of "unrealistic" in the minds of the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie might be scary for some viewers - but fear in a sense of shock (due to the sound effect, etc.) instead of being scared due to certain valid factors in the movie. <br /> <br /> You should reconsider the movie.
