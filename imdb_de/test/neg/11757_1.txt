Yes why? Among the filmmakers who came out in the 80s and 90s, Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, some. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, sometimes angry, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names prompt me to turn on the TV, go to a video store, or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. Van Sant's "Psycho", however, gives me a break. Why? I wonder. A shot at a massacre of one of the perennial classics. The color was staggering, the performances cruel. What did Vince Vaughn do? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What the hell was it? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who put them on? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is a great actor, but in this case he could not make us forget John Gavin. If Julianne Moore had been introduced to the world through this performance, perhaps there would have been no "The Hours" for her, "The Minutes." So, here I am, the work of one of my idols to speak badly. The final question remains: why, Mr Van Sant? Maybe in the words of President Clinton, because he could. I'm afraid that's no excuse.
