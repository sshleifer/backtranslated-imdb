As a science fiction and occasional fan of Angelina Jolie, I thought that this obviously low-budget movie would be worth a look ... maybe he had some scenes or a story that would make up for all the other bugs. It could also be interesting to watch Angelina getting into her star-studded career. Oh, how wrong I was. One thing I learned - Angelina Jolie could not act at the age of 18. To make them comfortable, the producers pour the entire movie with people who could not act. Seeing that, Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to do too much. It's enough to see ten minutes to burn your eyes. <br /> <br /> Add a nonsensical screenplay to dreadful acting and exaggeration, bland dialogues, down to earth cinematography ... add bottom-of-the-barrel everything. <br /> <br /> The story reveals Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin. With the help of her martial teacher, she escapes from the company headquarters. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid stuff happens. The end. I would tell you more, but I did not want to waste my life watching this filth. <br /> <br /> I implore you - it's not worth it to be seen. It's not even worth thinking about it. Save the pain and carry on.
