One of the worst movies I have ever seen! After I saw it, I go out, what happened? I am confused until today. Can someone please explain this movie to me? Both the quality of the drama and the image quality are so bad that you think you are seeing a school project created with a camcorder. First, I can not believe that some people could give this movie 10 stars. Because it is an incredibly bad movie! This movie is not scary at all! There are also no typical horror clich√©s. The plot and acting of this movie was terrible. It's not fantastic, surrealistic or terrible. It's just a terribly bad Turkish movie. And finally, there were many unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. When I see 'Gomeda', I fell into such hopeless, sad young Turkish filmmakers. Please, do not make a 'cinema' please!
