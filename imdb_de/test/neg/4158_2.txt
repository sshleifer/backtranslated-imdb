There is nothing worse than science fiction of people who have no sense for it. Understanding a concept that would not be so dreadful in itself (a future where cloning is often enough to make it a crime for you to be genetically too close to someone genetically too close to genetically) drove the scriptwriter continued, the imagination went wild. <br /> <br /> When Tim Robbins' character could guess a security guard's computer password, just by getting her to tell him something about himself, I knew I was having trouble. This ability was later attributed to Robbins receiving an "empathy virus". Viruses were used to provide their users with immediate (or near-instantaneous) upgrades. Robbins' love interest complained about her own experience with such a virus - a Mandarin-Chinese virus that allowed her to speak Chinese, but when she complained, "she could not understand what she said." Okay, first of all, empathy, no matter how intense, is not an ESP. Without integrating some sort of true mind reading (such as an empathy virus that actively releases virions into the environment, infects nearby people, captures parts of their memory, and then leaves for the original host - which you can probably say), you can not justify determining a specific detail such as someone's password by "just listening to things you did not say". Nor can you gain the ability to speak a language without understanding what you are saying - the virus can not infect your vocal cords and spontaneously translate for you because a virus can not think. In order for you to speak Chinese, such a learning virus would have to change your brain. It would have to encrypt the knowledge between the neurons, and once it's there, it's yours - you certainly understand what you say because you have to. In order to perform a task with your own brain, you must (for the most part) understand this task. Unless the film suggests that the virus was deliberately designed to create a bizarre multi-personal mental schism in which some of your subhumans act as built-in one-way translators. <br /> <The mix of languages ​​spoken by the characters is decent enough, though they are far from notable enough to justify the love that other reviewers have expressed. Moreover, all the multicultural insertions of the world can not compensate for a simple, frustrating fact: the dialogue stinks! It's slow, trotting and unnatural. I am sure that the followers have convinced themselves that the boring strangeness is the result of an inspired genius that creates a truly futuristic (and thus linguistic drifted) form of language. I do not agree with you. Good dialogue is a good dialogue in every epoch - and so is Tripe. <br /> <br /> Finally I would like to reiterate the central concept of the film - the prohibition of sex with oneself. The widespread cloning is a beautiful, classic science fiction topic. So global warming is leading to ecological devastation (which also includes Code 46). Unfortunately, the two do not fit together! If you have an ecological disaster that severely limits available living space, do not run around cloning people! They have enough population problems - they do not add up by triggering new issues. Regular, old-fashioned sex and childbirth provide all the populations you need, and cloning of any kind would be ruthlessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the movie was not bad at all. There were some nice movies. If I had seen it silenced I might have enjoyed it.
