This is a stupid movie with a lot of singing and dancing. Acting is average, but the writing leaves much to be desired. There are notable performances by Buddy Epsen, with a short but outstanding performance by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. An absolutely incredible depiction of college life ending with an outstanding Alice in Wonderland skating exhibition. Many parts are worth to be seen, but do not be afraid to move through parts of the movie
