This is a pretty bad movie, but well, at least this movie is not as lame as the third Ghoulies movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a bad movie, in terms of writing, directing, acting and basically everything in between. It has such a weak, simple and ridiculous story that it has little to do with the previous Ghoulies films. It tries to combine the film with the first movie "Ghoulies" from 1985, but on the other hand, if they really wanted to combine this movie with its predecessors, then were the ghoulies in this movie? Instead, we have some little people, played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, dressed as demons. Not that the ghoulies from the previous films were classic characters, but they were still the heart and soul of the movie, and they also made the movies fun. It's like having a Gremlins movie without the Gremlins. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really interesting because it lacks any excitement, good humor, intriguing characters, and basically everything else you can think of, because it's put together by people who obviously are not are the most talented in their business. Just like Jim Wynorski, the director, with films like The Witches of Breastwick and his sequel Alabama Jones and the Busty Crusade, House on Hooter Hill, The Scream Queen Hot Tub Party, The Bare Wench Project "and the sequels" The Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless "and" The Bare Wench Project 3: The Nymphs of Mystery Mountain "and" The Da Vinci Coed "on it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is pretty dumb and fussy, but that's not really enough to push this movie and give it a little more entertainment, you know, it's a kind of cheap-looking movie with lame special effects, costumes, makeup and actors, of which It's not the worst movie in the series yet. "Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College" is by far a worse movie, as this one has some terrible, had lame attempts at humor, this film still makes some attempts, he said To be diligent and professional, even if the end result is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Poor movie production and maybe only visible to those who have seen the previous Ghoulies entries. <br /> <br /> 3/10
