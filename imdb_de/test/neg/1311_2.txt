Currently determined. Entertainment? Probably - but only if a part of the common sense of the viewer is removed. Reality? Only in so much that it was made on this planet. <br /> <br /> How should thousands of people have died on a five-meter-high water wall in a city, which was abundantly crowded with buildings 25 meters high is not me. Carlyle's line on the effect of "How can anyone survive this?" If the recording shows forests of buildings with several floors above the water is completely ridiculous. If someone is committed to an area (underwater) where an air cylinder is insufficient (ie He will die off), why should not you use the easy way to take more than one cylinder? Obviously, the author believes that people in stressful situations can not count beyond one (one cylinder, one floor). Instead of looking at this trip, you would be more informed and entertained if you discarded the DVD and read the pricing information on the outer cellophane sleeve. <br /> <br /> Merciless, really pathetic and a terrible waste of talent on the screen. <br /> <br /> As with sexist propaganda, which only lets women assume, it can look through the problems to show the solutions to be done by the most discernable men: more PC 'tosh'. No wonder First Blood, Delta Force, Navy Seals and other such films, which have little or no merit, will always have a following while this obviously politically motivated bilge is gutted.
