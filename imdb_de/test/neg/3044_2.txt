That's pretty much all I can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 Carol Kane vehicle. Camilla Belle is not a great actress, and she does not bring energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the babysitter who is molested by an anonymous caller. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for something great, home d√©cor and home decorating ideas - this movie offers more inspiration than anything you see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering around the house of the wealthy doctor and the woman for whom she provides her seating, searching for the origins of strange noises and things that "bump" at night. Lurking around corners and looking down hallways, we see a beautiful master bathroom with its and her sinks that look like Roman bathtubs, a large kitchen with incredible backlit glass shelves, and the piece De Resistance, a self-contained aviary and coyote. Pond that has a self-watering system. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is not compelling enough to scare us into Jill's, we are distracted from the size of the house, which is nothing. You should do it when you see a thriller. Even though Jill is persecuted by the faceless madman, we're scared because she breaks valuables and messes up the Coy Pond, not because she's about to get murdered, and the end is anything but original. When it was over, I just wanted to know where the house was and if it really was. Anyway, Jill and the kids she took care of. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for the house.
