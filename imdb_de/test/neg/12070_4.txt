Once again, Woody Allen seems to have no more inspiration than to recycle himself. Here's a mock documentary (like Zelig), the film's structure consists of a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose), which in the 1930s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Life set (deconstructing) Harry, who believes to be a genius, frees him from being an idiot. Given this film and the deconstruction of Harry, the question is whether this is the justification of Allen for his own behavior with the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow. Yes, I was an idiot, but I'm a genius, so you have to love me. Allen has produced only two good films in the last ten years; the fine but overrated Bullets on Broadway and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other endeavors range from bits and pieces (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite) to nervous and experimental (Husbands and Wives) to sheer Drek (Alice, Scenes from a Mall, Shadow and Fog, Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry). His films do not even try to have a narrative sheet, and his humor seems to be aimed in a funny, not funny way. After deconstructing Harry, I stopped watching his movies in the cinema. After Sweet and Lowdown, I can also stop renting them.
