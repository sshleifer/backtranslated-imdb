I wanted to like this movie, but there is little to like. It begins with Jean Stapleton and a Randy Newman song in Iowa (Northwest Iowa, I think), reminiscent of Norman Lears Cold Turkey, which according to IMDb was one of the best films ever made. So far, so good. And the idea that the Archangel Michael lives in Pansy Milbank's motel on Earth? Give him a chance, it's supposed to be a comedy. Okay, so far, so good. But Michael does things that an angel who did not fall would never do and that totally negatively affects the credibility that the movie may have had. The other characters in the movie do not have much appeal either. Michael brings a dog back to life and we should be awesome. People make hackneyed country songs. In the end, Stapleton dances with Travolta. Big thing. If she was smart, she would not even be in this movie. When it was over, I thought, "What a stupid, tasteless, boring, stupid, sacrilegious movie!" It is not suitable to be seen by children or other persons.
