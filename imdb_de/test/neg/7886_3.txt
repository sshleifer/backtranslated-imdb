In June 2000, for the first time, I saw a poster advertising this film in a street in Helsinki, Finland. What struck me was the proud proclamation in which all readers were told that the film, even though it was a Frenchman, was "banned in France." When I returned to New York, I discovered that one of the "Art House" cinemas in the city was screening the movie, so I decided to see what the fuss was all about (along with my Finnish fianc√©). Boy, have we ever. <br /> <br /> From the comments here and the reviews I knew, the movie was violent and sexually explicit. I was not necessarily offended by either of these conditions, and I openly went to see what had disturbed the feelings of our Gallic cousins. Presumably, as anyone who reads this will know, the story is about two women starting a crime and murder plot in France (the film has English subtitles). However, the similarity with "Thelma and Louise" ends with it; The sex is unusually clear (and abundant), as well as the violence (trample much to death and a lot of blood and other organic substances after the impact of the ball). Intellectually One could argue that the real essence of the film is the relationship between sex and violence (as shown by the only gender these women know: one is a small prostitute) and the other is from time to time Making Money Money Porn Movies: When they control their sexual situation while descending into crime and murder, they only react with the same violence and brutality they themselves know and understand, but it is important to pay attention to the victims Rampage is not only creepy men who are interested in scary sex (there are several of them), but also innocent passers-by, for example a woman at an ATM. <br /> <br /> I Do not Really Understand That Why were the repeated "porn film" shots so necessary (except to portray the physical contact as cruel, dispassionate and discouraged) and the relentless Gore became quite severe after the first violent convulsions boring with rude and brutal people and equally unpleasant circumstances.From one point of view, the life of the French subclasses is being explored, and it's pretty bleak, a travelogue for France is definitely not - maybe that's why the French have banned it. <br /> < br />
