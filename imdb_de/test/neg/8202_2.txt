A non-epic Roger Corman from 1957, in which a number of characters land in a lead valley (sic) while the film thermal-nuclear blasting is unleashed. It is the end of the world. Four men with pistols, two women (an unmarried maiden, a Las Vegas show belt that drinks and smokes, presumably what they can do until the end of the movie?) Time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). Something is in the forest and eats radioactive rabbits. A mutated monster! Seven weeks of radioactive dust have "made a million years of evolution" (in an already living human being). The result is a ridiculously bad zipper on the back, a rubber monster that is strangely afraid of its only freshwater source. It's raining. The monster dissolves. The remaining two characters, the hunk and the maiden. The world should be repopulated when the title "The Beginning" fills the screen, after it has been discovered that the brief rain shower had washed away all the radioactivity and dissolved all the monsters that were running around. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really matters is the incredible amount of "curtain games" that are going on in there. One of the main elements of the filmmaking "Bad and Lo Budget" at the time was the use of curtains in set design. It was cheap. Done with a lineup? Put on a curtain, drop another piece of furniture in front of it, and you'll have another location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lights. <br /> <br /> 'Curtain Spectacle' is a skill in which the actor will be able to comment on what's going on outside of a building he's currently in ('It looks like Rain' or 'Here they come now, and it looks like they have the sheriff with them! ") kind of stuff). He does this by standing at one side of the window, grabbing his body and pulling the curtain away from the window, but along the axis of the shot, toward the camera, so he can pretend he's looking out and it tell us what's happening in front of the screen without letting the audience stare at the studio wall three inches from his nose, staring behind a cheap velvet curtain. There was a lot of it in this movie.
