I've seen this movie tonight and have to say it's awful! I expected it to be great, because we do not usually have a lot of films about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture. But already at the beginning it started badly: The introduction of the film seemed to have no end! The plot is so weak and when you drop the fights and the soundtrack, you really have nothing useful! The director of this film does not seem to have much idea of ​​how much time is needed for introductions and flashbacks (not to mention a few other things). <br /> <br /> For people like me who want to make a great vampire movie I really recommend "Lost Boys" or "The Interview with the Vampire".
