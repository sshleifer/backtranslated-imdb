I once saw a bit of this movie and was interested in seeing everything, just to see why the critics gave it two stars, and the result is that I agree. Basically, the film starts with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) telling all his Muppet buddies that they have lost everything, and he ends up sitting down (and possibly thinking about suicide). In another world (sky), Angel Daniel (David Arquette, who was already in space from Muppets) visits the "boss" (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to watch the movie) to show that Kermit really is Need help. In the flashbacks it shows Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and better Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets have prepared one Stage show that many people can see during the Christmas holidays and everything seems to be going well. But the really evil Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to either close the show or the theater, and Kermit does everything possible to make sure that does not happen. Of course Kermit fails the last time and Bitterman tells him they're done and she can officially take the theater with her. Here Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try to help him, but Kermit is in no mood and finally says, "I wish I had never been born". Obviously you can spot the parody of It's a wonderful life, with Kermit as George Bailey and Cusack as Mr. Potter. In the end, Kermit obviously recognizes how much he means to everyone, and goes back to finding the theater stored as a historic landmark. Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only character who sounds similar to Oz's version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs' Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes; Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as a scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the stage parody of Moulin Rouge, besides that and the familiar faces in it, not fantastic. It was the Emmy nominated for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song "Everyone Matters". The Muppets were number 47 of the 100 biggest pop culture icons. Appropriate!
