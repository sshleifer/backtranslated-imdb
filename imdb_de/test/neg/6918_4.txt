"A scientist has developed a serum that grotesquely distorts the hands and heads of the victim, and the scientist decides to use his serum as a concert pianist to extort money for his healing and to marry the man's daughter," he said Scientist Overview of the DVD case. J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays "The Monster Maker" in Bela Lugosi's low-budget mode. <br /> <br /> Mr. Naish's serum causes a true disorder, "acromegaly," which is defined by American Heritage as a "chronic adult disease characterized by enlargement of the bones of the extremities, face, and jaw and is caused by hyperactivity of the pituitary gland ". Ralph Morgan (as Anthony Lawrence) plays the saddened man with some dignity. The pretty blonde Wanda McKay (as Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the daughter that the crazy scientist Naish desires. In early scenes, Ms. McKay and Naish give in hilariously. Pay attention to Tala Birell (as Maxine) in a surprisingly good fringe. She plays the somewhat garbo-like and longtime suffering assistant of Naish. Ms. Birell definitely steals the movie; and you have to Dr. Question Markoff's mind if you throw her aside. Glenn Strange (as Steve) and a crazy gorilla (Ray Corrigan) contribute to the fun. The monster make-up (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** The Monster Maker (1944), Sam Newfield, J. Carrol Naish, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
