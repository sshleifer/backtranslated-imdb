I saw this movie as part of a Billy Graham program. The church I visit was part of a community-wide effort to introduce God and the Christianity of our fellowship (Hartford, Ct. USA). I was one of the counselors who helped the participants (who were invited to introduce themselves and practice a religious profession that they wanted ... and follow them up after the movie.) So it did what it should do, I found it was also a medium for strengthening my belief in God, and I also found it very helpful for those I have consulted, especially the work of Kim Darby in this film, and the parents (the Wintons?) were in somehow a little overdone ... no one tells his child if he thinks he or she could be the parents of an illegitimate child, as the Wintons did: "Oh no, no, not thaaat" It's not exactly that what they said, but the sympathetic audience that I saw laughed at whatever they said, and also at the emphatic "no," my son, not I.
