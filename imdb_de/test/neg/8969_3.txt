Any chance of seeing Katharine Hepburn in something I have not seen before, or from her early film career, is a reward, and at this level the movie is amusing, but she's a terrible miscast as Hill Billy. Her famous New England statement slips through making lines like "I'd better get a few Vittles out" pretty ridiculous. Is she so pretty and so young? it almost overcomes this big mistake. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and so a younger generation may think of this rather stupid stuff, but this was the basis of American Entertainment until the 1940s. It has its moments, but you have to be a hardened movie fan to appreciate it.
