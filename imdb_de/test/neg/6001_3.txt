I usually love Jackie Chan movies, but this was awful. There are only 2 or 3 combat scenes, all more or less normal. The bad thing about this movie is that it focuses a lot on car hunting / racing. The chase is not that bad (though not as exciting as fighting), but the race car at the end is exceptionally boring. Basically, it takes all the things that make a Jackie Chan movie into a Jackie Chan movie and leaves out everything but Jackie Chan. Even the traditional outtakes at the end of the usual humor lacks. <br /> <br /> I guess it was made worse by the fact that I saw one of those terrible dubbed versions. I usually try to see the subtitle version ... I wish I could understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I just saw a Jackie movie that was even worse than this, and that was one of his early attempts in Hollywood movies not so good. <br /> <br /> Avoid, if not really curious or a lover of motorsport.
