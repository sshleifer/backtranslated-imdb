This is the second addition to Frank Baum's personally produced Trilogy of Oz films. It's essentially the same childhood as the other two pictures, though I'd prefer it to others because it's shorter. As in the other films, there are performers in animal costumes, an adult woman pretending to be a boy, and the characters and action leap everywhere while the camera work is static. In the center this time is a magical cloak that fulfills wishes, and the boy played by a woman is made king. Most special effects are experienced at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposure photography. And there is a man on the moon who looks exactly like the one made years ago by Georges Méliès, best known in "Le Voyage dans la lune" (1902). Méliès' imagination and creative effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema. The movies he shot around the turn of the century were far better and even more technically advanced than this insignificant Oz series.
