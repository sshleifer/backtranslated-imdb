This is like a zoology book as the depiction of animals is so accurate. Here are some details that have been slightly modified during the transition to the movie: <br /> <br /> - Pistol bullets never hit giant Komodo dragons. It does not matter how many times you shoot the komodo, bullets just do not go near. <br /> <br /> - The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra or a giant komodo dragon. is only there to stand. The exception to this rule is when you have been asked to stay very quiet. In this case, you should run away until the Komodo is right next to you and you should be there to await a defeat. <br /> <br /> - Minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits are really fun to watch. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a storage expansion tool and a sufficient substitute for losing your boat license / arrest. <Br /> <br /> - Members of elite armies do not see huge Komodo dragons coming until they're a meter from the oversized creatures. Maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> - If you're filming a message that aims to expose illegal animal testing, a reporter and a cameraman with a camera is the A and O staff you'll need; Sound equipment, a second camera, microphones, etc. are all superfluous. <br /> <br /> - If you hear a loud animal cry and one person has a gun, he should take it out and point it at the next person. <br /> <br /> - When you remove a gun, the sound of the safety pick will sound even if your finger is not near safety. <br /> <br /> - Reporters agree to go halfway around the world to expose something - without the slightest idea what they are showing. Background research and vague knowledge are not fashionable in modern journalism. <br /> <br /> - Handguns hold at least 52 balls in one clip and then more than in the next clip. Nevertheless, those with weapons claim that they need more ammunition. <br /> <br /> - Expensive cameras (remember that the reporter has only one camera) are regularly left without hesitation or regret. These cameras make it amazing to get the reporter back all by itself. <br /> <br /> - The blonde girl is really the stupid one. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who does not say Go into a house, because a Komodo dragon can easily pass through it, making it unsafe. He brings a team into a building made of the same material and does not protect anyone. <br /> <br /> - High-tech facilities look like simple offices with high school sets. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified snakes will grow from 100 feet to 100 feet in one day, but will not grow at all in the weeks on either side. <br /> <br /> - The military routinely destroys entire islands if people do not meet a contact date. <br /> <br /> - Men with guns do not necessarily change the direction they shoot when their target is no longer directly in front of them. Instead, they just shoot in the air. <br /> <br /> - The better you look, the better your chance of surviving huge creatures. <br /> <br /> - Women's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn minds. <br /> <br /> - Every time you are hunted by huge creatures, this is a great time to meet girls who are only half their age. <br /> <br /> - Animal sounds are a suitable masking noise for the same amount of "cursing". <br /> <br /> - Old Israeli and Russian planes are regularly used by the US military.
