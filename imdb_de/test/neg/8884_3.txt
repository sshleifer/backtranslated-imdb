I have made this movie well done by different people. I also like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem and the director Milos Forman. After watching this movie, I really had nothing to admire. <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was very much below average. The performances simply were not powerful enough to be truly shocked, which the Inquisition did. Javier Bardem delivered a solid performance and was probably the only one who actually had a Spanish accent. It's pretty obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, whom I think she is a very up-and-coming actress, did not really regret that she was being tortured. Like the movie, there was nothing to admire about their performance. Stellan Skarsgaard, whom I like, did a very average performance, like the other actors a boring performance. This movie has essentially dealt with him since he played Goya. But he did not become what he needed to do well in this movie. What about Randy Quaid? You just have to kid me. He plays King Carlos IV. You see, he's great at comedy, but he plays a king who only describes the whole movie for you. <br /> <br /> The director was just awful in this movie. If a movie is a mess, there are usually two people to blame: the director and the author. I have a feeling that Milos Forman really does not want his actors to put a Spanish accent on them. Of the few fighting scenes here, they were all horribly shown. Even as a director, he has to make you feel how shocked the Inquisition was. After this movie, I felt like I could be careless at the event. All in all, he shot the scenes badly and led the actors astray. <br /> <br /> The writing Milos Forman made was as bad or even worse than the director. There was really nothing reminiscent of the movie except one in which Bardem receives the same treatment as Portman's. Apart from the fact that the film did not give you the feeling of the time, and at least he could have made up for it with one or two quotes. <br /> <br /> After finishing this movie, I just looked at the TV OK, why should I care about anything? I'm interested in and very interested in history, but when movies like these pop up, it feels like the producers have robbed you of something good that could have been taken out of the movie. When films are so bad, we highlight a lot of technical mistakes in a movie, as if it were good. Like the accents. I'm not sure if people would have stressed the lack of Spanish accents if this movie was good. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this review is to say you should not look at it.
