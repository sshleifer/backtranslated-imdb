A mediocre, at best, horror movie starring dumb, not-so-hot teenagers discovering a nasty video game (GASP) kills those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This movie is the ongoing mystery of the mystery gang in "Scooby Doo". I waited for them to pull off a mask from one of the villains. I could handle it for 40 minutes, even as a movie in science fiction, but all the way to theaters, people come. The effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is a bit shabby two, but director Uwe Boll, as this would be his cast. As always, the great thing about video game systems is the amazing power button. I would suggest using this ad. * 1/2
