The only reason this show did not get 0 is that one is not available. This show has evolved from informative news to sensational claptrap. I tried to support this show in its decline because I like human stories and primetime had some very good ones. Unfortunately, April 21 has changed my mind about this show and the unethical newsreaders who attend it forever. In fact, ABC recorded a brutal case of child maltreatment and refused to show it until the limitation period expired and the parents could not be arrested for the charges they should have been subjected to. What made it worse was how ABC swept the whole thing under the carpet. Instead of taking responsibility and seeking genuine professional help for these troubled individuals, some pop psychologists have had to send strong warnings to the audience that they should not overestimate these poor angels. I was really sick. I hope this review will prevent a person from looking at this investigative trash in the future. If so, I will be happy. Nowadays, all you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the good people of Primetime Live are butt kissing with celebrity A-list celebrities and criminal acts praised and praised by the stars. Do not waste the hour of your life; You better watch an old sitcom at Nick in Nite.
