I am Mike Sedlak. I wrote the score for this movie. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some have not gone far enough. <br /> <br /> The film premiered in the summer of 1973 in San Francisco. The theater was full of friends and family. We all clapped. <br /> <br /> Five days later, it was pulled from all the screens in the Bay Area. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in hearing scenes from the scene, details Maybe the movie is even more fun, please let me know. <br /> <br /> We could start with the shot of Gideon Blake throwing the toilet butt in order to distract one of the evil followers who guard the radio transmitter on the deck of Bud's house. <br /> <br /> Or how Gideon scattered the bomb in the original version. <br /> <br /> Did not help. It is still bombed. <br /> <br /> Bring it up.
