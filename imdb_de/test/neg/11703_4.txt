Ghost Story has an interesting feminist revenge story, A-list veterans, colorful flashbacks with sophisticated, youthful counterparts of the old men. Creepy staccato music announcing the oncoming horrors, atmospheric winter weather in New England, and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role. Ghost Story could have been much more effective in black and white and could eliminate some of the grosser special effects to present a more convincing screenplay). The biggest drawback to the movie is Craig Wassan (definitely born separate from Bill Maher), maybe editing or just Bad action is completely ineffective. He seems to specialize in far-flung reaction shots. not much personality here. The revelation, however, is Alice Krige, pale, puzzling, terrifying under the quiet exterior. However, her Eva Galli is already scary even before she meets her fate. I mean, a young woman who says things like "I'd like to bite you" or "Dance with me, you little toad!" is not already in the land of the living. Ghost Story would have been much better in a low-key mode by Val Lewton. The exaggerated special effects completely undercut the chill factor.
