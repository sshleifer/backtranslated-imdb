After choosing Avalon (which was only decent because of the beautiful digital movies) and some anime movies written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic), I should have a look at the Oshii box for the trilogy of movies , Since the red glasses and the stray dog ​​are related, I will go into both here. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest waste of money I've spent for some time. I first saw Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. Sadly, I have to say that these movies are probably the most boring two movies I've ever seen. In each movie, you'll only see some action between the characters for about 10 minutes, dressed only for a few fleeting scenes in "Panzer Cop" outfits. The rest of the time you see some very lengthy scenes with boring dialogues in less than impressive locations. I do not understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the movies themselves leave much to be desired. I would suggest NOT to watch these movies, and certainly not buy the box set like mine, unless you enjoy wasting money. Oh, and if you're wondering what I think of the third film in the set, Talking Head, I could not even look at it before I remove the box set from eBay on eBay for $ 20 off my DVD collection have. If you want a cool Japanese live action, check out Returner or Ichii the Killer or the Zeiram series.
