Dark Harvest is a very low-budget production produced by a number of high-ranking amateurs who manage to appear as a semi-professional film. Unfortunately, the bad effects, wooden acting and unoriginal story make this a very mediocre horror slasher. By no means is Dark Harvest the worst horror movie I've ever seen. He is simply nothing special and has nothing to hope for a second watch or a sequel. You know that a director has doubts about his own horror film when a) there is a senseless nudity and b) the movie is so short that in the credits he adds some pretty boring clips that really do not interest anyone because the movie is not that way good is! A slightly better movie that I could not help was the inspiration for Dark Harvest. The eighties movie "Scarecrows" is an OK movie but still pretty average. <br /> <br /> Dark Harvest is not so bad Some of the other comments say that this is the case, but I do not think you will be entertained too much. One thing I have to comment on is the character of Angela, who has a really awful English accent! What was the point in it? Maybe to give him a certain class? Yes exactly! English people do NOT say "WAAHTAAH" when they say "water," and I do not care which part of England they come from! If you can not find a true English actress or a non-English actress who can put on a brilliant English accent (not many of them), then DO NOT BOTHER! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10
