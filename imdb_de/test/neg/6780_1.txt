I had high expectations for this movie (not like it's an Apocalypse or an 8 1/2, but high enough), and when I saw it on the cable, they were all broken. Starting with acting (poor, almost mediocre, an amazing waste of good actors and talents) and the story itself: Since when does a 5-man troop patrol in a supposedly "hot" zone? To suicide ?? A big mistake, that costs the movie expensive. Very good actors play very badly here, like Sean Penn, who recently repeated the irritating nature of talking about "I'm Sam," and Michael J. Fox is on average a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen on "Platoon." ". But the most irritating character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid waste of fine talent by the director). This was a cheesy, scared and insecure person who irritated even more than Jar Jar Binks. The combat sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with Michael J. Fox trapped with his feet in a VC tunnel. de Palma has a weak job here, and if it were not for movies like "Scarface" and "The Untouchables" (those excellent films), I would consider him a bluff director: too much advertising, bad filming. <br /> <br /> 3/10
