Bad cut, poor production values, poor continuity, implausible, bad dialogues ... these films are bad, bad, bad. However, if you want a movie to be fun (a la MST3000), this is your movie. I would not recommend spending a lot of money on it, but if you watch this movie, make sure it's played with a bunch of funny, like-minded buddies.
