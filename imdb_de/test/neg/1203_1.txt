I remember seeing this as a teenager for the first time in the 80s. Man, I've read the reviews on this garbage and am amazed by the vote. This movie does not deserve four stars !!! This movie is NOT better than topgun. Topgun has its own problems; Do not get me wrong This movie should only be banned for its own stupidity. So many clich√©s, so many loopholes, so MUCH bad dialogues. I can not imagine a single redeeming quality of this vomit. This is not an action / adventure. That's a bad joke in the movie. A bit like Plan 9 with F-16 footage. This film not only defies logic and common sense in the context of a military environment, it also sends a disturbing message. The military will not save your father from the imminent evil of the Middle East. So get out and kidnap a million-dollar weapon and knock it out of the dark clutches of the backward, anti-American Arabs. Because you can not argue with these animals. This is a Bruckheimer strip without budget. Sober direction, weak acting, lame music, idiotic plot, same ... Iron Eagle.
