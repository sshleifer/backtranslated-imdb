The Palestinian situation is for the filmmaker a fertile and still largely fallow ground. 'Divine Intervention' is trying very hard and gives us an insight into the almost surreal life of those who get into trouble, but the movie is little more than a handful of (admittedly adorable) image jokes thrown at the celluloid while the Connections between them become darker as the movie progresses. A missed opportunity to say something more coherent on a very current topic.
