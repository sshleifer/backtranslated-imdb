Minnesota Feeling, directed by Steven Baigelmann with Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio: The tense relationship between brothers Sam (D'Onofrio) and Jjaks (Reeves) collapses when Jjaks arrives at Sam marries and leaves with the bride, Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper who marries Sam to pay a gambling debt owed to nightclub owner Red (Lindo). Baigelman's writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess filled with hateful characters and lack of coherence. To put Keanu and Diaz into a movie should at least be a feast for the eyes, but Baigelman even gives a few points and wears down his actors with little positive effects. Very poor.
