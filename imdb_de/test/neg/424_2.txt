THE EXPERT with Jeff Speakman is the definition of DULL !!! Boring, characters, boring situations, boring director, boring actors, boring cinematography, boring music. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand this movie. Should it be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie, but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is below the average of a TV drama. There are some typical "Speakman Pummeling Bad Boys" scenes here and there, but the main aspect of the movie depends on a kind of believable drama that is completely wrong for Speakman or so poorly directed that it does not work with the movie Action Star. In the end, this confused film looks very unimpressive and bland. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is the music. The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith wannabe with his pompous and melodramatic score that just does not belong in this kind of (boring) movie. It's as if the producers knew they had a very boring product in their hands, and they asked the composer to make the film more compelling and dramatic with its score, making the entire movie even more confused, dull, and bleak. > <br /> Do not waste your time with it, even if you're a fan of Jeff Speakman.
