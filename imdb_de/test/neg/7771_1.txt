In 1970, feminists invaded London's beauty contest "Miss World" and brought an opportunity to stop by spraying the stage with flour and eggs. Why? Because they rightly or wrongly perceived the event as humiliating for women. I do not give any criticism of their actions. It is a free world in which we live. What I want to know is, why do not their modern counterparts penetrate the studios where shows like this are done and do? <br /> <br /> Sex & The City is all about four selfish New York women: Carrie is a fashion slave who turns into a pussycat when a guy just slaps her eyes Finding the perfect man (she does not exist, love) so that she can seduce the poor devil with sex, lawyer Miranda scolds the men by bringing nonsense like "out of touch with my feelings" and finally we have Samantha who Incarnation of the old Martini ad "anytime, anywhere, anywhere". Feminists consider these figures - especially Samantha - as a shining example of the modern woman. Well, when the shouting of rude words in busy restaurants is progress, feminists should take a long look at themselves and at what they should represent. <br /> <br /> If 'Sex & The City' had been The creation of a man would have been blown up for sexual reasons. Instead, as with "Charlie's Angels" - supposedly intelligent women - it has led them to believe that it was a positive force for good. The show has something very clinical and cold-blooded. 'The Benny Hill Show' was also sexist, but at least it was funny.
