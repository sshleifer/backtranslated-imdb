Ok, so my summary is a cheap trick. But the movie is full of it and it is praised absurdly, so ... <br /> <br /> I caught this on TV (uncut, since the TV shows all the movies, that's for you Americans who could say I would not have) I do not like it because I saw a cut TV version (luckily that's just a US thing) and had no idea what it was. I turned on, caught the last minutes of a show and the movie started. Within a minute I begged that it was a comedy, given the particularly ridiculous clich√© beginning (yes, it's a bad movie in the movie, I know, but how do you try to keep the viewer interested?) I do not even know why I did not change channels. And yes, the movie was actually a comedy, albeit an unwanted one. <br /> <br /> Marina Zudina is pretty enough, but what a terrible idea! While the cast of a foreigner in the role is wise (she does not speak so long of the language barrier), but, sorry, Marina Baby, Mute does not mean to play Harpo Marx. Her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments. Only watch her if she pulls an X in the air as she is being pursued by the killer. He wants to kill you, there is no time to play Zorro. We get a lot of things that "run up" to create suspense, like in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a rug and a villain shoot at the other. Pooh! Will Hollywood ever learn? The best / worst pearl, however, is to have electrocuted a guy in the bath and ... Well, I've never seen anyone who would be electrocuted in the bathtub, but I'm sure you would Can not see blue cartoon rays in real life, are you doing? And how about instantly trusting a mean-looking man because he SAYS he's a cop and does not ask him to show you his references? OK, he turns out to be a real cop. But not asking for the badge does not make sense (in terms of the plot, we could always think the credentials might be wrong, or he might be a fake policeman.) Screenwriting 101). And how about the big turn? Do not tell me you did not see that 200 miles away ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the poor old Alec Guinness and his useless stock footage cameo. Now I'm thinking about what's the meaning of attributing a Mystery Guest Star editor to him ... in the END titles? The movie is over, there's no secret, and everyone and his brother have identified Guinness (even non-filmies will recognize "the old man of" Star Wars. ") Better yet, we can pretend it's not The late great actor People often compare that to Hitchcock, I suppose it must be John Hitchcock, the milkman, because the late Sir Alfred would feel embarrassed to see it, let alone make it This is a 6.8 / 10 ???? It is Bottom 100 material, but we are talking about a rating system that allows "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" to appear as the third best movie ever made ( see Top 100), so ... <br /> <br /> 2/10.
