A group of young adults gives the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory an escape route when reciting her poem from a videogame supposedly a s√©ance. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg), who is found as dead as he was killed in this video game. While the characters of the others did not die in the videogame, reciting their poem has instead realized the video game with realized CGI characters stalking and killing each of them in turn. You must follow certain methods with a mirror and nails to defeat Bathory and save her skin. <br /> <br /> If this premise is stupid, it's because it's her. The characters are Ho-Hum rejections of bad WB television programs that were allowed to spit out madness this time around. This strip follows the slasher rules, but does not show much violence and blood. PG-13 remains safe and most of the death takes place off-screen. There's a scene where the real hero and the heroine run in front of the video game characters they're chasing. Yes, that's so bad. Nothing to recommend. Good looking cast including Sophia Bush as the named October.
