I can easily get through most of the films, even if I do not like the movie very well. I'm the guy who recognizes great movies, even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. Acting is okay (Myers is as good as the cat, it's just that he's really annoying). The stupid songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even to the children in the audience. The action continues to retreat and the audience must suffer from bad dialogue. The "funny" parental remarks are disgusting and not funny (I remember a terrible comment about a garden hoe being compared to a person called "ho"). Although the movie is really short, it seemed to last forever. Do not waste your time. I know little kids who hated this movie. If children do not like it, I do not know how adults can do it. I'd like to say more about this movie, but I do not even want to waste time writing this review. I HATE IT! In summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! Watch a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest rating I've ever given in a movie.
