8 days no script, it says on the DVD, how the movie was made. It is recorded in blurry videos that are occasionally used with good effect, but they are really partially naked women who sit in a room most of the time. It's played very well and that helps a lot. However, the killer only appears once and the girls / women sit and complain that they are not trying to escape or do anything interesting enough so that the whole thing stops after about 20 minutes. Would have been a good short film, maybe even powerful. Even for eight days they do very little. Why? Because they did not have a script. How many movies were made without scripts? Not too much. I wonder why that is. How many great films have been made from bad scripts. Not too much. Why this? The direction is trying against this main problem and does some interesting things, but with what is essentially nothing. Girls shot in dark, grainy, colorless videos will stay for some time, but not for the short but too long game length. Actors in turn deserve praise if only a script were available. <br /> <br /> Also, the video quality or lack of it is really low, they try to use it and sometimes they watch some footage of which they are from Miami Vice, the latest movie. But that should not compliment Miami Vice or this failed endeavor.
