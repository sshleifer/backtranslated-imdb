"Menace" is not funny. It's hard - too hard. but rarely brings a smile. There is no acting, just raiding. One of the main characters wears a stupid grimace throughout the movie. No doubt, when Wayan's less talented brothers played, wrote and produced the film, they were completely blind to their lack of talent. Menace is a series of funny joke skits. The punch line is a mile away, but you have to wait for it to unfold. No brisk ones or lively dialogues. Just one scene after another to joke. The jokes themselves are teen. Loc Dog (the one with the Perma grimace) talks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath and then she snaps her nose and then waits for it (you always have to pay attention to w-a-i-t), she fart! How funny is that? Ten-year-old boys may find it funny because they have not heard the jokes so often. Alternatively, if you want to watch movies that are completely drunk or stoned, you can follow them and even find them amusing. The challenge is to become so drunk that the mental state is reduced to the level of the film without fainting.
