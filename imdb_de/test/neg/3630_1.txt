Blond main character, always believes in everyone and if you stay together, you can do EVERYTHING! The shy guy, the best friend with curly hair (rip-off of Gordo), wants to be a film director who secretly falls in love with Zoey. Spanish best friend (Rip off Miranda) Strange smart girl Quinn (rip-off from Lary Tudgemen) and the popular preparation for preparation Logan (rip off Kate) And Zoey's little brother Max, annoying (rip off Matt) <br /> Zoey is the most popular girl with 2 best friends. The only thing missing is the funny little sacastic cartoon that Lizzie McGuire has, and Hillary Duff was a lot cuter. Jamie Lynn Spears looks more like a toothpick in a tube top.
