I was just cautiously thrilled when I rented "All the boys love Mandy Lane," since I immediately remembered hearing and reading a variety of opinions. both positive and negative? in the short space of time between his brief cinematic release and the distribution towards video store shelves. Supposedly, this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror movie in years, with non-stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable twists. Okay, the basic concept may sound reasonably innovative, but the script inevitably quickly returns to the same old and irritating Slasher clich√©s. Once this point is crossed, even the chic stylistic hallmarks can not save the movie from the dreadful mediocrity. The opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bathed in a melancholy-melancholic ambiance, which makes it all the more painful as the movie sinks toward the "normal" level of the rudimentary Slasher strip. After the sublime intro, in which a drunken macho child breaks his leap from a rooftop to impress the enchanting beauty, "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" turns out to be another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic children stoned and horny on a remote ranch before being killed by a not-so-unknown maniac. The movie's whole overbearing film set-up breaks down faster than a shaky house of cards: we'll never get a real explanation why Mandy behaves so coolly and haughtily over her admirers (perhaps because she grew up to be an orphan?) Oh, boo-hoo ), the guys show soon enough that they would be content with any bimbo and not exclusively with the "divine" Mandy and the final twist with sex. though undeniably uncommon? is just pointless. The midsection of is pretty boring and does not even offer a really terrible fuss (shotgun murders? Please!) Or an authentic, rancid shit. My generous rating of 4 out of 10 refers entirely to the grainy and disconcerting 70's style of film (with faded colors, bizarre but beautiful photographic images?) And the surprisingly wonderful soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levine opted for the classic Bobby Vinton song "Sealed with a Kiss" to play during the trailer and the credits, while at first I was convinced that the movie inevitably created the cheesy love song "Mandy" by Barry Manilow would contain.
