THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. They think, "Ah, it's a crappy Hong Kong movie." You know what - it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it's shitty. This amazingly stupid Jackie Chan movie that was ruined by us, yes we, the Americans (I'm cooking with trouble, ooh, I think I'm jumping out the window!), Has Chan as a New York cop chasing a gang, Avenge the death of his friend. Sounds cool, but it is not. Do not waste your money by renting it. To prove that he could make a better police movie, Chan created the amazing POLICE STORY (1985).
