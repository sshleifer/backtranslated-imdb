I was quite excited when I saw this movie at the Montreal Film Festival competition. Together with Elephant and a few others, I thought that the issue of American gun violence / culture would be addressed in an intelligent and captivating way. The press release promised (not in so many words) a "red violin" for the amount of rifle violence that should cause us to think about our NRA attitude in this country. <br /> <br /> After waiting for a 9 AM screening after 9:15 am (which technical difficulties they could not have prepared for me), we were finally taken to the venue to air the movie on DV see (where did the advertised 35mm print go?). , I think I have just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is a disgusting mess. We get the "weapon" in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker" I've ever seen (and I know more than a few). The movie then falls into an irrelevant "character development" just because the characters are either one. Stereotypes, B. losers, C. stereotypical losers, or racial cartoons It takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement, and once we get there, we want the mindless conversations between the couple and / or the biker and pawnbrokers. <br /> <br /> The film concludes, but without leaving a clich√© unchecked: I was not interested in the white trash characters who came into contact with the weapon and the depiction of The Minority Characters immediately yell the NAACP foul. All of these people would be chasing a weapon as they would be at the bottom of the social garbage heap and looking for an opportunity wherever it was found would have at least done some soul searching on the part of the characters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the unfulfilled promise. The plot was great. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt, it could have been a powerful piece. But either because of a bad script, one direction, or both, the thing is an incomparable mess that needs to be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My bigger question is who on the MFR thought this was competitive. Bury this better on Showtime at 3 o'clock in the morning. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
