I've just seen Coronado ... The only line they wanted to sell here is "from the FX team behind Independence Day." I think that says a lot. No talk about writers, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> It's a cute little adventure story in a banana republic in Central America, but the plot is thin. <br /> <br /> Everything Throughout the movie, I've been thinking about how much this movie looks like the scenes of an action computer game. Although the FXs are beautiful, they are all too often visible. Similar to CG style cut scenes like Command'n'Conquer. <br /> <br /> You know almost immediately that this truck, the scenery, the bridge, the castle or the jet fighter never existed. The look is smooth and beautiful, but does not meet the standard we expect from Action Adventures today. The film lacks obvious filming on location. <br /> <br /> The acting is below average and the effects are nice, but not on the feature film standard. I'm not surprised that this thing was directly transferred to Video / DVD. <br /> <br />
