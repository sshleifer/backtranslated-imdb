Beware, My Lovely (1952) Director: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: The Filmmakers / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> The unbelievable thriller from the pioneering producer team of Collier Young and Ida Lupino, aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino not in the credits). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is the "danger" and Ida Lupino is the "woman" in this entry in the movie "Woman in danger". Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a hard-core psychotic artisan (noooo, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupino is the lonely warswitcher Helen Gordon who hired Howard to work in her home. From there it goes downhill as Howard makes Helen a prisoner in her own home. <br /> <br /> Howard has a bad secret, not that he could reveal it. You know, consciousness is a real challenge for him. That is, it remains. He has an unfortunate habit of finding his employer dead. This is part of the problem of the movie. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that even in 1918 (when the movie was filmed) he was able to move unhindered from city to city. He can not remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent, menacing, antisocial tendencies are triggered by the smallest and most common things (a young girl flirts, inadequacies related to the war because he was rejected for service). I do not know how he survived the interview with Helen at all. There are other implausibilities. If you were locked up in your house with a madman, but left alone for some time, could not you find a way to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan, I think, is defeated by the material. It feels like he's overcharging his hand. His series of tics and spasms and the heavily bundled outbreaks of dementia have done everything they've done. By this time in his career, he had probably played that character ten times, and that shows. We are encouraged to be in Howard (I do not empathize) with the portions of humanity shown, such as being stopped in his tracks by a music box, and his relationship with a group of children who do not condemn him. Lupino just has to be alienated and in distress, which she is more than capable of. <br /> <br /> The picture had one thing; What would be the final solution to the conflict? Of course, there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /> <br /> Of slight interest was a recurrent theme in which the camera would pick up Howard's reflection (mirror, water, Christmas tree decoration). This indicated that something was going on in his head or was about to happen. Horner (Vicki from 1953), who has made a name for himself in production design, makes the house like a prison. Thanks also to the always reliable RKO Art Department for working at the house. In the end, a below-average job from the clients, who all have much better films. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
