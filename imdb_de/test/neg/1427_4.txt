I had seen that as a kid, but since I was not a big fan of Jerry Lewis, I had completely forgotten it (not that it somehow remains in my memory). The film is about impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum in every comic star!) - in this case a German officer - and, although not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (there is a BOMB rating), it's not exactly classic either - certainly behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), albeit comparatively narcissistic! Ironically, before the crazy general's appearance, the scenes are more lucky than the more enforced humor at the Nazi's expense! <br /> <br /> The movie was really Lewis's last breath during his heyday; In fact, this was his last vehicle released in 10 years (it is painfully obvious that his special kind of stupidity would not work out in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
