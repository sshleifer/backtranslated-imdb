I have seen about an hour of this movie (against my will) and could not finish it. I would rate it as 0 The writing was bad, the plot predictable, and one that was done far too often. The most annoying part of this movie was the acting of Melody Thomas Scott. This part did not ask for someone who appeared snobbish, but in every scene I saw, she managed to be like a (sour) snob or someone who wanted to spit out something extremely sarcastic or cruel. <br /> <br /> The two romances that seemed almost serious at the couple meeting were a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I should know better than to watch movies made for TV movies. If there is absolutely nothing on TV and this is the only option, read a book.
