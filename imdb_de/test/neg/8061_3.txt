One of the most notorious of the banned "video nasties" of the 1980s is also one of the most overly hyped. "Make Them The Slowly" is about what to expect from a Umberto Lenzi-led jungle potboiler - original (poorly rendered) domestic torture techniques, some ridiculous "social commentary" (yes, even more stupid than "Cannibal Holocaust") and many guts are chewed. The exploitative power of the film, however, is often shown only in a short close-up and has never lingered very long, which reduces its effect (interpret it the way you like it). The dialogue is Lenzi's usual stupidity, as our male heroes show their affection for women by calling them "tw @ t" and the like. The cast of familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) does their best in the face of escalating idiocy (including a completely ridiculous "castration conservation"), but can not save this overworked, lousy person's effort.
