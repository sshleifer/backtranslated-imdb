This could be the worst movie I have ever seen. I knew it was a B-movie before I saw it (that was why), but I never thought it could be that bad. The title promises Dracula in space and delivers, but the story makes no sense that Casper van Dien's character is a descendant of Van Helsing. And pay attention to the end of the film, it comes quickly to you. I have never seen an end screaming. "And now we have exceeded the budget!" clearer. Their dissolution of the film, however, was quite funny, the story had painted so obviously in a corner. If you feel like you need to see it, look it up to a friend who shares your love for B-movies. If not, I would not have made it to the end.
