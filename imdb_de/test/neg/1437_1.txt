I do not recommend you to watch this movie if you are easily insulted. I'm not even offended and this movie frustrated me. It is so disgusting. And it makes no sense. The whole Internet is a clich√© and the producer obviously did not understand all the "internet rules". When you chat with someone, you can track their IP address. "Really?" (see the sarcasm here). It was stupid. Futile. And I have not even seen the end. I could always say "that makes no sense, that neither ..." Nice comment, right?
