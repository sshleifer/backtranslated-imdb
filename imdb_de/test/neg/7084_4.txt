This movie has a lot of action and little heart. For a minute, let's forget that almost every aspect of the Russian Revolution goes wrong - after all, we have only an hour or so to tell our story. The Tsar abdicated after the First World War as a disaster, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now back to our story. Here the revolution is "rumored" in Russian newspapers, in a seemingly functioning country, until the violence suddenly breaks out and the life of nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki comes to life' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.). He flees his house with his former servant Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in tow, and in Constantinople they begin a new life. Before the revolution, the baron regularly got used to playing a game for the girl, not out of a genuine passion, but out of boredom as a distraction. The revolution does not change that and he keeps trying to use the apparently simple girl. It certainly does not make the audience feel like playing with it that way. Tanyusha follows the baron because she literally has no place after the revolutionaries took over the baron's house, and she knew no other life than waiting for Nikki's hand and foot. In Constantinople, Nikki quickly became tired of being a destitute worker, and then met his former lover, the Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who had a plan to take her to Paris, where the Czarists gathered after the revolution. Unfortunately, Vera's plan does not include her for Tanyusha. <br /> <br /> This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with the little she gets, but that's not much. Lilyan Tashman is the challenger here, although as a Russian vampire she plays only a minor role. Lilyan has been starring as often as here, but her earthy voice and glamorous look make her the center of attention in every scene she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows himself humorous as an American tourist, curious about Russian rule, forcibly expelled from her homeland.
