I had high hopes for this production and was one of my favorite works. <br /> <br /> In fact, a lot of it is reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but lacks the devilry that the original character is infused with. Many of the minor characters are good, and the Scottish settings are excellent. <br /> <br /> The big disappointment for me is Jason Connery in the title role: He seems to read his lines with a wrong card from a cue card glasses - certainly for the first time. He can do so much better. Any production compared to the sublime Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979), who in my opinion was the gold standard, will be hard to appreciate, but I really fell asleep and had to rewind it before I could get through - barely a great sign. <br /> <br /> Frankly, one thing to avoid.
