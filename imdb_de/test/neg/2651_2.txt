Harrison Ford plays Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck of the District of Columbia Police Department. He tries to get the bad guys, but he does not do a good job. When we meet him, he tries to catch a corrupt undercover officer. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire Senator, Kay Chandler, who tries to be re-elected. She competes against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing she needs is the death of her husband. She is a politician - she can not settle on feelings. <br /> <br /> This story is moving slowly and painfully. I looked at my watch every five minutes and wondered when it would be over. The story is lost in details, the director Sydney Pollack did not have to bring. We do not want to know about the investigation of the police in Holland. They give the politicians insight and the "spin control" for campaigns. After watching the movie, I still wonder why they got involved romantically. Does not someone mourn anymore? Do not you need to consider longer than two weeks to go horizontal with another person? <br /> <br /> It was good to see actress, comedian, Chicago girl and Second City alumni Bonnie Hunt. Her role is not necessarily a funny relief, but she was the only one I wanted to see more of. Do yourself a favor, wait for the video if you want to see it at all.
