It's all my fault. They all told me that I should not see this movie because I'm a big fan of the old TV series. You were right. While the production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "Do not Look Now"), Julie Christie is not so bad, the entire film shows a cheeky and confident, which is clearly without justification. I think of a comparison between the "Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" by Karloff. In fact, Belphegore owes 2000 new Mummy movies much more than the old series. But then the scripting is awful, there is no speed and sometimes the movie is full of unintentional jokes (the first scene in the grave just looks stupid), with cats obviously being thrown if they are to jump (landing first with the hind foot)). Belphegore moves like a statue on wheels, neither impressive nor scary. The psychological drama that developed in the old TV series when the heroine learned she was a villain is completely neglected. This movie is so wasted (wasted money, wasted actor, wasted blueprint) that it hurts. It's a minor mummy rip-off that's good for just a few laughs but has nothing to do with the Greco classic (she also has a small role in this movie - in the cemetery).
