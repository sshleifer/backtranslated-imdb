The two most notable things about "I Will not Play" are: It was awarded the Oscar for best 1944 short two-roll short film; and it was headed by the leading man of the silence era, Crane Wilbur. The plot of this ordinary short film is insignificant, the dialogue lacks spark, while the drama is no better and no worse than what can be found in most Hollywood films of the war years of the 1940s (in other words, it is dreadful) . Admittedly, there are moments when "I Will not Play" is funny - Janis Paige's totally artificial look and line delivery are precious - but you laugh at the picture, not with it.
