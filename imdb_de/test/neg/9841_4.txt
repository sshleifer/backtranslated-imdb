"Stick Around" is one of the short series of films that brought Bobby Ray and Oliver 'Babe' Hardy together before Hardy's immortal team worked with Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy - the immature little man and the overbearing big man - were a prototype for Laurel and Hardy, but that's just not true. Ray and Hardy are playing well, but they are not a team. In each of these films, Ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero, while Hardy harasses him in a manner very similar to the later treatment of "Stanley" by his later "ollie" character. It's very clear that the relationship between the little Bobby and the big babe was inspired by earlier Chaplin movies in which the little tramp was bullied by the giant Mack Swain or the burly Eric Campbell. However, in "Stick Around", Hardy wears a melon that is identical to his later "Ollie" (though he has a fuller mustache), and he and Bobby end up having the most of this Films spent as opponents, as drunken comrades. <br /> <Bobby is a paperhanger for the company Matz und Blatz, with Hardy as boss. When the belated Bobby wants to pretend that he has appeared promptly, there is a smart physical business between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton in 'The Garage'. A little later, Bobby Ray - whose short acting career has never developed a solid personality - performs an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for Stan Laurel as he pulls a long stepladder out of a much smaller toolkit /> The Paperhangers working in a sanatorium, and there are the usual unrealistic representations of mental illness: a resident insists on sitting on a toast piece because he thinks he is a poached egg! There are also some howling racist (and tasteless listless) jokes involving a black man forcing the inmates to break walnuts on his head. If he sees a picture of a lion - not even a picture, you know - he's cowardly, as if it's a wild animal. <br /> <br /> "Stick Around" is pretty bleak. Most of the pantomime and acting is much wider than it must be for a slapstick comedy; Even Hardy, already in 1925 a very subtle actor, pong bad with his over-function here. There are several bad examples of shot matching. I was struck by an unusual camera shot when the face of a fat pedestrian is dirty and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror rather than his actual face. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS COMING. During the short pairing, Hardy typically played Ray's boss or opponent or both. Here they end up exceptionally as a buddy. It's a nice ending, but it does not make up for the really bad movie. My rating is only 4 out of 10.
