Let's cut everything in the first paragraph. "The Messengers", the latest movie by the Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror movie, is profoundly bad. And like a movie, that's a big disappointment. It is nothing more than a rehashed "Sixth Sense" and as long as this picture is still available, there is no reason on earth to pay money to see this turkey. Recent horror / slasher films such as The Final Destination series, Wrong Turn, Boogie Man, The Ring 2, and The Grudge are increasingly reliant on large, no-profit shocks jumps something at the person she's currently on The screen gets a breath out of the audience, but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something.) Little is it about making a real scary experience, like " The Sixth Sense "or" Signs "or something of the classic horror movies of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. <br /> <br /> "The Messengers" relies on the same old, tired stereotypes as these newer, far inferior movies and is therefore old, tired and - to my surprise - ended up being one of the most boring movies I've had in a long time have seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has another stupid family, led by Papa Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), Mother Denise (Penel, Ann Miller, "Awakenings", "Kindergarten Cop," "TV Series "Desperate Housewives"), the big sister Jess (Kristen Stewart, "Zathura: A Space Adventure") and the toddler Ben (Evan Turner), who move from North Dakota to North Dakota Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason The move is never really described here, but it has something to do with the father's inability to find work, and Jess's drunken antics.We know there's going to be trouble right away, because in the middle of nowhere, there's a big gothic Home, a domicile that looks like the Minster's summerhouse Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show that something really terrible has happened, Jess hates the place (hey, who could blame her for that), but the optimistic Pop hopes to raise the sunflowers (despite the unusually large amount of crows fluttering around). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Raising Helen" and Kevin Costner in the film version of "My Name Is Earl"), a hiker and sunflower breeding expert, things start to catch up. <br /> <br /> But then strange things happen; Jess is being terrorized by a violent, invisible violence in the house (of course no one except Ben two-year-old can see it, so she called a flake), and the crows are hanging around. Ben can also discover the supernatural creatures, but since he is two years old, he can not articulate it. Scene after scene, where people told the little boy to tell them what he sees, I finally wanted to scream to the screen, "He can not tell you, he's two - crazy '- years old!" Yes, the only protagonist who can solve all these things when a dumb toddler is really smart. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we have to think about the sanity of Jess. when and if Ben will ever properly describe the paranormal visions he sees; when Daddy gets the Sunflower thing working; if the drifter of the plateau is a good or bad person; What is the point of the George Plimpton realtor? how a pitchfork dipped in the back can only be a flesh wound; What is the mother's role in the family? and where do all the crows come from? <br /> <br /> All this while you wait and wonder if anything - anything - should happen. The conclusion is also really lame and raises again the question of how a mind that has no physical body can do harm to a living person. Very boring, pointless and most terrible of all, not the least frightening. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are many crows in this movie.
