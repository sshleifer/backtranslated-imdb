SPOILER <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> That's Tenchi? <br /> This is not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Practically everyone is terribly written out of character ... When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko. Nor is the villainy punished for her actions, which equate to rape by thought control. If a male villain had done to one of the women what Haruna did to Tenchi, then he would (rightly) have painfully bought at the end of the film and would have died terribly, and the audience could have cheered. But not only does not Haruna pay for her crimes, Ryoko actually FORGIVES and UNDERSTANDs her actions. No! The real ryoko would have dissolved her for what Haruna had done to her beloved Tenchi; the audience with whom I saw this, including myself, all audibly listened to this scene of <br /> <br /> anime fans, avoid this movie. Tenchi fans, avoid this movie even more difficult.
