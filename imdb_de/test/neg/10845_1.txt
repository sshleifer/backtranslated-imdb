I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I've ever spent. It's LAME! I could not believe how they could come to this. <br /> <br /> The plot ... there is no action. Everything you would expect will only happen in a worse way. The acting was terrible. My dog ​​could have done better. The special effects have no effect - except that they are completely disbelieving. And the cheesy lines ... I mean, why bother? <br /> <br /> The only appreciation I can give this piece are the opening scenes. They were actually pretty pretty. And one of the reasons why I decided to rent this. The graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic CG of the entire film. <br /> <br /> Total Reality gets 1 out of 10 because it is unable to lower it.
