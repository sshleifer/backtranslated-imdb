This movie stinks more than Limburger cheese! If you find this at a flea market, leave it there! I love Sandra Bullock and hate this movie ... Although I am ashamed, I have a copy and the studio has changed the cover to include Sandra Bullock at all. They play it as "A Sandra Bullock Movie". She has only a small role in the entire film and she does her best, but she is young and had not yet learned her talent. Well, everyone has to start somewhere ...
