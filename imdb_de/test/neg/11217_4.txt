This is the first porno I have ever tried to review. It takes a different approach than usual, as the allegory will not reward the dissection. "I am American, I am a prudish virgin." "We are Europeans, we are cultured and sex-horny." "It's nice if we all screw each other together." Much to tell! Well, somehow there is anyway relative to your average 60s volleyball number. And the impressive patina of 'class' at least provides clear, detailed compositions. But what is this porn? OK then: The only scene in which I really (rhetorically) dropped out, was the first time that Brigitte Maier came in. The one black man suffers a premature onset of editorial coitus Interruptus. And several takes or not, a potentially indescribable IMDb action looks as if it was partially simulated by a surgical tube. Nevertheless, I stayed awake and it was eight in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean?
