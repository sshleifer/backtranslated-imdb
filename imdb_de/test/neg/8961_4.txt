A group of unpleasant city dwellers settle down in Le Touquet for a week. Stories intertwine, characters fight, make friends, cheat each other, have sex ... Blanc has assembled an outstanding cast for his adaptation of Connolly's book, but not enough success. What should be weird is instead boring and irritating. All the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the farce of things, this viewer was given little thought of what's going on with one of them Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard, but that's about it. And Dutronc looks like he exaggerated the nips and wedges if you ask me ...
