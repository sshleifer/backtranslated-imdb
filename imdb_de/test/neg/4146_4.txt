I can not believe this is a movie I did not like. , , Normally, I think I'm open-minded about anything. , , But this strip is just good, bad. <br /> <br /> I could look into the topic if the script and the story were better. I could go into acting if the camera work was better or the characters were better established. , , I think it depends mainly on the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> It was just bad. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this the lowest rating, but. , , I do not think so, at least that guy has cut his tail off to make a movie. , , so he gets four stars (just over the average rating, this has so far)
