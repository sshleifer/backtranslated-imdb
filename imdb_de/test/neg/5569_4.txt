I really wanted to like this movie because it's refreshingly different from the horde of horror films in everyday life, and I guess the filmmakers are looking for something original. Unfortunately, the plot simply did not stick together and none of the characters was so sympathetic that I could really take care of them or their fate. <br /> <br /> Visually, The Toybox was pretty interesting. The director has taken some risky steps, such as adding small (flash-looking) animations and refreshing some of the special effects (such as the light of a particular amulet). Sometimes that worked and sometimes not, but he deserves Kudos for the try, and the cinematography was generally of high quality. Unfortunately, if this approach throws many things on the wall, see which sticks were applied to the drawing, the results were not very good. The film never really finds a tone he likes and moves schizophrenically from the black comedy, the family soap opera to the '80s witch film, the children's nostalgia, to a troubled family. By itself, pieces and parts of each of these elements work quite well, but nothing fits into a satisfying whole. Moreover, large parts of the action are never really explained. I'm not the one who likes to spoon everything, and I like movies where the decision is left to the audience, but the parts left out by The Toybox just seem like they have no money before more You could explain it or they did not really think twice. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the director's next project as I believe there are a lot of talents below the surface, but I can not really recommend The Toybox.
