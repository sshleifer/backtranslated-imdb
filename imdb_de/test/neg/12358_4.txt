I captured this movie in the Lifetime Movie Network last night titled "What Lies Above" and just commented on it. Designed as an imaginative action-packed yarn, it's so unintentionally funny (especially thanks to Marc Singer's scenery playing hamming hymns) that I thought I was looking at a cross between "Cliffhanger" and "Home Alone" at 5. "The Heroine Nicole Eggert makes them heinous, but stupid when the male pursuers look like the Three Stooges who fall victim to their ridiculous makeshift booby traps (somehow she manages to construct a swinging battering ram with a rope and a log within minutes, which temporarily taking one out of the ankle heads that want to kill her.) It's worth looking for a hearty laugh.
