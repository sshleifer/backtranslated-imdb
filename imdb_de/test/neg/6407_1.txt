The movie starts well, it has something to offer. About 1/3 of the movie goes downhill. Carrey starts obsessing from number 23 because he sees her everywhere. So what? That's no reason to go crazy and write things all over his body and walls. <br /> <br /> The acting by anyone who plays his son is bad. As soon as he learns of the obsession of his father, he jumps on the car and is hysterical. Absolutely unbelievable. I hope I never see this kid again in another movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time to watch this movie. Grab another one. Boring piece ... well. The number kills him? Give me a break. I will not spoil the end for you, but let's just say it's just as disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
