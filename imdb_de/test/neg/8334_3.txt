When the movie started, I felt that this would be something special. The acting and camerawork was undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have sympathized with them. The movie had a good atmosphere and there was a touch of fantasy. <br /> <br /> However, as the movie progressed, the plot never seemed to go down and only roll scene after scene. I could not understand the connection between the stories. All I could see were the characters, who occasionally came into contact with each other, and hints at bottles in bottles. Without this connection I had only a few inconspicuous short stories. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that things went so well in Cannes
