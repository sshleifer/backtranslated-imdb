Do not see this movie It's ... repugnant! The start is very good, but in the middle everything falls and I really regret to have spent 80 kroner (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to win people's interest. Nice picture! The only bright spot is the great work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> I hope you seek my advice ... The picture is garbage.
