It's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good production values ​​and decent action. There is good work here. Unfortunately they suffer from the problems of modern gay cinema. recycled acts, too familiar devices (I've seen the "pool" play too much in gay men's movies too much) and hackneyed scripts. Most annoying of all is "Dorothy," whose absurd premise is that a sweet young man will have trouble dressing in New York because there are few gay guys around him. Shorts play like little gay afternoon specials , Not much imagination when writing or performing; Basically, they follow a point-and-shoot, shot / reaction shot / master shot convention that gets painfully boring after about five minutes. In the works of Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late great Marlon Riggs there is hope for a queer cinema ... but not here. These films are unbelievably medium in size, unique to white bread, and their values ​​essentially evoke a gay bourgeois sensibility. That's probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.
