In his feature film debut "Yellow," Chris Chan Lee attempts to elucidate Hollywood's depiction of Asian Americans by deviating from the stereotypes common in mainstream film. However, Lee commits a much more vile crime: he exaggerates the Americans' own stereotypes in Asia to disbelief. The result? Terrible one-dimensional characters and an outrageously flat script trigger the cast into a madness of excessive acting, ultimately leading to a movie that's physically painful when you see positive reviews by 'yellow'; Everyone falls into one of two camps. In one corner (for example, here at imdb.com) you'll find Asian Americans who are so thrilled that an Asian character without thick glasses and a math book can be displayed on screen, neglecting the idiocy of Lee's end product , On the other hand, there are film critics who have simply assumed that it would not be cool to give "Yellow" the thorough beating it deserves; After all, this is a edgy Asian-American film, which was made by an independent Asian-American filmmaker ... initially protected area. <br /> <br /> Case study: main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). The author / director Lee does a monumental performance with Sin, editing 'Yellow' so that Sin never appears on the screen unless he's either scowling or screaming. See how Sin declines the support of his friends. Scowl. See Sin walking along the beach and brooding. Scowl. (Crying follows.) See how Sin closes his father's shop. Scowl. See Sin urinate. Scowl. See Sin breathing. Scowl. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Sin is full of Asian-American fear. Do you think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Scowl. <br /> <br /> To be thorough, Lee introduces us to Sin's father Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the movie, while Sin just looks dark or screaming, Mr. Lee * and * scolds. In fact, this is Woon's main role in 'Yellow': simultaneous grunts and roar. I wonder if Woon is an Asian father with an authority complex. Do you think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Yell. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional characters do not annoy you, this will be his story. Get to know Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), two characters who are used exclusively in this film to create a tangential and completely irrelevant love story in the film. Lee learned in film school that every good movie must contain a love-related subtext, and these two characters allow him to fulfill the commitment. In Mina and Joey's agonizing flirtation talk, one-liners insults culminate with a kiss: `Nerd! '; "Stupid Head!"; (Eyes meet); (Understanding smile); (Kissing follows). <br /> <br /> But rest assured, Sin is scowling somewhere while this happens. <br /> <br /> That neither Mina nor Joey in any way contribute to it The plot of the movie does not baffle me as much as Lee's insistence on the most deceptive film clichés insists on reaching his followers. And believe me, the flirting sequence is just the tip of the iceberg. At the end of the film, we try to try Woon Lee, Sins girlfriend Teri (Mia Suh), in which I was sure that Lee was a poignant moment. What a surprise: When Woon calls a metaphorical homeland story to illustrate his point of view, which has been torn right out of Reader's Digest, his voice trembles in that special paternal way. The camera shows a compulsory shot of Teri's shaking hands. We feel compelled to roll our eyes, unless we realize that Woon's explanation makes no sense whatsoever. But the lack of substance has not stopped Lee from making the film. Why should he cut this particularly ineffective scene? After all, the world can always use a different cliché. <br /> <br /> Well, you say the movie can be painful, but at least * he * has to be a technical masterpiece - like "What Dreams" Could come. ' Sorry, also technically disappointed 'Yellow'. Lee's edits are uncomfortable and disrupt the little rhythm that exists in the movie, but I'm sure Lee thought they looked hip. In addition, each image is either under- or overexposed. Although the light meter was invented in 1932, the novel technology did not manage to get the yellow set. Given the film's utter deficiency, actor Burt Bolos, who is Sins best singer friend Alex, works relatively well. Although Bolos seems a bit over the top, you can not really blame him when Lee's script is just a smirk and a roar. Bolos' Castmates, however, show no restraint in their exaggerated behavior. <br /> <br /> I have not seen such a bad movie like "Yellow" in a long time. And I sincerely pray that I will not see a movie as bad as "Yellow" for a long time. Please do not waste it. life is too short. Many Thanks.
