In the 90s it seems common to play with clichés. Some can do it with great talent. Hervé Hadmar not. On paper, however, the film looked interesting: the weak plot could be saved by great moments of comedy, dark humor and a very "décalé" style. Director Hadmar unfortunately kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarrassing because nobody in the theater reacts. The movie is incredibly slow and the actors seem to wonder what the hell they are doing in this ridiculous mascarade. What could have been a stylish, funny, mindless comedy is a cathedral of boredom.
