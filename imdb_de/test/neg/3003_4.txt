"What symbolism!" exclaimed a woman as we left the theater after seeing the Polish sister in front of Ingmar Bergman. Some symbolism is fine. But not much. "Northfork" blends into a fine acting weakened by murky cinematography that makes no coherent statements and makes a kinky story that irritates rather than delights. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a city in operation for extinction after a new dam. It's the early to mid-50s and a squad of identically dressed state agents, all looking like they've just answered a casting call for The Untouchables. Their task is to relocate unruly inhabitants who do not appreciate both their immediate danger and the offered premium for moving. An exciting anti-development film is always a possibility, but let us be real: Rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in creating decent living conditions and a stronger economy in American history. Dams can be built without forced removal? Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this film is less about the plight of the homeowner than a fantastic creation of the fleeting imagination of a dying boy. Nick Nolte is the priest who takes care of the boy, and much of what he says would have been interesting if the tone was clear enough to hear "Land if the dam creates this valuable area" and a phantasmagoric collection of Crazy, the film develops neither thematically coherent nor interesting. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is bad. A washed-out, subdued and depressive color pervades the entire film for less dramatic purposes. There is no reason why this vast terrain is so bleak. In fact, a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and sombre firmness of developing dams and power plants would have been very effective. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
