It's true, no one really expects anything from sequels. But even with this low standard, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this fourth part of the Hellraiser saga is an anthology movie time. An ambitious idea. But none of the performers have enough time to engage with his characters, and rookie director Yagher has given up on the film instead of surrendering to the studio. The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys find difficult to defend. If you are not an "Alan Smithee" fan, avoid it.
