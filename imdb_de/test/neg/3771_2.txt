This overheated "Mellerdramer" from the south of the gothic has some decent moments - but too often he is spoiled by a new director who puts a cliché on a cliché and a star who has apparently decided to make the picture his own Showcase writer / director Fork allow Inge or Williams to upgrade as a kind of contemporary "Midnight Cowboy" and "Lolita" tearjerker. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated southern accents and try to decide. You are witnessing a feature film or an acting class - full of zealous amateurs. <br /> <br /> Johansson is exceptionally bearable (ie less pouting than usual) - though power is by no means good, the power is decent, though she's a bit too pretty to be believed, and Travolta chews that Scenery Never before (with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint, his performance could have been really touching, as it is, he is - and almost anyone else - too unlikely to ever bring us boredom or disgust). Kara Unger is perhaps the best of everything. If her role had been developed beyond a few lines, she might even have found a Best Supporting Actress nomination. <br /> <br /> Pic is almost rescued by Leonard Cohen's growling title song, decent productions and locations, and continued reference to literary works (which has earned the usual script reviews such as "poetic.") Helpful are a few old professionals in the cast like Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, Soderbergh cinematographer Elliot Davis, whose good work is undoubtedly thanks to the first-time director, who in ten or twenty years can actually do this, learn how to direct. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
