I just wish there was a lower grade than F to give it! I rated it in the vote with 1. I do not even rate this as a regular movie, but as a T & A movie. This is the worst, most annoying, worst, and horrible movie I've ever seen. Music is all terrible, not to mention that there is no nudity for the T & A Connisuer. It's about a male cheerleader, and the viewer has to sit through many painful scenes of him making jubilation. that's the worst of the bad 80s.
