I'm afraid I did not like this adaptation. When I started seeing it, I had a weird feeling of seeing some 70's TV series due to the filter and the music. I did not like the end scene. Mr Tilney appears only in his vest. Jane Austen would never let a gentleman ride without a frock coat. Looks like the producers have interpreted the dream of a romantic girl in a modern way. I appreciate the more modern JA adjustments much more that keep an eye out for these details, which makes the BBC series so valuable. Sorry, I'm looking forward to the 2007 customization. I hope this gets better and shows the benefits of Jane Austen's 20 year adjustments.
