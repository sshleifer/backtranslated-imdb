I do not usually think about turning off a movie unless it's really bad. Homegrown is a movie that I wish I had not even turned on. The plot is interesting, but the acting and the writing are too inconspicuous. The characters did not interest me. Movies where drug use and unnecessary nudity are highlights are not worth the praise. The characters spent their time getting high and believe me, that's the only way to get through this movie.
