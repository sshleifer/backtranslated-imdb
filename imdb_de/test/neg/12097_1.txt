First of all, the script is immitative and unfriendly. The signs are flat and formulaic. The plot has arbitrary inversions and non-sequesters. Baldwin's direction is terrible - these actors could do better on their own. The jokes and jokes go flat. The shoot-out scenes are awkward and unbelievable. Baldwin leads herself as a wise, courageous heroine, but spends most of her time in power struggles with women, especially with the caricatured, oppressed woman in her tunnel team, who always asks for assurance and rejects it. The conductor suffers from absurd incompetence because he is unable to effectively use a gun he passed. The next time we see them, they sit in their seats, sit, sit, talk, eat, read, and knit. In New York subways, sometimes people come by train to play a musical or dramatic number - maybe they thought it was "happening".
