Every time I see this movie, I have the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid / bad that they tear me apart, they are not intended and there are many of them; The rest is just bad, stupid and / or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets mauled at its own expense because it's the intended result - stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi has achieved what he wanted. This film has no excuse, it is stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers have failed so miserably. The crap result is piled on the crap-writing and crap-performances, and it's a shame that the lowest rating a movie can get is one of "horrible." Watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a Billy Madison essay: "Everyone in this room is stupid now because he's heard it." I should be able to give this movie something about -5.
