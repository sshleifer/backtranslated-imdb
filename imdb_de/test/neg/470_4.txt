I remember when I read that Darwin had a crucial experience in the Galapagos Islands when he saw the great variety of wildlife there and wrote his internship theory internally. Not after this movie - he was inspired by the British landscape. OK, and as John Cleese would say. Nor did I believe that Darwin was a man who suffered from deep personal conflicts and someone who had dark dreams and anxiety. He was according to this movie. It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness, but I do not believe that the loss of a family member would have greatly affected the man's scientific abilities. Well, not after ... you get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than making fables out of science, and to a certain extent this film comes as an attempt to expose the theory of evolution by saying that it came from a man who was emotionally unstable, what for I'm just disgusting. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific research, cool and calm and always logical. This film seeks to dramatize undramatic and sensational, clear-headed scientific exploration. It's like a Canterbury story. I would not recommend it.
