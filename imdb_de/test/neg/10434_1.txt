I do not think this is called a Stoner movie just because weeds appear too. I can not imagine that this is even a "Stoner classic". That would be like calling singles a "grunge movie". The movie definitely trudges with a gritty plot. Sometimes I wondered if the script had either been dropped or jumbled, or if it was completely lost and it was simply trying to escape. The reputation of this film reminded me to watch children act and make the story while they were playing along. <br /> <br /> The characters are made of wood, the dialogue is taxed and the whole story seems completely disconnected. Who was killed? When? What? And how do you behave if your friend has an overdose? Complete lack of emotion and complete separation from reality. <br /> <br /> As for the booming guitar sound that accompanies every scene: enough! It was like looking at the Start Menu screen, where the same track runs endlessly in the background, moving neither forward nor backward. <br /> <br /> I kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall into the sequence, the acting and the sequence of dialogue would improve or something, somehow this mess would focus on a coherent film. It never happened after 112 minutes.
