This is a below-average "whodunit" with the clich√© that everyone has in the living room routine. Charlie Chan is a secret service agent doing government work, and he needs to find out who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat German submarines during World War II. There is little to recommend with this film, since neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war has much to do with the plot. Charlie Chan fans will most likely find this movie disappointing. Who stupid? Who cares?
