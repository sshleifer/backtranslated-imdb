The original of GRUDGE (the original American remake) has surprisingly brought everything that you could do properly with a Ghost movie. It had an exciting, dark and moody atmosphere, some good thrusts and some really scary pictures. THE GRUDGE 2 tries all these techniques, but ultimately fails, showing only the old stuff that we saw in the first movie, and a messy storyline that constantly moves from Tokyo to California. It starts in Tokyo with some students who walk into the house and are now heavily blocked by a strip of police tape. One of them faces a similar ghost, wide-eyed, while locked in a cupboard. She gets out screaming and they all run out. Next we drive to America, where Karen's sister is sent by her mother to Japan to find her and bring her home. At some point we follow a very familiar concept in which a curious man and a girl examine the story of a mysterious house. Right from the beginning, we are talking about the girls who are gradually disappearing and a boy who hears strange noises at night in the next apartment, all of which lead to a very unsatisfactory ending. The "fear" scenes are boring and ineffective. Avoid like Ring 2 this terrible sequel of God ...
