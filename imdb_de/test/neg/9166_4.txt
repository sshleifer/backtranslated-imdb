A little disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union leader of Roxton Garments in New York. His business partner is killed when an elevator is triggered and plunges twenty-seven floors into the movie's haunting scene. <br /> <br /> Cobb does not know or does not know Do not admit it, but the man behind the murder is Richard Boone, who protects the company from unions organizers. Then Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from Europe determined to learn the business and join in. His father ran a clean business. He is shocked - shocked! - learn that Boone has insulted the union members and killed some of them who were irretrievably irritated. Robert Loggia is one of the organizers who are killed by a couple of Boone's thugs, led by Wesley Addy. Loggia leaves a widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews understandably and decoratively calls. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cobb pays for his self-delusion, Addy and Boone only get their desserts and Mathews winds up with the succulent Scala, after which an opera house is named. <br /> <br /> There is no note in any dialog line. A few lines are literally stolen by "On the Waterfront" - "Pistoleros", "They speak to the grave." The plot is schematic and holds absolutely no surprises. Vincent Sherman's direction is pedestrian. The photography is flat and uninspired, though there are some nice shots of New York's streets. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can work. In this case, it must have been easy for him because he repeats Johnny Friendly of "On the Waterfront" with only a soft heart. Richard Boone can act too. Joseph Wiseman does a good job in a small part. Gia Scala meets her notes, says what the script requires, and does what the director tells her. A stunning woman, whose life became angry early. The director and the photographer do a good job with Wesley Addy. He has white hair, a blanched face, the color of a glacier lake and is sometimes shot through a wide-angle lens to turn his surprisingly fleshy lips into a parasitic fish. However, I do not see him as a muscle man. He and Boone should have changed roles. Harold J. Stone is his reliable self, although he is forced to be more "Italian" than Tony by himself. No one else in something that is much like it is more than mediocre, and some performers have not even filled that bar. Kerwin Mathews may be a nice guy in real life, but he is mild and sterile and is one of the local dramas on the afternoon television. <br /> <br /> Great title that hints at intrigue and shadows. Some good people in the cast. A potentially explosive representation of a company that does not know much, but about what is being traded in megabucks. <br /> <br /> And it all comes out.
