This movie really reminded me of a song by the Dead Kennedy entitled "Straight A's". In contrast to this movie, the hero of the DK song, however, becomes a suicide. They wish that Bozo had killed himself instead of committing the crime he committed. The whole thing was complicated and in the beginning you sympathize with the hero of the film, then he quickly reveals your sympathies. The long sequences, in which he shows only the face of the hero while he delivers a monologue, drag the film down quite a bit. Avoid this if possible.
