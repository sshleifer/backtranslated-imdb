Apart from Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), an appearance by Henny Youngman, and the last seconds of the movie, this movie was not that good. Why it is currently rated at 5.3 and is revered by some reviewers is a mystery to me - the movie is 99.44% crap ... and exactly what I would have expected from director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and '70s, Lewis was known for making a series of incredibly low budget films, including BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. In recent years, however, he has been christened "the father of Gore," and he has many, many fans - fans who ignore the inability of his work, focusing only on how groundbreaking some of his films were. Apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts, his films are basically a crap - and for his films the values ​​9 and 10 are unbelievable. This would be like putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre! <br /> <br /> The film is about a series of very gruesome murders that happen to strippers. If I say cruel, it's very bloody and sick for 1972 - though the special effects seem surprisingly lame by today's standards. So while there are some very deviant and cruel murders in the movie (I would rather not explain them - they are pretty sick and show a particularly sick disregard for women), at least they will not blame you because they are so bad. It is obvious that in many cases they separate rubber dolls and mannequins. But some of the sick acts, even if they are unrealistic, are quite evil and show much misogyny. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the movie, since the police are all idiots, is a guy named Abraham Gentry - whose behaviors and speaking style are very close to actor David Lochary from the early John Waters films. Although he plays badly, he is so extravagant and funny that he took my interest. He could be pretty funny and strangely this is the only movie he has ever made !! It was also strange that so many women wanted him - mostly because they just did not look like his type. <br /> <br /> As for the other people in the movie, it's the cretins and idiots who could not act. In fact, I was hoping MORE would be killed - they had really let it happen! None of her plays was the least believable and the director has apparently NEVER re-shot a single scene - as most of the scenes in the film were inferior to any other in Ed Wood's masterpiece PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. For many of the women in the film, the only requirement for their appearance in the film is the willingness to undress. Now I know that this will sound pretty mean, but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts struggling to get their next solution. When these ladies take off their clothes, men in the crowd give them money to put it back on (wow - Henny Youngman SHOULD have said that in the movie)! But given Lewis' budgets, these were probably the best "actresses" he could get. <br /> <br /> All in all, a shabby bucket of bile that is worse than most of the director's films ... and that says a lot! It is violent (but silent), misogynist (they treat it like flesh and mutilated things) and is completely incompetent from start to finish.
