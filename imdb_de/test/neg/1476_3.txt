The concept of this film is unique, but its execution is not special. When I arrived at the cinema and found that only about 15 people were in the crowd, I thought I had made a mistake. The real mistake, however, was recognized in shocking detail when the movie was over, and I knew that I had wasted two hours of my life. Without the cruel shots of the old man and the stupidly funny friend This film would have rated 1 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> This movie is special and special because it is probably the worst movie ever released to the public. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of whether one could call it a movie or simply an advertisement for the probably crappy "Northwestern" locations, not then. On the other hand, if you want to experience both ends of the film production spectrum, then just take a book, a little game or something new.
