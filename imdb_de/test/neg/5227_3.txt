I'm a fan of Ed Harris's work and had high expectations for this film. Having such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always of great benefit to a director, but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think that Needful Things is the worst movie of Harris' filmography and that it was a big mistake to get involved. Anyway, I have seen much worse movies in my life, but Needful Things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent. Overall, the story seems too unbelievable and unreal. I do not know if that's because of the book because I did not read it. But if the script was so bad, I can not recognize the reason for the filming. Maybe it was the commercial success of King's books or the need for low quality films for the VHS era of the 90s. Whatever the reason, this movie was a very bad choice for everyone involved.
