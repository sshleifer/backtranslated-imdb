This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. If you are not interested in masochism, you should never see it. It was an unbearably long, pointless, eye-damaging, depressing movie and will forever lead my list of bad movies. Who wrote this movie is a sadist. I almost cried at the end, it was that bad. I would like to give it zero stars, but since this is not an option, I give it one.
