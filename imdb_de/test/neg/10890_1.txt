I only comment on very good movies and total garbage. My goal is to help people who want to see great movies, spend their time and money wisely. <br /> <br /> I also want to prevent people from wasting their time with garbage, and make known the fact that the director / producer of these garbage films is not going to last very long. We will find out who you are and vote with our feet and purses. <br /> <br /> This movie clearly falls into the garbage category. <br /> <br /> The director and author is John Shiban. It is always a bad sign if the author is also the director. Maybe he wants two paychecks. He should not get one. So think of the name - John Shiban. And if you see something different from him, forget it. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the plot - others already have it. I'm a bit worried about how much the director enlarges the poor girl's face when she cries and screams. These long shots are a little worrisome and may say something about Mr. Shiban's state of mind. Maybe he should seek psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> Enough. It's crap - do not waste your time doing that.
