The science fiction channel (sci-fi channel) films have become boringly predictable. The budget, originality and conspiracy seem to be low. <br /> <br /> In this institution, the government is anxious to get a bunch of telekinetics and is recruiting a poor soul in various ways to help. There are many revised recycled twists about the evil government organization. Black coats, shadows and short, meaningless lines make up these one-dimensional cartoons. Daniel Dae Kim is a good actor in a small role. He brings a bit of the style of his "angel" in the role. It's hard to miss that his "crusade" character was a telepath and this is a telekinetics movie. Was it a sci-fi casting attempt to pull fans from the other show? Who knows. Luckily, he is a decent actor and a pleasure to look at. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely a small budget. It reflects The Sci-Fi Channels current model of Canadian location, few familiar characters, few effects, and a terrifyingly terrible development of plans and characters. One would think that they believe that science fiction fans would see everything called "scifi". <br /> <br /> If you want a good TV movie, check out "The Fury" (1978).
