It's unbelievable that two films with the same story were released in 2005. This one appeared one day before the other with Tom Cruise. Did not they do that with Truman Capote in the same year and with the zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> The author / director David Michael Latt had no budget from Steven Spielberg, and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of the blockbuster who brought in $ 588 million worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of Rhett Giles, who played a pastor who gave up his god. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey was scary as an army LT.
