I've been trying for a long time to understand why people like Shakespeare love so much, and I give it a try every few years. I had hoped that this piece / movie (my sixth other Shakespeare play) would unlock the happy coffin and marry me to the wealth of this literary demigod. Bah, I clearly chose the wrong tone. <br /> <br /> After the phrase "Pound of Meat" had been pronounced ten minutes after the film began, the main parts of the plot were transparent, which worsened along with a sluggish script and lifeless action. At each step, the plot is exposed in advance by two scenes. The concept that a dying aristocrat would convince his daughter to choose her future husband by means of a lottery is disbelieving. It's no surprise who wins the marital jackpot because Bassanio is a major player in the game ... and he's the third man to try ... and there are three caskets to choose from ... and his friend risks his life pay the dowry The only real surprise I've seen in this movie is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the lawsuit. But as soon as the treachery began, it was immediately clear what would happen. I know that millions of you love Shakespeare not for the surprise in the well-known stories, but for the depth and passion of the characters. But I did not feel anything for the characters. Instead of struggling with tension and admiration during the court scene, I sat passionately, hoping that it would soon be over. <br /> <br /> One day maybe I'll find a Shakespeare play that does something other than boring me.
