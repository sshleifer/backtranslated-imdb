Elaborate cheesy madness over lava spewed from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Even if you try to stop unbelief by ignoring this ridiculous premise, you will still be laughing with laughter at the dishonest dialogue, nonsensical conspiracies, and wildly ruthless scientific conspiracy holes that sweep across the screen. I have a theory: every successful actor is damned to appear in at least one bad movie sometime in his career. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn. Although he tries hard, the script is just so pathetic, even if it's on fire (oops, I'm sorry). Most of the cast is also suppressed by the choppy script; Some actors simply call in their roles. Anne Heche deserves the special recognition of the Hall of Shame for her awkward portrayal of a scientist. She is about as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even he would have done at least a better acting job. <br /> <br /> Since the scientific gaps are too numerous to list here, I would instead suggest you show the movie with friends and have a game "Find the Scientific Absurdities". The loser might be forced to listen to tapes of the film's canny lines like Everybody Sees Equal. Here's an example of the nonsense you can expect: A plan to blow up a building is being designed, constructed and the dynamite set and detonated within about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Let us not forget the obligatory catastrophe clich√©s: divorced fathers, scientists ignored by everyone, vile policemen, tough street kids, brutal teenagers, greedy investors, etc .; All are present and in abundance. The movie will knock you over with an inexorable barrage of political correctness. <br /> <br /> Only for fans of cheese and stupidity. All other viewers: beware.
