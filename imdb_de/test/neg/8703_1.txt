This movie was awful. Biblical very inaccurate. Moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of Egypt, the movie has him at forty. Moses was about forty years old when he fled Egypt, had gone forty years and been traveling with them for forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died, and was denied the privilege of entering the Promised Land. I find that films need a lot of "poetic license" because the biblical account is not that long, but if you make a biblical film, you must always reflect the facts and keep the general character of the main biblical character, this movie Aspect and in many other cases this is not the case. Although the 1956 version also had problems, it was theatrically much better.
