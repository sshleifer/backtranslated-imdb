This abomination and the continuation of ONE MORE TIME (no thanks) and the horrendous Jerry Lewis disasters like Do not RAISE THE WATER (why not instead of just Flush) pushed moviegoers to close their doors instead of being forced to watch those movies to turn. Right: In the '60s, filmmaking blockbusters was still enforced in unfortunate suburban and country cinemas ... This means that in order to get a good movie, the cinema was forced to run such timewasters like this: Me well remember that in 1974 he liked to show FIDDLER ON THE ROOF or something good. I was brushed in the United Artists booking office by a soiled salesman who waved a flop in front of me and muttered, "Well, before we get to this, we'll look at a date at first." which basically means: "Book these duds and we will beat you tired". So and why have so many cinemas closed, forced to sift through and annoy their dwindling audience with these failures on the assembly line with lame comedians and bored talents. Cinema owners, exhausted with disputes just closed, sold to a gas station and saw the cinema demolish. Nowadays, the same kind of movies (such as: I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY) are being banned into the 20-seater cinema 99 in a mega Google plex. Not much has changed. FREDDY FINGERED ... anyone?
