I love camp films, believe me and Gordon Lewis' usual technicolorian gore does not bother me at all, but this is just one of his dumbest films, even more than BLOOD FEAST. I am not joking. THE GORE GORE GIRLS is about a crazy person who kills many Go (re) - Go (re) girls of a nightclub. A detective and a reporter try to find out the big secret. Maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual, average-acting H.G Lewis films, but that does not say much. The camera work is even awful. <br /> <br /> But at least it's acting with the go-go girls ... They'll spend a good time with it, and the killings are in a very absurd, very bad way: a girl is going along killed a mallet beating in her butt (!) and just do not let me talk about what it does to the nipples. You will laugh like everyone else. But the better part of all this chaos is a scene I just love about his campness: the go-go girl, before being attacked by many feminists dancing in a very American way. However, it is important to note that this was one of the earliest films to receive an X rating due to its violence. <br /> <br /> ONLY if you want to laugh and have a good time (but only with a lot, A lot of beers).
