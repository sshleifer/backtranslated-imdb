This movie was included in the DVD of the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries. I loved these six films. They were well played, well written and historically accurate. I actually read Gregory's book and I liked it a lot, even though HUGE has historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole weakness of gays with George Boleyn in particular), but in this movie that was not even mentioned. This angle was one of the central points of the book. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me ask, "Why?" Why do we see someone else say aptly, "The Real World: Tudor England"? Why are the camera angles generally so bad? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I mean, I know it was improvisation, but come on! The actors stammer and stutter about their lines and it is obvious that they catch up with them as they go along. <br /> <br /> Why are the sex scenes so awkward? The way they were made in the book made them at least somewhat interesting. In the movie they are just bad and they are absolutely funny. At one point in time, the actress who played Mary Boleyn had sex with the actor who played Henry VIII. He pushes away and she has that expression on her face saying, "Hm ... I have to go to the store, is he done yet? When he's finished, I can get cheese quickly ..." just bad. <br /> <br /> Why does Catherine of Aragon play such a small role in this film? Her refusal to divorce was one of the main causes of the scandal that shook Christendom. It is the reason why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn could not marry immediately. Why is not she here? Overall, this movie is just bad.
