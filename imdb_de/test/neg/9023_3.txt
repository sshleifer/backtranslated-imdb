While most of Wayne's B efforts are entertaining in an entertaining way, this movie is so sloppily edited and written that it's a Dud. The first ten minutes alone show Wayne and bandits in night scenes cut with the footage they apparently recorded during the day. Dwire plays a half white, half Apache bandit with a strong Mexican accent and he does not seem to have a nationality! I give a 3.
