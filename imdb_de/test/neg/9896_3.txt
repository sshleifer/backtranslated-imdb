CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a curious documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. Native American George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently dolphins in Australia for 35 years. They used various newly invented cameras, which he fixed either on his back, on the board or on the boat. In the mid-1970s he collaborated with Surfmag editor and aspiring filmmaker David Elfick to create this visually interesting story about this life and photography. The 75-minute feature CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. Even in the '70s, the audience was a bit confused about this movie, neither surfing nor surfing, as George swims on a Zippy board for kids, not a real surfboard. This inhibited George's droning (occasionally so) dry or droll that it was actually funny ... as if he were setting himself on fire or falling over something) with a spectacular "you are there" power slipping through a wave that hit 23 Minutes to Pink Floyd music was running. When the opera house in Sydney was opened in 1974, there was also a cinema there. Crystal Voyager was booked there as an arty-sporty OZ image and was a hit by default: Since the "Opera House Tickets" cost far more than a movie ticket, viewers flocked to see this movie as an excuse to see Sydney Opera House '... the film drew locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they saw a show there as a cheap attraction. This created this myth that the film was a big crowd puller and the reputation spread. As a result, it teamed up with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a double trip through the UK and Europe. I ran it in a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was pretty unhappy about that. Recently, George has regained Lord Of The Flies style with another well-photographed sea adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE, which gives viewers the chance to dive and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It's an eccentric 20 minutes with an even more eccentric 20 minutes, as George briefly did. Both faced a collective yawn in January 2005 by both the media and the public. All this makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a "you had been there all those years ago". However, on a special Oz surfing night in an outdoor cinema last year, 2000 people came up, but then 2000 appeared every night to see everything during this summer season ... so, the damn thing brought out another box office binge , How many actually enjoyed it is very open to discussion. Again, they were more than likely just confused by this crazy movie with an amazing reputation. Elfick has, however, since 1975 begun an outstanding career as a major producer and director of many Australian and international cuisine acclaimed films. Look for NO WORRY or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO after clear and present applause on his performance. However, George is still hovering somewhere out there threatening to look for something else to film or the camera for.
