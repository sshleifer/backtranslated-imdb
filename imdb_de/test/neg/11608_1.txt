This movie is about miserable, spoiled, ego-driven winemakers who think they have something interesting to say, executed by miserable, spoiled, ego-driven winters that they find interesting. Straight from the coke-filled gutters of New York's arty farty incestuous drama scene. <br /> <br /> How many viewers are led to make them believe that this substance contains any substance remains a mystery to me. Maybe they are secretly longing to be part of this overpaid and overrated 'actor-guild' or have they never seen a decent movie before? <br /> <br /> Get your hands into the dirty earth and get a real job. Otherwise kill yourself with a real weapon.
