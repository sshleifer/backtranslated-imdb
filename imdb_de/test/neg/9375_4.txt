First, I have to admit that I've never been a big fan of the Dutch film genre. Unfortunately, watching Domino did not change my mind. It has some common mistakes, for example, a predictable and too linear plot for my taste. <br /> <br /> Worse, the cast has its dialogues as if they were actors in a play. Unfortunately, this is also common in many Dutch films and makes it impossible, at least for me, to feel any relationship with the main characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Adri (excuse me, I forgot his name right now) is at least a decent performer and one of the reasons why I do not rate this movie any worse. Another reason is the fact that he had at least a certain budget and the production seems professional. <br /> <br /> The fact that the acting is often too articulated may not be such a big problem if you do not speak Dutch, although I already warned you that the plot is not spectacular, but at least it could become an acceptable movie.
