It could be generous to refer to this film as a "Sunday School" because, as a Christian, I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I did not want to see it in my church. The message is, "Read your Bible, go to church, and sign up for fire insurance so you will not be left behind at the Rapture." There was no love. I think, if you know it well, I do not believe in the God depicted in this film. The guy who had all the spiritual answers felt like Count Dracula. Apart from the spiritual / religious element, the script was boring - the same over and over again. That might have been part of the acting that did not provide a convincing line the first time, and they kept saying the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the last few scenes. I thought it was important not to hit someone over the head or bow to a Sunday School formula. The movie was not all bad, just most of it. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for more clean films that are well done and present the truth in a non-preaching way. That was not one of those, I'm sorry to say. I took my family to this movie and wanted to support this kind of movie. Now I want my money back.
