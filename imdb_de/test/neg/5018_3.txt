Not a bad concept. I only wish they had taken a different direction. It's a movie that tries to be interesting by first shocking you with bestiality, which works for most people (prude with weak stomachs). Besides, there is not much in this movie. It's neither funny nor romantic, so please, someone's changing this label, and since I already knew that bestiality is legal in most places and in a million dollar industry, I was not really shocked. But most people do not know that, and I thought the movie's development after the mystery came out was simply disappointing because it might have been one of those shocking eye-opener films that would teach the ignorant a fetish for which it's a reality (Yes, I did my homework) Hundreds of thousands of people. So, if you like watching bad movies, you can dream of how you could improve them while you see them, than have a lot of fun with them.
