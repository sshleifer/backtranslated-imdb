The book was not great, but decent, but the movie totally changes it. Many elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie, but the character of Dr. Ross starts from a creatively written character who lives for money and in the end causes the volcanic eruption with her greed to a son of a son -sleeve Maid in Need, which does not do anything, if they even find the slightest hint of something less noble. If films change the book so much but keep the same name, it should be a crime.
