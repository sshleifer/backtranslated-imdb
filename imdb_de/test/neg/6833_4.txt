A reckless assassin was hired to kill someone at the head of the US government. As he constantly changes his identity and location, he is known only as a jackal. Everything about this hitman is a secret. The deputy director of the FBI is aware of the Jackal's presence, but knows nothing about his intentions and faces the biggest challenge of his career. To find this cold-blooded murderer, he asks the help of an imprisoned Irish terrorist with a Russian intelligence officer. These unlikely allies compete against the clock worldwide to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can fulfill his mission. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie like Die Hard, The Jackal is not your movie. It's a slow spy thriller with lots of cool gadgets and weapons. Richard Gere does a good job of being a passionate terrorist, supporting the FBI for more profound reasons than freedom. And Willis is good as a jackal. OK movie but not anymore.
