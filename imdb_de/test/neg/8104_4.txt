This movie is really an excuse for filmmaking. The pace is bad, the budget must have been depressingly low, and action is low (ie, except for Bela Lugosi). The sound at this point is also terrible, with so much extra background noise that it sounds like a jet taking off the entire movie. If these things bother you at all, do not look at this movie. <br /> <br /> If you pass by, you'll find that the idea behind the movie is a very good idea. A German Plastic Surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to operate on several Japanese agents and to make them look similar to upright American businessmen who kidnapped and killed the Japanese. After he finished his work, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown into prison. Later, he flees and travels to America to take revenge on his patients through a series of well-known murders. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi seemed to be the only decent actor in the movie, and to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgetful and unfamiliar. The lead actress was rather boring and stereotyped, while the police officer assigned to her case was an ordinary, chauvinist and always correctly dominant man found in many films of the time. <br /> <br /> I also found that the camera work was completely uninspired and often always occupies the same angles of the exact same spaces. After a while, this pulls the movie down, making the "action" very slow, which is pretty much nonexistent anyway. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea is intriguing, and with a better author, director, screenplay, equipment, and actors, it could be a great movie. Unfortunately, these handicaps hold the film back for now, and I can only recommend it to any open-minded film lover.
