I'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - in fact, acting is not so bad and the story is not as bad as it was in some Disney movies. The story itself is flat and undeveloped, but that's not surprising in a movie of this kind. The drama is more than a bit two-dimensional, but I appreciate the actors that they could do something with the material they had to work with Story is based on the theory that they created a "perfect" pop star, and then an actress who can not sing to save her life. If the girl can not sing, you have someone who can record the music! <br /> <br /> This actress is a terrible singer - she was so flat that she usually sang in a completely different tone!
