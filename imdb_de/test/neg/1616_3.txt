I bought this movie from e-bay as part of about twenty horror films, all for one dollar apiece. When I saw that, my first impression was that it was probably from the late '80s. Later I started to think - the posters in Linkin Park on the wall and everything else indicated that it was a newer movie. The streak became an unbearable agony. The last 3 minutes were the longest in film history - the movie just did not want to end. Is there a genre like "horror for kids"? In this case, this movie is definitely the right one. If there are parents who are perverted enough to introduce their offspring to the horror, I suggest that this would be perfect for children 6-8 years old. The only thing I really liked was Greg Cipes, who was far too good an actor for this nostalgic retro-bottom of a drive-in double calculation.
