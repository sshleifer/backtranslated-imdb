I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was a funny caper movie. I was shocked to discover a bad direction, unwieldy dialogues, a slow pace, unmotivated slapstick gags, and an overall rough surface. Just not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes of the usually excellent Donfeld are scary and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The whole children's book characters are not nearly as if they were the couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job. For a film that seems to be setting up a dart on the injustice of social and unemployment insurance systems, filmmakers have no problem being unfair themselves by playing Hispanic, black and gay stereotypes at such a gruesome level. The look of the movie is reminiscent of every episode of Love American Style. This is not a compliment. In this bureaucratic bureaucratic world, there are countless 1970s fashions that add a touch of implausibility to any situation. Apart from a clever initial idea and two capable stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this dated exercise in social commentary appears compulsive and mean for minorities, especially gays. If you want a better caper movie, head to The Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or What's Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. This is funny!
