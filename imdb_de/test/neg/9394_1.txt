This is just another of these "Americans finds romance with charming foreigners in exotic countries of Europe." This genre has been cinematically bankrupt since the 1950s, but they are still being thrown up. I let my girlfriend persuade me to see that - a bad idea, we both hated it. If you just want to see Tuscany, check out "Stealing Beauty" with Liv Tyler - a slightly better movie. <br /> <br /> This kind of genre movie is a Hallmark greeting card.
