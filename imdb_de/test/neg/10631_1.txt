After surviving this movie last night, I turned off the DVD player with the feeling that I had earned a medal because he had the stamina to make it through to the end. Throughout the film, I felt that I was watching the action ploters in a high-budget porn movie. The acting was stiff and tense, the camera work was appalling and the locations and sets were so bad that they felt like they had lent them to the local amateur school "Amateur Dramatic's Society". The only salvation for This film was Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris, otherwise it was pure dribbling.
