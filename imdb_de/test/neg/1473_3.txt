I love documentaries. They are among my favorite genres of the film. Before I saw this movie, I had not seen anyone I did not like. <br /> <br /> The premise for this movie is great. The execution is well done. There were a few times early when I laughed and smiled. But as the movie progressed it became more annoying and annoying. This could have been something special if the subject had not been so inarticulate, childish and awkward. I appreciate his passion for the movie, but stop moaning. If you do not have the money, maybe you should not have so many children or spend that much money on alcohol. Maybe you should have attended a film school or at least completed high school. Maybe you should have lived the life and got perspectives and experiences that could contribute to your vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people with stories that are interesting, funny and poignant. Seeing that this guy was selected over one of them is nothing short of blatant. If you want to make a documentary about a filmmaker, why not a person from China or Iran, a filmmaker with REAL problems? <br /> <br /> Two last questions: <br /> <br /> Who needs a small child to see Apocalypse Now? <br /> <br /> How many times did this guy say "man"?
