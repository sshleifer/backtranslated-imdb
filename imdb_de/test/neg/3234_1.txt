Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" is one of the best books I've read. Unfortunately, the movie is a sad cartoon of the book. The disillusioned middle-aged hero and lonely spinner, with whom he finds a sense of his life, are turned into a few stupid teenagers in the film, the Stoic security agent and the conscientious sheriff become a farce villain - you get a picture ? The filmmakers have taken a moving story of love, horror, and adventure, turning them into a Z-grade horror movie that's - very badly - geared towards the teen market. <br /> <br /> Buy the book and enjoy reading for hours - it will be far more rewarding than watching the movie. <br /> <br />
