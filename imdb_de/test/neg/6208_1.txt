Talk about acting ... !!!! Not only from Govinda, but also from Salman and Lara .... The direction was terrible. The first half hour you would actually want to turn off the movie .. because this movie is a real stinker (mark my words. <br /> <br /> I liked Govinda in some of his comedy roles like Haseena Maan Jaayegi Jodi No 1, Akhiyon se Goli Maare and Jis Desh My Ganga Rehta Hai and this is unlike any of them, and Salman Khan should not play any comedy roles at all! He sucks, he does not know how to make comedy, the only good one Comedy role he did was in Andaz Apna Apna, who was brilliant next to Amir Khan. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there were so many "exaggerated, stupid-funny" scenes in which you want to have to join the DVD and burn it so nobody else in your house ever looks at it again.
