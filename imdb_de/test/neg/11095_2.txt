"An evil spirit takes on a girl and spreads panic at the Louvre Museum," that's all I think, the summary of the movie and the movie itself! I think it's one of the worst French or non-French films ever made in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> Here's nothing good except the music (just the credits!), some tender moments of (Sophie Marceau) and of course the finale of the movie It's been countless years watching THAT CRAP, as well as a magical CGI work that was too good to be here! <br /> <br /> By the way, I would like to change the plot summary as follows: "An evil spirit takes over some movie artists to make lousy films". Just like this one.
