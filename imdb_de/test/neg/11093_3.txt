With all the potential for a good movie in its beautiful settings, cast, and cinematography, the dull screenplay, leaden pace, and woody performances of this film were just disappointing. With decent directing, editing, and musical score, this could have been a good movie, perhaps a dark version of Blake Edwards '10' instead of a whiny version of Ron Howard's 'Splash'.
