"Really?" Is that necessary? How can someone make such a movie? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, cars pursuing an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the end. Utter nonsense with the presence of the little girl. Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood !!! Well, in the beginning, a fortuneteller answers with something no one has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. You must be kidding. Steven Segal passes out after a car chase and I know he can not act. It was terrible. Nothing can save this movie. <br /> <br /> I lost 90 minutes of my life! See you
