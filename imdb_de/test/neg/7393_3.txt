Well, they sent it to television between midnight and 2:00 am - it seems to be the right time to look at it, and then go to bed ... No, no, it did not really live up to my expectations, I guess The dogma concept is good because the movie comes closer to what really happens between the characters involved when you cut out all the unnecessary effects and cut out atmospheric music. On the other hand, this concept requires some interesting actions between the characters. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I know King Lear (the Shakespeare version) very well, if I had known the play, I probably would have done it. We were able to predict much of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, a crisis can flaunt the best and worst sides of a character - and we definitely see some bad sides. Oh yes, the color of civilization and culture can be very thin, and behind that color you may find an animal. <br /> <br /> If you then compare it to "Italiensk for begyndere" (Italian for beginners), or "Mifunes sidste sang" (Mifune's last song), you'll see the same thing, but the opposite is true: people can be in crisis definitely make her life more constructive. And if you dare, you could win. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over, I thought to myself, "Oh, that's why I've never seen him before ..." The film has its own beauty. The quality of the work of the cameraman, the actor, etc. is good. But the script might need a little more. A conspiracy might not hurt.
