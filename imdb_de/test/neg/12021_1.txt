Everyone has the choice for the "worst movie he has ever seen". Some like to look for Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some choose classics like Plan 9 from space. Since I was 14 years old, I've said very loudly that it's problem child 2 for me, and nine years later I feel the same way. It is not "one of the worst", it is not just an expression. It's actually the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> How much fart, shit, piss and puke can you put into a single movie? I do not have to see a dog taking a dump that reaches to my waist! Why am I so hard on this dirt? I have nothing against bathroom or gross humor. Heck, I like the American pie movies. Having such an excess within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the true turning point is to do it with kids! When little kids call each other's sexual names (IMDb does not even let me post that word, but here it comes out of the mouth of 8-year-olds, remember the irony in it!) And urinating and puking others just makes the whole thing dirtier. Worst line in the movie: "I think I should fart in more people's offices." <br /> <br /> What else is there for a movie: sodas in lemonade, sticks of dynamite, the toilets exploding, a little boy filming his babysitter in sex and projecting him on the wall, and a little girl, that Scratching over testicles? <br /> <br /> But my absolute favorite moment must be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride and says, "I'm going to puke," opens her mouth and fakes the puke out of her open mouth at a perfect angle of 90 Degree! The puke scene in Scary Movie 2 looked more real. <br /> <br /> I think the only redeeming element in the movie is Gilbert Gottfried. One has the impression that he did not even have a script, but only his usual self. Too bad he has to face himself while pizza is being thrown at him. <br /> <br /> Do you know what? When I think so much about the movie, I just have to go to the bathroom. Goodbye!
