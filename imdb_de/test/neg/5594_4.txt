The first thing that came to my mind when I finished this movie last night was "Why the title of 8MM 2?", Because I obviously saw the first one. What had that got to do with the storyline of the first movie? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porn industry and that was not even needed in the plot, because after you see the end that I will not spoil it just made no sense <br / > <br /> A diplomat and his fiancee are in Hungary and notice a woman swimming naked in the pool area. She is very attractive. If you see them in a club, they decide to have some fun and a hot threesome. However, things get extremely intense when the diplomat is sent pictures of everyone who fears that this will be public and jeopardize his career. lead into a murder case. He and his fiacee are choosing to find the girl with whom they had the affair, but things get deeper and darker as they get into an inexplicable and ill-conceived movie, which was sad. As I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first, so do not fall for it. It's just a sexual thriller that does not make sense, but it's good for those nights alone, because, frankly, this is one of the movies where he's so close to porn that he might as well be called softcore. > 4/10
