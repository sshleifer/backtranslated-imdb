OK, I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason why I saw this movie. But it was so boring that I almost fell asleep. Sorry, but her talent as an actress is not very convincing. In addition, this film was presented with outstanding special effects and CGI. Yes, it's not so bad for a B-movie. After seeing her in "Marquise" a couple of years ago (also a very crappy movie), I thought she was playing more convincingly. But La Boum (and maybe the James Bond "The world is not enough") seems to be the only good movies with her. Is it her "talent" that she has a bad taste in choosing her films or just plain bad luck?
