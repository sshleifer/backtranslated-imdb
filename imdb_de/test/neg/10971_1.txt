This film takes a lot of liberties with the well-known historical facts. Even little things like Flynn licking stamp after stamp, if he almost certainly used a moistened sponge, is one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried for manslaughter or murder. It is not known that he caught his mother having sex with another man, and it is not known that he had a homosexual relationship with anyone, and he did not land in the sleigh in Sydney. He did not get his two-penny-halfpenny role in In the Wake of the Bounty by cheating and that role did not make him a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> This is just a mediocre movie in which the name of Errol Flynn was only hired to sell more tickets and more videos.
