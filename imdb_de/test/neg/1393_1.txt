I absolutely love stand-up comedy. I love to hear the rude thoughts of the stand-up on stage as they address the different life experiences of their peers who made them, or things they've come up with or seen that they just love for so ** ** have held. stupid that they had to share it with someone. <br /> <br /> There used to be stand-ups that adopted a personality everyone could identify with (Rodney Dangerfield), or they were just so damn crazy that there was nothing to do but laugh with them laughed at others (Richard Pryor). And then there were the thought-provoking comics like George Carlin, who, though pretending to be an idiot, was the smartest guy in the room, calling people to rethink the things they saw walking and realized How screwed up things were and how easily they could change things. <br /> <br /> Now, this does not seem to have anything to do with "Mind Of Mencia", which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy's terrible solution to the loss of "Chappelle's Show," but that it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show with stand-up bits for his audience, sometimes with popular themes, mostly racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three types of stand-ups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos, who despite stereotypes is just your normal guy. Then he continues to laugh at others, people he calls racist, or only those who disagree. And finally, he presents the sketches to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see their point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he shows a point of view people reject What he really does is not just promoting racist stereotypes that are already there and joking, but encouraging people to listen to them and the only thing they do Laughing /> <br /> The promotion of stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest way to laugh in stand-up mode. The best comedians I fear are Carlos Mencia in good company do not have to resort to them. They talk universally and ask you to laugh at absurdity rather than with it as Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "real" situations that demand racism or beating others with his use, he tells us instead of laughing, and he actually portrays these absurdities as truths rather than just extremes of them. <br /> <br /> His show is an insult to the heads of the audience. Mencia does not give us a comedy and asks us to digest it and take from it what we want (something I hate so much to compare the two was "Chappelle's Show" of the highest quality). He tells us exactly how to see it and react to it - which in his words is a stupid face and "Dee Dee Dee!" This show is named accordingly. It is indeed a show about "The Mind of Mencia". It is Mencia's mind, through and through, and as such it is nothing but stupid conversation. The show is tailor made to teach life lessons to its core audience, 14-24 year olds, about how bad stereotypes are, but racial beating is fine for Carlos Mencia and should therefore be fine for you too!
