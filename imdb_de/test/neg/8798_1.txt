OK, before I deal with it, let's get the warning out of the way: This film is the quintessential "cinematic" definition of SLEAZE! There are movies on the market that can definitely shake up or disgust this movie and have far more artistic validity than you can say for that shitty pile of a movie. So what does it make so dingy? Let's take a quick look at "Wet Wilderness" ... <br /> <br /> Made in 1974 for almost nothing, this "Roughie" has no real "conspiracy" to speak of otherwise a FAMILY would go into the wilderness to relax and spend a day while being chased by a fat guy in a ski mask with a machete on the tip of his head ... the way that forces everyone to have sex with each other, while masked crawling is systematically murdered. Those who are sensitive to incest related issues are encouraged to look elsewhere. Then, to either add some surrealism or just show a complete inability to film, the group's "daughter" runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black guy (!) In one Tied ("... this big bitch has left me here for 3 days ...") with virtually no explanation !! He is saved ... or is he? Of course not!! They get caught before they can escape, where our killer forces them to have sex as well, while the mother is forced to join in, and in the end a dead black guy (courtesy of a hatchet through the chest) when all said and done. Then our killer forces the daughter and mother to give him oral sex as one of the women snatches the machete ........ and the movie ends abruptly !!! Just like that! No warning, no bound loose ends ... it's just over. Well there might be a decent conclusion to this film (I honestly do not know), but I just saw the extremely rough Alpha Blue archive version. Your version seems to have either completely cut the end or so it ends. If this was intentional, then I'm sure there's a rule of thumb in movie 101 about ending a movie, but it should not be done like THIS! Fans of the movie "Psycho" should be happy about the soundtrack music, because everything goes through the movie! I would be willing to bet that no rights were granted or anything. Although this is a "violent" movie, there is not much of it, so Gorehounds do not do any good here. The violence is not shown graphically ... only the results (one of the victims is stabbed with a machete directly above the vagina area). Sex is also a part of the UGLiest sex I have ever seen! The interesting thing about this movie is that it is too ugly to work as effectively erotic porn or to appeal to anyone except those who tend to like dingy, hideous and ugly things, but are not violent enough, to get real recognition among the seekers for something really brutal like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other flicks. The only "notorious" thing about this steamy bunch is that violence has been added to an adult movie. A pretty new concept at the time, especially considering that porn chic was all the rage and the mills that stood on 42nd Street played such a thing to a least exhausted group of pornomadens. This was and is not a "mainstream" porno. <br /> <br /> If you were in a film school and there were a list of filmmaking products, the film would be a shining example of this lesson! This cinematic crush demonstrates what happens when disabled filmmakers get a "budget" (in this case, probably around $ 142, as it looks like!) And ignore all "don'ts" and turn them into "do's" ... .. yes, this movie is so bad !! One more thing: anyone who is offended by racial flaws can also see something else.The black man in the movie is constantly verbally abused for his color and the killer is obviously racist, but in the early '70s I'm not sure if such a movie could be done today, to be honest, this will not "shock" anyone or annoy anyone, except those who are ugly, I actually got bored, the sex is so ugly and banal, it's hard to see with eroticism, if you risk it, thank God for the fast-forward button! "Acting," if you want to call it that, is amateurish at best (I mean, it's even bad for PORNO!), with no reason to care about anyone or anything in this area !! If you have to see it ONLY, then download it because you really feel like a heel when you buy it. Some things are just so worthless ... and "Wet Wildernes" is it. It would be more unpleasant than watching this film if he were to sit in the theater and watch the other viewers, who also saw him and suddenly felt insecure. Probably not the largest collection of thinkers and intellectuals in society. But if you fancy some stupid yet SLEAZY porn, give it a crack. It's 54 minutes and yet it feels MUCH longer !! Crackheads would love that! On the other hand, maybe something is wrong with me, because I've ever looked for that ... LOL! Oppressors, sloppy lovers !!
