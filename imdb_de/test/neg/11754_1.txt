No matter what other people said, you can not go through this movie without comparing it to the original. If it were alone, it would be a 2-3 out of 5 movies, but it's a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 movie and so has standards to meet and we need to see if it has reached those standards. If the film was a rework or, as in Planet of the Monkey, a rebuild of the original, you can watch the movie by referring to the original only. Imagine this, if someone took the model in the "Mona Lisa", put it differently and painted it, you could only compare the frame, the concept, etc., with the original, but if someone simply put them in the position of You have to compare the original. <br /> <br /> That is, this movie is not just as good as the original, it spectacularly fails to make the original one of the best movies ever. So the shower scene is never forgotten, the remake should be one Celebration of Hitchcock, but actually ended to degrade him and his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The demeaning aspects of this image were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It's nothing to do with whether or not they behaved better. The relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent. Norman did not understand sex, he barely had any contact with the outside world, and when he met the beautiful Marion and watched her change, she was partly fascinated when he did not really understand sex and his attraction for her. This makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are on his side because he is not fully there understand the world and constantly struggling with himself and his "mother". The whole dynamic is gone in the remake. I must admit that Janet Leigh is not my type, but she is very attractive and you can see that Anne Heche is really unattractive. Finding Norman that she finds her Marion attractive is unbelievable when you add that to Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbates while looking at her, and you get a Norman just waiting to kick every naked woman out, no matter what she looks like, For which you feel absolutely no sympathy, they destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting the porno magazines in his room. It destroys a character we liked, and we're sorry, it's like he's reshaping "It's a Wonderful Life" and having the main character like a pimp that's totally humiliating. <br /> <br /> The only other character I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marines workmate. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock says the line "He must have noticed my wedding ring," he triggers a laughing reaction as she absolutely fumbles. If Rita says so, it seems only plausible, as there is really no other reason to be flirting with Anne Heche. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm very biased, the original "psycho" is my favorite movie of all time, if the movie had been reworked with another movie then you could have turned these characters upside down and it would have been perfectly acceptable. <br /> <br /> Hitch thought the movie was too bloody in color and made it black and white to reduce it. This also made the movie more atmospheric and scary in its own way, giving it a beauty that could never be captured in color, and it's a sad statement about how films de-sensitize audiences, that people have said, like the shower scene was more frightening in color. (nb, before people think "he can not spell", remember, I'm from England and we spell color) <br /> <br /> A remake should be just that, that's a fake, a complete copy and a very bad one. I could go on comparing, but it does not make sense, in the original almost everything is superior. The only better thing is the performance of Viggo Mortensen, as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was originally very shallow (Hitch called him "The Stiff" behind his back) and Mortensen delivers a more credible, albeit less sympathetic performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors who stick to the originals. <br /> <br /> All in all a movie that should be described as a "Expensive Embarrassing Experiment". Show only if compared with the original or if the original is unknown to you. But also watch Original 'The film would have received 3 out of 5 points if it was original or a revision, but it's 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)
