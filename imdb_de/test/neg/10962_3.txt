This movie was horrible, especially given the work that has gone into production. Although it's not as bad as Ax 'Em, it's pretty awful. Consider the obvious rip-offs of Gladiator and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and what do you get? This smorgasbord of horrible make-up and wooden games. <br /> <br /> The movie starts like most zombie movies that are happening today. An assembly of interesting jumps and a radio broadcast of the eruption. We see our hero (Ryn, who is probably the worst "zombie hunter" of the modern age, he has counted four or five times, either scratching his head with the barrel of his gun or looking down the barrel as he blows it off), the Cut off fingers from zombies. We later learn that these fingers are collected for bounties. <br /> <br /> Well, Ryn seems to be a rebel in his way of delivering zombies; They go so far as to buy Chum * wheezing * from his French buddy Hans (who is not really French, speaks with a strange accent from the Middle East). When Ryn uses the buddy to collect a substantial reward from Lost Hills, hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> And the awfulness of the movie. The zombies are pretty badly put together. I've seen comments that praised her make-up, but it was pretty amateurish in my opinion. Obvious Halloween adhesives were used to make the faces of the zombies. There were points where a girl looked like she was putting on a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. Oy Vey. <br /> <br /> To summarize the next sixty minutes in a few lines: Ryn is stabbed back by Hans (who has made a deal with some other zombie hunters, Blythe is the leader) and gives him a second of chance, he will be back by Hans stabbed, then shooted Hans and comes to Union City, where Blythe states that he poisoned the cities for profit. <br /> <br /> That's really about the conspiracy. When Ryn reaches Union City, all the bad guys are gathered in a house that's obviously so massive that it takes Ryn hours to reach the top floor. People die, Ryn lives, and the movie ends with one of those cynics, "Will he kill himself?" scenes. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * Above all, I have to blame Nott for this mess. The direction was terrible. EVERY character showed a different look than Hans, who was by far the best "actor" in this group of MacBeth. When they reach Union City, a bunch of zombies attack the crew, and the zombies seem to have no tips or ideas to leave as if their appendages were rotten. A woman sways as if swimming in the midst of a Sunday stroll. <br /> <br /> Some movies are awful. This movie is one of the reasons why logic was seemingly abandoned to keep a story flowing. Works occasionally, but in this regard (where the story was already in ruins) it does not. <br /> <br /> Avoid it, unless you want a decent laugh.
