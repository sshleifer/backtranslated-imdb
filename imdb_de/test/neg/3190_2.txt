I give this piece of Hollywood trash 1 in 10! Serious! I mean, I like comedy as much as the next guy. I can just take stupid comedy and actually sit back and laugh with it. But this movie had nothing to laugh about or with. <br /> <br /> I like almost every actor in this movie. I thought I would miss what many people told me (my fault because I did not listen). I was only humbled how stupid this script was! Just ridiculous and not even in a funny way. The only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when he saw other films or on TV. I was very disappointed and would really like to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then sign up anyway! Bad decision regarding their parts ... <br /> <br /> **************************************** **** <br /> <br /> Okay - here's my biggest question about this movie ....... If the characters on this story of Jewel (Liv Tyler) after the fact ... how can Paul Reiser then go to a therapist who remembers the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene when he is crushed by the dumpster !!!! Can someone answer that?!?!?!?!? Big jerk of the filmmakers ..... Nobody noticed that?!?!?!????!?!
