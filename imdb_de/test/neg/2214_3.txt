This is just one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. It may not be the worst movie of all time, but if you have not seen so many bad movies, this could easily make it a top ten list of the worst. If you think about what was achieved in 1933 with the original King Kong, you must ask yourself why someone has been so down to produce this debacle. Then we go one step further and realize that the quantum leap to "Star Wars" has reached a new level in sci-fi entertainment the following year. This offer will make you laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now I would like to ask you, what would the Professor (Peter Cushing) have to bring an umbrella as a first-class underground exploration device to travel to the Earth's core? OK, so it was helpful to fend off the parrot / tyrannosaur (Parrotosaurus?) At an early stage, but come on. Somehow, I do not think Edgar Rice Burrough thought of that when he wrote his stories about Pellucidar. He probably did not even have Caroline Munro as Princess Dia in mind, probably the only redeeming factor for this whole escapade. <br /> <br /> At least there was a pseudoscientific explanation that gave me a kick of; I always look for such in one of these films. So the sky in the Earth's interior would really have to be the bottom of the Earth's crust, explaining that ethereal pink glow. But try it, the story just could not make me find anything interesting about Hoojah, the cunning or Jubal the ugly, let alone those stupid half humans, half Pterodactyl creatures. To tell the good professor, "You can not fascinate me, I'm watching!"
