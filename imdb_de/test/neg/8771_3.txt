I am a Christian, and I have seen pretty Christian films, but this is too bad. They try to do that well, but it's too hard for them, I think. <br /> <br /> - You can see that the movie is out of sync in many places. - One can almost think that the main characters in this film were the only ones left behind. I think there will be a lot more of it. <br /> <br /> - The quality is poor and the drama could have been better too. The story is not so bad but could have been better. The only plus I give is the story in this movie, but overall I can not rate it more than 3/10. See "Left Behind" instead!
