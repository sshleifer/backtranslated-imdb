OK, yes, I know that I am a Philistine, and I have no knowledge of operas. I gladly admit that I might feel different about this movie if I did that. But not me. Well, for those of you like me, leave these out, unless you want to look at the pretty (sometimes unclothed) girls. For what it's worth, I thought that the first segment with Theresa Russell (which I did not recognize) was the best.
