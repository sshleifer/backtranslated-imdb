This film is a cinematic collage of gangster stereotypes. The script is z and the plot and the story are constructed without care or logic. It's a chaotic pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (think of Bugs Bunny cartoons) and stupid secondary characters (the doctor and the author). There are much better Bogart movies. In fact, Bogart looks like he slept through this performance. He does not put much effort into this character. I think the advice he received was something like "He's a bad guy, really bad." This guy is the equivalent of Darth Vader; obviously, evil and the antihero. Do not waste your time with this.
