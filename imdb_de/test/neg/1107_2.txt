One of the few reasons to shoot these pointlss films is to give some actors the chance to hopefully participate in better films if they are good at acting. The only good thing about this film is the acting, the three female lead actors are better than most horror movies like this one. There are two scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Small children usually crawl through holes and discard dynamite to explode mines. When one collapses and a cave is created, all children die and become zombies. The adults in the mine remain dead, there are no reasons why the children are meat eaters. When they were still alive, they looked innocently at the cave in front of the cave, so they had to go mad about any adult who had exploited them in the mines (just a reason that comes to mind) moving in House near the mine, along with a farmhand who wants to build a resort, and another of those scary people who seem to know exactly what's going on, but no one believes him, they're ordinary clich√©s, predictable, lots of negatives for this movie, very few positives.
