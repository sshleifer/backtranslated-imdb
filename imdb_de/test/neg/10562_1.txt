I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years. I had never seen this adaptation before, and when I heard about it, I came here and read the excellent reviews. I then eagerly ordered it from Netflix. What a horrible disappointment! They took one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made them boring. Apparently each character was given a single facial expression, a tone on which his flat characters should lean. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word that Jane Austen wrote, it seems that they were randomly passed on to the characters. Although it was a mini-series, this adaptation succeeds in being confused and feeling rushed as if it had been made as a movie of the week. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett is too hard, Mrs. Bennet is just a rattling chipmunk, Mr. Darcy is as lifeless as a nutcracker, almost indistinguishable from Bennett girls, and Mr. Wickham a man nobody would look twice - hardly the appealing Kad! I'm pretty angry!
