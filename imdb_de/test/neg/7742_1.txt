Boy, this movie is bad. And not in a good, cheesy, funny way. Even MST3K could not stop it from getting boring, and it's also confusing when everyone comes out. The most annoying part of this boring chaos is Ireland's hideous high voice, which I was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. Not to mention how much her character is unattractive. Even her father ran away and left her! I can honestly see why. If he had heard her whining in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he would have been tempted to do her a great deal of harm. As I was, at the end of the film. Besides, it is useless and annoying. If she toppled the long hole in the earth from Alice in Wonderland, she would have been killed in the first ten minutes, if the inexplicably Australian-influenced miner would not have saved her from all the various difficulties she repeatedly hurt herself. He should have simply tied her to the Atlantic version of train tracks and finished it. And this underground Atlantis with its strange, confusing obsession with bone density, I must ask - where did the light come from down there? Do you have generators that imitate the sun? No matter. There's no real plot, just some weirdly costumed goth wannabes running around trying to catch Kathy (probably to put a gag in her mouth). Stupid, pointless movie. Thanks, Golan Globus, for this cinematic abomination. May you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity.
