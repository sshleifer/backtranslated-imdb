When released, this film aroused a sensation. I saw it and loved it. Beautiful, mostly young, nude women filmed in a stylish style that we knew so well from director Hamilton's photography. His photographs never turn into porn and the same goes for this movie. Today I saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow scenes, all with some Vaseline on the lenses, is actually everything there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautifully filmed, but they are not real beings with a soul. Actually, nothing happens. It's as if Hamilton were taking pictures with moving pictures and not with still pictures. And that gets boring after a while. I did not even observe the whole thing the second time because I fell asleep. That's all that's left of this masterpiece: It's a very good sleeping pill. And you will never become addicted to it! <br /> <br /> Back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
