This is probably the worst and most disappointing movie I have ever seen. I spent four years at two universities and I know there has to be a good film about the experience. That's not it The "acting" is terrible and the action does not exist. Here are a few incidents from my one year stay in dorms. <br /> <br /> 1) A classy boy unconsciously chopped off with a transvestite. 2) The best friend of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname "The Brick". 3) A couple that is too loud. 4) The guy who gets all the girls 5) The guy from Northern Ireland who is very hard to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for a week. 8) A student beats some of my buddies to a hospital. 9) The discarded joint triggered a fire. 10) The Flood 11) The guy who wakes up on his floor and finds out that every piece of furniture has been moved out of his room I'm sure a few writers can do better, much better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie named after a Sleeper song, where is the Britpop soundtrack?
