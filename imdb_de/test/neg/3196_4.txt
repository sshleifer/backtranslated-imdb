I saw a great movie from this movie that I will talk about later, and then the cast list. I thought I might as well try it. Basically, the down-to-earth bartender Randy (Matt Dillon), his cocky cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and the murder investigation Detective Dehling (John Goodman) have something in common, they've seen the girl of their dreams (whether married or not) and they would do anything do to please and be with her, even die. All three met / saw them "one night at McCool's," the bar Randy worked on, they do not know each other, but all three can not stop thinking about Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine (The Lord of the Rings, Liv Tyler) , All three tell their stories to someone they hope will hear their rather intense and insightful stories. Randy talks to the hit-man burmeister (Michael Douglas who co-produced the movie), Carl to the psychologist / psychiatrist dr. Green and Dehling to Father Jimmy. They confess all the details of what they have wanted to do, their sexual contact with them, and finally, they are all brought together in one place, all anxious to be with her, and all those involved in the last firefight one who makes one run away (and finally dies) and one is stunned, and the unexpected guy she selects (but at the same time obviously, because it is the sex-obsessed Douglas). With Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I had to pick a favorite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned on number 11, along with Cool Hand Luke on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, where Tyler writes off the woman washing the car with foam on herself and before Goodman, very sexy! Apart from that, not the most memorable movie. OK!
