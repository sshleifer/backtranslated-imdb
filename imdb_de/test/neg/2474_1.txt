No, * Hitch * is definitely NOT a romantic comedy about the vicious (and questionable) former left-pundit reactionary pundit Christopher Hitchens, though this would surely have turned into a funny movie. A stupid little Englishman, stained black with cigarettes and Guinness, and shouting advice - and a sharp political commentary - to loving men: "Look into her eyes when you talk to her, you go crazy, and remember : calling someone a 'neo' - conservative "makes you de facto an anti-Semite! Can not you clarify something, you Libyan Pantywaist? "<br /> <br /> Okay, so instead we get Will Smith, whose lingering success remains at least a mystery to me, I'm clearly alone in this regard, Smith is the most powerful man In Hollywood at the present time: Americans can simply shirk their money at him, on the other hand I find his complacency unbearable, untouched by a scene (spoiled by the trailer) in which he experiences a drastic allergic reaction to seafood Knowing that Smith will return to his threadbare, over-muscular appearance, because a fat sitcom actor (Kevin James) is at hand making a fool of himself, we're supposed to laugh hysterically when the slob starts to dance like a donkey ( Catchword "Everybody Dance Now!" By CC Music Factory), but why should an accountant behave that way with a straight arrow? I've been with several business economists for years Auditors worked with straight arrows, and I can tell you that even if Norman Mailer's memorable phrase "hard guys do not dance," even the accountants do nothing with straight arrows. Am I taking this too seriously? Or - and here's a bold thought - maybe the authors could not imagine logically drawn characters to save their lives? <br /> <br /> When we talk about the authors, they come up with a lousy idea for Smith's love interest: a writer for a tabloid (Eva Mendes). Since when do tabloids make love? In which universe am I? - Everyone here at IMDb is actually bubbling over this ridge. Either you all have to raise the bar when it comes to entertaining your money, or I'm just a skunk at the garden party. (Me and about 150 million other longtime friends and husbands.) Anyway, if I'm to imitate Smith's Hitch and give straight advice to my male readers: If you're forced to see * Hitch * say half to yourself for the better "Hey, that was pretty good" after the movie is over. Do not be overjoyed; Do not rave about it - she'll know you're lying to her. Praise it in a slightly surprised way, as if the movie was better than expected and not the torturous waste of time it was. But what do I say, people? - We guys know all movements. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars.
