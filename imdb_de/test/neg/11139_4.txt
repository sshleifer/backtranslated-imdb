From the portrayals of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the kind of film I would predict for Andy Warhol - airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The (almost non-existent) plot of the film, which is sometimes unbelievably incredible, is offset by the rough, real-looking cinematography of the film. The film looks unreal and dictates reality to the viewer. The only rewarding part of the film is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly, and everything in it should be considered a characterization tool. There are a few weird scenes I have to admit are funny, but Trash is really just a character study that involves engaging people. Drug use.
