Yes, the movie is not a work of art, but when I saw it for the first time, I was 10 years old, my parents were not there and I stayed home with my two brothers on the cycle of horror movies that had a network). It's one of the liveliest memories I have with the boys. We all ended up in a bed and covered each other to the head! Our very first horror movie! We talked about it for years and laughed at the moment. These were horror movies. Horror movies are always the same nowadays. The safest thing was that. But for me it's a great movie!
