As a fan of bad movies, I was thrilled to find a 3-pack cr @ ppy horror on Best Buy today. The set was cheap and included a terrible movie titled "The Dark," which I actually remember when he saw it in the theater. The remaining 2 were just as bad. "Creatures from the Abyss" is probably the worst. Since they were all bad, that does not say much. But the stupidity, the bad acting, the terrible effects and the delayed action really made it fun to watch them. With every new land development I rolled on the ground. The discovery of the abandoned ship, the missing crew, the realization that something was terribly wrong !!! It was great!!! Of course, everyone's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene. OH MY GOD!! I almost lost it !!! Between the one and the "monster camera" I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of bad movies. I enjoyed it, but in all fairness I had to give that movie a 1. IT WHAT AFFUL ... But if garbage is your bag, then at least let it hire you ... (YES the bad pun was intended)
