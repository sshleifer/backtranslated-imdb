The Texas Revolution from 1835 to 1836, including the periods before and immediately after, is featured in this mediocre three-hour television movie, the only redeeming value of which is Stephen F. Austin, "the father of Texas," whose life story was told by the legendary Sam Houston was overshadowed for a long time. The rest of the film is simply the usual plot "Santa Anna is a Tyrant" and with a feeble attempt to show the Mexican perspective with a fictional Hispanic character showing a stereotypical Latin machismo. Combined with short low-budget combat scenes like Alamao and San Jacinto, this movie is only recommended for real history buffs who are not from Mexico. The Mexican uniforms look excellent and the romantic subplot (another love triangle) does not need too much time on the screen. Overall, the film shows the violent secessionist movement of the Anglo-Saxon minority in Texas as a positive and just revolution against Mexican tyranny as embodied by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the so-called "Napoleon of the West."
