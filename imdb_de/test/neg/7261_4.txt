In remote areas of the Arctic, something strange happens. A weather station of the Luftwaffe is destroyed, its inmates are missing. An Eskimo village is destroyed. A fishing vessel disappears. Curious spores find themselves in the snow. Near a destroyed aircraft is a four-foot living organism. The piece looks like half the claw of a giant Alaskan crab. The military (Craig Stevens as Air Force officer) and his experts are stunned. A renowned scientist (William Hopper) and his handsome assistant (Alix Taltan) are called from New York. Hopper deduces from this threadbare evidence that it is a monstrous mantis. He's right. The pretty assistant looks randomly out of the office window and sees the hideous face with the big eyeballs staring at her. She leaves what she carries with her, claps her hands on her cheeks and screams in horror. <br /> <br /> The mantis flies south along the Gulf Stream, pausing to attack key populations such as Washington and New York, and buses and people to eat. Military weapons do not really affect him, but eventually Stevens crashes into his jet fighter, damaging the animal that comes to Earth and occupies the "Manhattan Tunnel" connecting New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stevens, who survived the collision, leads his team into the tunnel and kills the big mistake with "3RG Mines," despite his fierce looks, threatening behavior, and breaking roar. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while Hopper chuckles and takes a picture of him. <br /> <br /> Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Like the deadly praying mantis herself, the formula at this time was panting and gasping for breath, jumping around and not looking for human prey, but something that resembles a fresh or original idea. A clich√© was overlooked. Hopper would have had to quickly invent a Super Duper DDT that could defeat the insect alone. This should fill the 3RG mines, not ordinary explosives. <br /> <br /> Modeling is pretty good, considering what the budget must have been. Not much money could have been spent on anything else, because everything else is routine. Craig Stevens is bland, a face and style for a television series. William Hopper looks right - tall and silver-haired - but his instrument has only one note. The pretty assistant is pretty simple considering her role. The part calls for Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They could not act, but they carried slight but clear hints of harassment. Everything would have helped this flogged film. <br /> <br /> I wish the deadly Mantis did not scream so loud and so often because you can not yell - you can not even whisper - if you do that, you have no lungs. But I did not mind the monster in the tunnel found its downfall. A praying mantis is a graceful insect in its own, spindle-tight manner, and it's great to have it in the garden because they eat caterpillars and so on. But if you know it well, they are not very appealing. The male praying mantis is smaller and weaker than the woman, as in humans, and when the couple is copulating, the female bites the man's head as well as the human. At least the male men know when to stop. The male praying mantis copulates for a few more minutes, though she has no head now. We humans do not have mentally ill men who grow together with target-driven women. Do we do?
