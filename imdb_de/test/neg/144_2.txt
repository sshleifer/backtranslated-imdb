I somehow managed to go all the way through this movie, but I was stunned by the complete lack of entertainment. My friends and I are fans of HK Film, but WOW. This movie has everything and by that I mean everything a movie should not have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, far too much overacting action, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-footed jump kicks, impossible situations, listless gags and jokes, elementary school lessons, thoughtless murders, and even running time for the material , Imagine the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent movie and this film is even harder to bear. Quite simply, if you entertain the idea of ​​watching this movie ... not.
