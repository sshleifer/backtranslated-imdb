It's hard to comment on this movie. It's one of the few films Dimension has not put on ice (it's hard to find a reason for it), and it was shown in a nondescript 500 theater on a day the opening took place. Maybe Dimension was terrified of people reacting to a swamp creature that used a tow truck to pull apart a house bit by bit. Ray Sawyer is just a tow truck driver until he is a voodoo priestess rescuing a serious car accident and for that he is attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowning. In the morgue, Ray comes to life again, following a group of teenagers who are witnessing the terrible clash. <br /> <br /> What softens this movie are the thin characters made of paper. I did not care for a moment. Besides, the dialogue was less than loud. It was also very predictable. Characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things, like checking creaking noises, delivering people's names and stumbling on a rock while being tracked. I was also able to find out who the last girl would be right away. And why did the camera have those fast white flashes when someone died or the killer was shown? <br /> <br /> What's good? Well, there is an impressive scene where the killer walks under swampy waters to reach his victims, and an exciting sequence in which the last girl has to disguise herself with a lot of other bodies while the killer is watching. Apart from that, it's another disappointment in August / September. I was looking forward to it, but did not get what was expected.
