The movie looked pretty interesting from the trailer. The production of the film is also pretty good - it looks like they have a good budget and do not look like a cheap movie. Acting ranges from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The actual content and plot of the movie are weak. The film begins as if it could become interesting, ending with a badly executed, disappointingly boring twist. Watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the movie would have fixed this movie, but everything in between makes this movie an absolutely boring movie. It's as if they were shooting a short film and then trying to force it to be more than an hour by filling the center with an hour of filler live, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this extremely boring movie.
