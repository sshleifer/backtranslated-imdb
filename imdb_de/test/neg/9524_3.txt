AKA <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 3 x 1.78: 1 within 2.39: 1 image (triptych) Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978: A working The Class children (Matthew Leitch) start from a false identity and destroy the high society, where he learns rigorous lessons about the divisions between rich and poor. <br /> <br /> Autobiographical feature by director Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MY LIFE ... YOUR FAULT), an expos√© of the pre-that-Archeric aristocracy, seen through the eyes of a low-income commoner, whose outlook is through his Adventure in the upper classes is changed. Unfortunately, Roy's screenplay tells very little about the excesses of the wealthy rich, and the tale is only briefly fueled by Leitch's relationship with a handsome, but self-destructive retirement boy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the people who he wants to imitate. Also with Diana Quick (as an outrageous snob who thinks workers of the working class are "embarrassed to be alive!"), Bill Nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson ("EastEnders"), Blake Ritson (DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typically flamboyant cameo that flashes their breasts anywhere and everywhere without caring about the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of Roy's insistence on a triptych effect is watered down by the insistence of Roy (three separate 1.78: 1 images are displayed in a 2.39: 1 image field in letterbox form each of which provides a different view of each scene), which reduces the size of the image and removes the viewer from the events on the screen. A long, pointless film, too personal for a broad appeal and hampered by a cinematic process that does not reconcile the present story. A single image version is also available (theatrically framed to 1.85: 1). The screen is titled AKA: LIES ARE LIKE WISHES.
