I found this Robin Williams vehicle to be mildly amusing. I think you would call it a kind of political satire. It's about a moderator / comedian on the political talk show who decides to run for president and win unexpectedly, and Robin Williams is far more cautious and relaxed than usual. I would say the movie is more a drama than a comedy, with a bit of mystery and tension. I think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedies and the mystery and suspense aspect (though that's a small part of the movie) worked best. So far, I would not rate this movie very high. For me, it was an OK waste of 2 hours, but nothing special. My best advice would be to catch it on TV / cable or rent it cheaply before you make a decision on whether to buy it. My vote for Man of the Year is a 4/10
