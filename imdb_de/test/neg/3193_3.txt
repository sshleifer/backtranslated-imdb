The intertwined aspects can be a good idea in some movies. Here it is a total mess. <br /> <br /> But the total mess begins with the story: A video clip Bummy wants to make a light comedy with a pernicious Noir-like female character. She is great and no man could fight back to dive, crawl and suck her toes. It is all the more materialistic and looks like butter does not melt in her mouth. <br /> <br /> The film melts in its own presumption: smart / funny / good-looking. Phalocretinism at its best. Please only white trash.
