All I know is that this movie is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon had done since the end of The Facts of Life. When I searched her name, this relatively new television movie was made. After much research, I managed to find a copy and was very disappointed with what I saw. D Grade actors, bad script, terrible effects - it was like watching a lazy, stupefied version of Day After Tomorrow that took 3 hours. Despite the long runtime, the characters are quite underdeveloped, we do not care about them at all, and in most cases, they long for their demise. Combine that with terrific lighting and cinematography and you have a real catastrophe of a movie. How they got so many "name" actors (ie, Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, and Brian Dennehy) to appear in such garbage is overwhelming. In conclusion - I would like to return these 3 hours of my life !!!
