Wow, even American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance now have more material for adults than WWE (at least the casting has a bunch of people who abuse the judges), and here's WWE, with one of the worst steps in television history to fight has turned into PG. Well, if I change sometimes to see what's going on, I get the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Hornswoggle, the ugly dwarf who shares his place with the main organizers, for seemingly no reason, except for of course, to thrill the young fans against Chavo Guerrero, a skilled wrestler, in every game. <br /> <br /> 2) One host (arghh ....!) every week to spoil the otherwise present teaspoon of fun. All these hosts are cheap B-class celebrities who try to catapult themselves back into glory by cracking horrendous, 5-year jokes and making stupid credentials. 3) Cryme Time and a female wrestler (forgot her name, most likely Eve) who teaches various "street words" (sobs) that are neither street nor cool. They were fun in the past, stolen things and are loud mouths. <br /> <br /> 4) The divas are dressed in unsurpassed outfits who do their best to look "sexy, smart and powerful" (by the way, I hate that statement. Remember, when Torrie, Trish and Sable are there Those were the times, and these divas are bad wrestlers, which adds to the misery I've seen some old WWE Vintage Collection matches and the Divas there were "professional" not amateur. <br /> <br /> 5) PG movement limits so many things: almost no blood during the games, DX is terribly irritating, John Cena makes even more patriotism act, crowd with many kids (which are so annoying), almost no heels, etc. <br /> <br /> 6) And yes, why should PPVs be kept so often? Every month have you lost it? There is never a feud or rivalry created and those that are made look wrong and just-to-the-PPV-surprise. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and a few of his quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, you are wat ching the longest running television show in history" (every week "< br /> <br /> "The attack of BRUTAL and VICIOUS by (he does not use it for others) Randy Orton / Legacy" <br /> <br /> "A vicious attack on Stephanie McMohan, Triple-H's husband !! ! ??? "<br /> <br /> WWE is almost at an end now Hope Vince gets up from his sleep and does something (bring back the era TV-14 or attitude) 2 out of 10 for the current one State of WWE.
