This film is about a depressed and emotionally constrained man who has a distant relative in his apartment in Istanbul. Over time, their relationship becomes more and more tense, until at last he begins to yell at his housemate - who is unemployed and does not like to look for work. That's actually the biggest part of the movie. The problem is that while emotionally-depressed and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and not communicative, they do not lead to a very satisfying movie. That's because he (and his roommate) mostly just stares into space and says nothing. I think all those shallow moments could have been shortened to a 30-minute movie - that would not have bothered me.
