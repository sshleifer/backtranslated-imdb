Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are planning swing bachelors to kidnap a casino, Ocean's 11, and attach it to the Hell's Angels. Bad train. For a movie with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND with current Hell's Angels this movie is surprisingly tame. The Hell's Angels really deserve a better movie centered around them. Not this cold. Fortunately, this is one of the DVDs with comments by Joe Bob Briggs, so the pain you have to endure is greatly reduced. If you think otherwise, let me suggest something to you. NOT !! <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Joe Bob Briggs Comment; Conny Van Dyke's message to her fans (she has more than one?); Photo Gallery; Theatrical trailer; and followers for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
