Rarely do you find a movie so bad that it reaches the much sought-after paradigm of having so little revenue that it alone is worth seeing. "Cyclone", I am pleased to report, is such a movie. <br /> <br /> I knew I was doing something good once I found the videotape. I'm at least the fourth owner: it has a $ 9.95 used movie sale sticker on the front and a yard sale sticker for a dollar. I picked it up for fifty cents at a thrift store. <br /> <br /> The Used Movie Sale! The sticker covers most of the covers on the front, which means that what I see is a really unusual mix from the front of the Cyclone Super Bike, a car that's on fire, and Heather Thomas, the Flouncy Eighties Hair with open mouth carries expression, which says: "I have a pain." I saw that and thought, "ALL RIGHT." The case was honest enough ("turning nowhere with no one to trust anyone, Teri being dipped headlong into a maze of danger and deception"), but I surprised myself when I actually watched it. I always make time for the really bad movies. The fight club band can wait. <br /> <br /> Meet Teri. Teri is an amazingly well-made figure, as we can see in her introduction, in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and later her leg warmers. Then Teri sets off to meet her friend for the evening, which is terribly wrong. Before she knows it, Teri is "driven straight into a net of deadly crosses" in CYCLONE. The VHS box says it's like it is. <br /> <br /> Left out of the box summary - maybe from a faint hope that actual copies of this movie would be sold - so awful is the acting. It might just be me, but I always thought I could read the thoughts of the characters through their eyes. "That's stupid," says Heather Thomas. "I know," villain thinks with too wide a mouth. <br /> <br /> A driving force (no pun intended) for the second half of this epic image are the chases. They were actually pretty good, although I think gasoline does not need coaching to explode. What really impressed me is that the streets were pretty empty during all the chases. It's like there are only twenty people in this huge city. I know what you think. They think, "Gee Wilikers, I have to see this movie!" The sad thing is that you can not find it. Oh no. "Cyclone" is a movie that finds you. Just wait. One day - maybe during lunch, maybe late in the evening, maybe "when military scientist Jeffery Combs ('re-animator') is murdered by hired killers" - you will hear the rustle of leg warmers and know it's time.
