This movie features Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hitman for some Russian gangsters from Buffalo. He is also a raving alcoholic, and this has resulted in his work performance waning. After falling asleep in his car during a possible beat, his mob boss sends him to San Francisco to attend AA meetings and get a job as assistant to the dying man. If you think that makes absolutely no sense, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> It's getting worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not much, much worse. Frank, despite a lack of training, suddenly becomes a master of burials, but his reactions to the people in the funeral home and the AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to root for him as he sees positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as a sponsor to Frank, although he has almost nothing to do (his character tells us he is gay, but that does not mean anything). The movie crashes with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character into idiocy. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest in Frank stumbles because the two actors have no chemistry. By the time she comes into the picture, Frank becomes much less captivating as a character. His characterization is seemingly random. There is no consequence in his behavior. The comedy is unobtrusive and only occasionally funny, especially considering the comedic descent of the casts disappointing. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It switches between Italian, Russian and Spanish. Throughout the film, Frank tells many people that he's a drummer (including an entire AA group), but it does not seem to interest or interest anyone. The film relies on clich√© scenes to bring it through its final plot, especially when Leoni's unbearable character pursues Frank at the airport as he's about to make a return flight to Buffalo. The film has a strong premise and an interesting first half-hour, The movie quickly becomes a total catastrophe and turns into complete nonsense. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates a year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years because I have not seen "You Kill Me". <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
