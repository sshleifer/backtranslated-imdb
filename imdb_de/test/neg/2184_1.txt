It was hard for me to take care of these characters, who were either angry or bland, all living in their hilarious city life. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was sometimes uncomfortable, and at other times the narrative seemed difficult to follow - Was it me or were entire scenes deleted? <br /> <br /> It felt like a poor sitcom was somehow turned into a movie. The stereotypes and jokes about "male groups" might have been funny at the beginning of the 90s. So it comes that much of the humor of the film comes here - and boy, he gets old quickly. Apart from the attractive Irishman, this movie was a dudel. And not even "that bad is good". The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. Perhaps, if you've never met homosexuals or thought of homosexuality, this film might have something meaningful to say. Otherwise - darling, it would be better to rent The Boys in The Band or Beautiful Thing.
