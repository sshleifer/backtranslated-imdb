I hated the book. A guy meets a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend and is constantly being followed by a hit man and a monkey beast (both want the dog). Dean Koontz really can not write (I read the book on my sister's recommendation, I should have known better). When I saw that (mostly out of curious curiosity), I actually criticized myself because it was not true for the book, even though this is a book that you can not make a good movie of. At least I thought that if they made a movie adaptation of the worst book I've ever read, the filmmakers might be just as accurate. You've made a boy and his mother out of the guy and his virgin love interest, for some reason that bothered me the most (though I seriously doubt he's a guy and his chick would not have done it better). Quite easy; bad book, bad movie, do not see it.
