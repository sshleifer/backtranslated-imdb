If this movie was shot two years ago, it could have been a lot better. Unfortunately, no idea was made of how a horror movie should look or act this decade. The first time I heard about this movie, IMDb classified it as a sequel to Cheerleader Camp. Oh, how wrong they were. Yes, Betsy Russell was there, but Uma Thurman certainly was not. I would really like to find the person who started with the whole successor rumor. I'm sure many of us would do that. I will not reveal anything because I honestly can not remember how this movie ends? I'll just tell you to see a real camp horror movie ... The Burning with Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and the Fast Times Geek at Ridgemont High. A word to the wise - Just because a horror movie has the word camp in the title does not mean that it's worth being viewed. Oh, and one more thing, every HORROR FLICK that was made in the early 90s of the last century has been considered incredibly good so far!
