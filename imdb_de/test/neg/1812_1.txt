The movie Heart of Darkness is an insult to the book by Joseph Conrad! To be honest, the movie made me fall asleep. On the other hand, the book was definitely extraordinary. I feel that the film has omitted some important elements and missed some of the key points from the book. In addition, the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The book is not an adventure story or easy to understand, but full of hidden meanings and interesting twists in the plot. The book is amazing, though it is very confusing and complex. When you finally understand it, you feel that you have actually learned something. The novella or short story had several key ideas such as futility and craziness that the film omitted. In addition, some key scenes were changed, which in turn affected the entire plot. Many of the scenes seemed to be very "choppy" in that they did not match. In summary, the film seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend the movie if you can not see or understand the book, but otherwise I would skip this movie. It was terrible and in complete disarray. If you've never read the book, do not look at the movie because you'll need the basic information from the book to understand the movie. The film was a terrible break from an excellent and detailed book.
