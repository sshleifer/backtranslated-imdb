This movie "Vampires: The Turning" is not even worth the 2 out of 10 points I give. The movie is very predictable from start to finish as our hero kills the leader of the vampire hunters. The use of music in this movie was even bad, it kept going as if you expected something important to happen, even though it was never the case. Acting was B-Rank at best ... and the movie was just boring. The only reason why I give this movie a 2 out of 10 points is that the story had potential, though in the end it could not deliver. Oh, and did I mention the wardrobe? The wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to "nonexistent" because our hero and his girlfriend (who he tries to save throughout the movie) wear the same outfits throughout the movie. I would only recommend this movie if you are really bored and do not have a good wall of fresh paint to look dry on. ~ Dave, the horror cowboy
