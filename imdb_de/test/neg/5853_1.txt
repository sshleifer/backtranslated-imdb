The comic stories of Michael Allred, especially his work on Madman, are usually a lot of fun. "Astroesque," Allred's no-budget Indy movie, is the opposite of fun. <br /> <br /> Worst acting, coupled with a truly dreadful dialogue, makes for a brutal cinematic experience. Pretty sure Allred understands WTF, but he's the only one. It is not enough to watch the whole mess, but it is not enough to stop you, to watch the whole mess. <br /> <br /> "Astroesque" is a kind of film associated with Allred's "Red Rocket" 7 "comic book which, ironically, is mostly unreadable, so if your" astroesque "experience is not terrible enough They track down the oversized comics and continue the fun. <br /> <br /> Allred was tired of being out of his mind to try a movie, and I was sorry, what an incredible waste of my time and money Please buy my VHS copy, which is now available on eBay.
