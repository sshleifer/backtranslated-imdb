I was tired of several attempts to sit down and watch this program "Gilmore Girls". It baffled me because I just could not put my finger on what it was about. Was it a young woman who had a young baby and never grew up? Was it the case that the daughter was more responsible than the mother? Was it about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What is this show about? After all, I just did not care. The cast makes me scream. The writing is neither "intelligent" nor "intelligent", it is syrupy and boring. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch then? Because I've heard so many good things about it and I can not voice an opinion until I've seen. Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong, so I've watched a few times. When I saw this for the first time, I saw the mother walking around as if she were 12 years old, and the daughter was behaving like 40. Maybe that did not attract me. I've never liked one of the "Freaky Friday" movies - not to say that it does, but there are some similarities. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend watching this show every week. So I asked her, "What's this show about?" A very smart young woman, usually articulated, whom she could never directly answer. So I asked others who are excited about it - they really do not know it. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls turns out to be a TV program that's like an art house movie. Many of us will not understand, but those who are leaving are desperately trying to find a meaning that really does not exist, just to be "hip." Yes, I find Lauren Graham's Lorelai annoying - whining, wailing, nasal crying. A whole hour of it. Impressive. And the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The city is hokey, the men are cuddly, the grandparents are boring, and unfortunately I find nothing redeeming these characters or worry about everything they do. It's like seeing paint drying on the wall.
