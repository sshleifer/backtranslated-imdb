I remember, when this came out, this was the first kung fu movie we've ever seen, and we were all excited to see it for sure, bad dubbing, bad filmmaking, or more precisely the way Chinese used to be Made films. They were undoubtedly inferior, but here there was an entertainment value that prevailed safely. The kung fu excitement had begun, and Bruce Lee and The Chinese Connection would soon follow with either Jimmy Wang Yu or The Chinese Boxer. In any case, this film was chosen as a pioneer.
