I just watched an episode (S1- # 5 A Boy in the Bush), so maybe my review is not very fair. <br /> <br /> But based on this episode, this is a very bad version of CSI. the action is crap. The main character, Dr. whatever her name is, it is so wrong that it really hurts. I would not get her to give her a supplement for dog food! <br /> <br /> The other hurtful thing is David Boreanaz from "Angel", a good actor who does a good job, but a lavish impression leaves this woman's idiotic spectacle. <br/> <br /> The support of the cast is OK, but due to this stupid acting by Emily Deschanel everything is ruined. Very disappointing version of CSI, very sorry to see it appears on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it. <br /> <br /> This woman is really shit, at least in this episode. But due to this one view, I will not even invest if I would see it on an elevator screen.
