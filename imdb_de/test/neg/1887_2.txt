I saw this movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was awful. Now that I'm older, I found it just as terrible. Universal could have been better. They just decided to make as much money as they could, using all their monsters at once. It was a cheap shot for me. These characters could assert themselves in their own films, and the choice of actors was regrettable. Dracula had to be Bela Lugosi, Frankenstein's monster, Karloff. <br /> <br /> In my eyes, it was the disastrous episode of Disney that was made decades ago and it was not appreciated. Umiversal began with something great and original, and then thought they could counteract the masses with the punch that is very clear in this film.
