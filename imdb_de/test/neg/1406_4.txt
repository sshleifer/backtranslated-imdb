Viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they will see stories about dysfunctional families, and they expect them to be expected, and it is becoming more and more of a challenge to keep them fresh, but here it seems despite the good occupation to be more equal. The story is about the Travis family trying to recover from the suicide of Matt (Kip Pardue), a promising high school swimmer. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is the father who retreats from everyone and has never treated his other son Tim (Emile Hirsch) and Matt, but he (somehow) communicates with his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver), who finds his supplies pot and starts smoking. <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy also starts flirting with much younger men, like the check-out cashier in the grocery store, but when she tries to buy more marijuana She was released and sent to prison. She does not tell anyone what happened, but she discovers bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben has taken a leave of absence from work. After all, Sandy happens to get sick and ends up in the hospital where her life is in danger, forcing Ben to realize that he may have to lose another part of his family. <br /> <br /> This film is written and directed by Dan Harris, who has worked with Bryan Singer for "X2" and also for the upcoming Superman movie and though his script allows these characters real moments, their pain and theirs Too much confusion, history has just too many things for me. The script touches so many different areas that you need a scorecard to capture all the information, including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimenting with homosexuality and a life-threatening illness. If all these scenarios were not enough for you, Harris, then a twist at the end of the plot that is supposed to explain the most of all feelings towards Tim. While I rolled my eyes at least two or three times with the scroll scrolling one thing at a time, I have to admit that I did not hate this movie, and I have to blame the actors for it. Everyone has at least one good scene in the movie, but I wish the story had focused more on Weaver and her character than on Hirsch. Weaver is extraordinary and with a sharper script she could have played a role that might have led to an Oscar nomination. Instead, we get endless scenes of deer at parties or his players with the neighbor next door. Harris shows that he can be a good writer / director, but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material is just tedious and tedious.
