This film was a complete catastrophe for me. There is one thing that movies need to have in order to be seen, and that is some psychological credibility of the characters ... Unfortunately, this is not the case here. The main characters are mostly irrational, and even if they have a reason for doing so, the director will not tell us. Sophie Marceau's character is particularly irritating. She takes pictures of everything throughout the film, if anything more reasonable could be expected (such as a meeting with her mother in the hospital) ... and why exactly did she marry this man? (No, that's not a spoiler) The plot sometimes seems to have been demolished like a soap opera, and although the actors do not play bad, that does not help much. All in all, I just could not find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I tried too much after the first hour. I've never been out of the movie during a movie, but this time it was the longest in my life.
