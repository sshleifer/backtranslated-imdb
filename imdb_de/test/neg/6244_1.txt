After reading many good things about it, I finally saw "the clearing". With a cast of great actors like Redford and Dafoe, you'd expect at least a decent movie. After the credits rolled, I was still shocked at how bad and incoherent this movie actually was. <br /> <br /> Should it be an "art" movie? I do not think it's too melodramatic. The bad thing is that the drama seems far too compelling and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense. First, it never really explains the motive for one of the characters' actions, it just blows the so-called "personal questions." What's so bad about Redford's character that he needs to "clear it up?" The fact that he occasionally cheats on his wife? The guy is a millionaire who has had a good life, has a great son and a great daughter, a woman who loves him (and a girlfriend who also seems to be well above the generic male type) and a newborn grandson The problem seems to be that he ... has worked hard all his life to be a successful person. Like this? It seems his hard work has really paid off and there are not really any problems with his life. <br /> <br /> Then we come to Dafoe's character: Here is someone who was a manager at a Redford company and was fired. Why is this guy unemployed for eight years? It seems he has to have some kind of good education to have a job that he had in the first place and that was a man with solid ideas about his work (as evidenced by his flashback to a conversation he had with Redford when he worked for him) Why could not such a man get a decent job and have a decent life? Because he was once fired? Totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The film really tries to tease these men as "souls" or something and that looks really cheesy. Actually, I would say if the creators of this movie were trying to say something about the American dream they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> As for the actual events during the movie, they make no sense whatsoever. The last 20 minutes of the film are an insult to the audience because there is not one thing that actually makes sense. Redford seems to have about 1000 chances, but he does not. In a moment he is ready to flee, and yet he misses his chance because he feels sorry for his kidnapper and does not want to hurt him! Then Dafoe picks up his weapon from the water and from the mud, which should be pointless (if you fire a shot with a gun after the weapon is in the water and mud will possibly puff up in your face) and the weapon is in perfect condition! !! The way in which an unemployed, useless (as shown in this film) and mentally unstable character outwits the FBI with such ease brings the narrative of this film to "twilight zones." The cheesy end (with Redford's illusion) At the conclusion of the beholder. <br /> <br /> This movie pretends to be something, it is not (ie a high-quality, sophisticated psychological thriller). Unfortunately, the film fails so hard that it becomes a disaster and the word best describes this film: a disaster.
