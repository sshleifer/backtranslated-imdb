I am proud to be a Dutchman and I am really shocked by such flicks. Why? why this cheap spectacle? Why this story that just shit? Why a dozen sequels? why o why? You add many hot Dutch chicks to save this movie from salvation, and you know what? All underage breezergirlies in Holland go and see it. I had to see it at a party. All the girls were crazy when Daan Schuurmans walked into the screen, all the guys drank another beer and grumbled ... But what really bothers me is the fact that these are the only movies Dutch filmmakers can produce ... (apart from "Van God Los" and "Lek") This does not prove that we are superior to other countries. It does not add anything to our imagination ... It just catches the nerves of little 13-year-old girls ... Johan Nijenhuis, I hope you burn forever!
