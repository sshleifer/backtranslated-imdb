I happened to watch this movie (movie?) And I never stopped watching because it's so ridiculous that any dog ​​can play this act and be better than the actors (actors?) Of this bad remake of Fatal Attraction , no game, just an unfortunate copy of the Adrian Lyne movie, if you doubt suicide, look at that and you can vote ... for "yes" I can not imagine people going to those Cinema to see this garbage; Maybe someone who had an empty afternoon and chose the first cinema near the house to spend two hours with some others to forget about problems, but it's hard to go home relaxed
