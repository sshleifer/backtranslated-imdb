I'm sorry, folks, but anyone who says this is a great documentary ... and this award she won at Sundance ... well, you've all been cheated. I've heard for a couple of years how to watch this documentary and finally looked at it. Maybe in 1999, when it came out and reality TV was not so dominant in the industry, this movie seemed to be entertaining. But Mike and Mark obviously play themselves, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are funny and some of the lines seem to be off the cuff, but mostly they do not sound right. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yeah, people are real, they're not actors, but it's exaggerated, and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe that so many people believe it's the real deal. I was not deceived, so it was a bit boring. Slightly amusing, but not much if you miss it.
