This review applies to the British DVD set with three discs. The first CD is called "Caught In The Wild" and includes model behavior, hunting for Jamie and "Fast and Curious". The second CD is called Bedroom Fantasias and contains Blue Plate Special, Back to Pleasure and Love Potion # 10. The last CD is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She is the boss and rightfully her. Why the other four episodes of the series are not included, is a mystery, because on the disks there is enough space for much more material. <br /> <br /> Each episode begins with the reading of hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) a letter from a satisfied customer. We then learn how the story evolves as guests check in at the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception, as this story comes from a waitress. Authors should be recognized for a good variety of storylines. For example, Model Behavior is two models that are fighting for the attention of the photography crew. Falling In Lust Again is about a man and a woman who break up and revive their love when they meet again at the hotel; She is the boss of an angry male secretary / dog who shows that he is more of a man than his boss has recognized - much to her delight. All episodes cause too much nudity and sex. <br /> <br /> It should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and pretty fellows. Even the geeky secretaries change when they take off their glasses and lower their hair. The sex action is plentiful, but seems too hectic and wrong. The camerawork could have been done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time nearby, moving around to hold on to everything, and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. Finally, the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida, is mentioned, although there is no Singer Island on my map of Florida. The landscape certainly looks more Florida than Utah or Las Vegas, some of which have mentioned. This is a pretty good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still waiting for a DVD release in the UK. 4 stars
