This film has something bad and basically the way in which it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our compassion for its admittedly awful situation. Sampedro, like many who have lost hope, chooses suicide. The fact that he has been thinking about it for more than 26 years is probably worsening his condition, but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks for, even if it means ending a life, is deeply wrong, in my opinion. What a contrast to the uplifting example of the scientist Stephen Hawkings, who suffered far worse from a much worse condition! However, morality is upside down, and the movie is reveling in hero worship, and the people they disagree with are portrayed in simple, idiotic terms. Especially in the encounter with the priest, there is little room (deliberately manipulating the encounter in real life, which was with a much younger priest). In this way I assume that the film is comparable to Riefenstahl's triumph of the will. The insidious idea is that everyone must have the right to take their own lives if they feel that they can not live anymore. It does not matter if you are physically or mentally damaged. There are obviously people who think they have the right to vote. The same people will probably go for an abortion. It is all part of the current trend to put the suffering or the sufferer out of sight, to brush it under the carpet. OK, and we are all very happy with us. So we go the smooth way of believing that some lives are simply not worth living, and then we decide that some people can not really decide for themselves, then we make the state decide to go with them. Adolf Hitler enters directly from the other Oscar contender "the downfall". Of course, Hitler believes that he does exactly what nature does to eliminate the weak. Under his regime there were forced abortions under the "weaker" burdens, the mentally handicapped were quietly cleared away and the Jews liquidated "humanely" with gas. He would have applauded this movie, and why not, he is in line With his philosophy ... "Some lives are simply not worth living". I am different from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and all the people who are involved in this film. Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and a gift. Commitment: No one decides to give birth. Who can choose death? It's not about religion, it's about protecting the weak and helpless, something that undermines this movie a lot!
