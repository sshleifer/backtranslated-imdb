This movie was filmed and filmed in 1987, but was released in cinemas in 1990. When I saw this movie, I saw the good intentions he had, but I'm afraid there was not much talent or experience behind the camera for it to work. The story takes place in California in the 1890s and some Italian immigrants who own vineyards are said to have to leave their land for a railway line to pass through. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan, who offered money for the country but was rejected. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero and he is proud to go and asks the other peasants to get up and fight to keep their land. Berrigan becomes impatient and hires a number of thugs to force everyone to flee. These thugs are led by a man named Andrews (Burt Young) and he does not hesitate to kill anyone who causes him any trouble. Andrews and his men kill Collogero one night, and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) vows to seek revenge and regain the land for all. Marco blows up the bridge that the railroad would need and they also destroy a tunnel, which holds back the project for several months and Berrigan now draws heat from other investors. This film was staged by Peter Masterson and, in addition to "The Trip To Bountiful," he has at best a spotty career as a director. He's a good actor, but here he seems to be above his head. This was a movie that urgently needed more attention to detail and is easy to see that it did not happen. Robert's hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s, but probably 1890! The cinematographer is Toyomichi Kurita, who was a good cameraman in the end, but this was only his fourth movie, and he certainly had not learned everything yet. It's not a sharp-looking movie at all, and I've noticed in several settings throughout the day that the sun would be dazzled by something and the scenes did not have the crispness that would have helped the overall picture. The script is just a revenge story, and there are no surprises as the movie progresses. We know Giannini will get it and it just seemed to be a matter of time. The cast is top notch and they do their best, but the whole movie looks uninspired. This was promoted as Julia Roberts film debut, but I'm not sure if that's true. She may have previously appeared in a movie called Firehouse.
