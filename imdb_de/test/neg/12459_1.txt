It was so incoherent - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the "thief" was obvious. It was a poor man (not to mention high school) "less than zero". I would pass on this movie because it has little to add. So many problems are not solved yet, and that's fine - but the fact that it jumps so hard that you wonder what's going on is terrible. The voice-over is required because the movie does not work by itself. Avoid this movie and look at something else about the rich teenage fear. I'm sure there are many others. Do not waste your time with it.
