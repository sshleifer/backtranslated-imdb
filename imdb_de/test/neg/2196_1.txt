[as a new resolution for this year 2005, i decide to write a comment for every film I saw in the theater (10%) or on DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I have to admit that DVD has revolutionized this habit. For example, I can hear the true voice of the cast, which is an essential feature of the personality. In my country, non-French films are dubbed and we end up with deviations: French voice is terrible, very far from their original tone! the same voice for different people or for the same people with different voices !!!! <br /> <br /> And if all my comments were considered useless, then in 2006 I'll stop reviewing ... Ah, AH ... Well, now enjoy them! ] <br /> <br /> My summary means that the story, the locations and the cast are not very pleasing. <br /> <br /> Just .... <br /> <br /> Sandra Bullock is there .. She's a talented actress who can make the viewer watch the movie ... <br / > <br /> It's reminiscent of a female "the airitive" .... So if you're looking for a movie where you can escape your life, watching this movie makes it even worse because Sandra's life is a mess the touch for depression) .... <br /> <br /> In fact, she has a sad life at the beginning of the film, has a sadder life throughout the movie, to finally come back to it in the end .. .. What a happy ending !!!! <br /> <br /> Maybe the writers wanted to say something about the life of a nerd ... <br /> <br /> very far away from the best computer movie ever: * WARGAMES *
