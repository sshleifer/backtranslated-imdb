I rented this movie, knowing that it would be bad (I just saw a good Disney sequel and that was toy story 2), but it went way below my expectations. I'm a tough Disney fan and I just do not believe in sequels to Disney movies. For someone who did not grow up with the classics (either when he came out or hired them since birth), that's a nice story. I just have the feeling that the conspiracy was pulled a little too far and was too predictable. The only thing that annoyed me most was the voices of the girls of Lady and Tramp. They were too high. Although most reviews say it's not that bad, I think that if you're a true Disney fan, you should not waste time with this one more sequels to any of the other classics coming soon.
