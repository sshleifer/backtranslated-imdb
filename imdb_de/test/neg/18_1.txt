The bloody birthday opens to a view of the Meadowvale General Hospital. There, during a total eclipse, three babies are born at exactly the same time. A caption informs us that it is now "Meadowvale, California, June 1, 1980". Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope), set out in an open grave. You hear sounds and Duke investigates. Both Duke and Annie are being murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is amazed and has only the grip of a jump rope of a child, which Annie held as a hint. Unfortunately, Sheriff Brody can not solve the case before his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) assassinate him. Just as Sheriff Brody is finished and another boy from her class, Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel) shows up, the three murderers are not showing how much he has seen. Soon after the incident, Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis at a junkyard. Curtis locks Timmy in an old locker. Timmy escapes and tells his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she does not believe him at first. The three children continue their murder rush. Her strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg), a loving couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van, and Debbie's older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among her victims. Joyce begins to have her suspicions about Debbie, Curtis and Steven, which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent-looking ten-year-olds are truly soulless killers? <br /> <br /> Co-writing and directing by Ed Hunt I have a strong dislike of this movie. I think it's absolutely terrible and does not have a single pleasing aspect of the 83 minute runtime. The script of Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the motives of the child killers beyond the eclipse that Saturn blurs out, and for bizarre astrological reasons, these three children have no conscience, so these are the only children ever born a total eclipse? If this is true, why are they waiting until just before their tenth birthday before they begin the murder? I think it happens suddenly, right? It's a pretty good pace, but I still found it incredibly boring and boring to sit through it. The movie as a whole is very exciting and predictable, the children are revealed as murderers within the first 10 minutes and as I mentioned earlier, no motive is given. It is also sometimes very stupid. Look at the scene where Debbie Steven stops by throwing a bowl of water over him! The death of the sheriff is due to his falling down some steps. Yes, the injuries caused by this type of accident are not the same as if you had been beaten to death with a baseball bat, just as he was in fact a competent physician or the pathologist would have discovered that within 5 seconds , Not a single drop of blood has been spilled throughout the movie, and all lame killings are boring and unimaginative. There is a bit of crazy nudity when Debbie asks 25c to let boys pee through a hole while her sister strips Beverly. There's an early scene just after the 5-minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen into the living room and the boom microphone on top of the screen is clearly visible. The general incompetence persists throughout the film. The entire production is bland and immediately forgotten. The acting is all bad, these three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves from the start and made it even more annoying with this movie, especially Curtis in his geeky oversized glasses. I just hate this movie, so easy. I can not think of anything good. To avoid in any case.
