When I saw this movie, I felt like a plastic bag was slowly closing around my head. Acting was terribly stifling and it was bad acting. The most brilliant spectacle of the entire film was the guy who had to be kicked out of the ground in a coffin. I only felt relief when it was finally over. I had expected this movie to become a real tragedy, with a profound psychological intrigue in the episode. It was stupid all around, no beginning, no climax, no end, it just went on and on. Let's be real here. This is a terrible movie.
