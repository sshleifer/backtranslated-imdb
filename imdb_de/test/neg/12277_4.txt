A CBS radio program titled "We the People" is helping to find an American home for Viennese refugee Charles Coburn (as Karl Braun), an experienced surgeon and pool hustler. He arrives with the beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni) who "studies" to become a nurse. Moved to a small, dusty Midwestern village, they are welcomed by John Wayne (as John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as 'Nunk' Atterbury), a vet, at the station. Ms. Gurie is dissatisfied in the dustpan and wants to leave. Immediately. But the prospect of a romance with Mr. Wayne could change her mind ... <br /> <br /> God answers the many prayers of the citizens for rain, but it is not enough to save the peasant city. The entire city was to move to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and endure. Coburn receives an invitation to work in a top clinic. And Gurie learns that her fianc√©, who is probably dead, will arrive to claim her as his wife. She feels obliged to accept; But he has a dark secret ... This film does not flatter Wayne, who pulls out of his element. Being promoted with Gurie as Garbo does not help. They have a cute scene in Wayne's car ("Jalopy, an Italian car"). **** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
