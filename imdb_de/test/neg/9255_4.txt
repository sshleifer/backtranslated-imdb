Well, finally, take a look at this underrated strip. But you can not find a good copy of it, terrible copy full of green drops, the editing is not in sync, the sound sometimes makes a terrible hiss and sometimes you can even hear the camera recording. All in all, it is too dark, a waist of time should be said, but it is not. It's a bit slow, the first half of the movie speaks and makes love to each other. It's even weird that the girls do not wear bras in movies from the 1960s. When they enter the bedroom, it is full of glory. Anyway, banned in the UK since 84 and still on the list of video nasties. The reason is simple, it's bloody for their time. It really has some nasty fragmentation and it's kind of scary due to the fact that it's being handycam-kind filmed. So every picture that moves the picture moves with the steadycam. The horrible ones could have been better if the quality of the movie had been better, but still better than other movies of the time such as Schoolgirls In Chains.
