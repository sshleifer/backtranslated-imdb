The Original Road House is by no means an award-winning movie. But it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. It should not have been so hard to do a sequel. You do not need a big budget, big stars and spectacular visual effects. Even the story did not have to be original. All it took was a good timing and some great fist fights. I do not mean matrix-style "wire-fu", just a couple of well-choreographed barroom brawls. Many of them. There are some decent fights in the movie, but none of them is memorable and the focus is more on the gun game. Moreover, the way it is tied to the original film is ridiculous and bordering on insults. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, a covert DEA agent who is good with hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he's the son of Patrick Swayze's character Dalton !!!! Say what????? Let's see, the original Road House was built in 1989. So, for Dalton, having a son in his late 20s (maybe 30) in 2006 ... you have the idea. They give him a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father "traveled a lot". Oh please. That would almost have justified turning off this movie. But I digress. Schaech is completely out of his element. Sure, he can throw a few kicks, but as an actor, nothing is going on. He is also called the "handsome boy" by the bad guys in the movie. I've never looked at men so closely, but I do not think this guy looks too good. He looks sick. His face is far too thin and his eyes make him look as if he is going to faint at any moment. I'd never heard of him before, but I think he should give up acting and return to his day job. Jake Busey plays the local drug runner Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good in Starship Troopers and even made a threatening villain in Hitcher 2. But here he chews the scenery in the standard Bad Guy mode. Even his "threatening" dialogue is worth mentioning. We should buy him as the man who has the whole city in his pocket. But why? What does he do? Because he wants to buy a bar from Patton "necessarily"? Ellen Hollman has the role of the girlfriend. A woman with a secret. Too bad that this secret is as hard to understand as 2 + 2. It is the local elementary school teacher who happened to be a former army soldier. Guess what that means? It means that although she can tremble with fear of most of the movie, she is ready to hit heads when the fur starts to fly. Well, at least she is hot. In fact, the fight between her and Wild Bill's girl is the best in the movie. It's fast, brutal and entertaining. Which leads me to my next problem with the movie ... the fights. As I said, Schaech knows how to make a punch. The same can not be said for someone he faces in the film. Obviously, the film is all on Schaech vs. Arrive Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He does not have the skills of a film fight. Swayze was perhaps a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to conduct well-choreographed battles. He also faced some worthy opponents and had a killer (literally). None of this here. With a few exceptions, the fighting is forced, poorly staged and routine. The beats sound like someone who smacks a 2X4 on the concrete, and there are even a few parts where the sound does not even match the beat. It's embarrassing. There is not even the good South / Redneck music of the original. Road House had the Jeff Healy Band, which was a somewhat popular band at the time. This movie features a singer named John Otto, whose music is lukewarm and his acting is even worse. He gave a line in the movie that was probably inserted to placate all the fans he has out there. Either that or someone owed him a favor. My last complaint about the film is one that only comes from being picky ... the continuity. Movies are shot in sequence, and then it's up to the editor to put it all together. Well, someone should give the publisher of this film a little nudge. The problems range from small things like people who do not look in the same direction when switching a shot, to reused material at the end of the movie. At the beginning we are introduced to the bar The Black Pellican. As the camera moves through the bar, you can see the band, the doormen, and the people dancing. At the end of the film, when the bad guys were defeated, we still have a shot of the same bar, with shots of our hero sitting at the bar with his girl. The problem is, the material of the people in the bar is the same material from the beginning of the movie !!! That's no joke. They are the same people who stand in the same places (or dance) and wear the same clothes. Do you want to get to know the funniest part? The recording shows bouncy castles that were KILLED earlier in the movie. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie if you do not feel the need to beat someone. This movie will make you angry enough to do it.
