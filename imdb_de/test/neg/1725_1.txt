Peter Crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. But if the government does not believe him (mute fact No. 1). He builds a shelter in the deep underground and draws a lot to see who will go. Plus is ready to kill to save humanity (mute fact # 2). How could a civilian with millions of technologies see what NASA can not? Plus, justify the purposes that the moral of this story is simply wrong !!! This movie is unlikely and absolutely incredible. What was going through these people's minds, why the hell do those piles get the go-ahead? Sometimes I wonder who needs someone to make a movie in this city.
