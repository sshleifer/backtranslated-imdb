Above all, I personally love Deson and Demons 2, I have seen them, although it was hard to find good horrors without good official film, which was shown here as a child in Russia. Then I heard nothing from Mr. Bava. Then I saw his ghost son. Well, it is certainly not a good return! Why was the lead actor, whom we never really liked, in an accident in the middle of an empty street? Why do African servants say so silently and stupidly about the human soul? Why is the plot so primitive? Have not we seen enough spirits for 100 years of film production? It is clear that Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us yet. It's a shame.
