I do not care what others say, this movie is the worst garbage in the movie. What did John Landis think? <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a number of children's books, but come on! Even kids hate this movie. It is meaningless and boring. Tom Arnold once again shows clearly that his only talent is to waste production money. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason why The Stupids did not appear in the 100 worst films of all time is that only about 20 people will admit to watching this garbage. At least hobgoblins have made it to MST3K.
