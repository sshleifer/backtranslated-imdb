This film takes the plot behind the sci-fi movie "Doppelganger" (an astronaut of our Earth that has crashed on a "counter-earth" on the opposite side of the sun and the totalitarian vibrations of the Cold War in this world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a television series. However, the whole thing has disappeared without a trace and it is probably better for television. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a way "for television". Cameron Mitchell shows his usual solid performance. This is also true for Glenn Corbett (who is a kind of John Saxon of the Poor) who plays the robust individualist whose existence threatens the foundation of the 'world order' on the counter-earth. <br /> <br /> But the low budget, the low energy and inconsistent script, as well as the lack of imagination in the sets and cinematography, keep this sci-fi adventure firmly on the launch pad. <br /> <br /> Let me give an example: in the original template for this pilot ("double-gangster"), the astronauts lose control of their lander during a thunderstorm and crash their ship in a truly disgusting order (it was obvious that her ship would never fly again). Then the two astronauts stumble helplessly in front of the smoking vehicle in the middle of howling rain and wind, but are beaten and overwhelmed by faceless men who scream loudspeakers. <br /> <br /> In "Stranded in Space" The astronauts sit in their seats when the buzzer sounds, things start to wobble and the camera turns black (and as a friend points out, it was pretty obvious that the actors just shook themselves in their seats (even shaking the camera or the device) I've seen episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" that took more effort to create mood and scenery That's basically what it's like with "Stranded In Space." No budget, no time, no imagination ... just making and hoping for the gestures of the characters that the imagination and enthusiasm of the sci-fi fan boys will fill the rest Sorry, guys, it did not work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone here has just finished their work and gone away and never thought about it again, except as a listing on her C.V. And you, the spectator. If you press, you will remember that you once saw a television movie titled "Stranded In Space", but it did not make a lasting impression on you and you can not remember it too much.
