I have to say, it is not very good. Polly Bergen is doing well in this movie. The rest is like that. I'm gay and honest, there are so many clichés for this time in history that it's just sad. We watched the movie, turned it off, and decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the movie. All in all, the basic idea of ​​the film is good. If it were rewritten with less constructed lines and better behavior, it could actually have been good. Above all, I would not recommend it. In addition, this is Coo Coo Denklinie is so lame. In addition, the fight in the hair salon is funny because it is so bad. The lesbian sister who is in the room with them while trying to put it on is so weird that it's sad.
