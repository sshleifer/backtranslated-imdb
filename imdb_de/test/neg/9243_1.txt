Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he wanted with this movie. If I turned my good day into a night full of disturbing memories, then he probably did. <br /> <br /> I know there were big questions in this film: Who are we really? There is really a god here. All the awesome questions, but I really do not think that's funny when you have the questions next to such a tragedy. I'm all portrayed for real life, but come on. It's never funny when a woman is raped, someone kills herself (and family and friends find the corpse) and people die for unexplainable and unnecessary reasons was filmed. There are many beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film student or I do not know much about the subject, I admit, but I know if I leave the theater with a feeling of disgust, then it was not a movie that I shared with everyone would recommend.
