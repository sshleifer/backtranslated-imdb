I really do not understand who this movie is for. Just because of the absurdity, not to mention the ridiculously bad acting, the cheese parcours and the fact that the villain is a kid, I would assume that this should be a children's movie ... but I think there are more swallows Words as Pulp Fiction, not to mention constant references to drugs and general chaos and killing - so which population does she want to please? This film is too schizophrenic, as if you wanted to combine country music with heavy metal. In the end, nobody will like it because it is a bloody paradox. I would recommend this movie because it is so funny (in a bad way), except that the actors are so obviously unbearable that I would not suggest anything else. <br /> <br /> I am completely serious when I say that I could not see more than 15 minutes of it. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiible
