What else can I add? This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Terrible drama, a stupid script, boring tempo - even visible microphones dangling from the top of the screen. I could go on, but it really does not bother me. I watched this for 90 minutes before the feeling of losing the will to live became too big for me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the first set of comments and votes came from people associated with advertising for this topic insulting British filmmaking. <br /> <br /> And worst of all was that I had to buy the mail on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason the DVD was not used as a coaster is that it's now in mine Top 10 Worst Films Ever collection a permanent place. <br /> <br /> Definitely one that should be avoided.
