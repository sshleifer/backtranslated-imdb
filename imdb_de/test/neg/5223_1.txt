I recently had the idea of ​​making a short film with a man who gets hit by a car and wakes up, believing that he is Chuck Norris himself. That meant that I had to do extensive Chuck research and find out as much as possible about the man. I later learn that he is not really a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With such a face, who could doubt it? I have seen more Chuck Norris movies in the past four months than any one person should. I'm proud to say that Bells of Innocence is at the top of the worst list ever. I spent most of the movie wondering if I could return my copy without a receipt to the local Wal-Mart I bit on to keep me from swallowing my own tongue. The biggest reason I chose the movie was that not only Chuck was there, but also his son Mike. I wondered if Mike was a chip from the old block that could not be taken out of his wet cardboard bag. I came to the conclusion a long time ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in film history for a reason. The only character he ever plays is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter what movie, no matter what the situation, he's always Chuck Norris. The only thing he thinks about his son is that he is consistent. Mike does not seem to understand how human emotions work. In the scene in which he talks to the little girl about his dead daughter, he seems extremely happy! Maybe it's because he actually put his daughter on the market, as depicted in one of the strangest flashbacks of all time. His actions confused me throughout the movie and made it very hard for me to focus on the little plot. The other two leading actors were just as painful as the son of Norris. The guy who always wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke was just one of the most annoying characters ever to be on the direct-to-video screen. The only thing I remember when he was in this movie was an episode of Walker Texas Ranger in which he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owes this guy something. The other guy, the only name I can think of because he was so forgotten, was your average Christian fanatic. I have nothing against Christians, in fact I am one, but this guy was just too much for me. To top it off, there are plenty of city dwellers who people like to call "friend" and a few villains who are unable to decide which of them is responsible. Not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar-store version of every other group of scary kids in movies. All in all, the movie may be one of the biggest failures of all time, on more levels than Chuck Norris can kick people in the ass. Although I'm one of the worst actors ever, I still can not get enough of Chuck. Maybe he was really sent from heaven ...
