I have recently seen a copy of it (under the title 'Eaten Alive'). Any movie Ed Wood has ever published looks like Oscar material compared to this ridiculous mood. To be honest, a few lines from the script will be remembered for a long time, like "These people (cannibals) do not buy frozen meat in a supermarket like us, they get it fresh every day from people like you or me" Classic! The crazy "Jonesville" leader in the jungle was the best character in the movie, he really looked like a jerk. I think he was the only actor who was not (badly) dubbed if these Italians need to have American characters in their films, why not make them Americans to dub in dialogue, rather than Englishmen doing their best to themselves to listen to Annie Oakley I give 3 out of 10, I give three, because it's really funnier than most comedies these days.
