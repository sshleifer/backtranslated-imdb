Fred Astaire will repeat with Rita Hayworth one year after her big hit "Columbia", "You'll never get rich". This was the movie that put Hayworth on the Hollywood map, but her performance in this weaker romantic musical makes it hard to guess why she was suddenly so popular. On the way to Buenos Aires, a tyrannical hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age. You might think that the movie is set in the 18th century, but no, it's 1942. Astaire is a former player who has become a player. He goes back to dancing to earn some money, and mingles with being an admirer in letter writing to Hayworth's stone-cold society beauty. Fred stares at Rita with a brotherly smile, but she's as mannequin-like (lip-synched to her songs as a wide-open dummy) that all the romantic sparks spray quickly. They do, however, dance quite comfortably together, and the score of Jerome Kern is imperceptible, but not too bad. ** from ****
