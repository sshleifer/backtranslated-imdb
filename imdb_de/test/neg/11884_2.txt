My wife and I could not even finish the movie. Really, it was pretty painful. <br /> <br /> First, the historical accuracy is less affected by the events themselves than by the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. For example, Augustus absorbs the "burden" of power only with great restraint. In fact, he is portrayed as being a kind of great humanist and believer in democracy. Second, the camp! Sir, the dialogue is terribly bad. I remember the soap opera my mother watched when I was a kid who had a better dialogue than this one. The constant exposure and pontifying of lattices on the ears like fingernails on blackboard. Pooh. (Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, but the dialogue is really bad.) The HBO series Rome is superior for no other reason than that its characters were at least credible, regardless of their historicity. <br /> <br /> Rome was wise enough to know that they could not stage epic battle scenes. The makers of this movie are not. When Caesar attacks Munda, the combat scene is virtually nonsensical. <br /> <br /> I agree that the costumes are totally good. The sets are alright, though their CGI scenes can sometimes be a bit uncomfortable. The sound is bad, both in terms of the music and the Foley work and the dubbing of so many minor characters. In any case, it's not worth renting. As a major in history, I hoped for an alternative approach to Augustus as the HBO-Rome, which I feel could not capture his entire "feeling" as well as Caesar or Antonius. Instead, I should have just read on.
