This is without exaggeration one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know it came in the 80s after a trend that was "Friday the 13th." started. "The Prey" copies the aforementioned movie in many ways. The woods, the killer, the stupid teenagers, the gore, etc. <br /> <br /> But "The Prey" is as bad as you might expect. I did not even remember it, if it was not by accident. <br /> <br /> Well, the killer is indeed human, so do not expect a supernatural murderer like Jason. The situations are rather boring and there is a lack of tension, gore, violence etc. It just does not work for a Slasher movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is just awful. The score is terrible! a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80s? I will not even mention the technical aspects of the movie because it seems to me that it only cost $ 20. <br /> <br /> Please avoid this like the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying something. Thank God it seems to have disappeared from the earth.
