Garden State was a mediocre film at best. The film seems more like a compilation of thoughts that the author (Zach Braff) had than a coherent story. The incoherent plot might have been more appealing if it was not interspersed with meaningless scenes that were nothing but "quirky." Coincidentally, these are often scenes that are passed on in conversations (Zack walks past faucets that turn on in passing, crazy party scene, screaming about a gorge, the list goes on). <br /> <br /> The main character is flat, detachable and ultimately unlikely. She is shown the most in the scene where he talks to his father, selfishly ignoring his father's problems, including a recently deceased wife, and talking about his own "What should I do?" with my life? "problem. <br /> <br /> The film ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to return to LA because he can not tear himself from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman) which he has known for two days, which can only lead me to conclude that the message of the film is that love heals professional dilemmas at first sight ... Sure, you could interpret it as a misuse of priorities, but if If this is the case, it could have been better. Much better. <br /> <br /> This movie does not know what it wants to be, a drama, a comedy, a teenage wasteland movie, or a bunch of other things. I'm not saying this as a single-genre person, but as a person who loves multi-genre pieces, as mastered by Stanley Kubrick, and the reason I think it does not work for Garden State is, that the genera are not merged with each other, but they are jumping around; Scene is one genre, the next, and back, so on. <br /> <br /> I've heard that many people tell me to relax Zach Braff, after all, it was his first feature film and he made his debut as a director, writer and lead actor. Impressive, since this was a first movie, I should think that he could do better with as much money as he could. There were much better directing directors (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Perhaps it would have been better if he had taken part in writing or governing or acting. Zach Braff is a talented artist. Maybe his second attempt is not so boring and incoherent.
