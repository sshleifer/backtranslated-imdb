I caught this movie on late-night TV. Honestly, I've seen most of it and all the time I was in total disbelief. <br /> <br /> Is there a genre that is more meaningless than softcore porn? If there is, I do not want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of pornography (lousy production values, vile acting, shitty scripts) with the coyness of sex scenes in regular movies. The result is exciting or entertaining. This film also has the somewhat strange approach of a sci-fi environment and works terribly. All sex is done in a kind of virtual reality where the crew of the future can learn about physical love. And yes, it's about as confused and stupid as it sounds. <br /> <br /> But there have to be some positive points, right? Well, there is one ... Krista Allen is incredibly hot. That's about the only thing that was less than terrible in this movie. I do not know what it has to do with her, but she has an amazing sex appeal. The rest of the cast, however, looks like standard pornography. Rather unattractive women with poorly formed fake breasts and men who have spent far too much time in the gym to sound grotesquely. Probably a gym in Germany, which is also based on haircut and clothes. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you enjoy the presence of Krista Allen's on screen, you can watch it for the brief moments when she shows some of her seductive potential (but most of the time she's trying shitty dialogue lines to articulate). If you do not like Krista Allen, you might as well stay away. <br /> <br /> I rate this 10/10 for Krista Allen's sex appeal, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for the entertainment value as this is a unique crappy porn / science fiction hybrid that does not really look like as I have ever seen her.
