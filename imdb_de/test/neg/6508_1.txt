Maybe it was the excessive weight gain that Seagal had put on. Or maybe it was Wayan's horrible drama in an action movie. Or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two main characters? These and other considerations lead me to conclude that Seagal should never have made that actor's nightmare. The story was good. An avid follower of Seagate's career and background, his physical appearance was not compatible with his genre of pure, pure, wholesome, Buddhist Zen life, especially in his discussions with Wayan on the silver screen. (Then his real life was also inconsistent with the "nanny"!) <br /> <br /> If Seagal wants to become a more varied actor, he should do what an action figure did in "Kindergarten Cop". ... add humorous material or situations to the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a funny way. Otherwise, skip the clever leaps and futile attempts of humor while chasing a serial killer. Seagal is not a type of natural humor. It did not work. <br /> <br />
