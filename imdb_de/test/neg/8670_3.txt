Why bother, ITV? Admittedly, Mansfield Park is the toughest novel you can "get", and Fanny is certainly the hardest, but ... If you take it, then you have to have the guts to stay true to the book it's a pretty complicated one Ghost. And for God's sake, have the courage to write Fanny the way she was written: a biting, kindhearted, sweet, whiny one! Mrs. Norris was not nearly as terrible as she should have been. And what happened to Portsmouth? The contrast between Fanny's rather dubious family and family home and the splendor of Mansfield is the key to so many aspects of Fanny's rejection of Henry, her uncle's rejection, her uncle's approach to a good person, etc., etc. Again, the complexity and challenges of the novel, why did they bother? It is beyond me ...
