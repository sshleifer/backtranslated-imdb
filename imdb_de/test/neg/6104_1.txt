The movie starts with a scene that just was not possible. A man wakes up and while his wife stays in bed, he begins his morning prayer in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. Morning blessings are recited, but only those that Gitai considers controversial. the rest is expediently omitted. then in philactories and a tallis he kisses his wife a good tomorrow !! This is not an exact account of Jewish prayer in any home, let alone a Hasidic home. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying Hasidic life. He is interested in contributing to his ever expanding list of melodramatic and empty films. The scenes with Mikka (ritual bath) are anything but true and his Jewish wedding was ridiculous as she does not even approach the atmosphere of a Hasidic wedding. I have many problems with the Hasidic way of life, but I can not use Amos Gittai's commentary on these topics. He would make you think that the Hasidim are all dense comformists with severe bouts of depression. I can not agree with the Hasidic lifestyle, but I admit that Hasidic life has many layers. Amos Gitai is blinded by his own secularist pseudo-intellectual stubbornness and therefore unable to present a precise description of Hasidic life. Apart from his poor research and his unbalanced portrayal of Hasidic life, Gitai also fails in other aspects. The plot is full of holes, the dialogue is filled with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the drama, while at times powerfully loaded with melodrama. The film keeps on going and the end is not worth it. Take care if you have to, but be forewarned. If you want to know something about Hasidic life, go to the communities and talk to Hasidim. Do not rely on Gittai's movie!
