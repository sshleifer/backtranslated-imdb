"When a Killer Calls" is an unusually unpleasant Slasher movie with some unpleasant and disturbing sequences. The decision was clearly on the remake of "When a Stranger Calls", by inserting the call sequences from this movie almost verbatim. They seem to be very forced. <br /> <br /> In addition, the filmmaker commits the cardinal's sin (but too often) that the heroine's friends are repugnant idiots. So for the beginning of the movie, we really like the babysitter (a good credible job from Rebekah Kochan), and then we root for him, but then she teamed up with standard Slasher-Flick teenagers and the mood is ruined. <br /> <br /> The nature of Flick works, but it's probably a lot more uncomfortable than you'd expect, so be forewarned.
