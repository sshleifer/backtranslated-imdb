To put it simply, this was a pompous piece of dog poopie. Overly gradual and everyone is at every moment the total melodramatic drama queen. After a while, I began to wish that every character in the movie is not so stuffed. <br /> <br /> And this movie has another of those really annoying things that have come in vogue lately and should not have: all scenes are in a kind of washed-out, blue steel gray. Hmmm, the last time I checked, candles and torches are quite capable of producing a pretty wide range of colors. In fact, the light they emit tends to be in the warm, yellowish-orange range of the spectrum. So, where does all that blue-gray-gray light come from? <br /> <br /> This movie has fancy sets and sparkling CGI effects, but it's still a shit. It is pathetic garbage for today's moviegoers, who are easily pacified by pathetic garbage. <br /> <br /> I like vampires and werewolves as movie plotters, but that was a total hacking job <br /> Universal Studios 1941 "The Wolfman" is infinitely superior to this, though its effects compared to the what is possible these days are pretty primitive. <br /> <br /> I'm done with this series. The first movie was pretty decent. The second is still entertaining. But I could not finish this one until the end, because it was so boring.
