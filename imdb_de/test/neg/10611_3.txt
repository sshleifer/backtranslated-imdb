I have to give this comment a kind of concession: I suppose I have only a penchant for the original television series of the 60s and 70s. I think the filmmakers here have blown it from the beginning to the casting: in a supposed remake, the audience was looking for hip reflections, the athletic Linc (Clarence Williams III) or the cool Michael Cole and so on. Instead, we get Giovanni Ribisi as a poor, little white, rich kid who looks just as pathetic as he plays in all his roles. Occupation of various actors as employees of the office staff; Guess who I occupy as dorky son of the president?). Danes is OK as the new Julie, but none of the characters has much to do because the story just sits there somehow and in the conventionality. So it's completely forgotten. What did I talk about?
