It's Saturday, it's raining and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I just watched "The Crime Doctor's Courage". It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters and a few of the usual suspects - each with its own potential motive for the crime. The story begins abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the storyline without any character development or storytelling. I think that's not too surprising for a B-movie of the time. There are also some moments that look and feel like they were before World War II, but perhaps that's because of the author's background in radio broadcasts. <br /> <br /> The "Crime Doctor" is the scammer that is currently visiting California for R & R from his psychiatric practice on the East Coast. He joins in with a friend of a mysterious novelist who claims to have been with one or more of the previous Mystery Chapters. The novelist occasionally fills the role of the Sidekick to our annoyance (AKA Dr. Watson) and occasionally also picks up some comic relief (somehow). <br /> <br /> There is also a somewhat simple but not quite mumbling police chief who is sometimes plagued by the interference of anger. And then there's the mysterious Braggas, a brother and a sister dancing in a nightclub. Dance is a kind of interpretive dance that happens to be one of the moments that feels more like the '30s than the' 40s. Although the place of the story is in California, the Braggas seem to live in a castle! <br /> <br /> There was an action element that kept me slightly amused but I will not reveal it anymore because I'm always there Enjoy movies when the story is discovered and not known in advance. (Although I think of many, many B movies that would be rated higher, and it's hard to say that watching this time costs a lot of time), I have not seen any other films from the "Crime Doctor" series, So I can not do the comparisons.
