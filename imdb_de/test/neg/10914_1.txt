<br /> <br /> Man, I just can not believe this movie. I looked at it completely (believe me, I did that!) And the best thing was the Traillers at the beginning (and I hate Traillers !!!!). <br /> <br /> No conspiracy, no acting, no, nothing. I saw the movie and thought, "When will that start"? It never started. How can you spend time and money on such a crap? <br /> <br /> The "Conspiracy": A dog is bitten by a bat and gets rabies - Okay, so far no problem, nothing special, but OK. Now the rest of the movie will be - the dog will chase people !!! that's it, nothing else !!! Now add some of the worst actors / performers I've ever encountered, some completely unrealistic scenes (and some others really idiotic about how the child can not breathe and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he is feeling better). and a very lame ending, that's it, here you have CRAP ... ops! .... CUJO. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do something more worthwhile, such as banging your head against the wall or playing chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> ZERO of 10. < br /> Gabriel.
