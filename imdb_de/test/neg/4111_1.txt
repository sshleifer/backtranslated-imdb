This movie reminds me of old B movies, but not in a good way. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first scene, I thought it was a spoof of one of those early SF movies. The terrible actors, the plastic props and the eye-catching visual effects made this impression. <br /> <br /> But no, the movie is really that bad. The story is a total nonsense, the impact is below the level of a television production. Even the cut is a mess. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me in the theater was that I wanted to know the end of the story, although I was pretty sure it would be stupid (and it was) stupid. <br /> <br /> There are better ways to spend time and money.
