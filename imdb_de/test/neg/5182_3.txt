After a while I realized that it was just my IQ that was slowly losing weight. Frostbite is one of those pathetic films that nobody, even I mean, anyone, even tries. I chose the dorky hero to die in this trash can (how did he even manage to fit in there?), Traci Lords, the queen of the B movies, was terribly irritated and tore me and my friends off by doing so her tits did not show once. <br /> <br /> The "characters", although I use this term loosely, are people who are so exaggerated and one-dimensional that they might as well have used cardboard cutouts. The "jokes" (I also use this term loosely) are just funny. A fart of a guy causes an earthquake. Roflcopter! Our "hero" is provided by Traci Lords with a butt acupuncture. Oh God, I can not breathe! The blind man uses the F-word repeatedly! This is too much!!! <br /> <br /> Tell me what you expect from acting, but I think Adam Grimes did a pretty good job playing a mentally handicapped snowboarder. Apart from that, the only source of entertainment here is breasts. I think I counted three, maybe four, pairs throughout the movie, spread over about five minutes of screen time. That's five minutes worth of undisturbed garbage for 83 minutes. Do not watch that. Watch Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson - at least there was plenty of nudity and action in this filthy movie!
