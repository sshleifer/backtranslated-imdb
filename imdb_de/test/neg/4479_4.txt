The only romantic thing about this film is the pain and pain of romance. If you expect this cinematic adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of earlier films, such as "Message in a Bottle," "Nights at Rodanthe," and "A Walk to Remember," think again. No one dies of an accident trying to save someone, and the romance does not change those characters. If anything, they are even more miserable than they are. <br /> <br /> John Tyree (Channing Tatum of "GI Joe"), a soft-speech sergeant from the Special Forces Army, has a memorable, two-week outing on a military vacation with a stunning college girl, Savannah Curtis (Radiant Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia") spends spring break in South Carolina. Savannah does not drink, does not smoke, but she tells John that her head is filled with profanity. John and Savannah inevitably collapse and initiate an infinite correspondence of love letters that inspire sleep by any standard. Tyree is traveling around the world to serve the military in a godforsaken corner of the world while she's in college reading his letters in class. Just as they get hot and violent, suicide bombers push into the World Trade Center. John re-enlists with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without talking to Savannah about the option. Meanwhile, another shaggy but likeable family friend Tim (Henry Thomas of "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial") Anyone with a motherless, autistic child named Alan becomes the subject of Savannah's sentiment. She is the kind of girl who helps build unhappy homes and build a summer horse ranch for autistic children. She delays, which seems forever, before she finally contacts Tyree with the eponymous letter. She drops him for a man with a disease! Later, she confesses to John that she knew the sound of his voice had broken her resolve to marry Tim so she would not make that fateful call. Predictably, John suffers from the lack of communication from Savannah. In a routine mission, our hero takes some terrorist bullets in the back and lands in Germany. While this is going on, Tyree is trying to deal with his own coin-collecting father, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. It seems his father is on his last legs after John leaves the hospital. The female protagonist lacks respect, and her betrayal of Tyree is a pretty minor blow. Tyree, his father, and Tyree's commander, Keith Robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in this pen pal. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives lethargic love stories a new meaning. Yuck!
