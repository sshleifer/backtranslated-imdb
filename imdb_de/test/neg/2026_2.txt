The initial voice sounds like 'The Wind', could be a pretty intriguing movie, but as the story unfolded, I knew it was going downhill from there. The most important thing about this movie was the awful jobs that all the main characters were doing (except a few scenes showing Mic's inner turmoil), lack of character development, and nothing to do with the plot - what did the authors think? <br /> <br /> Michael Mongillo won 2 'Horror / Sci Fi' Awards for 'The Wind'. HUH? What was so scary about this movie? NOTHING! Apart from the Resident Evil 2 video recordings, the rest was more of a "for the TV thriller" - it did not even have to be edited. If you're looking for a much better movie about "Murder Among Friends," rent "Shallow Grave" instead. <br /> <br /> 'The Wind' * / *****
