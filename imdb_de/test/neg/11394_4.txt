The recently released documentary "The Adventures of Errol Flynn" provides a comprehensive insight into the ultimate Hollywood hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne and the like were in principle blue collars in their screenshots, but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner. The younger son wanted to find his own fief for an ironic analogy between sword, thunder, and romance If Warner Bros. had been under contract, he would have been perfect in the role of Cary Grant in Suspicion: the handsome charmer whose 1000-watt smile blinded him to being a predator. And he could have played Joan Fontaine with his best head nurse. It was Flynn's trouble that he was the ultimate Screen Hero until his own habits and bad timing overtook him. Grant and Flynn are similar in some ways, but Flynn was the maker of the two. You can see Grant as Captain Blood, but Flynn in the Philadelphia story. Mr. Blanding builds his dream house or Monkey Business or Operation Petticoat. I've put these roles on their collective ears because he's too damn sure on their feet and the sexual tension he would naturally have made would make the story wiggle. This shaky biography, however, is only a plasticized view of Flynn and his time. There were times when I half expected that at some point a laugh track or an audience would go "Ahhh". It's not deep into Flynn's life, just the view of the screen magazine. It also does not interfere in its fight to be more than a cheater. Like the tidy biographies of Lon Chaney (the father, not the Wolfman or Lenny "Of Mice and Men") and Buster Keaton, created in the 1950s, this is just a time when a piece of lint is destroyed
