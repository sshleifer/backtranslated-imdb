According to the blurb on the back of the DVD case; Jonothan Ross "laughed until a little bit came out". I suppose that has more to do with being full of it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the show for some reason, so I may miss a few important hints. To this film; I have seen the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once, then picked up the newspaper while I waited for something else that was entertaining. Nothing did. <br /> <br /> Obviously intended to be a surreal parody about post-Python style life, gross-humoristic, this one is absolutely flat. In recent years, there have been a number of comedy series on television, including "Bottom," "The Fast Show," "The Vicar Of Dibley," and "Father Ted," each of which brought a bizarre group of witty characters and characters sketches. Any of these could put this crap in a hat. <br /> <br /> If the series was something like this movie; I'm surprised they got the funding. Fortunately, it was one of those Â£ 2 Tesco bran tub purchases and is now in the local charity business. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is; Do not believe the experts, never pay the highest dollar.
