As many know, this is the feature film debut of Edward D. Wood Jr. as author / producer / director / actor. I have been a fan of Ed Wood for several years. While I do not like this as much as others of his films do, it was probably the greatest insight cinema-goers get from Wood during their lifetime. Everyone knows that he was a transvestite. This film is about changing gender and how a transvestite can become a conflict in relationships with loved ones. This film is way ahead of its time in addressing this issue and how it deals with it. However, the film still contains the usual pitfalls of Wood such as bad dialogues, meaningless inventories and hokey special effects. Throw Wood's usual overdose of Bela Lugosi, who pulls the hammer up, and you have Wood's first attempt to become a director. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after discovering the body of a transvestite who discovered them committing suicide to seek advice on how to avoid further problems in that direction. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but can not bring herself to tell her about his secret. He also tells the inspector about Alan, who undergoes a sex change because he is more suitable for a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who apparently adds a running commentary on what's going on (Lugose's role is not really well defined and turns out to be most likely a vehicle for Wood to have a star in his film, and Lugosi for something to get cash from it). <br /> <br /> All in all, the film shows the characteristics of Woods career. It was obviously filmed on a very small budget and dropped some things pretty randomly. It definitely feels "it's so bad, it's good". However, I have to congratulate Ed for his progressive thinking on this film. Transvestism and sex changes were not very open topics in the early 1950s. Wood went to great lengths to make a film that depicts transvestites as non-sexual deviants and puts crossdressing on a more human face.
