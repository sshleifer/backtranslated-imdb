While this is terribly outdated, I MUST insist ... PLEASE, NO VISIT Honestly, it just does not help, since there is nothing that could be temporarily added or changed to make this cinematic better creepy work, but on film just do not translate it. Most of King's masterpieces do not translate into movies. I'm not sure why that is, but if you look at this work, you'll probably see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The book? It is wonderful. It's not a masterpiece, but it's more than entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie? Do something different. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> It rates a 3.1 / 10th of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
