I like B movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very good actor. I love how he delivers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness' were great films. I liked 'Running Time'. I do not know if I'll ever see this movie again ... and I bought it. Well, after saying that, I bet that the commentary tracks and the peculiarities will be worth seeing! This movie just has too many holes for me to really enjoy it as a cheapo movie. First of all, Ted Raimi was annoying, just annoying. There was nothing about his poorly played / written character that was not improved a thousand times. The direction was unfortunately unsurpassable and the choice of some shots ... yikes. I do not expect Woody Allen or James Cameron to be here, but Campbell did not deliver. I'm disappointed. I would have been happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I got a lot less. At the end of the film, there were no scenes that jumped to me, no dialogue that sounded in me. Even 'Hostel' had a classic line for Petes sake! I do not recommend this movie.
