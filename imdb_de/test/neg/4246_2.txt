Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story begins in order. Her husband cheats on her and she finds out on national television. So she has to rebuild her life. It could have been interesting or developed into a story here, but you get bored with it. She moves back with her parents and Harry Connick Jr., who plays Justin, begins to attack her. The two have no real chemistry at all, but you should get the impression that Justin loves them. The movie ends the way you imagine, but you wish it had not ended like all the others. They got off to a good start with this movie and would have let it show in something, but instead it's a movie you definitely want to miss.
