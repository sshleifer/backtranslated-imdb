If good intentions were enough to produce a good movie, I would have rated the clumsy, ponderous, obvious "Focus" a little higher than 4. Macy is doing his best, but as a previous poster commented, Miller's little parable asks us to stop disbelieving too often. Maybe the novel gives us a bit more background on Newman, so that we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence can perceive the situation of his fellow human beings so closely. I agree with another reviewer: If you are unaware of how middle class middle-aged people were in America at the time, this film could be an eye-opener. I grew up in the 1950s, and the "good" pastors of my Lutheran church did not mind going on a picnic on a commercial beach, the sign of which clearly indicated that no Jews or blacks would be allowed. It is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm, not just in the South. It was not until I graduated from a more racially integrated but sexually separated public high school in Baltimore in 1964 that my black classmates could not attend the traditional "father-son banquet" because it was in an institution that did not allow blacks , Unfortunately, it was a facility owned by a Jewish family. Focus is important, and we should never forget, despite the continuing signs of racism in modern America, how truly the attitudes of this previous generation were repugnant (in fact, the "largest generation"). Perhaps this film is of some value to counteract the recent wave of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow's sentimental crap of the 1940s. But in the end, as in "Far From Heaven," filmmakers' good intentions are undermined by the fact that they have a protagonist who so silly ignores the social conventions of his day.
