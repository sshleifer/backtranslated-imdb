Let me first say I wasted the Halloween movie night by looking at this garbage. Secondly, I would like to point out that the current DVD available from Shriek Show is not uncut. Third, this one scene is the highlight of the movie, and since it was cut, you see where I'm going. <br /> <br /> I know a lot of horror fans digging this movie. It is atmospheric, shot in the forest, with some very beautiful landscapes, waterfalls and so on. But after the opening kill, which has a very brutal shot of a machete through a hunter's step, there are no really brutal killings after that. And with a Slasher movie you want that somehow. At least I do. The Director and Co. Do not mess with the idea of ​​the killers in the woods, some of these movie types were all filmed at the same time in the early 1980s. The only thing that matters is that you do not hate the actors as much as in other movies. They are somehow sympathetic. The children have a reason to be there: One of them has a property on a piece of land on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There is neither a hut nor a house. So why buy a property in East Jesus, especially if you are not a hunter or something? I'm sure some people buy land for camping, but that seems unusual. Anyway, two squeaky backwoods appear and begin to track the campers and pick them up one after the other. And as I said before, a decent death after the machete strike initially comes as good as nothing in the way. The end does have some foolish killing of Connie, but even that's not enough to save it from the almost forgotten film The Forest, which is mind-blowing. <br /> <br /> If the Shriek Show had been able to get a real, uncut print, this review might have been a little forgiving, but this is the day and age of the uncut / unvalidated DVD releases old obscure movies for cine dogs like me. If you insult us, you will get the bad rating. Unfortunately, the presence of the great, patriarchal George Kennedy is the only highlight in this film that sets him apart from the other garden wastes that were whirled up that day.
