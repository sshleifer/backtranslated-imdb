As a helpful warning to others, I believe that "Skeleton Man" is actually worse than "Raptor Island". I used RI as an example of the worst original movie on the sci-fi channel, but SM is the most laughably incoherent and miserably designed movie I've ever seen. Yes, I have seen almost the whole thing and drove in about 35 minutes. It attracted me with its pure incompetence. What did Sci-Fi think? Once Skeleton Man and the surviving platoon leader (or whatever he was - I'm not good at military unit designation) had reached the chemical factory, the film moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing. I had the same idea as another viewer, wondering if more than one movie was being edited together to make a dreadful whole.
