Why did Bava on Earth add insults to injuries that made this miserable aftermath crap? <br /> <br /> Initially, "the onlookers" are treated at home with a narrative of an unknown thing - asking us to draw attention to the events of the last episode, which point to the triumph of humanity over the demons ( yeah right) -Have something to do with Demons, as this is a whole new story with a completely different background. As usual, Bava makes a random appearance that does not seem to fit into the main context of the story at all. Oh god, I will not continue. Convince yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual, you'll be treated with laughable dubbing, crap scenarios that make no sense, and most of all, unanswered questions. How typical of a sequel, where the first shit was leaked. <br /> <br /> If you're one of those DVD-DVD collectors, you may want to try something else to avoid the plague. It's by no means close to the first, so you may want to avoid the plague.
