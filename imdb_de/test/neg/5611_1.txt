This movie had so much potential to be hilarious, yet moving, but lagged far behind them. It had a great story, it just was not done as well as it could have been. The strange "hallucinations" during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and were definitely not necessary, they had no effect and made no impression or whatsoever of what would come or happen. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder's character was fine, but could have been further developed. He played the shitty role he got from his best side. The character was funny, but it lagged behind what could have been. <br /> <br /> Mila's character was perfect and her performance was just right. <br /> <br /> In the end, the writing was awful and most of the time it did not make any sense and his hallucinations did not fit into the movie at all. This movie, with better script and better direction, could have been a contender for National Lampoon's Vacation as far as weird, bad things happen that happen to a person on a trip across America a second "flush". If I had seen that in the theater, I would have reclaimed my money and boycotted the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did this movie was wasting an hour and a half of my life. It also made everyone involved look bad, just because the movie was a stinker. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone! Ever!
