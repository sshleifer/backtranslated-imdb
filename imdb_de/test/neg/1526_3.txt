A modern fear movie? Yes that's it. <br /> <br /> The hippies, peaceniks and environmentalists have teamed up to give us a movie of fear. I did not realize it when I saw it only two years ago that it was a scary movie, but that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> There is no difference between this film and the films the Nazis made about us in WW2 and the same films we made about them. This is pure propaganda and only speaks to them .. I believe in aliens, conspiracy dates for 9/11, fake moon landings, oil and the environment. What I can say is that this movie has push buttons, asking questions, and ultimately just forgetting everything. If your scars are in your homes, lock your doors and fill in for the nuclear winter we all know that Bush will come when the Chinese become involved in the nuclear war.
