I honestly expected more from this movie. That could have been the problem. There was not a single time when the camera was still standing. Close-ups shake the camera, the subjects move and I get a headache. The cuts are so frequent and so fast that the viewer often wonders what has just happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) If you expect a happy ending at the end of the movie, after you've thought so much uselessly of understanding what's going on, you're losing. For me, this was basically a terrible movie that was destroyed by a cameraman with ADHD and it lacked a meaningful plot.
