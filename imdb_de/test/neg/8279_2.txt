"Graduation Day" - <br /> <br /> I bought this movie last week and waited some time to sit back and relax and watch some "good" 80s slasher gems. I got this and "Xtro" look, I've never seen one of them. I have just looked at it and found that my outdoor speakers were turned on. I can only imagine what my neighbors thought when "Felony" sang their 10-minute hit? I'm sure it was loud and I'm sure they think I'm funny with the sound of the chainsaw and screaming from other movies. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty entertaining slasher movie, no suspense, no story, a couple of cool deaths, it almost seemed like an amateur site, I usually like movies like this, but it just did not click, now I will see "Xtro" for the first time and have a margarita! /> <br /> DJ Eric Austin TX
