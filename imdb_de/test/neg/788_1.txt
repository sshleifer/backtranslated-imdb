Perhaps one of the (if not the) worst movie ever conceived, cast and played in the history of cinema. Who on God's green earth would ever dream of occupying Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like his mother. God forgive me, but I'm just honest. And that was the least of the many problems that plagued this terrible apology for a movie. It was a terrible statement against women, but if you want to blame women for the world's problems, tell a decent story that does not have so many annoying loopholes and pitiful excuses for excitement and thrills. Everyone should get their money back, who saw it in theaters or bought the DVD.
