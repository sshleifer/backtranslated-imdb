This is one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are beautifully engineered and their interactions are exciting, complex and very fast in this stunning novel. <br /> <br /> And about 99.8 percent of it lost the movie. Seriously, the script AND the direction were outrageous and clearly made by people who could not understand what was good about the novel. I can not blame the actors, because they never had the chance to live this turkey with Crichton's original work. I know that good novels, especially those with a sci-fi edge, can be put onto the screen in a way that is original to the original. However, this is possibly the absolute biggest quality difference between novel and screen customization. The book is really good. The movie is just awful.
