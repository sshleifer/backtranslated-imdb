1st Aufstener 26.12.2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy murder mystery with very little laugh. According to the credits, the film is based on an earlier Italian film, but was rewritten by two pretty popular American romantic comedy writers. But this one of Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers is not felt compared to the other efforts. The story is about a couple of excited Americans, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who come across a lost dog and hope to earn a fortune with reward money after seeing an ad in Dachsund's return paper. While trying to return it, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door in the lady's apartment, which they believe is attached to the rest of the woman's corpse, which is supposed to give them the money. They freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make outcroppings of the scene and expect to be framed for the murder. The other characters in the film meet in one go and hang out in a Monte Carlo casino, where they do different things to get drawn into the story. Other performers include the character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police learn about death, they start questioning the main characters, and of course they have to work through their stupid lies to find out what really happened. None of the aforementioned character actors can bring this film out of its mediocre state despite some fun moments provided mainly by the Belushi / Shepherd couple. This is not a horrible movie, it just is not so good. There are many average movies on the market and this is just another one for the pile. Try it, maybe you like it, probably not.
