Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental catastrophe, so humanity now survives subdividing into various religious cults. What caused the disaster? I have no idea ? Why is humanity divided into different church factions? I have no idea . How can humans, as the surface of the earth can no longer support human life, grow crops to feed the population? I have no idea . What kind of producer thought this script earned money? I have no idea. <br /> <br /> SHEPHERD is one of those films that creeps on cable channels late at night. The kind of movie in which you consult the IMBb to see if it has any merit. The number of people commenting on SHEPHERD on this page is not yet in double digits and this movie was released nine years ago. Maybe the people who have never seen it before are the lucky ones? <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the story, it's very routine. The grumpy ex-policeman Boris Dakota, whose wife and child died several years earlier, meets a woman and his child, and it's up to him to save their lives, almost like a futuristic western. Throw a former wrestler who now runs the God Channel, a fascist Christian guy trying to wipe out Boris, a ventriloquist, a couple of T & A for the sake of it, and you have a movie. I think after Neil Marshall's seen DOOMSDAY, he might be a masterpiece of cinema in comparison
