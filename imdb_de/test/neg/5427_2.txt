Ahhh this movie is awful. The script is stupid and of course Chase does not say he does not love her !!! Like any episode ... I can never understand why the fucker Logan's father is acting so dramatically. And it's all about Zoey and chase as far as the other characters are concerned. It's always the same in every episode that Quinn makes, and the invention goes wrong with the invention, and the zoeys brother is always there. If you have not seen it, do not waste an hour looking at this cuz, because you will waste your time! SMaybe may be interesting for an 8-year-old 8-10 well, but I can not imagine anyone watching this movie again is older. But what can you expect from Nick?
