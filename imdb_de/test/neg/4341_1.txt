This is a pale imitation of The Die Hard franchise, which is just crap. The low ambitions of the film are evident when the terrorists hold the vice president as a hostage and he has to call the White House to ask for money. In most films of this genre, the president is kidnapped or held hostage because he (or she) is the country's most powerful person and has fingers on the atomic button and so on. Most Americans would have really worried if Dick Cheney had been abducted? The honest answer is - probably not. Why the terrorists would choose a Stanley Cup final to perform their operation, and why, despite many explosions around them, the audience in the hockey stadium does not know the situation, are unanswerable questions. Let's just say that this movie is really hokey, not hockey. Those who enjoyed the movie and were exciting should get a life.
