This movie is totally filthy. I love Val Kilmer and was very surprised by "Felon" (a good movie!). The entire DVD box is misleading. While Val Kilmer is being charged as one of the main characters of this film, he is in the movie for about two minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not quite right. It could have been a good movie, but the direction was terrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually, when a movie is so awful, you can sit back and laugh about it. However, this movie is so bad and boring that I actually fell asleep (which I never do during a movie). AVOID ALL COST!
