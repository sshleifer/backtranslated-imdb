The credits at the end were "ALL directed by Shigeru Izumiya". This is a fitting phrase because it looks like filmed material from several projects has been somehow thrown together, with little attempt to make everything consistent. It felt more like one of those music clips being marketed as feature films to make money out of those video spots, except that here the marketable music and live performances are missing, except for a scene that may as well be marketed comic music video clip in Japan. What ever. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense. Visually, it's not too special, even though it has its moments (for example, the female creature with the "death powder" strapped to a bed frame and a slightly streaky pattern), and it certainly has an industrial feel about it Describe effects as amateurish, but what this film offers in this regard is more than anything else confusing. Remember the cheap video effects from the music videos of the 70s and 80s that make them look as outdated as a picture in an image flying through the screen? There are quite a few of these types of effects for no apparent reason. The half-hearted apparent effort comes in the form of a picture collage. The pictures somehow look like album art. What ever. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's with the subtitles of the version I've seen. The Chinese (or whatever these hieroglyphics are) sometimes appear when nothing is said and the English often appear without the Chinese. The English submarines talk a lot about a life without death (is that possible?) And a mindless body that offers what comes closest to a comprehensible conflict between characters in this film. One guy (a scientist guy) says that life without flesh is death, while another guy (a metamorphosing guy) who claims his mind is no longer the body because he's blown the "death powder" into his face and now knows the secrets of the flesh and so on; The metamorphosing guy is visibly distracted from the scientist's claim. What ever. <br /> <br /> Uh, the end - all written by Perception de Ambiguity
