I've just watched the movie and have to say it was a good movie, I loved some of the good guys and I loved the killer robot, but the movie had some holes in it. People's names were kinda ... stupid .. I think people should end up sueing the creator of this movie because of the bad movie. The first half hour was good, but then it just kept moving on and on I was happy ... it was over ... but I loved the killer robot and some of the movie's good men. <br /> <br /> I think they were the best two bucks I've ever spent, because I like stupid b movies like these and come on .. it's a B movie for everyone.
