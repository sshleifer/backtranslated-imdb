Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film does not awaken the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> By the way, what happened to Ms. Driver? She had such a potential in the film industry. <br /> <br /> For me it was almost like a Yentl version from the 1850s without musical fanfare. With the death of her father, Driver takes a position as a governess of a Christian family and hides her Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> Although I realize that this is a period peace, he was terribly bored even for the England of 1850 and Scotland. <br /> <br /> The lady of the house is the most irritating with her singing voice. I expected her to call Driver any moment sweet. What kind of name is Mary Blackchurch? I know Driver is trying to pretend to be a Christian, but does that name mean all the way? <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Mary finds love with the young man's father (Wilkinson) and his emotionally unbalanced son. <br /> <br /> In the end, we conclude that Mary has found a job that is responsible for her family photography. Do we really have to submit to the whole movie? <br /> <br /> The early scenes of Judaism practiced in England in the 19th century and the cholera epidemic in the end could have been played more. There is a clear basic feeling of anti-Semitism in the Wilkinson family, but that must never come out.
