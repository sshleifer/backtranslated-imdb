SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I do not go into "high-tech" movies and expect them to be 100% devoted to everything related to computers. But somehow even the average "I have a computer" user should believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) A computer professional with top-secret, special data <br /> <br /> 2) is the primary copy keep this data on a 1.44 floppy disk <br /> <br /> 3) and make absolutely NO SECURITY of that particular secret data. <br /> <br /> Even high school students back home for goodness sake. <br /> <br /> Again, this is the worst representation of a computer nerd ever. Although she is super cute, we should believe that she has no friends, neighbors, extended family or colleagues who can identify her. Even the stranger had a family that could upset him. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER <br /> <br /> These are not just minor bugs that did not affect the movie's points that fueled the storyline. The characterization was terrible, the plot completely unimaginable and if you have not seen it yet, do not worry about it.
