I can only laugh. Impressive. I like Jim Wynorski's films. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But what happened to this guy? He made funny horror movies that tried to be good. But that was not even funny ... I mean, I think it was because I laughed. The bad guy is incredible. I mean, awful CGI. It looks terrible. And the film has no blood and no nudity as redeeming qualities. It is classified PG-13. A movie called "Bone Eater," which you know will not be a blockbuster movie, probably will not have an intelligent script. A movie like this can count on Gore ... but no. It does not really depend on anything, it's just ... crap. Take a look if you want to laugh. But do not expect a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski returns to movies like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV because this and Komodo Vs. Cobra does not cut it off.
