The problem with a movie like this, however, is that the finale, the cr√®me-de-la-creme of the film and the fight between the two souped-up ships must be done well. Disappointingly, this scene in Ironclads is obviously carried out completely with small model ships in an overgrown tub. There is no tension, little explanation of what is going on and what the time frame of the booth is. <br /> <br /> The film takes some liberty with the surrounding story, like all true stories when converted to a movie like the Traitor of the Union, and especially that of Betty Stuart (Madsen), a Virginia beauty , <br /> <br /> It picks up on a potentially decent movie that includes an interesting story about the Ironclads preaching about the evils of slavery. It was not appropriate in this historical drama and was a cheap trick to bring the female onlookers. It has only managed to mitigate the positive results of the film.
