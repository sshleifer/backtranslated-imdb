I saw the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. At that time it was 8.0 and I thought, "Wow, that must be good". I thought wrong. The beginning of the film actually holds what the plot promises, but then goes exponentially under its basement. I think without the character of Richie Nix it might have been alright - though that's why the plot takes its course. The character is just too extreme for my taste and hard to bear. Also, the journey that takes the main character from the beginning of the story to the "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been left out - the alternative is, I just did not understand the movie though I have to admit that it was " was easy to see "and I had no problems getting through the whole movie, he was dissatisfied at the end of the film. All in all, rather mediocre.
