In the same way, Lamberto Bava was an inferior facsimile of his father, Mario (who was an extremely overrated director anyway). Michele Soavi is an inferior director in the Dario Argento white horse. "The Church" has at least one to recommend - the incredibly detailed art direction - but absolutely nothing else. The film is long-winded, filled with one-dimensional characters and almost put me to sleep several times. There is a fine line between "art" and "arrogant crap," and although "The Church" is not completely worthless, it is better to see something different. <br /> <br /> 3/10
