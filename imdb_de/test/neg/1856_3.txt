When I followed Dylan Moran's star from the charming misanthrope bookstore owner in the surrealist sitcom Black Books, I saw how his weird potential was going to be used in theaters or on major movie theaters. This first big screening performance in a lead role (he had a cameo appearance as Rufus, the thief in Notting Hill) had promising results, but like Steve Coogan's tense vehicle, The Parole Officer, he has too many wrinkles to make iron out must pre-production. <br /> <br /> The plot is so confused that I'm not trying to repeat the finer details (the script has every character that does that for us), and the laughs are from the show business Joke. Michael Caine is a pompous producer of Richard III. - updated to the occupation by the Nazis (one of the few real laughs, a satirical jab by Ian McKellen), in which everyone makes the Hitler salute forever when he enters the stage. Convinced Dylan that acting should be a conceptual act in their own right, the two of them planned to steal money from their rather harmless gangsters through their acting skills. There is confusion (both on screen and in the audience), between Dylan and the daughter of a gangster blah blah blah, there is a romantic subplot, and Dylan puts on strange clothes and sets funny accents. Michael Caine delivers some selection lines, and Dylan's weird timing is on the money. Why is not it good then? It has a certain charm that you would expect from Film 4, but it also has a precocious girl who acts as a compass in a cluttered and irrelevant storyline - a No-No in Screen Writing 101. The exhibition overshadows everything else. They just want to see Moran and Caine as they used to act as comic strips, but when they're together at the end, the pairing has lost its charisma. <br /> <br /> The actors are an amusing if overpowering effort. If it comes on a rainy Tuesday afternoon on telly, then you have. Otherwise, you'd better watch your old Black Books videos or rent Withnail & I.
