Basically, the first two Critters films were already stupid, but in a good and fun way. This movie is more of a B-movie, but stupid for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first successor that does not really follow the storyline of the first two films. Basically all characters are new and this time there are no bounty hunters (well, hardly any, since the bounty hunter shows up too late in this movie) and the budget for this piece has apparently dropped again. To save even more money, the movie was shot with part 4 in a row, which I represent as well, as it follows directly on this film and was made by the same participants as this one. <Br /> <br /> It's just a typical B-genre movie that is not original or entertaining. It makes "Critters 3" a real, redundant sequel that you can easily do without. Granted, things could have been a lot worse for this movie, but it's not good either. The movie just turns out to be science fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> Also weird how the critters in this movie suddenly changed. They are about twice as big as usual, without any explanation, and they are even more Gremlins like in this movie than in the previous one. <br /> <br /> The film is made interesting only for this reason. This was the feature film debut by Leonardo DiCaprio. He was about 17 years old in this movie and of course looked like he still would. I like seeing these well-known actors in their early roles. It's fun to see how they behave and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course DiCaprio only got better, but he delivered his lines in the same way as today. <br /> <br /> Really too stupid and lame movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
