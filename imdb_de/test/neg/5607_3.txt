Rutger Hower fans Do not BE FOOLED - he only plays a cameo in this movie and that's IT. This movie loses an extra point for this scam. I think Rutger Hower has a total of about two very short scenes and two very short voice overs. <br /> <br /> The female lead for this film is far beyond this meager material in looks and talent - she's awesome movie is a dog and she's wasted on it. The story is about a lawyer who one day hoped for this partnership in the firm because he had to lug the boss's niece across the country. They have several encounters on the road with different weird balls and that's the vehicle for a lot of skits, and the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite is thrown into the mix as a side-effect for a good move, a road trip in which extreme circumstances are ours repressed heroes to the test and he slowly gets a little looser at the end of the film, oh no love is great, yadda yadda .. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you want a hot one Chick annoying a dork in a truck for one and a half hours.
