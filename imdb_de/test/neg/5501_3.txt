Some things become clear after the first minutes of this movie. First, the scenery and the special effects are unbelievable - the best, and if everything else worked well, his strong presence might have made it a great movie. But as soon as the actors open their mouths you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your building watching a movie. The story itself is full of clech√© and melodrama, and dialogue is among the worst I've ever seen. And as if that was not bad enough, they made a fool of the protagonist, and in my experience, you do not want that if the movie is not a comedy. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It was hard for me to get in and I would not recommend it.
