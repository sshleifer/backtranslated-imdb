One day I thought to myself: What is the worst thing that could happen today? I answered with a simple "Oh, it happened already, I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2" on DVD. Well, what is there to say? The budget was not big enough to hire a police uniform, the film cuts out sex and death scenes. There is a funny line that I can remember, and acting is much worse than the first one. There seems to be no lighting on the "set" (the woods anywhere), and the killer killer known as Killjoy (who makes Leprechaun look like The Exorcist) is less spectacular. This time he is not portrayed by Angel Vargas and is completely changed from a crazy, irritating clown to another crazy, irritating clown with the inscription "CHILD". Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a blade of grass is this version of Killjoy. Somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile lies Killjoy 2. Her guilty conscience is underestimated. This movie has no redeeming qualities except the song at the very end about the credits ... which is at least a bit of fun. Killjoy 2 is not even a movie, but an exercise in tension. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be the worst movie I've ever seen. MINOR SPOILER ######### Let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes. A girl is trapped in a woodshed (maybe in an outhouse?) As Killjoy peeks in through a hole. He has a couple of clattering teeth (like the ones you can buy from Spencer's Gifts) and he does something with them (maybe he opens them?!). Then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can not be written in IMDB). From what I gather from this scene (not what's shown in the movie), teeth went into the outhouse, killing the girl in an interesting but not shown way, and then returned to Killjoy. If I had those teeth, I would have run. Get away from Killjoy so he could never get his hands on me again. Killjoy 2 is hopefully the last killjoy we'll have to endure. Even if a fan of films is perceived by others as very bad, I think that this "film" could unite humanity and create world peace if it were promised that this film and everything that reminds us would be destroyed. I give 2/10 - simply, because the creators have managed to set the pictures in motion.
