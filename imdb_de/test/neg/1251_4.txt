Stu Ungar is considered by many to be the best poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary, self-destructive natural force - of small size, but a big heart for the game. <br /> <br /> What we have Here is a kind of Hallmark movie about the dangers of gambling. Sure, he wins, he loses, he blows everything on sex, drugs and more gambling, we get it, but where is the real game - where is it that made him the greatest card player of all time. <br /> <br Too shallow and frankly boring, this gets a four, because we can learn something about Stu, the man, but Stu, the card player, nada. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot and presented This is a perfect example of how you should not film a movie about cards: To be honest, ESPN's coverage of the World Series is easier to observe than this. <br /> <br /> A waste of a great opportunity.
