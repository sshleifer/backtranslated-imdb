Ridiculous film in which two swinging college graduates move to California and become one movie star and the other his manager. <br /> <br /> Over the course of 10 years, the popularity of the star television show is waning, where women will fight for his affection. <br /> <br /> The movie is disgusting and ridiculous. The girls who compete for love boys look stupid. Only one girl seems to be the producer of the show. She is really an amateur against some of the other women, but she is healthy and brings good reviews to the show. <br /> <br /> In the third scene, you realize that the manager is in love with her. <We know that Ryan should really be a bachelor. While the ending is a bit sweet, you really know where that should lead.
