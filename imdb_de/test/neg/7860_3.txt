While Maetel Legend is highly recommended in both the concept and the final product, it is ultimately a bad movie. Plotwise, it is a retelling of Maetel's early life, which is usually unclear; At the same time, the authors use the opportunity to tell the story of the machine empire. And since Leiji Matsumoto struggles not to include his other work, we have a starting point for Emeralda's sister, her mother: The Queen of La Metals and a bit of Galaxy Express 999 to make the film. <br /> <br /> In short, Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metals, a planet with an irregular orbit, meaning that its cycle around the next sun reaches a cold stage and the artificial sun dies. As the story progresses, the planet gets colder, increasing the feeling of sinking. To protect her subjects and her family, the Queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of the La Metals people. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg who provides the resources for the job. The film challenges the characters of mechanization. Will they still be human? Can you trust Hardgear? Are there souls and hearts left? So for a fan of Matsumoto's work, there is much to enjoy, answer questions, and continue topics, unless it's obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction, as well as a fan-curiosity. The negative, especially the animation, while Galaxy Express 999, a TV series from over 20 years ago, is endowed with inferior mundane animation and sometimes sketchy character design, Maetel Legend has all the worst features of modern animation and deserves such a sense of respect Galaxy Express 999. The design is well detailed, but unfortunately the animation has left well-drawn characters that can "move" as the backgrounds move or the camera zooms. This is a fast way of animation. The few, yes few well animated scenes are used again and again in dream sequences, repetitions and in additional scenes. Anyone who looks like the movie will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> Next, the story: While everything sounds good in the concept, the finished product is actually a series of conversational plot that repeats itself over and over again, is the number of times that the characters on encountering the same problems and learning the same things are practically insulting to the audience and the characters who seem to have been much articulated in previous incarnations. Add all the awful character design that seems lifeless and exaggerated, and the public has a movie that has been so abused that it could just as well be rewritten as another movie, at least the newcomers would not be confused. <br /> <br /> And yet it really has moments, the end is at least surprising. The suffering of the citizens of La Metals was quite disturbing and rightly disturbing. I think I find the whole man-machine theme uncomfortable. It is difficult to know whom to recommend to Maetel Legend, as it is not well animated, written or executed, and confusing as soon as Leiji Matsumoto's compulsory cross-references are inserted. But I can not help but lighten up when the grand entrance of Three-Nine enters. Well, that's a good movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 out of 5 stars, 2 if you are a fan.
