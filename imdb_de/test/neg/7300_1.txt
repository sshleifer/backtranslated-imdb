A post-apocalyptic warrior rushes to rescue some kind of nun and meets some cyberpunk skaters trying to kick him in the ass. This is one of the hardest-to-see movies ever. There are scenes of silence that seem to take hours before someone comes out with the next badly written, badly played line. There are action sequences that keep repeating - and we're not talking about the Quickfire 1-2-3 action replay for a particularly good kick popular with Eastern directors. These are many repetitions of long, bad combat sequences. This is incredibly confusing at first, but then quickly becomes annoying when you watch a 30 second sequence for the second, third, and fourth time. Any kind of action or vision is lost in the confusing continuity, the only thing that keeps this movie in the video player (apart from a friend's bet that I could not see through it without asking for it to be turned off and disposed of safely, so that it does not hurt anyone) is the fact that this film, although it is painful, is unintentionally funny, I'm not at all a fan of this "so bad it's funny" movie types, but in the parts i was in tears to watch out for is also the quality of sound and image. However, this is forgivable, since obviously the money was a major problem in creating this movie. Final judgment - king of the genre "so bad that they are funny". Anyone who has this kind of genre video night should get a copy. Let's not forget that this is the worst movie I have ever seen.
