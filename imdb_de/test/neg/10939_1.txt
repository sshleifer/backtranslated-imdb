They may not believe that, but when the credits of this movie were filmed, I searched for the name of the director. When I saw it, I burned it into my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is awful. It makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, this was a soul-displeasing experience. The quality was so bad that I wondered who allowed it. I heard Uwe Boll runs 14 miles a day. Because wherever his films are seen, people have to lead him out of town with a flame and a pitchfork. The script was awful, the lighting was like a high school football game and the cinematography was just over the quality of Roger Patterson's Bigfoot video. The acting was carried out by people who were ashamed of the production in order to credibly tell their lines. At the end was a movie on which Alan Smithee would not have put his name. I learned that day to avoid any movie of this man despite the circumstances. After all, I hear this is not a bad thing.
