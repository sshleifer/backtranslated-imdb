I wish I could go back to the time I saw this movie with the time-of-day machine and make other plans instead. I have seen a free screening of A Sound of Thunder, so I can not complain about the price, but I wish I could refund my 103 minutes. The acting was mediocre and the special effects were regrettable. People should not shoot movies about dinosaurs if they can not afford to make the prehistoric beings look as good or better as those in Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only salvation of the film. I've found that women under 18 rated the movie with the highest score, and the only explanation is that they've been battling Burns the whole time. The whole long 103 minutes. This movie should be finished in about 80 minutes. It just went on and on and on. Do not waste your time or money on this far-fetched movie.
