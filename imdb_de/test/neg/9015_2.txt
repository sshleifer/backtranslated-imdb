Another winner from the '50s and' 60s, whom I value so much for the comedic value they give each time they look at them. Corman never lets you down with these films, they take themselves seriously and have a very low budget, a good recipe for sure. Ed Nelson, a very competent actor, began with both Corman and many other favorites that appeared in Superman and in many Western countries of the day. The costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaks, well said, the reverberation was a bit worn, but that's the beauty of it. Filmmaking for love, not looking for perfection, just digging the plot, doing it, it comes through. These movies are a fun time! Even better is the MST3K version !!
