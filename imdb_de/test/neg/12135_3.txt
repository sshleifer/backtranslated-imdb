UP at the villa made me think I would see something similar to GOSFORD PARK. The film opens in a ballroom in Italy in the 1930s, populated by vulgar Americans and brave citizens. In reality, UP AT THE VILLA is more like a Merchant Ivory production. and I mean a very slow romantic drama, with some of the romance very unlikely. If you like slow romantic dramas, this movie might be appreciated. I did not do it
