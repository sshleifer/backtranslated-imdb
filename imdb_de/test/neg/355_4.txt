When I talk about Blackholes and cosmology as a physicist, I get my heart pumping. However, I found this presentation too slow and too little information for the interested layman (who most likely sees it). If you are more than curious, go to the library and look at some books. You will find that they explain the current scientific cosmologies with far more detailed explanations and at the same time fill you with a sense of wonder than is the case in this film. To put it in a nutshell, Hawking is NOT considered to be the "greatest mind" or "the smartest person in the world," as even the IMDb itself claims among users' ratings. Hawking himself commented, "It's garbage, it's just a media hype, they needed someone to fill the role model of the handicapped genius, at least I'm disabled." To be fair, he's probably a genius, but among the greatest scientists in history, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss, and many more are even more appreciated. This is not to respect Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist, but to disrespect others who have done more than he. Anyway, watch the movie if you're really interested in science. If not, I think it would be boring for you.
