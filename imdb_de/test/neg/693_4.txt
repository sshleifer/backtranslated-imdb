Wrestlemania 2 is the only wrestlemania | Thank God | It was not really working in three different places, and although it was an interesting idea, it did not really work. There are really only two games that are really crazy. The rest is decent, or most of them are pretty awful. There are some entertaining celebrities like Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was largely a waste of time. The British Bulldogs Vs The Dream Team game is worth the price of the recording itself, but you can see it everywhere. <br /> <br /> matches. <br /> <br /> Nassau Coliseum. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorff vs. The Magnificent Muraco / W Mr.Fuji. For the time it had, and despite the crappy target, this was surprisingly bearable stuff, and the crowd was really there. Crowd songs "Bullsh * t" at the end. That being said, it had not helped either career. The game ends in a double counter, where they fight outside the ring. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> Intercontinental championship game. Randy Savage | C | Against George "The Animal" Steele. Not so great wrestling, but very entertaining by the antics and a great comedy by Steele, unless a wild potato can wrestle and look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes to gain leverage. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jake "The Snake" Roberts against George Wells. This was better for a throwing game than it should have been, but it's too short to have any influence at all. Roberts wins with the DDT and pulls out the snake words, which disgusts Saint James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Boxing Match. Mr.T / W The Hati Kid & Joe Frazier vs. Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva & Bob Orton. A huge mistake in my opinion. I was bored and it was a marketing success, but I certainly could not entertain myself. Also many rowdy songs are noticeable. T wins by DQ when Piper T hits. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Women's title match. Fabulous Moolah | C | Vs Velvet Mcintyre. Ends too fast, before it even gets a chance to set a record for the fast fall of the needle, as far as the matches of Woman. Moolah wins if she exploits Velvet's missing splashes from the top rope <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Sergeant Kirchner vs. Nikolai Volkoff / W Classy Freddie Blassie. Great pop for the corporal. Stupid match, with boring insult from both parties, but far too short for the cause. Corporal wins when he beats folk off with Blassies stick. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. That's pretty entertaining, despite all the NFL talents. It's also notable for Bret Hart's 1st Wrestlemania appearance. Andre wins when he kicks the Hart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano & Ozzy Osbourne vs. The Dream Team / W Johnny Valiant | C |. Absolutely huge match, this is one of the best Wrestlemania matches ever. You have no time to breathe, with all the maneuvers and excellent ring psychology. This is pure wrestling at its finest, you can not call yourself a wrestling fan if you do not like this match. Bulldogs Win When Dynamite Kid Bounces Their Heads With Valentine <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena Ricky Steamboat vs. Hercules Hernandez. A pretty good game up here, both men show solid performances. Hercules is a bad animal that has above-average abilities and stands out well from Steamboat. Steamboat wins with a soaring cross body from the top rope. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis against Uncle Elmer. Terrible game with annoying comedy. The fans love Uncle Elmer, but I do not. Adonis wins with a top rope maneuver. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Funk Brothers vs.. Tito Santana & JYD. Pretty solid game here, with many memorable bumps from Terry Funk (the one through the table was something else for that time). I would have to rate this as my second favorite. Funks win with the help of Jimmy Hart's megaphone. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Against King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most hyped games in Wrestlemania history. Hogan can not lick valuable, and Bundy himself is not that great. The violence was brutal for the time, but Hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins if he flees from Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Conclusion. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. The tough wrestling fans should see this, but you really do not have that. There is not enough here to please a true wrestling fan. Vince blew it on. Do not be fooled by the hype of the main event, it's really a boring business, like most cards. Not recommended and one of the worst wrestlemanias outside of the brilliant tag title match. <br /> <br /> 4/10
