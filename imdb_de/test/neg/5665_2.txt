Out of boredom and great curiosity I decided to check this show today as my four year old niece loves her. I should have known it was a show that only a four year old could like. The show was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> First, the show was just not funny. The laughter track started at the most inopportune times, which was very annoying, especially since none of the jokes was funny. The laughter track eventually went off when the one kid, who is the cameraman, said, "I'll polish my lens." How the hell is this funny? The parts that should be funny (like meat drums) were fun for anyone over 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Now I have the feeling that four-year-olds are not the target group. However, having a four-year-old niece watching it made me so worried while watching it: it does not show very good behavior. In the episode I watched, she shows Sam stealing Carly's sandwich and knocking her to the ground, just so Carly can get up and do the same. I do not want my niece to be so rude. I also do not like the idea that two young girls have a web show where they reveal personal information. If this were real, there would be freaks everywhere. <br /> <br /> This show would probably be good and fun for someone who is eleven or younger, but whoever is older just stay away from it. I give this star two stars, since I suspect that it can be funny for a child.
