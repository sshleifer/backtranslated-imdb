Yes. Those of my generation, who grew up watching the old Sunbow cartoons, were pampered. The 80s Joe song was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well-written stories, well-developed characters. Granted, it was nothing more than a glorified toy commercial, but it definitely helped carry this toy line. Nearly twenty years later, they are bouncing and kicking in Valor Vs. Venom. The animation was at most average. The movements of the characters seemed to be jerky and doll-like. The film felt more like a sequel to Small Soldiers than a story about a particular military force. Then we have character development or lack there. Dusty likes to be Dusty? Slice and Dice like to do things together? What? Did the authors write a writing course on how to develop characters with the depth of Jar Jar Binks? As for the story. I like a bit of sci-fi. But the whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutated army was put to death in the Joe Universe. Mega Monsters or Toxo Zombies? But I appreciate the creators for trying to make the fan-boys happy by doing a martial arts action every 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS, but I liked the fight scenes between the two. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will enjoy it. I admit not to value VvV as I should. Again, everything is compared to what Joe did in the '80s, and frankly nothing is compared to the glory days of GI Joe. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will enjoy it.
