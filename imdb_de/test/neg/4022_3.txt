What was that sugar Brothers movie? I do not mind a little humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder's "The Privacy of SH"), but this version of "The Sign of the Four" feels like a Grand Guignol-like episode of " Murder, She Wrote "(from the beginning, these are the worst options: a montage of scenes from the movie), as directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a good actor and certainly looks that way (he's a dead alarm for these drawings from The Strand!), But his interpretation of the character is all wrong and overly humorous, from the stupid smile he often wears (thought Dr Holmes was in cocaine (not weeds) in his expressions of strange stiffness in the carnival sequences, not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man, he is so over the top that despite the subtle make-up, he recognizes him immediately Healy is a memorable but reasonably acceptable Watson, and he's not too much of a buffoon ... at least not more than the rest of the characters. "Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) exaggerates Mary Morstan from a 1930's vaudeville <br /> <br /> In terms of history, there are some pointless supplements (like giving Tonga Vampire Fangs, the appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live, leading him to a rejection of the island of dr. Moreau does), and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the secret next to Holmes, since we are informed about everything before Holmes finds out. And that's full of tired stereotypes: not only do we get the infamous buzzword "Elementary, my Watson" (which, as every Sherlockian will know, Conan Doyle never wrote), but we have such blatant similarities as Hindi music Visited white man in Hindi clothes, you have emerged from nowhere. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In Britain, in the 1980s, two rival TV companies tried to create a long series of Sherlock Holmes adaptations and produced their first TV movies as potential pilots. One of them played with Ian Richardson, the other with Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one that has prevailed through several episodes, the good one! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Travesty.
