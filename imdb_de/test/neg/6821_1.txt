Sorry, excuse me but sorry. Nice, very nice production, very nice actor, also funny. But those kind of movies with a dog (Rex German, Gery-Jerry American) with private detectives, with a pretty rich woman. ??? Hello producer, how many movies do we have with the same plot ?????????? What do you think when you make scenes like a dog that has a doll? Or any king of these dog activities ????? Microchips that can make you rich? Microchips that make a fortune? There are three master chips, wow? And the creator of the chips can not make the same chips again? Hello, wake up. can give us something smarter? Best, D
