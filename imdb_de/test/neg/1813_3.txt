Despite the great cast and potential of the story, this film fails on many levels. I was convinced that the director was a beginner. The film is very poorly cut, shows many unimportant and annoying flashes, has very obvious flaws and no exciting atmosphere. The question that kept popping up in my mind was, "So what?" I am no less interested in the protagonist and what happens to him. It's not that the story is not convincing, just the way it's narrated. The film tells the story. PERIOD. It's like an actor mumbling his lines without knowing what he's saying. The film simply tells the events without a soul. And the director is to blame. He does not know how he makes something interesting, exciting or enjoyable. (And believe me, I'm NOT someone who wants to see the tough 8 or 2 fast fucked 2. On the contrary, I like very slow movies.) I was convinced that the director was a beginner. But to my astonishment, this man has years of experience and has worked as a cameraman or camera assistant on many wonderful productions. Guess he had a bad year back then.
