Okay, here's a really quick review: This movie has blown. I wish I could just have a review that sets this simple principle, but I have to endure you with more bad review terms like "terrible", "clich√©" and "unsurpassed". It's the kind of movie you see when you're drunk or stuck on a deserted island with nothing else to do. Here is the premise: The vice president is captured by a terrorist group in a play-off hockey game, and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Really, really terrible, but on the other hand, I did not pay to see it the first time, and only my dad felt that after this movie in the wallet, there was no scope anymore. I hate the fact that he is a Republican and all, but on the other hand he has spared me the horror of paying for this piece of rubbish. Okay, that's enough space now to be recognized as a review, so I'll adieu.
