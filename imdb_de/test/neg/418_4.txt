Why did not they follow the book ... I am really sad and disappointed. I was so looking forward to this movie, but if you've read the book (maybe lately), it could be very difficult to stay objective. My wife did not read the book, and she loved the movie. <br /> <br /> The reasons for the disappointment are: 1) Cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, it's such a shame, there's a very small part at the beginning where the antimatter forms, but that does not last In fact, (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand), the perfect entry into the Movie_ 2) storyline between the (deceased) Pope and Camerlegno was completely gone ... That's the motive All in all too flaky a story and can not understand that Dan Brown has allowed them to put his name against it. Maybe I should visit this movie again in 10 years if I can not remember the excellent book (fat chance to forget the book, I'm afraid)
