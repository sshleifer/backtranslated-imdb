I only saw this movie last night. I remember the thrill of his release and to be honest, if I had been looking at it then maybe I would not have been so generous. I hate hype, it can ruin a movie. I think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was good too - though he kept wondering if he was rocky the whole time. It never went too deep. Redford was dark, but not too dark, and his character let me down in the end. For me he should have been more confronted with Demi - maybe throw her out or tell her she was paid for it. After all, he would have examined her before he made the suggestion - this is not shown in the film, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to anyone. He was so cruel that he broke it and the last straw was the house, and yet Demi fell on him? The passages that give an insight into the relationship between Demi and Woody were the best part of the film. There was a sharp depth that outshined the superficiality of John Gage's character. He could really have been much stronger, and as other people have hinted, I think the movie ticket was Redford, and they did not want to tarnish his "image." I say what the hell Robert was old in this movie! Woody and Demi's characters were, in a sense, naive, but I think that was very much intended to pull them into their plight and stand up for their decision. But the reality is, they lost their dream house and where did they go? Las Vegas? to play what little they had left, and then accept a proposal from an insanely wealthy billionaire. I found her naivety when Redford seduced her too unrealistically. The movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but after I said that on late night TV - it was enjoyable and I, if you do not think too much - also tasty
