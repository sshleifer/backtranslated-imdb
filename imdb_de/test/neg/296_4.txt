I've heard a lot about this new avian flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia over the past three years. Apparently, it's about mutating into something very contagious, and millions of people are being wiped out in a global pandemic. I just thought I'd mention that if you have not gotten around to writing your will. <br /> <br /> I also thought I would mention it because I saw something today called CARRIERS. It's about naval warfare, but it starts with a scene consisting of a cross between OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES that I saw many years ago. I thought I would observe something with added resonance after hearing the stories about bird flu, but after the inconspicuous opening CARRIERS climbs into a cheap and happy TVM and like any other TVM you will see the main characters One of them is a blatant authority figure, while the other main woman is a mother of small children. Of course, there is also a sick child subplot. <br /> <br /> What irritates the TVM format is that it overcomes the potential of a movie that is quite good for cinema. There's a pretty bloody scene where someone coughs blood over a nurse's face, and a very impressive Jay Walker shuts down, but these parts are quickly forgotten as the mood falls into the family mood - and almost every other TVM, the ever made - was made for an essentially female audience
