So you're a huge mantis and hang around the Arctic for a while, and you're tired of Eskimos beating you with snowballs. What does a huge mutant insect do? Of course in the big city! Take a look at the sights and maybe watch a show on Broadway. But wait! Just when you find a nice, cozy tunnel to give yourself your own name, some annoying people attack you !! Argh! Time to smash! <br /> <br /> Still, this movie is a step up from most other huge bug movies because it has pretty decent FX for 1957. But that's about it. Avoid, unless you really have to see another big mistake, or see other Perry Mason actors in a B-movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
