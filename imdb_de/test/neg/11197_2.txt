I mean, come on! This movie had such great potential, but it was like he ran out of money to finish the script and the whole damn rest of the movie was telegraphed about 2/3 of the way. The characters begin to utter the movie with all the reason for passing on to other characters who have not asked for information in extremely threadbare rooms. They also fall into a few stereotypical behaviors, as this must be expected in this film genre. It is really sad because this movie could have been so much more. <br /> <br /> I really hoped that this would be a good movie. There was a good spectacle. Mark Hamill does a great job until the movie falls apart, Sally Struthers too. It was fun to see them working on their craft and succeeding. Majandra Delfino was pretty good for a while, until her lines became untenable. I was saddened to have to say those lines that turned the credibility of the entire movie into something for every thinking moviegoer. Brad Hunt does an excellent job. He really has a surprising array of talent when you saw one of his last films, Lucky 13 (which was a bit of a crap). This guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and be lucky with the right director. <br /> <br /> Almost forgot! The music was so heavy that you might think that this project was handed over to a smaller film school. I call this kind of music "Teller Music" because you can easily tell what's coming from the music. Less is more sometimes. <br /> <br /> Cut half of the music out of this movie, get a good movie editor, some small transcriptions and this would be a very good movie.
