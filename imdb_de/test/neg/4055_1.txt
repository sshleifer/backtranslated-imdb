When I see such a video, I have to ask myself how it was funded. HBO or Showtime, or whatever the production company has to pay to go through the moves - hire someone who can or does not speak English to get up and bring something close to a conspiracy, pay strippers with fearsome boob jobs to recover and get down to roughly waxed types, find people to design and illuminate sets, acquire the rights to kitschy techno music, etc. But I have to imagine that this must be a vanity project for everyone who works as executive producer ... He must have nailed all these girls, right? And Bro is not mistaken about the "Spanish-looking" girl, but calling the police "gorgeous" is terribly generous. In fact, I would go so far as to call them something much closer than "abominable" or "fleeting." Turning these women around - sometimes * clearly * high with pain killers - was not so erotic that my testicles actually appeared in my body. Large. <br /> <br /> Why waste time when there are so many free hardcore porn sites on the internet? I wonder if the popularization of internet videos will kill the softcore video industry slowly ... you can only hope so, right?
