Maybe this movie was special in its day. But five decades later, it seems a bit strange, just another cinematic relic of the terrible 1950s. In this fluffy story about three female gold diggers settling in a Manhattan penthouse, there are numerous clich√©s to attract wealthy husbands. But the premise of the movie is lame. And the execution is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I did not laugh much. The plot about an extremely shortsighted Bimbo is about the only smart element in history. The general dialogue is shallow, as is the delivery. And the script structure is confusing. The action keeps jumping back and forth between the three ladies. It's as if the author could not quite mix the roles of the ensemble. The result is a plot that looks choppy. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And Betty Grable, with her squeaky voice and terrible hairdo, was just annoying. <br /> <br /> Color film is conventional. However, there were many rear-projection images that contributed to an outdated look. The visual elements are enhanced by costumes that smell of cheesy "glamor" of the 50s. They are just terrible. Viewers have to endure a fashion show, a plot point that reinforces how the director of the movie was thrilled by these dirty, happy rags. <br /> <br /> And then there is this orchestra. In what is probably the worst movie opening in cinematic history, the first part of the film features an orchestra that plays something bleakly melodious. At first I thought I would watch the introduction to upcoming attractions. But no, it's actually part of the movie. And the orchestra goes on and on and on. It has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the story. What did they think? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Marilyn Monroe in her breathing voice as she made her way through the action bimbos. But the movie would have been much better if they'd dumped the other two ensemble rolls, unloaded the orchestra, improved the dialogue with the comedy, and downplayed the crunchy, cheesy costumes.
