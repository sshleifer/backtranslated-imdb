I saw this "movie" partly because of Netflix's many good reviews and learned a valuable lesson from it. No lesson on ethnic diversity, but the lesson I've learned is "do not trust ratings". <br /> <br /> Yes, racism is shit and people are complicated, but people who really need to see this movie will be the ones who are the least attracted to it and the least affected when they see it see. The only reason I can think of the number of good reviews is that it's being discussed by people who are not used to thinking or making their first movie thought-provoking and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he has made this film, which should be called "racism for dummies" as emotionally overwhelming as possible. He seems to give people who do not spend a lot of time to give the impression that they have discovered a basic truth had never been shown in a movie before. It's not Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance ... An after school special for the most careless masses cut into bite-sized ham fistle pieces to make swallowing easier without too much introspection. <br /> <br / It's as if they're going to make anyone the worst possible, just to make us happy that we're such good people because we do not identify with the characters. Let's see it, people. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they are all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reversed stereotypes). It is done well (even if the dialogue is disgusting) and cleverly executed, so much so that you do not feel like asking "where is the beef?" until you can tell that the movie is done. The flaming car scene was well executed, like most of the movie, but ended up going nowhere. <br /> <br /> The messages are very persistent, and of the "behind-the-scenes" rappers, the producers clearly looked at another film, because there's very little to laugh about in this film, even during the movie intended funny parts. I have to emphasize that this is NOT a conversation, rather a high school diversity lesson ... the "blood on the highway" of racism. You could even show this to high schools if Jennifer Esposito were not "naked." <br /> <br /> In this movie everyone is an idiot and everyone learns a lesson (except Michael Pena) who gets the best role, but the most predictable action). <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, with bad writing and good actors .... an ugly cartoon by Paul Haggis for people who can 'handle something other than the bold strokes of storytelling ... a picture painted with crayons. <br /> <br /> Crash is a depressing little nothing that evokes emotions, but teaches nothing when you already know racism and prejudice bad things.
