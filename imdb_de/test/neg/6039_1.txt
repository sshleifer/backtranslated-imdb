There is no worse criticism for a movie than the word BORING. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are fun, some "fun" movies are really bad, but being boring means nobody wants to buy the DVD to watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> It seemed like a movie dealing with the Antarctic drama class. The lead actor spoke in a whispery hoarse voice, damn it seemed like he was seducing someone, and he did not care who. <br /> <br /> The film can not make money, if it is boring, I hope it dies quickly, never to be seen again, death.
