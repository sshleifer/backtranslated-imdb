This movie was awful ... It had absolutely nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe, none of which appeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> The beginning was a jumble of random scenes that most had nothing to do with the movie except that they somehow show that the man is psychic ... but not too good ... < br /> <br /> After the first 10 minutes of the movie, there is an hour when only the man looks for the character for his daughters. It gets a little interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died the year before. But that's the extent. <br /> <br /> And why, I might ask, was this movie rated R? There were two drops of blood and four curse words. And how in the world did you get into a video library? This movie was poorly played, badly filmed, poorly written and executed horribly.
