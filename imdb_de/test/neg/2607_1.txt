Impressive. After watching this movie, you'll know why America's youth are still lacking in intelligence and characteristics that contribute to the well-being of society, except that they are unable to function. Most people presentable to one another who lack the talent or the mind to make something of themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve-O), and the only way to glory was to make the living as stupid as they are by being hurt A guy who drinks horse seeds? Just disgusting. A man who puts a hook through his cheek and acts as a "bait" for sharks? This is not humor, it is proof of institutionalization. <br /> <br /> Overall, I left the theater, with no hope for humanity.
