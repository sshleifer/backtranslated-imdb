There is so much wrong with this movie. Greico with a girl's wig, old time-worker for time machines, tough guy Jones, left behind with a shotgun that has three shots, spiders with tentacle hands and bad teeth, etc. The make-up was so bad and they had few visible spidermen at once on the screen (Aliens Cameron technique might have been used), instead they decided to dress every spider human in the same way ... bad. The beauty of Greico's acting is that he keeps his bet on every syllable, as if he were counting how many words he is allowed to speak in the script. It amazes me that with all the information on DVD comments, there are still people like that who make films. This movie could have been worse, which I do not know. Oh and one last thing. I'm going on an SCI-FI movie hunt. The people who run this channel should not be allowed to evolve to continue the nepotism that exists in film and television.
