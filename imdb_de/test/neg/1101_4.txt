After spending all her money on caring for her terminally ill spouse, widowed Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) recently moved to the run-down family home of her deceased husband, Pennsylvania, with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz). where local legends speak of zombies roaming the woods at night. <br /> <br /> Just seeing the name of the film and the director of this movie in the appetizer was enough to scare me: Boaz Davidson is the 'genius' responsible for writing the Scripts for STV titles like Octopus 1 & 2, Spiders and Crocodile, while JS Cardone gave us the god-fearing "video evil" The Slayer and the boring vampire strip The Forsaken. With such dubious talent, I did not expect much from Wicked Little Things. <br /> <br /> And after finishing the movie, I'm glad I kept my expectations low. <br /> <br /> Although the film sometimes looks good and the scary forest landscape is used and the performers perform adequately given the stereotyped gossip with which they work, the plot is so tedious, poorly written and distracted that it does impossible to be excited about. Perhaps most importantly, the film's killers, undead children, who get up every night from the mine they died in, are not a bit scary, a make-up stain, black contacts, and a few shabby joke shops. Scars that add little to the sense of threat. Scout Taylor-Compton and his company strive to be scared of the tiny horrors and convince each other in any confrontation, but their admirable attempts to convey a sense of fear to the audience are unsuccessful: the little idlers just do not have that Right one must cool the blood. <br /> <br /> There are a few dull zombie chow scenes trying in vain to win Gore-Hounds and the last kill, where the victim's blood soaks both Compton and Heuring. Although tasteless, Wicked Little Things (AKA zombies in the UK) is an instant garbage - just another clinker in the filmographies of Cardone and Davidson.
