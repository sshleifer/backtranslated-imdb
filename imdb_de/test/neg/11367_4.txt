I liked certain things about this game. I loved the first-person perspective and wished we'd had that choice in the first three games. There is nothing better than seeing the monsters in your area. The graphics were really not bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with, even though it was just a shooter. The music was good. The things I hated were: the movement that was aimed at sucking and aiming was total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing without originality. The inability to save was terrible !!! Some of us have a life and would like to end the game later. I also thought that the weapons somehow sucked. This game is fun for a while, but it's nothing like the top three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff. I would recommend it for the novelty of the game in the first person, but that's about it. Play it at your own risk.
