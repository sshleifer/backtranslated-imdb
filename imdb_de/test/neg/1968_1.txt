Unforeseen sequel (the absurd idea of ​​having the killer snowman in an island resort where there is neither snow nor cold) brings back the mind of the psychopath and returns thanks to a scientific experiment that provides foreign elements reintroducing life to his Molecules (it's the best I could do to explain this absurd concept). <br /> <br /> I could go into depth as it lands on the island to kill a lot of tourists, but I just can not find any reason to bother, because it would be so exhausting. Anyway, the filmmakers think it wise not to kill the pretty girls ten minutes after they arrive (I mean seriously, why do we worry about even introducing them when we can no longer enjoy our feast for the eyes ?! ) <br /> <br /> The murder scene "Snow Anvil" takes the cake. Ice icicles stick out of the sand of the beach so that a victim can fall on it. Oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of Weenie pliers. <br /> <br /> See what comes to my mind when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie. Such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle you funnybone ("Oh, it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!") Or you wonder why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense. Jack Frost has the power to freeze water (.. how could they melt it in the first movie?) And drop the island to snow. In a sequence, Jack has frozen the water out of the pool, wrapped a swimming model under the sheet, causing her to drown and escape nowhere! ") <br /> <br /> I have to give it to the performers, but they are real soldiers because they want to make this miserable material entertaining ... Christopher Allport (... maybe unwise) returns as Sam to join him The experiments of humorless Humans (at least for me) fell flat, but the cast soldiers tried to get the most out of a very difficult situation, and with spirited performances tried to do the pitiful ones Prerequisites to overcome and miserable dialogue. <br /> <br /> There is a development that increases the danger for those present to face Jack, whose genetically modified water molecules allow him to cool / cool thanks to the foreign elements introduced resist, freeze, and, what is worse, it can reproduce itself now. Through indigestion Jack hacks snowballs that look like little snowballs look like, with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth. The killer snowman costume and the little snowball dolls that were introduced later in the movie could create tummy chills if you're in the mood for such phenomena, but I personally found this junk pretty hokey (that's the purpose behind it, I think, cheap laughter from those who are willing to accept it) and unbearable. The snowball offspring is an obvious tribute to Gremlins, where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in large numbers about terrorist victims at the resort. The weapon against them ... bananas! It was explained that when Jack killed Sam in the first movie, both of them fell into a cargo area full of antifreeze (an icicle rising from Jack's belly penetrated Sam's chest as he pushed her out of a window into the back of the car and I think that since they were "connected" by the icicle, Jack Sam inherited banana allergy, or that's what we should believe in!), and in a sense, they both "fused". <br /> <br /> Phew, such a movie defies a simple explanation. It's a movie with effects and plots that are so terrible that the presentation is perceived as pleasant because of its many mistakes.
