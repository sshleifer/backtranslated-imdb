Spoof films have come this far since Mel Brooks said in "The Producers" (1968), "Do not be stupid, be smart, come and join the Nazi party." It brought us sexy movies like "Young Frankenstein", "Airplane" and even "Naked Gun". But the good guys die young. Fortunately, the genre succeeded until the late 1990s. And then ... the Wayan Brothers set off the Apocalypse: "Scary Movie". Suddenly the word parody was an allusion to rough sex jokes. Most of the movies that have since become parodies have followed, including "Scary Movie 2," "Date Movie," and the movie that will end the Epic Movie genre. Sure, there was some relief. There was 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. Will Ferell has become a vehicle that takes advantage of every imaginable sport. The Wayans Brothers have also left the "Scary Movies" and were made by the trusted Zucker Brothers. While these films have a certain value in salvation, the genre is tragically condemned to be films loved only by prepubescent men who have just discovered what an erection is. People who have not yet explored the term "spoof" and cut and paste movies to laugh quickly. No heart, no brain, just cheap glue. Unfortunately "The Comebacks" has been added to the list. Dave Koechner (who co-starred alongside Ferrell in "Anchorman") leads a team of outsiders to a win over a coach (Carl Weathers from "Happy Gilmore"), who brought him back into training. Koechner has shown promise as a supporting actor, but as the lead actor in this film he just sounds like a script. He sounds too much like a passionate cold. Also, the jokes about being a coach encouraging the team to fail at school and later to walk in underwear from the police during the course of the film have already been made. Yes, that's a parody movie. But let's remember that even parodies can have quality. Give the characters dignity and a kind of sophisticated look at modern society. Believing in stereotypes will not make us laugh anymore (who knew that a movie with Jive-speaking people might lead to gangster stereotypes (not really, but you see)). I have to admit that I laugh a few times ... it was not at the same level. The football team itself had many clich√©s, including a Mexican, a cocky jock, a fat guy, the skinny nerd, and the mentally handicapped aides. Even the only woman in the team was reduced to stereotypical female humor, as she was usually sparsely clothed and gave allusions. In fact, her character, like most others, never developed. It's a sad thing for this movie. If it did not just rely on stupid sex jokes, it could have been something for yourself. In fact, this movie next to "Epic Movie" will probably be the joke for the coming time. Koechner deserves better. The script was generally poorly designed and even named the championship "The Toilet Bowl". So yes. Parody movies die. There's a movie called "Meet the Spartans" (be ahead of the trend, boycott now!), Which contains a parody about the collapse of Britney Spears. Let these children continue to get erections ... but people will grow up and lose them. We need food. One day they will learn to fake and restore parodies. Hopefully one of the heroes will be "Get Smart", made by Master Mel Brooks, who will be coming out next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 (stars)
