Lou Gossett Jr. is an outstanding and captivating actor, but when he plays the role of a "president", he behaves like James Bond. He runs around, carrying a gun and entering a warehouse to discover a plan that kills Christians and then being able to escape the supposedly high level of security to live another day does not do him justice - this movie has so many unresolved issues <br /> <br /> I will try to list just a few: <br /> <br /> 1 - What was the purpose of "stocking" a vaccine if no one was vaccinated? For example, if the "Tribulation Force" already had a vaccine at hand, the preacher could have been vaccinated. Later, Buck Williams' wife goes to the sick preacher and she becomes ill herself; Was the virus contagious? - IF it was contagious, why did Ray and his wife go to church without proper protection? - Why did not you get sick too? - And when Chloe drank the wine and was "cured", how did she suddenly know that wine was the "antidote"? - Was it California wine, ordinary red table wine? - could red grape juice be appropriate - and if the preacher had received a "communion" at least every time he preached, perhaps he would have allowed antidotes to flow through his body? - buck and Chloe got a "heavy" vaccine box that was never used - what kind of mysterious message should we see in it? <br /> <br /> 2 - The presentation of "evil" forces working with anti-Nicolai to destroy the world as Russians, Chinese, etc. is truly a relic of James Bond's 50s and early Era and shows an ignorance of modern society and humanity - should we believe that Russians and Chinese are constantly trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose mere destruction? - This was such a narrow-minded view of the world and was so clich√©d that it could be laughable. - The main purpose of this film was the scene at the end, where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, Jr. preach the unbelievers in the audience (by showing Kirk how he proclaimed Lou) - it was a movie without meaningful action, too many discrepancies with the Reality and a totally inappropriate action for a great actor. <br /> <br /> I therefore classify these as 1 because Zero is not available
