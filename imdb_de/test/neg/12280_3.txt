Essentially a flat-less action movie has raised two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s. Roundtree's smaller portion is far from his "Shaft" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another nefarious murder to his career "(this man was once a respected actor, now he has worn flowers in his hair and complained that people are up bleeding his rug.) Only Stack Pierce looks a bit dignified, so do not worry about the violence: most of it is too bad to offend anyone. (* 1/2)
