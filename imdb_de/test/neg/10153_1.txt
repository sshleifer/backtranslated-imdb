I got this on a DVD entitled "Scream Theater" and it's without a doubt one of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen. And I have seen some really bad ones. The school is out, and of three girls (of whom I would be teen if I eat my hat) they are talking about "non-stop party". Of course, they all go to the girl's house, whose parents are most strictly a pajama party. Meanwhile, a psychotic from the local beetle house has fled, in which the father of a girl works, with sharp objects and green coat and wide-open eyes is on the way. Since he has to pick a bone with this doctor, he goes of course to his house, whose place is apparently well known. In the meantime, some dumb-jock types are beating down beers and frightening the girls, and of course the madman shows up and starts cutting his throat. And that's it, as Heavy Metal music is floating in the background. Or maybe it's not like that, but that's all you need to know. If you do not spend your time getting stoned or drunk, you will not find much interest here, and even if you are wasted most of the time, you will probably still find your intelligence insulted. 1 out of 10.
