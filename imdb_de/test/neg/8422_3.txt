In the first fifteen minutes, the story of NAKED FAME is interesting: two male pornstars living in a seemingly healthy relationship at the end of the thirties decide to leave the porn industry and work for the world of singing and acting. The two captivating and cute men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton does a dance track, which is then marketed in New York with the hope that Colton Ford will become an instant star - a unique disco singer who announces his background as a porn star for PR The rest of the movie is grumbling and fighting and is commented on by porn producer ChiChi LaRue, and the movie slowly sinks into repetition and weakness. Not a bad idea for a movie, if every character's desire to move away from a successful career (though one was heavily influenced by the youth who lost both characters), has developed some more depth to an alternative. It's just that a one-note song gets thin quickly. Grady Harp, November 5th
