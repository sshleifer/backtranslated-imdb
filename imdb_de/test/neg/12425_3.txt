Some friends and I have the weird hobby of really looking for horror movies out of terrible and totally opaque (for good reason) and then watching them under the influence of mind-spreading consumer goods like alcohol and / or soft drinks. Surely many people do that, but they watch movies like the remake "Godzilla" while we torture our eyes and brain with stuff like "The Loch Ness Horror". And, Eureka, this is a prototypical bad movie! We traditionally open with pocket whistle music during the opening credits. Of course, this is to emphasize to dumb viewers that the story should take place in the Scottish highlights and not in the birthplace of Texas by director Larry Buchanan. For the same reason, the performers seem to be instructed to do too much and talk about cruel accents. American marine biologist Prof. George Sanderson arrives at Loch Ness with brand new and advanced sonar equipment to locate the legendary monster in the lake. There are now many other parties hanging around the lake, such as a group of children in a science camp (what a boring way to spend your holidays), retired army generals looking for an Air Force aircraft, the second A lot of thieves and failed scientists steeling the monster's egg One might think that these numerous negotiations bring some variety and excitement to the story, but unfortunately that is not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is an altogether boring movie with only a few noteworthy elements. The monster itself, for example, is a wonderfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and smoky breath. His teeth also glow in the dark, which is very useful if you are dumb enough to take a boat trip in the middle of the night. Towards the end of the film, the remaining performers were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than in the monster. So it was time to finish it. "Loch Ness Horror" is highly recommended if you are a fan of bad B movies from the 80s. Note, however, that it contains a wealth of meaningless dialogues and a bizarre end that seems like the movie is suddenly out of budget.
