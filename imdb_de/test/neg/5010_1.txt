I tried to look at it and was very disappointed. Do not expect intelligent and insightful humor like Amy's brother David in the midst of this filth ... it's the exact opposite. But if you fancy shit, fart and boner, you're in seventh heaven. I suppose that's bathroom humor, which is aimed at those who have multiple bongs, which can only explain why many enthusiastic reviewers have called this crap "the best television book of all time". I assume that those who hate such a simple humor could not watch long enough to submit a review, but I'm just sending a warning shot to those who are unaware and looking for high-end comedy , The characters override each other. The shock factor is set to 10. And the laugh is set to zero (unless you're looking for youthful humor.) <br /> <br />. I made it 40 minutes and prayed all the time It would turn the corner towards a rewarding conversation, but unfortunately it got worse and worse. And beware of Amy's omnipresent and malicious overbite expression - it will make your eyes run. It was nice to see cameos from well-known comedic actors I like, but I can only assume that they were ready to join the Sedaris family as a favor. , This is my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review.
