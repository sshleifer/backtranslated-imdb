"Tragic Hero" is definitely a film that tries to imitate the classic Godfather movies and focuses on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. This is also part of a two-part series, as The Godfather (at the time) was too. However, this film is nowhere near the level of these classic films and is actually worse than other triad thrillers released in Hong Kong at the time. <br /> <br /> One reason is the acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the drama is generally exaggerated and unbelievable. The audience tends to find the process humorous just because the actors are unable to remain serious. Therefore, the movie is not really emotionally involved or intense because we do not care what happens to those characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the lack of focus. The narrative tries to include many different elements of the story in the film. However, this means that parts of the film are underdeveloped and there is no real sense of coherence. The audience sometimes gets lost in the processes we are about to see, and we do not know what the motives of the character are. we do not care who lives or who dies; The scene loses its intensity and tension. The other action set pieces are more worldly, with the feeling that they are too controlled and not free-flowing. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a purely average movie that is not recommended for the general movie Viewer ... Only hardcore genre fans and fans of Chow Yun Fat should consider this movie as a viewer.
