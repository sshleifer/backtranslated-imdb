I bought this movie at Blockbuster for $ 3.00 because it sounds interesting (a little bit of Ranma-like, with the idea of ​​someone pulling a skeleton around) because there's a cute girl in a miniskirt on her back, and because there was a sticker with limited visibility. I thought it would be a sweet or at least straightforward story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I have to ask myself how the limited sticker came about, because there is hardly any malicious language, little violence and the closest thing to nudity (honest! I usually do not go around hoping!) Is when the girl is in her nightie and you see her panties (you often see her panties in this movie because no matter what, she wears a sort of miniskirt). Even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, distracted, unoriginal and at worst not funny at all - it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens' "Jesus will wear a Rolex on his" TV show "). This would hardly qualify as a PG-13 (it will not be rated), but Blockbuster does not allow it to be rented out by minors under the age of 17 - as if it were pornographic - any small child could go there and the edited version of Rent a requiem for a dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> <br /> It's like that, but not that way. <br /> <<In a way, it worries me - that The only thing that could offend people is the idea of ​​suicide in the beginning, if anyone has to watch movies with well-described suicides (not this, but better ones like The Virgin Suicides), then it's the teenagers As a result, I have little opportunity to turn a story I've written into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death among teens (I think it's number two), so there's a chance that most teenagers will or will be affected by it. <br /> <br /> Just say no to this movie but still. 10.2.
