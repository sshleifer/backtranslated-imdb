Robert Aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy "The Grissom Gang", a reworking of the British film "No Orchids For Miss Blandish" (1948), has kidnapped the heiress Kim Darby of the 1920s from a pack of clumsy thieves. Soon this gang will be dispatched, and poor Kim will be thrown into the clutches of another crooked mass - third-class gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen on the train. First, Darby (not very brave and not very smart) tries to escape this drooling breed, but they are focused on her. At some point she just gives up trying and that's the trouble with the story. Should we sympathize with her in the audience? Should her growing concern for the family be heart-warming heartwarming? These are disgusting, criminal characters, and I wanted to see as little of them as possible. But with the side stories (the progress of the cops in the case and another involving Floozy singer Connie Stevens) pretty boring, the director has no choice but to oppose those sweaty faces. Soon, even the nervous Darby begins to sweat, although her scene on the hayloft is sensitively executed and Aldrich's climactic moments to think about, if they are messy. ** from ****
