This is the worst work Daniel Day Lewis has ever done ... I can not believe he did that awful movie and my left foot in the same year ... Please, stay away from this movie ... this It is a film only for Argentine people as a curiosity ... The plot is impossible to understand ...... The author says that in Argentina all people speak English ... Of course Patagonia bring a very good frame photoshoot of the film but that's no reason to watch this movie ... I'll repeat it only if you're a big fan of Daniel Day Lewis or if you want to see the south of Argentina, part of Patagonia. and you do not have enough money to travel by yourself .......
