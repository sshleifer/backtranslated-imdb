This cheap, grainy-filmed Italian film is a couple of heirs to a manor house in the Italian countryside, who go to the house to stay there and then have themselves killed by ghosts of those killed in this house. <br /> I was not impressed. It was not really scary, mostly like a cheap Italian movie. A girl, his two cousins, and a cousin's girlfriend go to this huge house for some reason (I could not figure out why) and stay there to clean up and check the house. Characters come in and out of the movie, and it's boring in some places, and the majority of deaths are pretty rushed. The girlfriend is hit by a car when she fled the house after a dream of her death, and the scene is pretty good, but then it gets back to a puzzling ending when the male cousins ​​turn to a weird one Way of being killed together. and this crazy guy (I could not figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe I just do not remember) is following this one girl and attacking her until that other girl finally kills him. I hate to reveal the end, but oh well. The female cousin decides to stay in the house and watch it, and they show scenes of her life that lived there years later. The end. You really do not miss anything and you probably will not find it anywhere anyway, so you're in luck.
