Occasionally, after "South Park", I accidentally run the TV, and in the end I catch something from the wreckage of the middle school bumblebee "Mind of Mencia". It's the only time I wish my room was cleaner because I could find the remote much faster. The truth is that Comedy Central needed a replacement for "Chappelle's Show," and what they got was a show that appealed to idiots who either miss Dave enough to be on a minority show or are content with the level. "Mexicans love tacos," jokes Carlos Mencia every week. I understand, however, that there are some people who find Mencia * shuddering * funny. I stand by my words when I say that these people exist only in myth. However, when you're actually out there, all I'm asking is that you'll never come to my neighborhood and read those big differences between Carlos and Chappelle's Show. <br /> <br /> 1) Dave was funny. Maybe you would like to highlight this. <br /> <br /> 2) "Chappelle's Show" was FIVE times as nervous as Mencia could ever hope for. Every time a promo runs for his little show, it's all about him. He makes his own horn aware that he has never seen anything. You have that right, Carlos. And not in a good way. Chappelle did not have to tell people that he was nervous and funny. We all just stayed around and watched the show to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually had racing jokes that plunged into different cultures - things some people did not know about. Like his game segment "I know black people". The main prize was a hair cream that blacks use. This is deeper than Mencia would ever dare to dive. How dare he call himself nervous? If Mencia wrote this sketch, the main prize would have been fried chicken and Kool-Aid. And my allegations have earned something. A few days ago I saw a promo for his show (which I affectionately called "my television monitor for thirty minutes") and it was some stereotypical Olympics sketches that I thought were pretty for myself. Funny concept Then I saw that the Mexican, who won, received a green card as the grand prize. That's it?! That's as close to the fire as you want? Who CAN NOT think about it in grade 7? For you fans of the show, if you ever watch and miss one of his punchlines - maybe because you and your friends have discussed how "Duh-de-Durr" never gets old and is in no way part of the joke where someone is funny, something clever has to say - remember that there are only five options for the punch lines anyway: green card, tacos, border jumper, lawnmower and, of course, duh-de-dur. Just remember - whatever it was, it was screaming. Have fun! <br /> <br /> 4) With reference to number two. Every time he says something that makes him laugh, he pauses to tell people (laughing at his own joke) that he thinks he has "gone too far with the last one". Then do not say it for heaven's sake. Or let people decide for themselves. He and Comedy Central keep pushing this tripple over and over again, making this Tell It It It show rather controversial than The Da Vinci Code. You are not you will never be. <br /> <br /> I have never insulted the content of the show. I would never appreciate it so much. I'm offended that Carlos Mencia has thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily. Yes ... I am literally offended by this fact.
