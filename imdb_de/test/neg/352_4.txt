This version is very painful to look at. The entire acting is very stilted, but especially of Norma Shearer, who still acts as if she were in a silent movie and not in a talkie. Take a look at the 1937 version with Joan Crawford, Robert Montgomery and William Powell, which is much more entertaining.
