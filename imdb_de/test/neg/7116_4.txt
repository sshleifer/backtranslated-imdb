Mr. Brento wonders if this movie was produced by the producer of the Dragonball Z TV series. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a real Hong Kong action movie based on the first episodes of the original Japanese cartoon (also based on a comic book series). And I really do not know if it was produced under license from the Dragonball creators ... <br /> <br /> However, the story of the monkey boy with special powers is a story known throughout Asia (in Japan, the boy is called in the story of Songoku, Sunwukong in China, Sonogong in Korea (etc), and the story in Dragonball has a lot to do with this story. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is based on the first episodes of Dragonball. Series (which was followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the US version had a different broadcasting order), and all scenes related to sexuality were also included in the original animated series (without too much concretization and insistence on it! ), But based on your comments, I could assume they were completely removed in the American dubbing <br /> Anyway, I agree with you that the movie played too much and how bad d This adaptation of the original cartoons is. But maybe nobody can forget it after I saw it ...
