This depiction of the popular children's story in the movie is pretty pathetic. I know that this is one of the earliest filmmaking efforts, but this 15-minute image is uninspired and poorly recorded. "The Great Train Robbery" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> We see the little long-haired Jack a cow (two men in a cow For a hat full of beans from a dealer and later grows a beanstalk from where she is thrown by her mother in the yard (I think poor Jack has reached the wrong kind.) Jack dreams of a goose (it seems to be a chicken) and a golden egg, and the next day the stalk rises into the sky. <br /> <br / > In this film, no effort is made to be creative, the stalk looks like a rope with leaves, the giant is just a big bearded man in a house that is nothing unusually large compared to Jack and the culmination of the It's miserable when a stuffed dummy falls out of the screenshot instead of the giant and the actor takes his place in an exaggerated death-dance, as in most early movies n. The bean rod (leaf-covered rope) comes down from above and winds neatly on the forehead of the giants. <br /> <br /> See something else.
