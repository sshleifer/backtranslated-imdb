I thought I could see something good, but ... I'm tired after seeing this movie, I do not know what I hated most: the script, the acting, the effects or the music. Try to imagine the worst Power Rangers episode and still be too friendly. I've seen better effects in FPS games (The touch of the bone sword or his breath, which makes people disappear in a green smoke, is a touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a western spaghetti. I liked the way the women screamed in the car when the "monster" walked around the car (even though she was looking the wrong way). So take a break and do not look at this thing, at least call someone to watch a horror movie with you. Trust me that you will end up monopoly for some kicks.
