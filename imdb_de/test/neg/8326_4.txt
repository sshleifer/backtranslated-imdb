"Black Vengeance" is an alternate title for "Ying Hung Ho Hon" AKA's "Tragic Hero" (1987). I've just seen this on the VHS, along with the first part of the story "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also in 1987. (The poster and the 2 stills on the page are for a 4-DVD set from movies with Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2) and Richard Lawson (Black Fist) The fourth movie is called "The Black Six" Strangely enough, while the characters have their original name in "Rich and Famous" Chow Yun-Fat in "Black Vengeance" is called Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry and Andy Lau's name is Johnny, but confusing is the fact that the copyright date for both movies is 1994. Maybe According to IMDb release dates, "Tragic Hero" was released before "Rich and Famous." Was there a reason to release the sequel first, despite comments from some users? I g. these films although they are not among the best of CYF, like "The Killer" and "Hard-Boiled", which is really amazing. However, one day, when I come across a 2-DVD set of "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero," I do not hesitate to buy it. I hope these comments on "Black Vengeance" will be clarified, which were also a mystery to me, where they belonged to the filmography of Chow Yun-Fat.
