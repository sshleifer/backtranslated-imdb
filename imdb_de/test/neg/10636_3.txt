I just saw it on TCM today and was shocked by the over-functioning of Jean Arthur. She tore her eyes in surprise and just exaggerating everything was not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was wonderful in her reserve and weird timing. She is the best in this movie. The Wilder-Gags were flat and, frankly, something that a freshman would say trying to "get away" when he's evil, funny and dirty, but it just sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed like the humor was pushed too hard to be funny. The end was completely thought out. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD: I never thought for a moment that Art Lund suddenly fell in love with Dietrich and then suddenly fell in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy. Really 3 out of 10.
