Tycoon is never listed as one of John Wayne's better post coach movie. It is good in spots, has some fine action sequences in the cave and also in the high tide. The action leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> What we have in Tycoon are two men who absolutely dislike each other and dislike prevents them from working as a team. The multi-millionaire Cedric Hardwicke has commissioned John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad. But then he refuses to give them the money to do the job properly. <br /> <br /> Things get really complicated when Wayne falls in Hardwick's daughter Laraine Day. After a night of spending time alone in an Inca ruin, Wayne and Day get a shotgun wedding by convention in South America, even if nothing happened. They were locked up in a room for 24 hours to sort out their differences find out another way. Her little spits cause a few deaths under Wayne's crew. <br /> <br /> But what's best known about tycoon is another little thing. Laraine Day was married to Leo Durocher, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, when this movie was filmed. He was constantly on the set, madly jealous of John Wayne, whom he thought might have an affair with his wife. Nothing against it, but he made the life of his wife unhappy. <br /> <br /> Not one of the Duke's better efforts.
