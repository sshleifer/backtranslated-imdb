The title makes viewers believe this is an entertaining movie and probably much better when viewed under the influence, but it's not good at all. A 15-minute sequence, in which Jack Black plays one of his songs beautifully and stumbles on acid while venturing through the woods, does not save this film. Every actor in this movie went on to do better things, except the main girls, whom I could not think of a movie I'd seen before. I hate to make films, but I do not hate finding something decent in movies. The film is sad, not very funny and had such a potential with its great cast. If it were renewed and overwritten, it could be fantastic. If you want to watch a good movie, see Omas Boy or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused. However, this is not a movie you can even see.
