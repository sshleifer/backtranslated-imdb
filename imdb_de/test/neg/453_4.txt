I'm and still is a big fan of Doctor Who, but I was very disappointed when I started to watch this new series. Children under the age of 15 or even better under the age of 10 will probably enjoy it best, and possibly new fans who have not seen any of the original series. But for fans of the original series, this series will lack much of the charm of the original series. So great, David Tennant has made me appreciate how much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a Doctor in Season 1. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this series only to people who have not seen much of it Original series, people under 15 and EXTREMELY THE HARD, the fans, everyone else will just get a laugh and whisper words about Russel T. Davies mumble, one of our favorite TV series.
