The movie is not bad in itself ... until you see the original movie Hitch (2005) with Will Smith. The film is a direct copy, and even the dialogues for most of the movie were simply translated from English into Hindi! The representation in the original is closely executed. The Hindi version does not interest viewers. The exaggerated nature of David Dhawan's comedy seems to have been too loud, with Govinda always screaming hysterically ... sometimes more time is spent understanding the reason for it than the plot. :) <br /> <br /> If you speak English, which you assume you are reading, look at the Hollywood original. At least look at "hitch" when looking at partners to compare. This is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, I regret to say, is sadly raised by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
