This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie moves in and I almost shut it off, but I gave it a shot. I had not expected anything great, but I had expected more than that. Well, I work in a video library and have seen this for free because I would not spend a dime on this movie. I gave this movie a 2 just because I've seen worse. If I were you, I would stay away from it, very far away.
