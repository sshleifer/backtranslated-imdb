My name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Review: ...... Because I saw that. <br /> <br /> This is something else. First of all, how is this rated so highly? I can not understand this. This "show" fills up with either annoying people, stupid people or just unlikely. The "gags" are abominable. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode where Earl's brother's wife wrapped herself in dead fish and washed. Not a joke. That was not funny, that's disgusting. Then she and Earl's extremely stupid brother (and I mean stupid) then had sex. I almost vomited. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the most desperate attempts of the comedy for a long time. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but in this terrible "comedy" he is trapped in a helpless role. <br /> <br /> Earl is now in jail for this season. Let's hope he gets the chair, so that this show is torn from their misery. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: This show would be fun for people who think the guy from Larry the Cable is funny. No chance for the rest of the world. Avoid like the plague.
