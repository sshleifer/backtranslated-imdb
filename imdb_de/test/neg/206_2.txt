A movie with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... sounds great on paper? I suppose it must have happened, if someone has lit the production of this movie green, but the end product is terrible! <br /> <br /> The story is boring, the action boring and for a movie it's just 88 minutes it just seems to pull. I could feel my life slipping, and I was sure there was something better I should have done ... any color you might want to see dry somewhere? <br /> <br /> sigh. I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but what did he think when he signed up? There are so many other great action movies. Take a look at one of them and forget about this movie.
