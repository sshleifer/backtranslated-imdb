This is not a new movie. It's a remake of 1994's "Emmanuelle, Queen of the Galaxy," and it has been severely cut. Attention: Many characters appear in the credits that were cut from the movie! <br /> <br /> If you want to see them in their original form, select "Queen" - avoid them in all circumstances, the cuts make it even more hackneyed than it was originally.
