This is a relatively predictable movie (+1). After seeing UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, it looks good in comparison. There are no obvious technical gaffs, though the vampiric teeth look weird. <br /> <br /> The story makes no sense. Just take a look. An American GI is fighting against vampires. Return to the States and be rehabilitated to see ... vampires. His commander is the aunt of his ex-wife. Who is researching the biodiversity of the South American area where the vampires are located? Huh! Do not stack too many coincidences. Who cares about the head vampire? Or his daughter? Or one in this movie? The only originality is that most myths about vampires (allergy to crosses and garlic that can not come out during the day, etc.) are wrong. But they can only be killed by decapitation or a wooden wound in the heart. Yes exactly. It is obvious that they did not want to make a dark movie, as this is a movie produced for the TV movie. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice for the viewer if he had hired some actors. Oh, they have Lynda Carter (TV's Wonder Woman) and a big black guy with an enormously deep voice growling appropriately to show off his vampire teeth prosthetics. Otherwise, you would never know that they actually paid people to read these lines. <br /> <br /> There are more than enough fighting scenes and some vampire-biting blood, but no real violence.
