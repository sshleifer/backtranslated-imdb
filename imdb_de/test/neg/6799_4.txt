Bizarre. This movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this movie is fiction. I think it's trying to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination for curios and made her her main focus on photography. In the movie, the wolf man moves into the apartment above her. She seems to be obsessed with him and falls in love with him. She places her children and her husband second to the Wolfman and even tries to integrate him into their family gatherings. Some of Wolfmann's freak show-side kicks come by and she mixes with them. The whole thing is very bizarre. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing special. It's just something weird about a woman getting her jollies off the Wolf Man's shave. I think you can find better movies there.
