I rented this movie for the first time on the infamous day of September 11, 2001. Since then I have seen him several times. My only complaint is that it is too short. "Strangeland" would be a complete piece of horror art after two hours. Currently, the duration is only one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Ex-Twisted Sister member Dee Snider wrote, produced and played in this 1998 shock festival in a small Colorado town. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a crazy sadist who has psychotic ideologies about human evolution and love near-death experiences. Hendricks is not a phony, he is a six-meter high "modern primitive". Someone who has tattooed and pierced his body to the utmost. When he makes his first full appearance in the film, this is a truly scary sight. Hendricks' most important hobby in life is to share his "spiritual awakening" with his abducted victims. He visits Internet chatrooms under the name "Capt. Howdy" and invites people to his home. They think they are going to a party. Instead, they are in a house full of pain and suffering. Hendricks closes her eyes and mouth and tortures her by inserting blades and hooks into numerous parts of her body. If it sounds sick, it's because it's so. <br /> <br /> One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the teenage daughter of detective Michael Gage. Gage not only manages to save her but also arrests Hendricks. Four years later, Hendricks is released from a mental institution that has been wholly rehabilitated to disapprove of the community. A group of Rednecks, led by Freddy Krueger, the actor Robert Englund, decides to kill him. They fail and Hendricks returns to his old self. I'll leave the rest of the film to you, just to say that the conclusion is satisfactory and will leave you in shudder. With the exception of Snider, the drama is not too good, but it's usable. The direction is okay too. There are some funny parts in "Strangeland" and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack, it's great and it's worth buying if you love rock. Overall, this is a worth watching movie. If you love cheap horror movies with a sense of humor, have a look. You will probably like it.
