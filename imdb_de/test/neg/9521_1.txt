I was very interested to see this movie, even though I had read an article about the director in Tattler Magazine. I can not judge movies by what the director has done or not. This debut was very hard to see. I found the split screens as a distraction to the film's drama, some of the minor characters performed poorly and the film was a copy of several other films I've seen. It was really nothing new
