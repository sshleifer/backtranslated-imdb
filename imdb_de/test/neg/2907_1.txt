A montage prologue, evidently made by the blessed maniacs who have decided to banish this thing, tries to convince us that the weird impression of this amazingly incompetent part of nothing is completely deliberate. Do not believe it: this is for Lloyd Kaufman, as Andy Warhol is for Herschel Gordon Lewis. It is so thorough in his project of torturing his hypothetical audience that it seems like a kind of misanthropic negationist art installation. It just can not be, because it is so completely without self-confidence. As disgusting and ugly as "Things" or "Frozen Scream," this succeeds in self-recycling, with an irresistible bald persistence to be believed. For example, a shot-by-shot Hitchcock-style analysis of the Cardio Girl attack could result in twenty edits and maybe three minutes of footage - only the sequence is ten minutes long! You would like to believe that this life was a more bearable short topic, unless you would take away the repetition, what was left would be far less intriguing. When the "Fiend" enters the room, he only inspires vast, highly apathetic, completely blank glances from his imminent (off-screen) victims. Repeat this scenario about four times in slightly different settings. Bridge this with maybe thirty lines of dialogue altogether; offer actors even hateful and lethargic than those in the classics mentioned above; and decorate us with a monster of gauze, ketchup, and a yellow Spock ear, and you have a movie that's too confusing to reject it, a working definition of bad. I'm proud to own it!
