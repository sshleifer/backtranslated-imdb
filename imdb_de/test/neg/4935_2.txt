A mindless movie about two girls and some guys they meet in an airport that goes into the wrong night bus and gets into a world of trouble. Great twists and turns are totally and I mean totally wasted in a movie with an action that is so incredibly stupid that it can not stand the description. What's generally going on is okay, I mean, the idea of ​​a man kidnapping unguarded girls for nefarious purposes is a good idea. The problem is, the details are so incredible that I would be shocked if you did not turn off the movie in complete disbelief. Gosh, a man who wants to take you home does not go the way you know, and you stay on the bus? From then on things get worse, think of every bad decision and this movie has made the characters, even to the point where they could just go away, but never do. What's annoying is that some of the twists and turns may have worked if something smart was before that, but there's almost no intelligence in this movie. Okay, maybe there will be an end, the end is wise. The end is the kind of thing that should freak you out. it should be the "oh # $ * @ !!!!" his moment and become a classic horror movie. Instead, it's just between the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. One of the most brainless films of the year.
