I saw that on the cable. Someone had to lose his job because he had made this air. Just because a movie is made, it does not have to be shown! Savage Instinct should be shown in ALL movie classes. It's the perfect template to not make a movie. But the cut is so confused that you think it was put together by a team of trained (poor) monkeys who traveled in a jeep on the unpaved Canyon Road, blindfolded and drunk. The audio is often unreadable. Acting? I can not name anything that I saw here. Recite? Hmmm. I can not call it that. To fail? It works. All this is said ... IT IS HILARIOS! I can not emphasize enough that there is not a single redeemable factor in this "movie," except for the serenity that comes from his own incredible inability. Fun in a strictly masochistic way. Look at it ... if you dare.
