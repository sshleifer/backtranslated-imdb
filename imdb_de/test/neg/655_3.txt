I was quite excited to see this movie when it came out. The ads for it looked weird and I like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock in general, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed with sister Betty. <br /> <br /> Personally, I've usually found out that graphic violence and comedy do not go together so well, and the only directors that have successfully combined the two of them are, in my opinion, Tarantino and the Coens. There is not so much violence in Sister Betty, but I feel weird in the power of violence when I should laugh. Of course, part of the problem for me was that there did not seem to be many places I was asked to. <br /> <br /> The movie does not seem like a drama either. Renee Zellweger's Betty, the protagonist of the story, is clinically insane and can not really relate to each other. I say Zellweger plays the role quite well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear are also doing a good job. The problem is in writing. Freeman is the only person who can play an interesting character. It is really too bad. 3.10
