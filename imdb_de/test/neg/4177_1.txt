My friend Zac has borrowed this film for free as his mother works in a rental business. I still feel torn off as I can never get those 100 minutes of my life back. After watching the first "Dark Harvest" the night before this visit, I expected at least a shitty remake of the first movie. Not correct. <br /> <br /> There is not a single scarecrow in the movie (unless you count the cover of the box), and there are no real death scenes. The film received its R-value from an 8-year-old girl who yelled at his father with "God D ** N". Believe me, we tried.
