I write this note both as a chess player and as a movie viewer. I watched the 1997 Kasparov Deep Blue games on the internet. I know something about the issues raised. Other chess players will come along and want to know if this movie is worth a visit, and I talk to them largely. However, I will try not to ignore those who are not "in check". <br /> <br /> This movie is about the 1997 match between Garry Kasparov and the purpose-built computer "Deep Blue". However, the first image you see in the movie is not from Kasparov or the computer, but from "THE TURK". This is a "automaton" that was built around the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and won against all contenders. I put the word "automaton" in quotation marks because, as everyone knows, it was a fake. There was a man in it. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to watch "THE TURK", you can not stand the movie because "THE TURK" has as much screen time as Kasparov, maybe more, in both modern material and black and white movies old movie. The re-emergence of "THE TURK" a few seconds ago underscores Kasparov's claim that "Deep Blue" had human support - that it was (to some extent) a fake computer that IBM had cheated on and that "a man in it" was behind it the computer worked scenes to help win. Not only does Kasparov believe this, the filmmakers also seem to believe it. Therefore, this is not really a movie about chess or programming chess computers. It's a propaganda article about a big company that supposedly abuses a helpless grandmaster. It's really a kind of "negative campaigning" because it's full of ominous music and impressive camerawork and spooky sound effects and allusions ("we never found out what was behind that locked door") and the ubiquitous present "TURK". <br /> <br /> Well, most people in the chess community are pretty confident that IBM did not cheat and that Garry's paranoia was at work. First of all, for a person to help "Deep Blue" defeat Kasparov, it seems like you need someone better than "Deep Blue" AND better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the whole idea is suspicious from the start. By the time this film was made, there were computer programs that could run on your PC and beat strong grandmasters. Today, much more so than in 1997, we take it for granted that a computer can do things that you might not expect. And we're less likely to believe it's a monumental human tragedy that a computer defeats a man in chess. (All in all, Kasparov has made two bad mistakes, including the retirement of Game 2 in a drawn position.) <br /> <br /> There are very few chess games. There are a few comments from masters and commentators who briefly explain how they came to an end, but you can hardly see strategy or tactics. Of course, as a chess player, I take that as a big drawback, but I think non-players will be cheated, too. For example, imagine a baseball movie in which you can barely see anything of the game - just a commentator who tells you that "the White Sox have defeated the Astros with such a result." Nobody would make such a movie. For example, here we are told that Kasparov made a terrible mistake at the opening of the crucial game 6, but the position on the screen is not displayed or why it was a mistake or what he should have done instead or anything. We only see a few seconds when Kasparov holds his head in his hands, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. <br /> <br /> (Since I've seen this on DVD, I'd like to warn the chess players about the DVD) Well, the jacket promises you that the extras include the games "with analysis". Is this grandmaster analysis that people like us might find interesting? NO! It's the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis of a version of Chessmaster that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and you're in the "Caro-Can-Guard, Mainline". Blahhhh.) Someone might come along and say, "Well, of course, this movie is supposed to dramatize the game for the non-player, so it's unfair to be impatient." But it's also not very good when it comes to the Not addressing non-players - it's about a few points that a true newbie would have really explained. For example, it is said that Kasparov had received a "permanent check" in the second game, but it does not explain what that is (or show what it would have looked like on the board, which would have been interesting). It flashes back to the games of Kasparov-Karpov, but does not explain why there were two or who organized them, etc. I did not need this information myself, but I am familiar with it. If you do not have any chess experience yet, there are places where you can get confused, and this is just a defect in the movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I can not recommend the movie. Like "THE TURK" itself, it's not what it pretends to be (a documentary), but rather a stage illusion.
