on this swamp of mediocrity? You are so much better than this. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Frostbite is worthless. Bad acting (and I use that term loosely), minimalist "plot", sophomoric humor and dull snowboarding. There is not even enough representation of female cordiality to arouse the interest of socially incompetent but red-blooded men. Top Gun had spectacular flight sequences in which to look. Days of Thunder had a raging race action. Even Point Break was right in skydiving scenes. Frostbite is nonexistent. It is neither your time nor my time, the time of Traci Lords, the time of Carmen Nicole, nor the time of a human involved in this destruction of celluloid, which would have been applicable to something valuable, if not to this food would have been wasted for the recycling center. <br /> <br /> The world will be a better place if we forget that Frostbite ever existed.
