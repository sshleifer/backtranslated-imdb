The movie begins with a cult leader trying to revive a dead member while his followers sing after his rebirth as the sun hits them in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) wholeheartedly believes in his power and is so agitated that he collapses with an apparent heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all involved, doctors and nurses, are convicted of attacking with Reanhauer's demonic spirit into the curvy body of nurse Sherri (the big dickhead Jill Jacobson), who uses everyone as a revenge tool. Forced to her will, without remembering such injuries, Sherri murders the host's body as a victim. Fortunately, Sherri's colleague Tara (Marilyn Joi) begins a thriving romance with a blind patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), a former footballer whose mother was a voodoo practitioner. Through Marcus' knowledge, which was passed down by her mother, Tara learns how she gains possession and how she can possibly save Sherri before she unknowingly kills everyone. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land), worried about her present condition and well-being. Well, this was my first Al Adamson movie, and I have to agree with his critics, just because of this movie alone, he seems to hold them together with paperclips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which the mind takes control of Sherri is terrible and rather ridiculous. A little soft-core nonsense as a filler, some demonic obsession thrown into the mix (Sherri actually speaks a different voice when she's obsessed), with naughty nurse behavior. The three nurses focused on film are all pretty sexual active and free-spirited) and a bit of violence / gore. The film is essentially filmed in tiny rooms with boring dialogues from a more secular cast. The sexual situations are not so severe and Al shoots her without showing it all. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and lacks of thrills, though the scary rating (which sounds like something of Dark Shadows) helps a little. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (as nurse Beth, who appears to be a nymphomaniac, even plaguing a nutty patient, always complains about illnesses that he really does not have, with enough chest hair to make him a Neanderthal ) It looks bad, and Adamson's storyline is fragile but somewhat coherent (it seems he rarely directs films that are). Overall, the film looks like it costs $ 5, and Adamson just can not overcome budgetary constraints (or, in my opinion, create an awkward atmosphere due to a sometimes lumbering narrative and boring scenes that do little for the story) , John F. Goff plays the role of the psychiatrist at the hospital, who wants to commit Sherri without believing in the idea that she was possessed, and he keeps stroking Peter over her. I looked at the unweighted "lost" version that I think is the real version of Nurse Sherri.
