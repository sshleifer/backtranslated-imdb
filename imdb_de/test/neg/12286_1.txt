Dinosaur City adventures, though a creative idea, were a vile, cruel attempt to film. It's interesting to be sucked into a TV and into a new world. Three teenagers who are fascinated with half animated dinosaurs are not. Do not waste the time or brain power to see this safe loser. I would not even let my kids see it.
