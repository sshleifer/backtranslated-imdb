"Garden State" is another of those "indie" types that purportedly limit output to give the audience a real human drama. Strangely, the production is very good, as well as the performances (even by some pretty well-known actors). Where the picture is missing is in Zach Braff's screenplay, which seems to come mostly from other film sequences. <br /> <br /> If you are as young as Braff, you have not really lived enough to use the cinema experience as a movie feed. Braff's experience seems to be watching films and then repeating the same banal clichés in his own film. In Garden State he plays Andrew Largeman, a half-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown of New Jersey to bury his mother, who died after a long suffering in a wheelchair. He seems to feel nothing of all this; he has no relationship with his father, who accuses him of causing his mother 's paralysis in a strange accident when he was six years old, and has no particular despair because he has lost his mother (in fact, after the funeral, he goes to a party Inviting a friend who works as a cemetery digger, it smells strongly of "Beautiful Girls," even of a guy who returns to his hometown to "find" and hang out with his old friends, with a small "Ordinary People" by the side. <br /> <br /> It's really a miracle that Braff can achieve anything in his life, given his father and useless friends (I'm surprised he did not kill himself) who are still live their "lives" as if they are still in high school, celebrate with stupid bimbos, drink and stun, etc. None of them even knows him from his TV role as "retarded quarterback" (Natalie Por tman's figure, the most conscious person in the film). does) and say things like "Hey, I remember you from the junior year". These people are such losers, for them television would be a cultural leap forward. Even a friend who has made millions to invent a dumb velcro has no real reason to live, because his entire frame of reference is high school and party. And you do not need big money to celebrate like a sophomore high school student. <br /> <br /> Braff, as it turns out, is highly medicinal, which would prevent the "feeling" and dealing with everything, like an adult. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a lost girl who gives pet burials and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink dollhouse blown to life size. Anyway, they fall in love and Braff learns to "feel" again. The stereotypes come fast and angry. Braff has a long, delayed conversation from heart to heart with his cold detached father and tells him what it is and what the name of the game is. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in the Millionaire's house, and playing Touchy Feely is in front of a giant fireplace, and the play is so routine, so I gossip, a normal movie assassin, I'm assuming someone is approaching him Throw a sled into the fire. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to fill his trash, and Liebman tells him (in the worst possible line of the movie): "The body can cheat you." I once found the cufflinks of my former best friend in my purse my wife, and I have not had an erection for a year and a half. "Obviously, no trained doctor would ever say that, but it's scumbag poetry, a nod from Braff to his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of her, like that Like the "37" slogan in "Clerks" Kevin Smith nods to his buddies. <br /> <br /> In any case, Braff finds true happiness and goes out of the trash. The story is predictably happening. But if you want a movie that's wall-to-wall clichés, at least give it some charming performances to breathe life into. And Braff does it. He has the right kind of vacancy, the chance acceptance, to make his role as crazy Andrew both real and poignant, and Natalie Portman (also by Beautiful Girls) gives the film a big boost. With her tiny features and flickering mood, she steals the image as a traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mom, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better in "Shattered Glass") is notable as a friend of the grave-digger. I would recommend "Garden State" if you can not get enough romance from movies, but when people start calling it a masterpiece, they are just clueless. Braff believes you can take the same old tired plot, write some "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and clap on an acoustic rock soundtrack, and the material will be up to date. It does not
