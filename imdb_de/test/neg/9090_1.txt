I read in a Stuff Magazine about some of the wildest and bloodiest movies Asia had to offer and immediately jumped to Netflix to quench my thirst. Boy, what a mistake I made. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all, no plot what I expected as a plot (see: "Revenge") turned into a series of events that were in progress to spend their $ 14.89 special-effects budget and wasting studio time. They should have kept their money and not wasting their time or time. <br /> <br /> When a big conspiracy of the plot occurs, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer gets a new identity and I did not buy it. There is a flashback to answer our questions, but it seemed like I would turn on Showtime at 3:47 pm and drop ACID. The movie keeps going and gets out of control with cheesy graphics and special (Olympic) effects. <br /> <br /> Does this movie sound bitter to me? Yes. Did I see Iron Man? Was there a conspiracy? Was it so symbolic that I did not understand it? NO. Was there a body hammer? Beat hell out of me. So take my advice and stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I have to admit, although I had so much fun writing this and laughing about this movie that, if you want to laugh, WATCH IT !!!)
