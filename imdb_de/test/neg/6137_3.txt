When I gathered this together with the rest of the Marx Brothers box, I was disappointed with most things outside of A Night at the Opera. That stinker is the worst thing I've ever seen of them, skipping the neat lines and making the character sad. The playwright is so stupid in this play that it's hard not to attack the TV and choke it. <br /> <br /> It looks like the Marxes seem to be better, as outsiders have helped cause chaos much better if they have at least one good gag. The material here is obviously written for everyone, and it really wastes the talent of Marx. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
