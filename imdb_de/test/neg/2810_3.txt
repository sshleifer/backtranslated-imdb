When rich people are different from us because they have more money, filmmakers differ from us because they think the world cares about every thought. <br /> <br /> This complacent piece of Tripe seems to have been made just because the director felt it was time to make another film and someone would finance it. Not every trivial idea or reflection deserves a movie (unless you're a college film student trying to complete a course). When you have nothing to say, it is sometimes best to stay calm. <br /> <br /> The visuals are not breathtaking. They are very ordinary. The dialogue is incredible and incredible. They speak words that nobody would put together in sequences that are beyond imagination. Germaine Greers zipless-f ** k is finally brought to the screen. Even if you believe in love at first glance, nobody falls into bed as easily as these characters. They screw before they speak. Even more incredible is an aging, bald-headed director who immediately finds sex with the city's most beautiful chick, even though gravity reaches Miss Marceau at a young age.
