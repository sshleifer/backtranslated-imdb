Robert Carradine, a pre-nerd Robert Carradine, a pre-automaniac Desi Arnaz Jr. and an almost pre-teen Melanie Griffith, set off to Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming rich salmon fishermen. Well, her dream is about as exciting as this dull youth road movie. They are not very interesting, and the movie does not really make sense. Aside from "We've put together the spawn of some famous people and made a low-budget movie about their mishaps." From the guns of road and rebel youth films of the '60s and' 70s, this is a mediocre, underdeveloped, unwavering figure, not much joke, not much freshness in the story as bland as the muddy landscape of the movie. > <br /> But for those who are interested ... They go to Alaska, and apparently Alaska in the 70s was like the Wild West, because everyone wears a weapon and rough and crashes. Robert Carradine says charming things like "I hope we can find a shower, my nuts itch." (And he's the one with Melanie Griffith!) They're quickly robbed and forced to take work, and the local Bigwig, their employer, hires Melanie and eventually shoots Desi because she's not corrupt. Then they are not smart and do not leave the city, instead opting to eat dog food or get hungry, get beaten up by the guys and then go on a ride in Bigwig's car. The last half of the movie leaves the evil Bigwig, while the trio makes a robbery, escapes and performs an abduction scheme, and so on. The film somehow ends up being annoying and ambiguous, but since he has not bothered to have much character development and history, that's pretty fitting. It pays to see if you really care about low-budget 70s prices, but in the end forget about them.
