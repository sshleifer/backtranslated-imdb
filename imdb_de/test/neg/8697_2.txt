This film could have had a lot of potential. With today's technology, one would certainly expect real special effects. But movies are not just created with special effects, of course, acting is in demand. Both were missing! <br /> <br /> First I would like to say to those who are upset that they are not following the Bible: Why can not a movie acquire an artistic license? If you want to know something about the story of Moses, read the Bible. I've seen very few films that actually follow a fact story. Watch the film of its artistic qualities. <br /> <br /> If you look at this movie you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. It fails miserably. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. You do not see this here. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not compare, standing alone, this movie is too hectic. Parts in which a scene should be developed do not do this. It gets boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip this and have a look at the other one. As campy as the other one is, it's by far the better movie.
