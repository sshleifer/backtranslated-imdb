As an avid fan of Christian film and a person eager to keep an eye out for improvements in Christian film, I was delighted to see this movie. I was ready to see something that sets new standards in quality films. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is excellent, although Leon - The Professional is a bit of a rip off, it shows some great cinematography in the early stages ... everything after that was pretty downhill. <br /> <br /> I could barely prevail, I was tempted to turn it off several times. <br /> <br /> The acting, although possibly sincere, was unbelievably horrible. But the heart of the problem was the script itself. The dialogue was worse than anything I've ever seen, and even my amateur script "The Awakening "(soon an independent movie) looked like a Hitchcock thriller. (Which does not say much.) The good thing about this movie is that it was filmed with Sony's all-new high-definition 900 cameras spinning in 24P. This movie and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones were the first films that used these new technology cameras this year. Unfortunately, the performance of the camera seemed to be wasted with bad light, poor viewing angles, and cumbersome handling. <br /> <br /> The only good feeling I had while watching this movie was how good my rookie indie movie is; ) 4/10
