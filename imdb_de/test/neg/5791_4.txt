As a CA resident, I want to see that the shafts that shut down the power plants to raise prices also get jail time. <br /> <br /> I found the movie pretty good and has some very informative pieces. While they noted how Enron got up and crashed, I found it really interesting. But as the movie focused on its anti-Bush bias, I wondered if they were really accurate. <br /> <br /> It's nice to point out the Republican connection to Enron, but the monster was created when Clinton was president. The energy crisis in California occurred under Davis watch. Both were in office during Enron's abuse, but both are not held responsible in any way. Rather, many minutes are spent as Bush was friends with Lay. So what? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in the bedroom of Lincoln. Why do Democrats get a free pass in this movie? I think most politicians are a waste of our tax money, so I'm not partisan for any party, but I hate being subject to someone's political agenda when I watch a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve some guilt, but I really doubt that the only guilty ones have Rs after their names. I found no value in portraying the Bushs as Kay aficionados when the Democrats received as much Enron campaign money as the Republicans did. As I said, it weakens the rest of the movie for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts that they depict.
