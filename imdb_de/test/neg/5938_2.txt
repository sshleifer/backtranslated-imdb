Being a government bureaucrat may not be the most glamorous way to make a living, but it's still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one might think that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited paper shifter who attends only his next lunch break. Not a pretty picture, but that's the kind of image the audience has to endure if it's just another boring, loud and over-actioned action movie. Exactly what the doctor ordered ... right? How many of these movies has Hollywood done yet? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for these films is so dusted that it should be completely unrecognizable. The scenes change, but the actions remain the same, and with the same flat character development and flat behavior as trained performers, they are encouraged to evolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to be endless. "When will this movie end?" I kept thinking about it. Leonardo DiCaprio was absolutely unbelievable as a CIA employee, but what must be one of the great madness of abuse, plays the overweight Russell Crowe as a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie, the on-site staff is "lean and mean" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What did the casting director think? Why did not Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or Nicole Kidman plays a frumpy department store saleswoman? And the story was so fantastic that no literary license could afford credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to portray himself as an Arab ... speaks fluent Arabic ... and bundles all kinds of hair-brain systems that are doomed to fail ... and try to try out the thinking and the outfox in real Arabs, who are completely disappointed by his ridiculous Arab masquerade. They are trying to love a Palestinian woman while they are performing a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you have understood the point. Next time try to occupy a real Arab in the role. Not even the most na√Øve movie-goer can believe it all. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and the antagonist. In this film, the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that he leaves the story in ruins. Next stop for this movie - DVD Land and Oblivion. And something else. Do not let this movie stop you from working for the government. The pay is not big, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.
