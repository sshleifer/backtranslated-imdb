As each of you has rated this with more than two stars, I'm surprised. I've created an IMDb account to comment on this cr @ p movie. The effect is cr @ p and the plot is cr @ p. Without the descent soundtrack, it would not be worth a star at all (and yet there are some outrageously clownish tracks here, especially those that contain the oboe and black and white comic-comedy background music and in No the mood of the scenes they do The dialogue and the plot are about as complex as those of Dr. Sue's book, these actors are terrible, I'm watching this movie, and with every word I'm stunned that The only reason I did not turn off the movie was that I got used to creating an IMDb account and posting this review, digging mainstream movies, digging stupid stupid movies 'I dig retro indie movies and almost every other guy / genre when it's done well, my brother convinced me to rent it because he said it was good and he generally did a good taste in movies. From the moment he told me the title, I looked at him as if he were crazy. I have a difficult time to finish this saying because there is so much that can be talked about. The only way to streamline the good reviews here is that you were paid to have this movie rated high. It is so poorly made and not close to being dramatic, artistic, complex, well written, well formed or even bearable. If this was the end product of my hard-working directorial work, I would be embarrassed to make it public, and I'm not sorry for the director reading it - what the hell do you think?
