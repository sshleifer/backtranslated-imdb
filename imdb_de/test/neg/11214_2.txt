This review contains a SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> The film is an American Ninja who is mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls in love with the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hated grunt on the post to "folk hero" at the end of the film. This film is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched. It is good for people who are not interested in the development of the plot or the reality. Good for children under 14 years. The military mistakes in this movie are weird. I remember that during my three years in the military, we were not forced to greet or call the sergeant "sir", the film does this in several places. The hair of the colonel is far too long on the ears. The mustache of Master Sergent was in length against the military protocol. At the post, the colonel was the only officer. No other officer was led around the post. They had made idiots ninja who put swords against troops with m-16 rather bad. People who were filmed stank. Michael Dudikoff is not a really bad actor, he just has bad scripts. The ninjas were funny rather than dangerous. Avoid this movie
