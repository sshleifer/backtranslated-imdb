I found this movie completely and completely incomprehensible. I knew some facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and confusing. The pictures were strangely interesting, but I was looking more for a biographical and / or critical account of Caravaggio's life and works, not for an LSD-type drug tour. The dialogue was very confusing and the timing of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting. If it had been called "artistic film", I would not have bought the DVD; Now I have a DVD that I will never watch again and who would buy it? I prefer mainstream movies, not those that need to be translated or enlightened. Thumbs down for me!
