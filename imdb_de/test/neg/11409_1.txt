In another of the terrible horror movies that make me feel so masochistic, we have a group of friends in a haunted house, who are killed one after the other, thanks to a bunch of zombies that have yellow blood and very bad dental problems. However, the first 45 minutes are all in the conversation, and given that the young Thespians can not work their way out of a paper bag and given the most banal dialogue they can ever recite dispassionately, it is particularly painful to prevail. If you manage to stay awake through this nonsense, things will not get better ... with bad make-up galore and cheesy cash effects (not so special). As for the conclusion ... Well, what is the wager that the vintage car that warned you against going into the scary mansion will save the day for the last two survivors (of course a boy and a girl)? ) with his mystical powers? Please .. life is too short for this kind of movies. Spend the time you would otherwise spend watching this trip to support the community, or make a few shifts in a soup kitchen or something. You will feel that you have actually done something productive in your life and you have not put any money into the pockets of studios throwing irrevocable trash like this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is too late for me ... where did I put this version of 'Pumpkinhead'? 1.10
