If you're an average person like me and enjoy good acting, good action, good scripts, new ideas, or entertainment, you should skip them. To be honest, I was bored from start to finish, but tried to give the film a try and looked all the way through it - just to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The acting was unbelievably sub par, but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are guilty or if it was a ridiculously wooden and terrible dialogue with an even worse screenplay. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped, and I think the audience should take a deeper meaning out of it or be able to pass it by in some way, but honestly, that would be a waste of time. <Br /> <br /> The film has a kind of gross sexuality that serves no purpose other than showing a few tattoos and underwear. Nobody seems to have any motivation, other than making money out of some sort of "investment" deal that is never really explained. The connections between the characters are not very clear, and there is little to no character development. <br /> <br /> This is either a kind of subculture film intended for a very specific audience, or absolute crap. But you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 2 because it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but probably not the worst.
