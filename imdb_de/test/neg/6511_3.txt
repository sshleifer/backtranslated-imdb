Imagine that you were creating an alternative universe in which someone made SEVEN, where instead of a talented cast and crew, a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand-up comedian are used as lead actors. If your imagination can not stretch that far, just look at THE GLIMMER MAN, because it's the next worst thing. <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Jack Cole is a policeman with a hidden past and it is very ironic that he is played by Steven Seagal, as he is also someone who has a hidden past, but do not tell anyone because of it so is top secret. Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like Seagal became primarily a movie star since THE GLIMMER MAN continues in the films of Seagal's other films. Look at the way his partner comes to his office. "Yoi love beads man, in a fake office," Steven replies with something that's funny from side to side, or he would if someone could understand a damn word he said, because he just mumbles most of the movie , In fact, the only time I could understand his dialogue was the scene in school, where he meets the gunman who holds the class hostage. <br /> <br /> "Do not let me kill you" br /> <Is that what a policeman would say to a suicide? I just think that in another movie where Steven is not the hero (like a good movie), the policeman would say something like, "Do not kill me, I have a wife and a few kids waiting." At any rate, the suicide bomber blows his head off, but Steven saves his life by flinging them through two panes, and it goes without saying that you should not try this at home. <br /> <br /> Im As the story unfolds, Steven (I've given up calling him Jack, though he'd have to thank the writer for giving Steven a reasonable name) gets involved in a plagiarism in which someone from other superior films was stolen with serial killers. When Steven finds more victims, he can see him thinking, "What was the movie where Morgan Freeman was a cop?" As he inspects the corpses, Oh, and the action keeps changing into domestic life As a family man, this guy is so good as a family man that he is so bad as a movie star
