First, nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. They did not have to predict the bombing. Second - nobody has these six industrialists / lawyers / whatever has been missing for quite a long time? They were killed * before * the operation took place! Third, how the hell did Lugosi get out of the cabins without being seen? Fourth, why did not the Japanese just kill him instead of putting him in prison with a comfortable, same-looking companion and his suitcase? Fifth - oh, what's the use? This movie has some interesting moments, but when they explain what's going on, you've probably stopped watching. If not, you do not care.
