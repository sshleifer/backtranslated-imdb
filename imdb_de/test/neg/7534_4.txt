Think of an extremely cheap version of "Heathers" and you have "Pep Squad". That sums up the movie briefly. However, I have to give credit where credit is due. The film has a nice visual appeal. I liked the cinematography, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the costume designs. But without good acting, a movie has no redeeming value. I'd rather see a movie with little visual appeal, good actors, and sharp dialogue (ie, "The Brothers McMullen" or any movie by Edward Burns). The actors recite their dialogue either monotonously or screaming as if they were in a bad soap opera. That's why I do not do bad to most mainstream actors. Let's face it, most mainstream actors are mainstream for a reason. If they are not "big" actors, they are at least competent. People are in a bad mood, Leo DiCaprio, but when did you last see a movie in which he recited the dialogue as if he was reading from the page? It's a shame, because the director seems to know what's in the scene (SP). At the same time, I can not quite praise Steve Balderson (the director). He wrote the screenplay, which contains some terrible dialogues. He could also be a bit racist, since there is a black rule in the film that is home to a high point in African-American stereotypes.
