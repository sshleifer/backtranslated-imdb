This was a movie that was damned to his conception. The idea was lame - take a minor character out of a mediocre PG-13 movie and make a complete non-sequel as you change your tone to a PG rated family movie. I was not interested. Then came the trailer. Not only did it confirm that the film was harmless and generic, but it also managed to reveal the WHOLE movie. and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer. It's like a 3-minute Cliff's Notes version of the movie. Obviously, I would not pay for it, but as soon as it appeared on DVD, I thought, I look at it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save that. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> I'm still amazed why he signed up for it. He must have done someone a favor. The jokes were all so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to choose a very broad comedy style, such as Jim Carrey by Bruce Almighty. But it's just not funny. Apparently, the studio tried to share the success of the 40-year-old maiden, along with several Coell stars of Carell, a reference to the film strip of a theater tent and another musical closing sequence. But even the talented Carrell can not save that. His co-stars are not much better with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms. Wanda Sykes is not a waste, she is just a waste of everything she does, and her terrible one-liners and reactions just make you want people to stop giving their jobs. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simply predictably lazy. It turns you on its head with obvious foreboding, such as Evan's disregard of the environment (propels the gas-guzzling Humvee, chooses to use wood from endangered trees for his home, hates animals ...), and in the end it's just over-the -Top preaching both about faith and about the environment. Why the movie was made is puzzling enough, but I really do not understand how it was supposed to become the most expensive comedy. The only real effect work is the presence of all the animals, and integrating them into the scenes is one of the worst and most obvious blue / green screen work I've ever seen. Maybe the rental of live animals on the set cost a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it cost, it did not bring it to quality, that's for sure. But hey, it was not the worst movie of the year. There are still many worse guys like Norbit and Death Proof.
