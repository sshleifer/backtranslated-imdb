This could be the worst remake Hollywood has ever produced, and that says something. I go further and say that this movie is so stunning and misleading that it has to be seen. I do not know if I'm even able to tackle all the wrong things - like the fact that the casting director seems to have gotten names out of his hat, or the thought that Richard Gere has his character go away scot-free at the end (I'm sure people say "It's just fiction, who cares?" would have no problem if it had been a former Al-Qaeda agent who just wants to return to his homeland) Therefore I just dedicate my review to the extreme hilarity, which is mainly the scene in which Bruce Willis tests his weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you will remember that the jackal performs his kill on a pumpkin. The pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect called "understatement". In this version, Willis sets up a pumpkin target, but he does not use a sniper rifle - he uses a huge remote-controlled cannon that costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge eye-catching minivan (this man likes a challenge). He unveils the cannon by pulling away a tarp, whereupon Jack Black, who is to be observed, jumps around and says: "These ROCKS! This thing ROCKS!" About 18 times (I think Willis did not have to dismantle it first, he just lifted it with tarp and everything from the trunk, though it probably weighed several tons). The scene turns into an Austin Powers movie when Willis misses the pumpkin and pulls out a tree. Then Black runs through the mud, his pants fall down and finally blows off the entire arm of Black. The pumpkin falls uninjured to the ground. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this film for ONE non-ironic reason, this is the character of Diane Venora as a tough Russian major, romantically connected to Gere despite a disfigured face shape - a bold move for a Hollywood -Function. In the middle of the movie, I really liked that character, so it was a shame when she had to be killed. I would have liked to see a movie about her. Besides, this bastard is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 10.3.
