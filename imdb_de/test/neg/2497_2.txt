Six stars for Paul Newman's portrayal of General Groves, negative four for recording a highly invented event where the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman did not really exist. His character - or at least his fate - is loosely based on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who came to Los Alamos only after the war. In May 1946 he carried out his deadly experiment "Tail of the Dragon". This is a critical point. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were unknown until they were observed in the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions. If someone had died of radiation poisoning before the Trinity test in Los Alamos, it would be very likely that the scientists had stopped their work abruptly and the story had changed. Whether for the better or worse, we can only speculate. Someone should ask the producers and the director if they added Merriman's character for dramatic effect or sent an anti-nuclear message. For a more detailed and detailed discussion of the events in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, see the TV movie "Day One," or better yet, the Peter Wyden book on which it is based.
