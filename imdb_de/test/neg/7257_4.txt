I got a discount version of it. I had seen it a few years ago. My only recent experience had been "Mystery Science Theater", where it was faked. You never really get a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay. I love the beginnings of horror movies of the fifties. They give us a pompous talk about defense systems near the Arctic. These were there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but given the threat of very large insects, they should prove useful. <br /> <br /> This particular flies. For some reason, despite their exoskeleton, they can still fend off air-to-air missiles and deactivate fighter jets from the stuff the locusts are made of. In any case, it's more fun - first, the obligatory confused case that saw the flying thing and cooled its heels in a hospital (it teaches only one - see an insect the size of one House - shut up). I wonder if the poor guy could go home after he found the mistake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a pretty ordinary effort. It follows the usual effort to find a way to distract the stubborn beetle - and let's face other options next time - the Russians. I still get a kick out of these movies and this one is usable.
