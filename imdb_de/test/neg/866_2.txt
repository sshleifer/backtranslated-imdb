This movie must be one of the most boring and stupid films Perrugorria has ever made. <br /> <br /> It looks like a commercial from start to finish. The "director" spent the whole time on a tripod, he had no pace and no rhythm. It is illogical. what a mess. You can say what will happen for the first 15 minutes and the end ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ Spoilers ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ, how the hell was Perrugorria shot? Are you serious? Worst scene ever to shoot anyone! <br /> <br /> ------ End of the spoiler ----- <br /> <br /> Poor direction, bad script, bad acting ... Really bad overall. I would not recommend this movie at all. It is a waste of money and time.
