Since this show was changed from TSS (the screensavers) to AOTS (Attack of the Show), it went downhill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. The show was awesome, then they were fired by TSS for some unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it was less about computers than games and magazines. It also promoted bands that nobody had heard or were interested in. I finally could not see it when Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he did his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online podcasts, shows, etc. on the REV 3 network. Listen. REV3.com I think you can reach it at www.systm.org. If you'd rather have a real tech show than Aots, check out the shows by Kevin Roses or listen to TWIT's podcast
