YOUR PURPOSE TORQUE <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Quiet <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Film) <br /> <Two hapless nightclub Night owls (Laurel and Hardy) are unable to pay their bill, resulting in a violent retaliation by a spirited waiter (Tiny Sandford) performing their best work of that time, but still worth a look. Stan is in the spotlight this time, having a financial dilemma after holding back part of his pay to fund a night in the city, only to find out - too late! - That his abused wife (Fay Holderness) has replaced his stock with worthless vouchers. Some of Laurel's long close-ups, as he slowly learns of the looming disaster, show his genius for characterization and pantomime. The moral of the 1920s is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, who plays a back-faced, bustling body that takes great pleasure in alerting L & H's spouses (Holderness and Lyle Taho) to the bad behavior of their husbands. The end flickers, but the film has a lot to recommend. Directed by James Parrott.
