Anyone who wants to see a great work of art should NOT see this movie. A sophisticated movie connoisseur will undoubtedly be offended by the terrible production values ​​and the sight of an outstanding actor (Joseph Cotten) who hates money. Mr. Cotten either needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the movie was crap. The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews, who appeared at the camp late in his career, and terrible FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was in the struggles of alcoholism, but why did Cotten do this mess ?! <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, this is a revision of the Frankenstein plot. The first half of the movie really did look like a serious but seriously flawed version of the original Frankenstein story. Then, inexplicably, they introduced a daughter. That was not bad ... until then, out of the blue, they decided not to make a horror movie, but a softcore porn !! The change was dramatic and bizarre. It was almost as if they were saying, "Okay, Mr. Cotten has finished his scenes and gone home ... ladies now, ... STRIPES!". <br /> <br /> The problem is that In each level, the movie is just terrible, except for the monster's makeup. Although not great, it is still pretty cool to see. But bad writing, acting and a budget of $ 17.46 gave the impression of making this a shabby and horrible movie - one that is so bad it is not enough to throw nudity at the perverts out there ,
