Right, where do I start? I can not imagine understanding this pretentious excuse of a show. Imagine the following: a boarding school where children whose parents roll up money simply push them in to fly around the world. It could not be more diabolical than this. <br /> <br /> If you've been teaching these children, you should not even upgrade them to the term teens because they barely behave like crazy homosapiens, were selfish, think again. About 23 minutes suffocated her so-called problems, boy problems and the like. The heroine of the show was, of course, Mademoiselle Zoey, played by Britney's Polly Pocket Little Miss I'm All. This sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, obviously has a lot to learn about acting. I do, however, give her a face because her superficial, one-dimensional character does not leave much room for depth. She plays the sun, the moon and the stars of the Pacific Coast Academy, a crusader who fights for the misery of all women, equality for all genders. <br /> <br /> Perfect in every way, always with her two loyal companions, Nicole, the Daffodil Bimbo, who obviously has too much of daddy's cash and the tough chick, Dana, who proves a teaser. Both left the series in season 2 and 1, not that I accuse it. But the horror of horror comes in, Lola, who has been Natalie Wood's biggest actress, with green feathers in her hair and fake tan. She's even more rude than Zoey herself, if that's even possible, and even more stupid than Nicole and the hell, we know that this can not be possible. <br /> <br /> This show, like all the sad apologies for television programs Nickelodeon has been on the market since the 2000s and is a major victim of stereotyping. Get a girl next door and the feelings of her best friend for Zoey, a great, if unspoken best friend, Chase, a cool, arrogant lady-man, Logan, a crazy girl who's not very smart, Nicole the one everyone Strange, just because she's extremely smart, the nerd, Quinn, the overdramatic, annoying, but super thin, Malibu, a perfect model, Lola, and the tough but soft woman, Dana. Where have I heard these characters before? I'm sorry, but what's wrong with having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionately interested in science and actually cares about her future and is doing well in the academic aspect, where the rest should also take care of it, is she "weird" and a "nerd"? Lola at the beginning of the series proved to be a potentially great character with her cheeky behaviors and different attitudes in life. Zoey just had to go, take out your pitchforks and burn them at the stake. She returns to Weird Town and all this jazz So much for women's rights. Unfortunately, Lola did not hear anything from another OC clone in all its anorexic splendor. Probably not to outshine her mistress. <br /> <br /> But hey, the 2000 generation of MySpace whores seem to love it, with the Chase / Zoey signature fairytale romance, the tension between Adamant, "hot" Logan, and "kick-ass" Zoey or Dana, depending on your taste and the pretty people. Please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a presumptuous, flat and gloomy lifestyle. I'm sorry to break it, darling, it will not happen, unless you have a large trust fund and parents to cushion you.
