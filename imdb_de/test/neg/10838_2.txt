This was by far one of the worst films in which Sandra Bullock played. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue to write scripts. This is definitely not his strength and actors. I actually spent 54 minutes in this movie, until I got so bored that I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a bore from the beginning to a good 54 minutes anyway. The premise "Guess what happened to me on the way to ..." was repeatedly made to death. It just does not seem like it's funny or romantic when people cheat on each other. Parents should be aware that this may not be an appropriate movie for your teenage children, especially for those who consider Sandra a hero. There is a scene where the authors / producers / directors thought it would be nice to show how "acceptable" it is to smoke a joint ... while driving .... and then have no consequences if they do getting caught. I'm not proud and I smoked my share when I was younger, but I guarantee I will not take my teens to see it, and they are solid A & B students. If you want to see a good Sandra Bullock movie, hire "The Net" or "Hope Floats", which I believe are two of her best works.
