A bad movie, but with a role worth enjoying. The jokes are bad for most of the movie, the songs are bad, even the UK. Fields is bad. Then there's a sequence with Bob Hope and his movie ex. The dialogue is funny and the song (a version of Thanks for the Memories) is light, cynical and adorable. Who noticed this case? Nevertheless, the whole thing worth the original 25 cent revenue.
