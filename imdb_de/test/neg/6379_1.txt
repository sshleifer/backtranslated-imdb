I've tried to see this show on different occasions, and each time I found it totally dull of humor. <br /> <br /> The only reason to mention one thing is that it only matters to ridicule what Republicans have. In short, these are essentially democratic party-political opinions that are touted as humor. <br /> <br /> All that Mr. Stewart does is Wisecrack over everything the Republicans have done, and the audience is acting in violent laughter. My guess is that the left has no real substance, so they to define oneself how much they hate all republicans. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _____________________________ <br /> <br /> My belief: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
