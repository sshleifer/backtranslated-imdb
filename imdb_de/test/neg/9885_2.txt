The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan played Dick Rafe and melted me. Rafe and all his splendor made the film worth the while, though I found it hard to get up and scream. I have never seen a hotter man. <br /> <br /> -but- But that's not the point. <br /> <br /> The title? That's it. They took the beautiful story of Annette Curtis Klause and threw it out. In all my anal-restrained fame, I'll point out what's missing, what's changed and everything else wrong with the movie. <br /> <br /> Sit tight and here is: <br /> <br /> Apparently, RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently, ULF is no longer the child of ASTRID, as in the book. AND, as I remember the book, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS. <br /> - ASTRID seems to be BLOND, unlike the remarkable RED HAIRS described in the book. I think the book said that she looked more like a FOX than a WOLF. And the movie also shows that ASTRID is VIVIAN's aunt. <br /> <br /> - WAS AXEL GO? <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN is 19. In the book she was 16. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN meet IN HIGH SCHOOL, both of whom visit the book. VIVIAN visits AIDEN for his poem 'Wolf Change'. According to the film, AIDEN beat his father, fled and now lives in Romania and draws graphic novels. That made me go "What the F ** K". <br /> <br /> -There is no "Kelly" in the movie. WHERE THE KELLY WAS IN THE FILM. However, the KELLY in the book hated VIVIAN. And she had also met with AIDEN after they split up. Vivian is even drunk in the book and thrown her room away. <br /> <br /> -GABRIEL has a striking resemblance to a Colombian drug Lord in the movie. And he kind of sounds too. His acting was very good, but his appearance dropped me off. <br /> <br /> Vivian had NO parents in the movie. Her father and mother as well as two siblings died in the film. But in the book, when she comes home one evening, her MOTHER ESME is sitting on the couch after battling with ASTRID for GABRIEL. And VIVIAN has no siblings. Only her father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN accepts VIVAN for what it is. That REALLY got me. He kills RAFE in the spooky church, confronts VIVIAN and she saves him from the other wolves, unless AIDEN shoots them, so they go for a walk to look for medicine, and then they try to leave the city together. WTF?! In the book, AIDEN flips out as she transforms into a wolf and cries like a chick, throwing her at her with a pitch and she panics and jumps out of the window. Then he invents a story he wanted to separate with her and she threw a chair out the window. That sounds unacceptable to me. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN wants her to flee with him. In the book he does not want to have anything to do with VIVAN after she has chosen him. He also does not lovingly hold her face and says she can control it. He cries like a woman because he is afraid of her. <br /> <br /> And the last outrage ... the one that almost brought my three best friends and I HEARTENCE IN OUR SEATS: <br /> <br /> - In the film, AIDEN and VIVIAN are running away from it and VIVAN has killed GABRIEL. As she shoots him. GABRIEL dies. Not only does VIVIAN not kill GABRIEL in the * BOOK *, I also believe that they end each other. Since she does not land at AIDEN, she lands at GABRIEL. WHAT THE HELL. <br /> <br /> Even small things were noticed: Ulf's red hair, which he gets from Astrid, has turned brown in the movie, and Vivian works in a chocolate shop. <br /> <br /> A terrible shock; I am ashamed. The book really was not hard to follow. If Disney is a random H! School can use, why the director does not have random H! Found a school? <br /> <br /> * sigh * I was really looking forward to this movie, I loved the book, it's sad that it did not follow him a bit. I give him a 2 just because Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was absolutely sexy and Agnes Bruckner did a great job. AND, they kept the poem from Steppenwolf <br /> <br /> with love, Caitlin
