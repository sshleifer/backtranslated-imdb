Mel Welles, you may remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors. He directs this somewhat interesting, but completely twisted story of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter, who, after his death, carries on her father's work and creates a creature that is unfit for her intellectual ability or anything else, his likelihood of being good, but more of his sex appeal. Tania Frankenstein, though herself a doctor and scientist, is actually only interested in satisfying her original wishes for the stable boy and making her a super sex slave by not loving his body with the excellent brain of a man. The story here is web-like and you get what you'd expect: lots of mocking and suggestive comments (surprisingly most of the female lead role), special effects that are not so special, actors who lack the characteristic, and not really much action or Tension. And although this film is almost barren in terms of storytelling, Lady Frankenstein has weird aspects that make him stand out - not highly observable, but still observable. The Italian actress Rosalba Neri Alias ​​Sara Bay / Bey plays the baron's daughter with some sovereignty and a lot of sex appeal. It leaves desire and seduction pretty good. Her appearance is pretty one-dimensional, but she's pretty pretty and plays a bit over exaggerated. She is also very open with her performance when you notice my drift. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated for European horror movies for money, plays the father in a short but competent performance. He is the main attraction, but before the movie really got going. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is Dr. Charles Marshall, Baron's assistant and daughter's devotee, was reasonably effective for some time. As crime and missing persons unfold in the village, the policeman (I did not buy that) starts Micky Hargitay pumping Tania for answers - in spite of what you may not be pleased with. Where the movie really loses credibility lies in the last third of the movie, where the suspicious script, the weak performances, and the lackluster direction are all heading south. The creature is revealed and looks pretty ridiculous. The film ends a bit abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions of the 1970s. While not nearly as bad and disgusting as some would think, Lady Frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with perverted, if intriguing, overtones.
