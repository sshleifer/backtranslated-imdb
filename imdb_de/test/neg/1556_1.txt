This movie stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly evaluate this turkey. The acting is either made of wood or over the top; the film was apparently NOT written by anyone; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. Even as a movie driven solely by the monster scenes, these shots were so disappointing they did not arouse sympathy for the rest of the movie. I want to get back the 80 minutes of my life that this movie has stolen.
