Zurlini's film, despite its ambitious ambitions, must be seen as a failure. It's one thing to create a world that makes the viewer feel the boredom and fear that the protagonist has experienced (which I think is what Zurlini tried). It's another thing to make a movie that's boring and meaningless episodic. Despite beautiful cinematography in a haunting location - and a wonderful score - the film never lures the audience. Too much is unintentionally funny (the fake sound of dripping water in Drago's quarters, for example, or the silent movie being stolen by some actors), or just confusing (why exactly does Drago want to leave the fort for the first time?) So the movie can be considered as coherent work succeeds.
