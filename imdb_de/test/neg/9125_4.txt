As with many sequels, this album does not have the quality or effect of the original. The first belongs to the best with the other sizes. This just does not cut it off. The first movie had a magical "good" feeling that is completely missing in this movie. We've fallen in love with all these characters (minus Richard Dreyfuss) in a time of innocence. Well, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are largely different people. While this happens in real life, we do not expect this to happen to our favorite movie characters! The movie does not have the humor the original had and we expected to laugh. What kind of humor there is, is dark. The first movie also showed probably the greatest soundtrack of all time, while this movie is good but does not even come close to the original. This movie is so different from the original that it is not even a sequel. I gave it a 4.
