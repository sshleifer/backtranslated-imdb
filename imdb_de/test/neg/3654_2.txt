This movie feels like a college project that wants to make a blair project meets saw theme. But it is not successful. Cinematography is bad and acting all the more. The characters are not believable in my opinion. The editing of the film does not work as intended. There are many bad effects that I believe are used there to try to add a terrible effect. But for me there is only a sense of indifference. <br /> <br /> I would stay away from this movie unless you are a dedicated movie freak who likes to see "other" and Indian "horror" movies. However, I think that this movie is not worth watching for the average person. You will not be pleased with the bad effects and the mobile phone feeling that this movie gives to its viewers.
