Just a few nights ago I saw Caribe at the annual Vistas Film Festival in Dallas, and I have to express my dissatisfaction. The opening title shows us that the film is the current invasion of South American countries (in this case Costa Rica) by North American oil companies and the negative impact of this invasion both economically and environmentally. The main characters are a married couple who lead a simple, enjoyable life and maintain a banana farm. Immediately a woman arrives and announces that she is the half-sister of the woman. I will not go into more detail (and to be honest, I do not feel like I would spoil anything with this review). Another important point is that the company to which they distribute their bananas drops their value because of their household needs in a poor economy. The main conflict to be addressed in the film is the husband between the rock and the hard place trying to make a living. On the one hand, the oil company Reynolds essentially offered him employment and financial compensation (essentially a bribe) to encourage the public to encourage the city to allow the company to start drilling themselves in their city). On the other hand, he faces death, but on the side of his community to protest against the drilling. Given the length of this film, there would have been plenty of time to explore the issues just described, but it just does not happen, and I'll tell you why. You will find that this film has won several awards so far, one for directing and one audience award. I will not take Esteban's direction apart, it was neither bad nor good enough to be so passionate about writing. The Audience Award was at a film festival in Spain, and to win an audience award, I would have to imagine that the Spaniards dig only soap operas. Indeed, Central and South America are also digging soap operas, I know that. I'm assuming that Esteban either wanted to exploit this or that he was digging soap operas himself, because that's what has developed so far in the course of this film that he almost throws the whole oil company plot aside as if they were filming The film thought the film had become tiring because at least three of the supporting characters greatly restricted their background story and story making room for more sex and crying scenes. The only true villain in the movie is one of those three characters, and at no point can you find out who the hell he is. It's almost as if they're going to make his screen time as short as possible to get him out of the movie completely. From time to time they play with the oil against the conspiracy of the community, but these are at best digressions. What we see much more are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes make history so strong that the oil company's subplot becomes unnecessary. It's almost a trick to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) with some political relevance. Even so, the movie gets so caught up in romance that it does not know what to do with itself, which leads to an end where you wonder what you've been waiting for, if there's anything to do with it. Two things that I think could have saved this movie: either turn off the half-sister or the oil company. It is obvious who she was more interested in. Or if Caribe had been an hour longer, they could have solved it all. Regardless, I would have been fine with a straightforward soap opera, and I think that the issue of oil companies exploiting foreign nations urgently needs to be addressed by the film community. Caribe is both and not both. These two angles could have worked together if they were balanced accordingly. However, since a romantic act runs in a circle and takes almost twice as much time as at the expense of an oil plot, which was initially barely fixed, both sides suffer. The best part is that the love story is never solved. I'd like to say that I would watch this movie again to see what I've missed, but I have the strong feeling that I already know what it is. For me, it would not matter if I saw Caribe ten more times. I missed it because it just is not there.
