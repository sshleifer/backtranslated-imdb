Well, send me aside. I have not seen such a bad home movie since the terrible 13 SECONDS or HALF CASTE. Someone should take away the Sony Handycam of this guy! This film proves that only if you can make a movie for $ 20 on your camcorder, this does not necessarily mean. <br /> <br /> I remember one of the things Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book "Rebel" Without Crew "was that when you wanted to create a no-budget feature, you had all the assets Rodriguez says that you should take stock of all the locations and props that you can beg, steal, and borrow from your friends, Robert Rodriquez was friends with the mayor of a city in Mexico, so the Mayor let him shoot for free everywhere. What you got in EL MARIACHI was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budget. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the director of this movie He used to have a copy of this book, and he took that to heart, in which case he seemed to be friends with a man who owned a cornfield, where they planted a ghost house every year, and it seems a pretty good place for a scary one It's hard to keep a corn field interesting for 90 minutes. No single installment of the CHILDREN OF THE CORN series spent more than a few minutes in the corn field. Hitchcock spent only about ten minutes in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Take a hint, man ... Cornfields are not suitable for fascinating cinemas. It would have been good if the director had more friends with more locations because the thing gets pretty boring after the first 15 minutes. This movie looks like it costs about $ 30. (or whatever it cost to enter the cornfield labyrinth). <br /> <br /> Apparently he could not even find someone to play in his movie, so he throws himself off. Big mistake. Here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, get yourself an actor. As for wealth, it seems as if the cornfield maze is the only thing the poor guy had. Maybe he thought that was enough. In fact, I'm going to bounce up and say that I know that's enough, because the movie, before it achieved the coveted honor of being the sequel to DARK HARVEST, was simply called THE MAIZE: THE MOVIE. Maybe he's already planning THE MAIZE: THE MUSICAL or even THE MAIZE: THE MINI-SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our all-rounders (and yes, the Master of Nothing part of this statement is definitely (here fitting) plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen Dead Zone, but not nearly as good as an actor like Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall, Psychic Dad has a premonition that his two daughters, who are in the Maize Maze with Mom, will be killed, storming to save them. From then on, the entire movie is spent watching Pyschic Dad walking around in a cornfield looking for his two daughters, finding the two little ghosts of THE SHINING and helping solve the mystery of their murder. <br /> <br /> Recorded on a 200-phone camera, the director has thrown himself in. Edited on iMovie Improvised story, if that's not enough to keep you from this disgusting, crazy catastrophe, consider Do this as a last warning ... The WHOLE FILM takes place in a cornfield, in boils and ghouls. Here's Ghoulie Guru's tip on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie. The next time you see a corn field, stop the car. Take a flashlight and run around for about 90 minutes.
