Okay, I can sit down in almost any movie and tend to give Sci Fi Originals a real kick, but there was a big mistake in this movie that made me turn it off for half an hour. <Br /> <br /> After serving in the US Army, there are expectations for a movie, including the military. At least some attention to the right military rank, uniform and terminology is required if you expect a viewer to actually enjoy the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" had characters looking the wrong way on the lapel, and later in the movie the time was given as 11:00, but it was dark outside. Even though the screenplay was done perfectly and the dialogue is spectacular and the acting Oscar-worthy, if the people making the film do not care enough about the movie to even look for the right way to display military time, why should it be so somebody bother to try to see it?
