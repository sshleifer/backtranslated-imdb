Jessica is a young, virginal and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. Jessica is also a strong clairvoyant capable of insanity, retro-knowledge, foreknowledge and especially. When the young and handsome Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit, he is immediately skeptical of Jessica's abilities ... until her skills uncover a lost wristwatch and release an ancient treasure chest. In the treasure chest, however, is the severed head of a centuries-old dead Satanist named Gideon Drew, whose powers are far stronger than those of Jessica. Despite her warnings about the evil in her midst, Drew manages to make eye contact with anyone unhappy with him. But Drew wants Jessica in particular. He needs her ability to find his body so that he can rise from the dead and rule over humanity. Will Jessica's powerful lily in combination with Gordon's love fend off the ancient evil before it can destroy them all? <br /> <br /> This is not a very interesting movie. That could have certainly happened - the basic story is interesting and inventive, but acting is lead-free and the whole thing moves too slowly to hold the interest. Jessica is also too innocent - almost annoying, and Gordon, her love interest, is made of wood, stiff and completely emotionless. None of the characters are very personable and the low budget is painfully obvious. A rushed end does not help. Avoid, unless it is the MST3K version.
