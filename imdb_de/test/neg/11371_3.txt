Although not as bad as some movies (like the terrible "Atomic Twister"), "Meltdown" still relies on common misconceptions and inaccuracies of the nuclear industry to drive their conspiracy. I'm currently studying nuclear engineering in pursuit of a masters degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry. In an American work, the film could be that any collapse (according to one the guest commentators of the film only partially) would mean a catastrophe for the region. In fact, a partial collapse in an American factory while the core is being destroyed would pose no threat to the environment. Three Mile Island experienced a partial collapse, and thanks to the natural stability of the fuel used in the country and the core construction, which was associated with significant containment, no radioactive material was released into the environment at all. <br /> <br /> The security steps shown in the film may have been the part of the film furthest from the truth. At any key strategic location-be it a power plant, a chemical plant, a military base, or anything-you'll never see the staff respond to an alarm by lurking around as if it were an unannounced exercise. This is especially true of a nuclear power plant, where the reactors would immediately SCRAM when the alarm was triggered and shut them down. SCRAMing can be done at the push of a button in the control room (you do not need to put the core in "shutdown mode" as shown in the movie), and the nuclear fission chemistry prevents a core from being rebuilt after about 9 hours of performance sCRAM. If this scenario were to succeed in real life, the attackers could not cause a significant collapse. Theoretically, because of the residual heat, they could still cause a partial release if they immediately exposed the nucleus. However, this would be almost impossible given the many backup systems available in a plant - there is much more to it than just the backup pumps they talk about in the movie. <br /> <br /> For the spent fuel pools, it may be possible to blast the pools into a dirty bomb. However, this is much more difficult than simply parking a truck with explosives near the pools. The fuel is under (approximately) 18 feet of purified water. The water can not become radioactive (no radioactive vapor spoken of in the film). Particles dissolved in water can not, but the water itself; So the reason for a very thorough cleaning. The only way to make a dirty bomb a fuel tank is to get the fuel out of the water. This is not an easy task as water is very heavy and the basins with very thick concrete walls are underground. The explosives should be in the pool below the fuel (which is securely attached). And there should be a lot of explosives, because water can be very difficult to move by an explosion. Even if this were the case, the spent fuel is not extremely radioactive, and the explosion would not require nearly as many fatalities as mentioned in the film, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would spread. <br /> <br /> From the film's point of view, I got a little tired of the style used. The constant fading in and out, the use of rough black and white and the quick finding and moving looked amateurish. The characters were one-dimensional, especially in the US government. I have some issues with the twist in the movie but I will not talk about it as it would be a big spoiler. <br /> <br /> A total of 3/10
