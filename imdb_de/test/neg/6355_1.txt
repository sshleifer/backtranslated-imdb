Following the Matrix, this travesty of a film with loose connections to VR with the slogan "The Matrix has Deadler!" Released in a box with a Matrix-inspired cover (still called "Expect to Die"). even though). Due to the choice of font, the tagline around the world looks like "Beablier". Anyway. <br /> <br /> To complete the transformation to Matrix wannabes, they mocked a VR combat scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character DOES NOT WORK IN THE FILM. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a travesty on every level. Jalal Mehri is a terrible actor and does not impress with his martial arts. However, his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who is simply the worst actor I've ever seen in this movie. Obviously, he was chosen to make Jalal look good by comparison. The worst movie I have seen in a long time.
