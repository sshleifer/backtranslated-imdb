The only good thing about Persepolis are the shadows created in the animation style of German Expressionism and a touch of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman who is dissatisfied with her culture, who tries everything else and then returns to her roots. Here she finds great dissatisfaction again and sets off on her own to now rid herself of all the others in her country of the situation and what they will do if she is not there to support her. It comes to no conclusion and leaves us the feeling that this woman has no loyalty. Mind you, it is torn between cultures and does not have enough background, it seems to know what is important and real. She listens to so many voices and will most likely become a global citizen unconnected to her Iranian culture. The only thing I got from this movie was fear.
