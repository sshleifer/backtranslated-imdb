Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and buddy Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are wanderers who seemingly can not stay long in one place. In "Helltown", the boys drive to Montana, where they meet with Rudd's cousin Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It's a shout to see the boys wearing aprons as they begin cooking with the herd, though Dare becomes self-conscious when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) rides into the camp. Judy is Tom's girl, but the attraction between her and Dare is evident early on. <br /> <br /> Fillmore has a herd of cattle to move and encourages Dare to drive the drive, partly to prove to Judy that he can not. Be up to the task. In the meantime, villain Bart Hammond (Monte Blue) has eyes on Fillmore's livestock, but when his followers do not rush the flock, he thinks it's easier to win the money Dare paid at the end of the way. When Dare makes a rigged card game with his husband Brady (James Craig), Dare's money begins to evaporate hand by hand. Only when Dare does not show up at Fillmore's ranch does Tom go to see his cousin. Revealing the cheats, Tom, Dare and Dink High Tail, before the bad guys can take their revenge. <br /> <br /> "Helltown," also known as "Born to the West," was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a few years after Wayne's Western series for Lone Star Productions. It only slightly changes the Lone Star formula; Wayne gets the girl at the end of the movie, but here he tried. There's a great runaway horse scene where Wayne Marsha rescues Hunt, where Johnny Mack Brown's horse does a somersault. Syd Saylor does a great job as a comic book friend doing his best to sell lightning to unsuspecting victims. He replaces the familiar faces of George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, staples of the Lone Star movies. John Wayne's charisma begins to evolve and prepares him for the leap to superstar status he has finally achieved. <br /> <br /> "Helltown" is based on a novel by legendary western author Zane Gray. If you're looking for more films based on Gray's stories, try Fighting Caravans with Gary Cooper, The Light of Western Stars with Victor Jory, Drift Fence with Buster Crabbe, and Heritage of the Desert with Randolph Scott
