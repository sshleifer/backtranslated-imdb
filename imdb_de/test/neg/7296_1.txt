I saw this film with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the Mediterranean. <br /> <br /> When the tape was recorded, me and my friend were tied to a wooden stake at the end of this cavernous area. I told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened, so as not to open her. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and after a few seconds began to scream. The faces of the Nazis melted, and the archaeologist's head exploded. After a few seconds, the videotape dropped out of the VCR and landed back in its box, and the lid snapped shut. Me and my girlfriend were unhurt. <br /> <br /> Based on this experience, the video cassette was placed in a wooden box and stored in a huge warehouse of identical wooden boxes that you would never see again.
