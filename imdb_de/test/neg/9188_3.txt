After Sept. 11 in New York, this drama about American firefighters was designed to recognize and recognize their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks after which firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) fell through the floor of a burning building and communicated only by radio with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta). Essentially, the flashbacks show Jack as a fire-fighter legend of a recruiter who sees Kennedy as a father figure. Of course, Jack's firefighters are trying to reach him these days, but they are too late, and in the end he lets them leave him and forwards them to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they knew. With Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Robert Patrick of Terminator 2 as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. After all, all I can do is watch the movie's fire and enjoy it when the characters attack it, the rest is a bit too talkative for my liking. Appropriate!
