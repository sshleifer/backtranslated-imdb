That's the only word I can think of to describe this movie. Not wasting time wasting (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but wasting like wasting opportunities. When I watch this movie, I think of all the Star Trek novels that were written that would have made a much better movie than the story Shatner had chosen. The setup was like an average television episode, while the finish feels like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie. <br /> <br /> Nimoy focused on the character of Spock in Director II-IV - how he faced the Kobayashi Maru outside the classroom and how he dealt with his emotional life after he had the chance to freshen up to begin. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he did not. We do not know much about Kirk, which we did not know before. Once again, one of the novels would have been better - try "My Enemy, My Ally" for a very interesting character study of our friend James T. from the left field, especially as the subtext in the original series was Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even hardcore fans can not find much here. Sorry, but it's true.
