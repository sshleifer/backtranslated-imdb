Horror movies are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to stumble upon a formula that works very well, sometimes they try to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems, sometimes they are so bad that they are somehow fun .. and sometimes they are "The Cavern". <br /> <br /> A good horror / suspense movie should contain inconsistencies that make you puzzle. They should allow you to become interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually do a kind of reaction when they die. Instead, The Cavern chooses elements that initially work and are negated only by their own weak storytelling. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely forgotten and any other background story that makes any of them even a long-distance monologue is blasted out within a 30-second monologue, which makes it impossible to do more than laugh, since the Characters are picked up almost randomly and on the least frightening way on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> (To spoil a scene a victim is taken during a complete blackout, which could be a little scary if the sound effect that suggests his killing is not going to be a pot too Add that formula The camera that works makes me think the director has seen too many videos of Nine Inch Nails and an end that has almost no purpose in an attempt to be shocking as you annoy and confuse the viewer, and you have an almost unsurpassed horror movie that fails at every level. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest with you if you have a claustrophobic speleologist horror movie "The Descent, "and I find it weird to say that because I do not particularly like this movie too.
