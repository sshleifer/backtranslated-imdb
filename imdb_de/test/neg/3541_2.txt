Do you think you have seen the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising. The cover makes it look like a good, scary horror suspense thriller. But no. What we have instead is NIGHTSCREAM. A movie that is a "sweeeoooowww !!" Each time a credit flashes across the screen, a sound is heard. The biggest name in the movie is probably Casper Van Dien, who plays almost no role. <br /> <br /> I only chose one for this one because I could not choose a lower one. If I could choose something negative, trust me, I would have done it. At the moment I will give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * of 5 just because it ended.
