Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis - and this vision is so full of claustrophobic attitudes, crazy costumes, and loud, "quirky" little characters as possible (unfortunately it takes about 80 minutes). The "Alice in Wonderland" -like story is meandering and uninteresting, and there was probably no actress in the world who could make a good movie out of it, even though Kathy Ireland made an appealing (annoying) attempt.
