The film by Peter Yates, written by Steve Tesich, is a relatively modest "thriller" that can not really get you started. The story is about the mysterious murder of an influential Asian businessman and the subsequent involvement of a wretched Vietnam veteran (James Woods) who, according to the police, might take revenge on his former employer. As an "eyewitness," William Hurt never believes that his friend is capable of such an act. Hurt is far below his usual strength and it is hard to sympathize with him or an uninspired Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer are a bit better in their support roles. Noteworthy is the appearance of Morgan Freeman as Detective Black. <br/> <br/> In retrospect, Steve Tesich's story is just an unlikely romance disguised as a mystery movie. The plot is too much. <br /> <br /> Friday, October 17, 1997 - Video
