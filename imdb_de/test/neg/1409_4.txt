I was aware of the critical pans of Man of the Year and the inconspicuous Grob, but I was ready to give the film the benefit of the doubt because I know that good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded release schedule of the fall months. <br /> <br /> I found out that the movie is surprisingly unimaginative. Surprising is an understatement considering Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and Robin Williams' obvious comic gifts. In fact, Robin Williams is mysteriously unused. On the "Making Of" feature included with the DVD, Barry Levinson talked about how he sometimes made Robin Williams improvise from the script as if it were a bad secret. Are you really such an idiot, Barry Levinson? Whenever you have Robin Williams in your movie and you want to use him for his comic skills (basically any movie he's not in Insomnia or One Hour Photo), you should not put him in a script. Let him free what he wants, because he's the funnier than anything anyone else can write for him, and his uncontrolled comic heroes can raise the bar for any mediocre movie like RV or Patch Adams. Even more confusing, I found the fact that Levinson had used this exact formula to perfection in 1987 in Good Morning Vietnam by injecting Robin Williams' weird disunity into a war picture to create a resounding political image. <br /> <br /> So the movie is not as laughable as it could be and feels awkward in its tone. If the movie had the potential to function as anything, he might have made one of those 90s thrillers in the style of The Pelican Brief, The Fugitive, or one of those Jack Ryan movies. The story revolved around an employee in a Silicon Valley company who discovered a glitch in a system that states that the country chose the wrong president and the CEOs' efforts to eliminate them before the mystery comes out. So if you replaced Robin Williams with Harrison-type actor, or maybe even Harrison Ford himself, added a few more explosions, and maybe the movie was going to go here. I'll never really know and it's not worth it to find out.
