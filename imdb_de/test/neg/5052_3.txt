You know, I'm really tired of all the generic music used in such movies (see Jawbreaker, Disturbing Behavior, etc.). Any scene of real tension here (and there are those) is immediately undercut with a cheesy pop melody, completely reducing the tension. Why are you doing that? To sell some soundtracks, but in this case, mission unfinished - did anyone buy the CD? <br /> <br /> And yes, Ms. Mirren takes on her role with enthusiasm (with some jokes) kicking in). But what are Molly, Leslie and Vivica doing here? Their roles (they are so little used that I can not use "characters" here) have no purpose in the plot, so I can not figure out why three well-known actresses were cast. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the end is so incredibly hackneyed and irresponsible. The kids get away with it and pretend that nothing has happened - everything smiles when they graduate. They are criminals, people! No consequences for their actions (kidnapping, assault, manipulation of the grade) - nothing. <br /> <br /> Little things - was Tingle's story about her husband true? What about the crossbow? Would the virgin Katie figure lose her temper? (Big message, guys.) Why did McKean go to her house? How did Kate's academic archenemy come through the door right now? How do the students get the home addresses of teachers? WHAT IS WITH JEFFREY TAMBOR ?? On what basis did McKean fire Tingle? It's bloodied, smashed and taken hostage by students, but for the sake of Crips! Oh, I think the script is much more thoughtful than Mr. Williamson, so I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 3/10
