Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to her father Chris (George F Marion) after 15 years. He is the skipper of a boat and she stays to travel with him. During this time she meets Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fall in love. Matt and Chris are not on par and Anna has a secret to confess ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story .. .... it starts badly with George F. Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunkard in a bar. The scene goes on forever and they are both terrible. It's also hard to understand. In fact, it is difficult to understand the whole cast. I have missed entire sections of the dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it is incomprehensible! Garbo is obviously special because she is attracted to her every time she appears on the screen, and her presence gives this film the 4 stars I gave him. But nothing really happens - it's a boring story with gruesome accents. They do well to stay awake.
