Where do I start, it's one of the most frustrating movies I've ever seen, because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point, but it's really very stupid. A movie about a ghost-inhabited bed? The first 2 minutes of the film feature a black and white flashback of a strange-looking fat guy dominating a Fabienne by Pulp Fiction Lookalike contest winner and strangling her with his tie. This is to determine how the bed goes down in the story. However, if you want an opening to interest people or send them away early, strangulation is the way to go. To this day, a couple moves into a flat with a friendly landlord and starts unpacking his things, as far as everything is normal. One night, as they do the Hippie Dippity on a single mattress, they realize that they need a bed frame. Things are getting fishy here, why did not they bring or buy a damn bed frame before they get there? We learn that the door that leads to the loft where the first 2 minutes took place does not open. Once the couple realizes that they need a bed frame, the door magically opens. They go to the attic, discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it down, and their love days are saved ... at least they thought. The rest of the movie revolves around the two being tracked by the bed frame. The female is an artist, so she begins to design the creepy images she dreams about, and the male is a photographer, so he begins to make his models feel like they're being tortured or tied up (one of them has gray hair and appears above) 50 years old (yuck) The woman is increasingly frightened, and she discovers that the house she lives in was once a sanctuary for serial killings and murders that put an end to the film. They find the friendly landlord murdered (which makes no sense, as ghosts must take on a human form to kill) and decide to clear hell out of the way. While packing up, the husband goes to the attic where he's obsessed with the crazy fat guy and the woman throws in his skull before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills a guy trying to meet her. <br /> <br /> If you've read this far, you have to think of one thing ... why did not hell just throw it out the window ???? Seriously, they never said anything about the actual house in which it was, just the bed. So why not get rid of that damn thing and move on? That's why the movie is so frustrating because it is actually a good plot and the actors follow suit, but there are more holes than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth. The couple has been trying to leave the city, as in any other movie that gives the old "Oh, let's give this place a chance, sweetheart". Still, my buddy and I saw the movie every 5 minutes ... Why did not they just throw the bed away? Especially when they learned it was a haunt, it would have been a good time to set it on fire or something. All in all, it's an almost observable movie with lots of porn-like bed scenes and a credible plot (to some degree), but the solution is so simple that you scratch your head at the end of the movie and wonder how stupid the couple can be? The highlight of the film is when the husband orders the 50-year-old model to spread her legs, and his assistant tells him he can not shoot her like this. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (a small budget) Porn The Man Show would love)
