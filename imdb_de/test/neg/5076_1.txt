The movie "Chaos" takes its name from Gleick's pop-scientific explanation of the Chaos Theory of 1988. What does the book or anything related to the book's content have to do with the plot of the movie "Chaos"? Nothing. The filmmakers seem to have skimmed the book (apparently without understanding it) and searched for a "theme" to unite the series of secular action sequences that lie beyond the flimsy consequences of events that act in the movie instead of an action , In this regard, the movie "Choas" resembles the Canadian effort "Cube," in which primes serve as a means of confusing the audience, so the plot's ridiculousness is not noticed: in "Cube," a series of primes are thrown into it that viewers attribute their lack of understanding to a lack of knowledge of primes: Chaos pursues the same approach: separate excerpts from Gleick's books are thrown into it, making evil behaviors appear diabolically clever in the film. This, of course, is an insultingly patronizing treatment of the audience, and any educated viewer of "chaos" who can survive the entire movie gets confused. How could a movie be made so bad? Written as a novel, the story in "Chaos" would probably not even pass the desk of a literary agent. How could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars be thrown away, which can only be a waste of time for all except those who have taken money home? In terms of what is in the movie, every performance is called. Apart from technical glitches, it would be amazing if more than one take was used for a scene. The story is completely pointless: the last time I saw a story that broke the connection, it was the production of a literal eight-year-old. Among the massive deficiencies include: The villain leaves evidence for the police. He has no reason at all to leave such hints. Police officers do not carry or use radios. Dupes of evil have no reason to behave in common with evil. Let me strongly recommend that nobody looks at this movie. If there is another movie you like (or just do not hate), watch this movie instead.
