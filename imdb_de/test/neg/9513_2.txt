This is by far the worst version of William Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece I've ever seen. It seems the filmmakers did not read Shakespeare's lyrics. No, they only took what they wanted from the Lawerence Olivier movie. The plot is not all right and limited to the bare necessities, but it's time for the non-canon Olivier created between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have lazy the "Something in Denmark" instead? Casting is another topic. I understand that the far superior Branagh movie had its weak spots (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston), but it has very few good moments. I like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is stale. Mel Gibson's creepy stubble is irritating and you're often wondering if he has any idea what he's saying. Many of the actors seem to have memorized the part only - they are less aware of what is said than in the secondary school Olivier To be honest, even Disney's Hamlet is better.
