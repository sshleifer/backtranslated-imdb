When Hollywood tries to understand what a "smart person" is, they fail miserably and find it hard to give words to the alleged "genius." <br /> <br /> Right, every genius walks around trying to rub his superiority in any case. Sure, they hang out in bars and choose fights. It's not as if they are (generalized wild) autistic nerds who never have a tan. <br /> <br /> If you're a genius, you know everything about math and history and politics and of course you're always up to date with current events and a thorough analysis. Coz these things, how, all go together and stuff, you know? <br /> <br /> Plus, you go with a grin all the time. You're just a smug son of a you-know-what-so-it's you. <br /> <br /> And of course you smoke like someone who has never smoked before, but you smoke because it's such a cool stuff, you know? And you are different. That's understood. <br /> <br /> And of course you can fight? You are a tyrant. A tyrant who finds time to learn 10,000 books if he does not lift weights. And whenever he does not smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health plan. <br /> <br /> And you have a 30-year-old college student? Minnie Driver. Well, I will not even comment on Matt Damon. Team America has already hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> This movie is a daydream of a Beavis & Butthead student (95% in other words): "Yeah, that's how I would be if I was a genius." But stupid people and stupid writers can Do not imagine the life of geniuses.
