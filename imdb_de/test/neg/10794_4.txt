The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934. I bought it because I like desert adventures and on the pits it's a drama. That's certainly not it. <br /> <br /> It's a couple who goes to Egypt to capture some drug smugglers in the desert, a drama instead of a comedy that drops it off a lot. It's pretty stupid at times. Apart from that, there are some good action and location scenes. <br /> <br /> The cast is directed by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as a love interest. <br /> <br /> A visit is enough for this movie. Overall, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 stars.
