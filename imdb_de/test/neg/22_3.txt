When you make a movie with a killer kids premise, there are two effective ways to approach the movie. You can either make it as realistic as possible by creating credible characters and situations, or you can make it as funny as possible by making it laugh (something that the creators of "Silent Night, Deadly Night" for example on a CD made equally controversial topic: a murderer Santa). However, the people who did "Bloody Birthday" do not do any of these things. They simply rely on the shock of a child's image with a weapon (or knife, noose, or arrow) in their hands. The result is both offensive and stupid. The whole movie looks like a bad idea pushed through production (and then kept away from publishing for several years). It is a little bit redeemed by the kids, but it is very sloppy. (* 1/2)
