This does not apply to quality films. It's actually the first Chuck Norris movie I've seen and I was pretty repressed. The fight scenes are slow and not very varied. Norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks with all the bad guys coming after him, which makes the fighting pretty boring. The movie is also pretty short, but for some reason the movie does not even end up in the end. It's a pretty anti-climatic end. Still, I've seen a lot of bad movies, and that's not one of the worst I've ever seen. It's well worth a watch, I especially appreciate for Norris fans. There's nothing like a group of drills racing through the desert, which I think was the highlight of the movie.
