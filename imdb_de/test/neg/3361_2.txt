Hello, I am Derrick Cannon and I welcome you to the very first Cannonite Review Show. My movie for this week was controversial, which route for which movie, which excellent four-star epic I would choose. Deciding to move an eighty and choose the other route, I decided to critically review a movie that killed it, which could have been a very unique concept. The movie I'm going to discuss today is Jack Frost Two, the mutant killer snowman's revenge. Stars in the film include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney as Colonel and Scott MacDonald as Jacks Killer Frost. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series where we gave the hilarious Jack Frost (who loved the carrot scene), but it's even harder to believe that this is exactly the same cast. The movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was the purpose of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie? The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character who was total killer snowman food. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid than the original. His babble about frost protection was one of the most miserable depictions I had seen in a movie. His wife, however, was one of the few bright spots. She played her role as head woman with a handle. She was a reasonable voice in the movie of idiocy. The scene where she finds out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie. Ray MacDonald once again did a great job as Jack Frost, even though he was given to him. If there were not such weak characters, he could have been immortalized like Chucky, Freddy, and Jason. Laugh if you have to, but when it comes down to it, Jack had let Frost spit, he had humor, and most of all, he had an undoubtedly nasty kick. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much more than it could have been It was a sequel to a great franchise, instead all plans to make Jack Frost three were canceled. <br /> <br /> This movie gets two out of ten points for me, and it's lucky he even gets one.
