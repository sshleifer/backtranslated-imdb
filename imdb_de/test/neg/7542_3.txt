Apart from the fact that this movie was made (I think it seemed like a good idea at the time, considering that BOTTOM was so popular), the only thing that baffled me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO was that what happened to the lighting. There's absolutely no artificial lighting in this movie, and I've seen it on network TV, so there was no point in watching a dodgy tape. In fact, the movie was shot so darkly that you could not see what the hell was going on. But if the dialogue was anything, that might not be a bad thing
