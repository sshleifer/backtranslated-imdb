In a world full of movies - such as "You Got Served" - that hit you with their many mistakes in your head, you would never suspect that there are any worse movies ... until now. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" is more than just cheese. It knows that you are angry. First, there are no killers in this film. In fact, there is only one good fighter in the whole movie. Second, the place ... is basically a place: some Jackass house (or basement, it's up to you.). Third, the special effects (frankly) can kiss my ass. Fourth, the drama beats "Plan 9 from space" in the category with the worst impact ever. Ron Hall can not act to save his life. Finally (and definitely not the smallest problem): THE MACHINING. The person who edited this movie hopes better that I will never find it. The cuts and shots are incredible !!!! Other topics: lighting (almost none), the fact that the man on the cover is not even in the movie, and the fact that this movie exists. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie, let's just say I say that I tortured the DVD copy before I ran it back on Hollywood Video (do not worry, I used the MVP membership, so it was free!). NEVER SEE THIS FILM !!!!
