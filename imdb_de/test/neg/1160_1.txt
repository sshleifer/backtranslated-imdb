PLEASE people! DO NOT worry about this misguided joke. The direction was completely wrong from the start. Where is the story of his mother's emotional interference and the general insanity in the original family? Why is ED portrayed as this tall, overbearing, imposing figure, full of anger and hatred? What is that crap? The author and director obviously did not research the story and only wanted to make money with the infamous name Gein. The idiots who made this movie took so much liberty with the truth that it's ridiculous. If you want to see a brilliant Gein movie. Go back to the sub-classic "Deranged" to see how Ed really was. There's humor in this movie, and according to HISTORY, Ed is portrayed as the sadder, lonely, easy man he was. Where is the background story? There are simply badly set shocks (which are not shocking) that we have seen before, and that have achieved more. Take the worst Texas Chainsaw rip-off and add this list to this list. There had to be one in ten, because the rating would not accept NULL. I want my money back. If someone sees this movie as "mind-blowing," it may get a financial setback.
