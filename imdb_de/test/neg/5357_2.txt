What can you say after seeing this movie? That is, if you had interest and concentration to see it through to the end. I was speechless because of the amazingly boring story, annoying situations in which an American equals those of fifty or more Iraqis, and boring dialogue. I think if this movie has anything to teach then it probably goes like this: "Do not mess with us or we'll kick you in the butt". In addition, the film really encourages and agrees to kill masses of foreigners in the name of the war. I got the image to take chess pieces from the game board. Only now is it fast and there is not much to think about. And on top of that, no character has any spirit. How can you even take care of what's happening to them? Without war movie fans without taste, I would not recommend it to everyone. It should always be something interesting.
