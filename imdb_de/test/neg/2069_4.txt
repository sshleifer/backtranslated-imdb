For those who expect the cover and story to feature another entertaining Indian Bollywood production, be careful: there are no musical dance numbers or production-value songs that set the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the British Indian Brighten culture - with a few variations thrown. As written by Roopesh Parekh, the script jumps around discussion points to obscure them with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai leads the way as a traffic cop and tries to keep the different undergrounds together until the Keystone Cop tactic. Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a college student who is gay and has a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and they live with Jack's obesity, alcoholic, loose morals Aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes) and Sally's chubby daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton) , Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi, who brings their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) conclude that Simran is the girl for Jimi, who marries and arranges an engagement and wedding according to Native American customs - without contacting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along, a decision that makes Jack angry and makes Vanessa angry. Hannah tells Simran (that she is Jimi's daughter) a "little lie" and the wedding is over. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house, they discover the drunken Vanessa, are repulsed by her, but eventually they decide that for Jimi's happiness she will be accompanied by the fact that Vanessa has given them a "granddaughter," and the marriage arrangements as Wedding use for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces the very reserved Vanessa to follow the idea, and just before Vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and Jimi, who is afraid of what he's only doing to please his parents, closes Jack as his best man. The truth comes out at the wedding, and to Jimi's surprise, his family adapts to Jimi's true self and the day is saved just by being honest. <br /> <br /> The cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense pretty well and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, albeit without any kind of loving relationship (the director seems to be to show the slightest hint of intimacy between the two men). Sally Bankes as Vanessa caters for the most laughs; The rest of the cast repeats the stereotype roles they have played countless times in Indian films. This is not a bad movie - he has his moments - but he is just too shallow and too tired to care about any of the characters.
