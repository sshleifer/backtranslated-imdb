I did a review for this director's fictional recovery on BTK. I also saw this movie and it was awful. Please save money and time. This movie was awful and the director is untalented. I do not understand how he finances these films. They are awful. I've decided to make sure I check who the author, the director and the producer are. If the name of this director pops up, I will not waste my money. There's nothing worse than renting a movie on a Friday night, making popcorn, and then realizing you've been cheated on creative art on the front of the box. Stay away. I think I should come up with some stuff to fill in the lines? I have always reviewed IMDb for reviews, but I do not think anymore. That's ridiculous. I've been corrected way too often in my ratings. Not enough lines? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
