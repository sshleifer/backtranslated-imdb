Dear Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know in what capacity I write this letter to you. I'm never saying he's an Amitabh Bachchan fan who had gone nuts in Jaadugar. I also ask for some important passes at The Godfather Fan Club. I've seen the Coppola classic more often than you've delivered flops from your factory. And of course I was a great admirer of you when Nagarjuna had wrapped the bicycle chain around his ankles in Shiva. When you announced Sarkar and named him godfather All you wanted to know was the date your first look was published, the Sunday on which the promos aired, the Friday the movie was released. It was a pure wish fulfillment at work to know that you and not someone hovering between the mustard fields of Amritsar and the Tulip Gardens of Amsterdam have taken on the task of restoring the puzo pages on the big screen of Bollywood. </ Br> /> Your cast could not have been you anymore? to work for the first time with the legend of occupying Abhishek as his screen son, giving Kay Kay a role he has earned for years, bringing with him forgotten faces like Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar and choosing complete non-actors like Katrina and Tanishaa List?? Before July 1st, they had made Sarkar the most anticipated film by all the godfathers who worshiped Bachchan. The opening speech raised the hope that your stunning sepia-colored promos on TV had been lit. But now you have called Sarkar your tribute to the Godfather instead of the word "inspired" that you used all along. You probably do not want the two creations to be compared, but if the medium is the same, a Kaante with Reservoir Dogs and a Reservoir Dogs is compared to a city on fire. <br /> <br /> Even if your first and last sequences? the heart of a script treatment? It's about the establishment and transfer of power, you can not separate the Nagares and the Corleones, even if you replace the American mafia trains with Maharashtria's power play. <br /> <br /> But you got it wrong, Mr. Varma? They wanted to show Amitabh in his' 70s avatar how the pins of Salim-Javed made him rush. They wanted him to lurk beyond life. They wanted him to be his own brand (o). How could you then steal his voice to use silence? How could you keep him in his chair looking for interesting camera angles? How could he leave him without his voice and stature, the two things that made B so big? Coppola's godfather cameraman Gordon Willis masked Brando's eyes throughout the movie because he did not have the strength to match that drawing, hoarse voice or the sudden cracking of his fingers. However, you have tried to repeat the Malik Act of your own company. But Bachchan is not Ajay Devgan? His strength lies not in the stagnant view and in the suffocating silence. They made the man look like a comatose patient who from time to time was reminded to look at the cue cards and mouth the predictable one-liners. Agneepath is there every Saturday. <br /> <br /> Which Bachchan fan would watch Kay Kay Menon steal the thunder from the scene in which Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house? Which Amitabh aficionado would see him in a movie in which he talks about power with a big P in the promos? We can not handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement! They do not even let the camera rest for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him. Give me the old-school camera-only-on-Bachchan style every Saturday. Kudos to you, of course, because you made Abhishek an actor, first in Naach and now in Sarkar. They also allow him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can walk as well as his father. Even in the short prison sequence, you really let the Bachchans come out of the text, an opportunity that Shaad missed in Bunty Aur Babli. I wish the movie could have been a father-son story rather than a chaotic conflict between cartoons on behalf of characters who appear on the Internet like the advertising windows. <br /> <br /> You also let the women into the script more than Puzo and Coppola and again you earn all the brownie points because you have impressed them so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return, with the mother in the center, Tanishaa loveable as a loveable girl, Katrina a revelation as a confused lover of Abhishek, and Rukhsar's silence speaks volumes. When your free-flowing camera tries to make each frame look like your background noises are constantly irritating, we're always reminded that we're in a factory. Well, maybe not a Nino Rota score, but Sarkar certainly deserves better than these govinda, govinda songs, and undisputed flute interludes. <br /> <br /> Mr. Varma, some of your factory directors tell me that you are related to any project, from monitoring the recording schedules to monitoring the editing sessions. Perhaps the bhiku mate cry in the middle of the various storyboards is muted by the silence of Subhash Nagare. You may need to shut down the factory shutters and work on a single home-made product. Otherwise, your products would not stay, use and throw products. And movie fans like me, for whom there are no hits and flops, just good movies, would rather opt for a movie without a factory finish, every Saturday.
