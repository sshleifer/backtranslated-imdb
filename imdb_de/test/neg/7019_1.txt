In the beginning I love Lucy very much. Your TV show still makes me laugh. She was with Chaplin and Keaton one of the greatest comedians who ever lived. Her performance in this film is disappointing. She was too old and the gauze filters on the lens made her look like a London fog refugee. She could not sing and her voice was so froggy that she croaked through every song. Their dance days were long in the past. Just because you're a Lucy fan, do not miss this fake, sad performance and sing his praise. I prefer to remember Lucy in her wonderful TV series (I Love Lucy) and draw the curtain of charity on the awful confusion of a movie called "Mame."
