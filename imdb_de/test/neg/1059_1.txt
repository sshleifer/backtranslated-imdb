Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think we're all idiots. If not, how are we to understand that? <br /> <br /> American pilots start with Mig-29. Suddenly all the planes use the F-16. Ha, a magic! After an action ... Migs Land. Again the magic! <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention that the F-16 have Israel marks? <br /> <br /> Another Magic: Obviously unarmed L-39 trainers are bomb opponents. <br /> <br /> And more magic: While all films are in Europe, we can see a desert in almost every fly scene. <br /> <br /> Maybe the director wasted all his magic on things, because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and explosions look awful, as if pilots were bombarded with Molotovs. OK, OK, that's a movie. I should write about his story ... wait. A story? Yes, there are some stories in this movie. And it is also terrible.
