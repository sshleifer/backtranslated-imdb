I do not like Cary Grant, but I find his performances in so many movies annoying that you notice it. this, Arsenic & Old Lace and Baby educate. I do not like him in North by Northwest, but I find this movie really unbearably stupid. In addition, I find the endless excitement about Grant's class boring. I have no idea what his class is doing for the viewers who announce it. It does not matter to me. <br /> <br /> In the behind-the-scenes DVD included in this DVD, Patrcia Hitchcock says Grant was her father's favorite teacher; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better man in a series of better Hitchcock movies. <br /> <br /> With its ruined ending, this is really a half movie and does not support discussion and can not support the high ratings it gets. Even if the movie should end, there is not much going on. Fontaine is a totally unsympathetic jerk. She has to be deaf, idle and unwilling to contact someone other than Johnny to finish the entire movie for his tricks to work. That's not much to work with. Cary Grant begins each line with "Monkeyface ..." until I want to strangle him. He says it about sixty times. It is positively scratching. The technique of Hitch is frighteningly flat. An endless sequence of rooms / sets has projected a fake skylight on the back wall as a spiderweb effect. And a light bulb in a glass of milk can upset the fans, but it can not save a movie that was made so bad. Peter Bogdanovich should retire if he makes another imitation of Hitchcock / Cary Grant a DVD. I think that's his whole career now. As soon as I saw him, I thought, oh crap, here comes an imitation of which only he is impressed. Instead, there were two! oh joy!
