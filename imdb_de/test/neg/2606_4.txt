When Family Guy premiered for the first time, I was not in a discriminatory mood. Why should I find it in the 1990s with a wealth of smart, surreal cartoons? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life among other fine cartoons (yes, this includes Spongebob). All had bizarre, dreamlike animations and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogues. The Simpsons have become an absolute phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as their greatest defenders claim, but a very fine investment of their time and certainly disappointing the false axiom that television is all junk. South Park began with a rough but witty attack on everything with a unique and intelligent satire underneath. It evolved into a Monty Pythonsquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally fast and sharp social critiques (like their defending the posh Unterhosengnome) and eventually decided to be completely self-centered and "meta" like the Simpsons Unfortunately, the shark jumped. Family Guy is superficial like The Simpsons and South Park. It pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. What he has wit, he lacks wit. <br /> <br /> The show is famous for its use of gimmicks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad TV sitcoms or commercials. Some are funny (especially from the first two seasons), most are not. Are references funny by nature? I'm not sure, but mostly it's what the show is about, considering their characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charm and Cartman has an artillery of self-confidence and sheer indignation to support his awful behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a loud, disgusting pig. Anything weird about his character is just because the authors forgot how to be funny that day. Lois is also very flat and dull; Meg is a prop that can only be abused. Chris is left behind at the border and only occasionally funny, and the show's two stars (Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all somehow makes no sense. <br /> <br /> I can not do any other gimmicks If a character points to something clear, he stays unpleasantly long. This has happened a lot lately and I can not stand it any longer. Not only the oft-mentioned chicken Peter is beating, I'm talking about the painful moments in which they talk about pop culture and as if they are foreign viewers. This is not a joke or even ironic humor, it is totally boring and lifeless. <br /> <br /> Not that the show can not be funny, in fact some of the earlier episodes got me rolling. Highlights include the pilot episode in which Peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television. when Peter's religious fanatic father shows up and wreaks havoc; When Peter becomes a drug dealer in the Megs school and the "pancake" episode. I suspect these are the episodes that have inadvertently incorporated human traits into their characters, or they were merely times when the writers had truly comedic inspiration. <br /> <br /> One last thing, the show is not offensive. It's just offensive to those who would not even see the show, so it's almost like a circle jerk to the hipster choir.
