Definitely not a typical Polizia, Redneck just never worked for me. The film tells the story of a jewel robbery that went awry and a boy being inadvertently kidnapped. In their attempt to escape, the robbers leave a bloody trail of death as they devise a plan to deliver the boy. The plan is never misleading, as the robbers tend to come to France and the boy wants to stay with them. While I could name a few issues I had with the movie, I focus on the most obvious ones? the figure Memphis played by Telly Savalas. From his work on The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films like Crime Boss to his most memorable role as Kojak, Savalas was a winner. I've always seen him as an over-cool customer. Unfortunately, Savalas in Redneck is hard to beat. Did the director turn the camera on and tell him to be as psychotic as possible? It might not have been so bad if his actions had been done in connection with a conspiracy that interested me, but here he seems to be bizarre to be bizarre. It seems to be a random madness. And what about this accent? Savalas may have been a lot of things, but Southern is not one of them. He sounds utterly ridiculous, even if he tries the accent. In addition, I found little interest in the rest of the film. As I indicated, the plot never got me involved. And the idea that the boy is so quickly drawn to the criminal lifestyle does not seem to be true. For the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and the normally reliable Franco Nero is not much better. Three "name" actors and no good performance between them. I think the director filmed many of the night scenes just with the glow of his watch to illuminate the shots. I could not say what was going on. Characters I hate, an action I do not care about, and production values ​​that have failed? No wonder I gave Redneck a 3/10.
