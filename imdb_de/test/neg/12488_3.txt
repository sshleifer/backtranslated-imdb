What happened to RGV? There are so many wrong things in this movie that you have to stop and decide where to start first and worst - the music. Every scene was accompanied by that overbearing background music that told you the mood, quite pathetic, I would like to add. Second, the lighting. Do we really need dark scenes in which we wonder if the projector is still working? And finally - if you want to Indianize the Godfather and Godfather 2 - please note that many of us have seen in it. Nayakan was a rip off of GF1, but better done and more entertaining. I've seen a similarity in Company and Sarkar and while RGV's Ab Tak 56 was brilliant, these two films leave something to be desired. People will no longer be impressed only by corrupt politicians and much more. Maybe RGV Maqbool should see what is good enough to be RGV !!
