An obvious deposit for the * Insert Monster Here * In a plane gimmick, Flight Of The Living Dead is what you expect. <br /> <br /> The film has little or no action, as one would expect from a film of this kind. Although it's fun in parts, I have to say. The zombie action is especially entertaining. Once the movie is resumed, it never stops; The pace is solid. <br /> <br /> The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> The end seems to leave the film open for a sequel. Let's hope that does not succeed. <br /> <br /> If you're a diehard fan of the zombie subgenre of horror movies, I'd recommend it to you. it is worth at least one o'clock. But if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
