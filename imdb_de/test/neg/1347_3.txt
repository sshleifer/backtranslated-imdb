This movie could have been a decent reprise and knows he tried (or tried English). To assemble talented actors along with a successful and experienced writer / director should be a formula for a decent movie. But Ms. English's experience, according to her IMDb biography, is limited solely to television work, and it is strikingly obvious in this film. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that in none of the reviews I've read is what I've read mentioned. Most unlikely, he found this movie and what prevented it from only part of its potential He looked and felt like he had been made for television. To pay tribute to Ms. English, many of the jokes that just did NOT work on a movie screen would have been great on TV (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). So much of the camera usage and lighting would have been good on television, but seemed awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole movie had been broken down into a mini-series or sit-com, I think it would have worked. But this is cinema and unfortunately the talents of Mrs. English did not translate. I startled myself at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors and the writers, as if I had the feeling that I had come half-shrunk out of the theater! Meg Ryan is her usual, naughty self (apart from the terrible plastic surgery she had on her face), but where did she get the chance to use her talent ?! She made films in which she did not rebuild her stereotype role and made her good ... but not here. Annette Bening just seemed to go through the moves - such a talent and yet such a bad performance! I enjoyed the other female characters, but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s does not translate to the 2000s, and nobody helped Ms. Englisch to get the changes & updates or subtleties right. If only she (as a writer, director and producer) asked for help, I think she could have worked well. But it was not like that. <br /> <br /> It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good author or director. The feeling that it would be a waste of time and money for everyone! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is fitting: a couple of film executives have a meeting, and the caption reads, "Let's make a classic worse!"
