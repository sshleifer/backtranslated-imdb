There are so many holes in the plot that you wonder if they knew they had an audience for it and just threw it together. I do not know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two films. Obviously, he was used as a loving father, crazy scientist and vampire man. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised he ended up in the genre. This is the typical "I will create monsters that can be used as an army." By transferring Wolf's Blood (or is it Coyote) to his rented hand, he turns him into a werewolf. Glen Strange, who was one of Karloff's successors as a Frankenstein monster, plays the lovable, lovable employee who falls victim to trusting the madman. First, the scientist can control when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But like the invisible man, he suddenly begins to transform himself and becomes a guilt. There's a little love story from the daughter and a high-voice reporter (Golly Miss Brooks). She wants to leave, but her father, the doctor, does not allow it. He is also driven by a group of his colleagues who have previously mocked his research, and now he will be satisfied. It is quite a stretch, as he imagines, to embarrass or kill them, and depends heavily on Petro and the boys waiting to be attacked. It is not a very good movie. The strength is the atmosphere of the forest, while humans and monsters lurk around the Spanish moss. Again, the citizens are a bunch of idiots who look like they've escaped a bad West. One thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a movie of that era. There is also a smoking old lady who knows werewolves, but no one listens to her.
