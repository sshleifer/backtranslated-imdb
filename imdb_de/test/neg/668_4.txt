Okay, let's be realistic. Nobody goes into a movie that is shown and expected by WWE Films (whose owner challenged God for a wrestling match) under the direction of a former porn director (the man gave the world the cheek trilogy) with a wrestler named Kane some piece of art on a golden plate. If you do, you'll probably need to find something other than watching movies to save your time. <br /> <br /> So what exactly can we expect from a movie like this? Well, I was looking forward to it: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad spectacle. 2) A rather nonexistent, clich√©d plot. 3) Kane walks around with a disheveled, sour face indicating that his nostrils have just found the potato salad he had mislaid a month ago. 4) tons and tons of blood. <br /> <br /> If you are hungry for something "so bad, fun", you can satisfy your appetite as it works in every way. <br /> <br /> Films like this one are best seen for free, but if you decide to sacrifice the box office casualties, then have fun and make a game of it. The filmmakers are so kind as to introduce us to the annoying delinquents by lighting up their names and violations on the screen. This makes it easier to write down which people should be killed in which order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. <br /> <br /> I also suggest that you and your friends write down every single moment of stupidity and insanity you can find. Summarize them in the end and see who comes up the most. I think my total was 107; can you defeat that? Personally, I would like to know how, after 35 years and a fire, this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water and a working elevator. I know, I know, the filmmakers assume you have to pay When you see this, you obviously do not think much about what you spend your money on, and you probably will not worry much about it, how stupid the movie is, but that does not mean that we can not point it out and laugh. <br /> <br /> I also like how the city manages this huge hotel (which is condemned and recommended by any sensible inspector) in They want to transform a homeless shelter, and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few pugs and brooms. Uh-huh. <br /> <br /> I think you know pretty well what to expect, but I feel the need to give you some warnings. First, if you hate the mass interaction regardless of the movie, you might want to stay away. People in the audience behaved like a wrestling show. Calls of "Kill Him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" echoed through the theater and showed what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I do not usually value such interaction with the audience, but for such a cheesefest, I thought the comment contributed to the entertainment value. But I can see how others could get annoyed with it. Second, and that should not even require an explanation, the film is not afraid of anger. When you see a big, ugly guy pull eyeballs out of the sockets, that does not mean "fun night at the cinema!" for you then you know well and well to save your dough. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was a little surprised by Kane's extreme lack of dialogue. I did not expect him to start a drama clinic, but I was hoping he'd have some cute slogans like "Say good night" (his character's last name is "Good night") just before he killed a victim. Instead, he spent four words throughout the movie - "Nooooooo!" and "I see it." But hey, he delivered it perfectly! <br /> <br /> If I was a bad guy in a movie, my slogan would be something like "Place your bets!" or "All bets are out!" <br /> <br /> It would rule and you know it. We need a new generic term for bad horror movies like See No Evil, which cause so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to call them comedic. Send me your suggestions. For now we just call them HOR-larious!
