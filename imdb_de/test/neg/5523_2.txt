The Nu company produces a couple of "action packed" films every year with "full suspense". This little nugget called Shadowcaster III (until I visit this website, this is a whole trilogy) is a great example of the good work the company is doing. Frank Zagarino is as mean as ever and does a great job as almost indestructible (?), Schizophrenic (?) Android. I will not waste words anymore, as I do not want to betray the grandiose conspiracy and ruin some great laughs. putting together this kind of garbage must be nerve-wracking.)
