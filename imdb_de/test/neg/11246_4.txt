... this is not worth the price of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers have done can not really be called filmmaking. Instead, they chose only sixteen students of varying degrees of diversity (though not as much diversity as suggested in the reviews) and relaxed them. The results are brutally open, far more often boring, selfish, overwrought and repulsive grainy than truly enlightening. Only possible in documentary, but overall there is not much more truth here than in "Bully" or a decent TV documentary of the same kind Sex, sexual diversity and racism speak, the movie brings nothing to the table, which is useful for anyone who has seriously thought about these issues. And while certain sections have absolutely no purpose other than injecting (admittedly welcome) comic relief, the five-minute limit usually keeps them from emotionally engaging with one of the students. An interesting idea, but keep your fingers crossed for CHAIN ​​CAMERA.
