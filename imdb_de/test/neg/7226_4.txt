Has really good music and performances; Kid Creole and the Coconuts, James White and the Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, the Plastics, Melle Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc, but apart from that there is not much else. The dialogue, especially the story (by Saul Williams), is actually pretty good, but the performances are all pretty boring or downright bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown; Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the last role is the main character) still do not have enough cultural appreciation to avoid making this film a novelty object. It's about the frantic spontaneity of a Jack Kerouac style, but does not have the insight to push it, and it's where the band's appearances come in. I enjoyed it, but I just expected more. Although it has a fairy tale ending.
