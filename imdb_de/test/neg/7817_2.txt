This is the first time I've commented on a movie I did not watch until the end of the credits. The reason is simple ... People must be warned: This is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I usually stay away from many comedies that taste bad, but I thought that was good. A regrettable decision based on other Ashton Kutcher comedies that were (half) enjoyable, like A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. and I do not mean any !!). Acting is terrible, especially the "boss". Tara Reid was no surprise, how dare she call herself an actress ?! The premise is thin and the plot does not thicken at all. No problem, if you manage to keep it funny and / or sweet ... but as you probably suspected, this was not the cast! The script felt like it was not quite finished and I would not even be baffled if the director did some rewriting while shooting. My dog ​​could have seriously written a more coherent script. And he is not exactly Lassie :-). <br /> <br /> Stay away from this trip, even if from time to time you like funny stupid things (like me). This inferior movie will not be enjoyed by many. <br /> <br /> I never (almost) ever give one, so ... a 2.
