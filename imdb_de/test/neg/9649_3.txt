Let me first say that I'm not someone who is usually scared of having to think about movies while watching movies. For example, I love Tarkovsky films. Berghman is also a favorite ... but that? The positive points are easy to summarize: the photography is great and the music is perfect ... does it make a good movie? I thought earlier, but this is a perfect example of one who can not (for me) do it ... maybe because I'm too stupid? possible, but I do not think so ... Tarkwosky, for example, has taken very long shots, but he has never shot the same image of two people running for five minutes (and I just mean their heads because in this movie there is it's a lot of these recordings, but sometimes it's effective), the overall result is just boring, even with the smart undertones (which are done in a way that is both intelligent and above all very pedantic). <br /> <br /> You also feel that the director does not make some of the long shots aesthetic or symbolic, just to save the budget ... <br /> <br /> Me I am very disappointed in this movie because I really liked the first 30 minutes, but it just went on and on, without keeping the same level as in the first scenes .... During the reading of the movie Very praising comments to this Page, I also feel that some people in the movie are trying to see a lot more than it is ... If a movie is slow and artful, this is not necessary. I mean, it's very profound ... yes, it does is an allegory of music theory related to a small city, which is interesting for itself, but it does NOT make a profound movie ... except for people I really want to make some kind of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it is not what you see in the fil m, but what you find in yourself ... an exercise that, in my opinion, can be made much more effective while watching. "Stalker" or "Solyaris" as Werckmeister Harmonies, Tarkowsky owes a lot, but the taxi is never at its level ...
