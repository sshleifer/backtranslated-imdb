What a frustrating movie. A small city in the south is full of opportunities to explore the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underground floors hidden beneath peaceful surfaces, as anyone who has read something about Carson McCullers already knows. That does not matter. Instead, the writers were content with cute flashes, cheap warm bottles and banal melodrama. The thing looks like a TV movie and was filmed without special direction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating aspect, however, is the fact that there are many very competent and engaging actors in this cast who are all trying to make the most of things and do what they can - well yes, there is no other word for it. A tragic talent waste, especially that of the great Stockard Channing.
