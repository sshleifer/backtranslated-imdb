Kidman and Law lack the chemistry to do this sloppy, poorly written romance / melodrama work on something other than grandiosity. Kidman sulks and pines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She just met him when he was fighting for the South in the Civil War, and they only exchanged about 5 sentences and a kiss, but they are totally in love. Law's mainstream seems to be "Look empty and shocked, but sensitive." Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this gritty script, but she plays it way too far and exaggerated, as if she were playing in "Annie Get Your Gun." Yee-hah, boy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged to a Monty Python sketch - the one from 'Holy Grail', where farmers spend all their time hiding in mud and making mudcake for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to avoid her whenever she can. Her scenes are like a comic book hidden in a Victorian-era novel. <br /> <br /> Whenever the action sinks into utter boredom, which is often the case, the authors just write: "Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!" and Teague (Ray Winstone) gallops out of nowhere to commit his unspeakable, insidious acts, such as killing and torturing innocent, godly city dwellers in the name of loyalty to a fast fading confederacy, at other times he lacks action, which is absurd even in this Cornball script from other talented actors who perform credibly in small roles, these are the characters that Law meets as he makes his Johnny Appleseed trek from the frontline where he left, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman in Cold Mountain, but ultimately none of these characters matters, the law has no time for them or their lives, and each of those little mini-movies has the same tired The ma: War is damned gol-durn and turns otherwise decent Christian people into rabid animals. <br /> <br /> And the script is way too predictable, too cumbersome. In addition, the tempo of the story is terribly slow. They spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion as Kidman wrings her hands and sighs. Law overcomes incredible opportunities and beats balls. And when it finally comes, it just does not care anymore. You will look at your watch and ask yourself how much more of this gossip you have to endure. <br /> <br /> I give her a star of five for the fight scenes. There is a strong anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern about the loss of life by the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful. But it's only about 15 minutes from this 150-minute dog.
