I love Umberto Lenzi's police films - ROME TO THE TEETH is my favorite - and his DESERT COMMANDOS legitimated the Italian Euro War phenomenon by making it a pretty good movie. Give him guns, machines, and a few people who walk around and talk hard, and it's hard for him to overlook him. <br /> <br /> What a shame it is to meet his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could have been from anyone, and one observes them with the feeling that he is under contract. It has been said what kind of films to do, it is charged with a cast and a crew and receives a budget, an appointment and a screenplay. Lenzi then went out and performed his films the same way a McDonald's man repairs a lot of French fries. Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is the more original - which is amazing because it contains extensive material from three other cannibal films - and is easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, but not much. <br /> <br / I'd like others to outline the plot: What fascinated me about the movie is how it's staged, and yet, what a somewhat infamous reputation this movie is as a kind of total assault on has the good taste. It's not so, although the film is an exercise with a bad taste, complete with a theme scene scene in which two of the pretty supporting actresses are literally cut into pieces and eaten alive by cannibals, which is the highlight of the film. The problem is that Lenzi gives us a good, long look at the cannibal-fixed scene and shows the convincing ring of a Season 3 STAR TREK episode with a fake jungle set for really bloody close-ups. And I do not know about anyone, but if someone cuts off pieces of my person and eats them, I would not just lie there and look desperate. <br /> <br /> My problem with the movie could be that I have great respect for Lenzi as a filmmaker, and that could have been done by anyone. All of your cannibal film conventions are touched, but it never feels as if they are being filmed with a genuine conviction, except to bully Ruggero Deodato out of the sandbox. The two directors certainly had to get to know each other and either had some kind of youthful rivalry or an actual dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to put them in the limelight. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with MAN FROM DEEP RIVER, Deodato blew it off with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi shot back EATEN ALIVE, Deodato threw him (and everyone else) off with CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and Lenzi has one final leg with CANNIBAL shot FEROX, which is about as realistic as the commercial of Krazy Glu, in which the guy sticks his helmet to a carrier and hangs in the middle of the air. <br /> <br /> This film is less desperate and a little more reluctant to push viewers into the abyss with anything holier than FEROX, which remains a kind of misguided attempt to put CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST in the limelight. This is more like a mishmash, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a Jim Jones suicidal cult - the cannibals seem to be more of an afterthought than the reason for the movie. I think fans of the genre will get a better idea of ​​the movie than fans of Lenzi's films looking for something new from the awesome director. It is not as entertaining as SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, as adventurous as its own MAN FROM DEEP RIVER, and it certainly lacks the courage of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Combine these considerations with the recycled footage, scenes of massive animal entanglements, misogynist scenes of sexual violence and stagy, wooden methods of filmmaking and what you get is going to be an OK jungle thriller with two or three outstanding scenes and Umberto Lenzi so much more. <br /> <br /> 4/10; Gore freaks, however, go crazy.
