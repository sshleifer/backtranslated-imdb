Carson Daly must be the only presenter of the late-night talk show who is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking? He is not funny! The writing is terrible! All sketches are painful to look at. The current new karaoke is not funny at all, especially since it tells you what they will sing before they sing it! The escalator interviews are just stupid and needless to say, not funny at all. Everything he jokes, especially during the monologue, is the least clever, dumbest, not funniest joke ever released on TV! I mean, every time he makes a Jessica Simpson joke, he ends it with "because she's stupid," which eliminates any jokes from the joke that was already very low. Any 3-year-old could have come up with the jokes and sketches he made for a show with that lame excuse. Seriously, do not look at this show unless you're on the brink of suicide and want something that pushes you over the edge.
