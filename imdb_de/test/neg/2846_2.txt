Bridget Fonda is the sexually contented wife of pretty Hart Bochner. One afternoon she comes home, calls him "Honey," and quietly prepares a drink for him, only to find himself pouting. Minutes pass while she pleases his frowning silence. Suddenly he bursts into rage, accusing her of infidelity in complete absence of any reason, calling her the C-word, banging her head against a cupboard, knocking her around and flinging her from the second floor balcony, breaking her hand and one few ribs. <br /> <br /> She wakes up in the hospital and is deaf, though she notices that she reads her lips perfectly. This avoids all the awkwardness associated with an ASL interpreter or the squeaky words in a simulacrum of speech. <br /> <br /> Alright. Let me just lay out the basic elements of the plot. This beautiful and devoted disabled woman is beaten by her husband, misinterpreted by her older mother, betrayed by her sister, her bank account is emptied by unknown hands, nearly raped by a fat man who accuses her in a bar and is said to have murdered her now missing husband is persecuted by two police officers (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice, while the other seems to like all women and is embarrassed by their presence. At the end she stands alone at a deserted bus stop with a handful of money - alone, whiny but courageous. Now a pop quiz. There is only one multiple choice question. "This story was written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman." Do not sound sexist. One could also easily portray a scenario of a decorated military hero and trained warrior who is captured by his enemies, betrayed, beaten and tortured by his organization to seek revenge and resign himself to his beloved wife. d lost a long time ago. <br /> <br /> The direction is functional and conventional. When Fonda comes to a hospital bed, we see the faces of the anxious doctors and nurses staring at her - that is, the camera - echoing every scene in countless second-rate films. The Gurney hurries down the corridor rolled, and people, strengthened with white coats and decorated with stethoscopes, hover over the camera. <br/> <br/> Hart Bochner has played some nasty people in interesting ways - some of them The characters are stupid ("The Hard") and some are more than rude ("The Sea Will Tell"). His masculine beauty has a kind of evil tinge. It would be too easy to occupy him as a hero. Nice, intentionally bland performance by Steven Weber as a stupid cop - maybe the best in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. Her spectacle is limited, but here she is fully displayed. What makes her an interesting object is her almost stereotyped beauty. She's like a high school prom queen. Very feminine. Of course she can not help herself if she slides around or moves her hands so gracefully. She can not do anything with her nose either. For the most part of its length, it is completely normal and attractive, but at its tip there is a bulge outward that follows the natural radiance of its nostrils. The tip of this nose is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> As for the film - Pfui.
