One of those movies where you bet on who will die first and who will survive in the end. There was only something about the movie that pulled me out of the zone. I think because I keep looking back and think "yep still in this tree ... still looking at the water". Bad character development. I did not feel anything when in danger. I voted for the croc. I found it hard to believe that a croc would even try to tip a boat, and when it jumps into the boat, I find that very unlikely. The crocodile sometimes seems too supernatural ("everyone knows everything"). Even if the crocodile attacks, his behavior seems very unrealistic. It is a killing machine and would not allow the victims to escape two or three times in a row, especially when attacking in the water.
