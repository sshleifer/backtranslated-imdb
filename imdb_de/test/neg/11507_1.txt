OMG, what Disney has been doing lately ... most of their new shows are really shit. The life of the suites of Zach and Cody is pretty good, but other shows like Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place are shitty and unsurpassed. Of course, Sadie is just stupid and stupid. It's about a teenager named Sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her older annoying brother Hal. Everyone is annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret, who considers herself the most popular girl in school and thinks she's so pretty ... it's just awful. I hate all the seasons of this series, it's just awful in every way (but the first season was better). <br /> <br /> If you value your life, you would not see that crap, it's painful and stupid
