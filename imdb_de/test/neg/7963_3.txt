Spoiler Warning !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my least popular Cary Grant movie. I spent most of my time thinking about it: ignore him, leave him, etc. Will he kill her? Should we assume that after the end, if he persuades her to return home with him, he will still kill her? I see in some books that some viewers / critics have read this. After all, early quitting is a more reasonable way to film a book than to change the ending-and this is a more unreasonable change in the ending than, say, Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example of not making the killer murderer because a star was thrown (if Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits are not mentioned), the end of the book is not definitely ruled out. <br /> <br /> In Hitchcock's Revisited Movies by Robin Wood, he writes: "When you mentally" change "from end to end, the meaning of each scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of reality fiction breaks down, the film becomes a "modernist" text, in which the narrative process is in the foreground. "I like to play intellectual interpretive games like any other, but if the film is not directly readable, it fails. This fails. Even after looking at the deadly milk glasses that recur in some Hitchcock movies. <br/> <br /> An annoying dichotomy. The year is 1941. Nothing in the film says it plays in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Paris bank and goes there to do financial transactions? Does not he know that there is a war? Did you actually have flights from Croydon airport? Is he in good contact with the Nazis? Why is it never suggested that the Germans shot him as a spy or something. <br /> <br /> A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mystery writer, and her brother, the pathologist, a fifth person is present who is neither explained nor imagined - a woman in a tux. The credits say she's Nonda's Metcalf playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Is not that an example of how lesbians were coded in movies in the 1940s? Should we take her as Isobel's lover? The books that discuss open and hidden gays / lesbians in Hitchcock (eg, Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
