I'm surprised that Pauly Shore is entertaining for everyone: he's basically a joke that's * fast * obsolete. He has his little "California" -back vocabulary and a basic set of lame jokes. Mostly it's just awful. <br /> <br /> That is, I saw this movie because I got sick and it was literally nothing more than infomercials, otherwise I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. Anyway, the movie could've been OK if Pauly had just turned off his game and could just play it as a comic actor instead of, well, Pauly. Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you're not a Pauly fan, stay out of this crap. <br /> <br /> I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user has actually given this movie a 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly !!) Personally, I rated it 3/10 because they did not shoot with the microphone in the picture, did not drop the camera, and the side squat was pretty good.
