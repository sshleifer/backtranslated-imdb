Please, if you are considering renting this movie, then do not. If you're considering watching a few downloaded clips, do not do that. If I want, nobody would need to read this summary. <br /> <br /> Although acting was one of the highlights of the film, it was still pathetic. The director was probably a sadist. The humorous deposits were something you would expect from a room with high-paid, antisocial 7-year-olds who eat breakfast chips paint a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (do not connect these two films) because of it bad is that it's funny. But it also tries to be funny at the same time and fails so overwhelmingly that the sense of humor remains crippled to do anything but trigger the gag reflex to save myself. I could do much more and describe in detail how terrible it really was, but I think it would make me want to live, just to think about it. When you need me, I set out to cook myself so that I feel clean again ...
