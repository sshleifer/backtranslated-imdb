They've brought a love story to people in the heart of Edinburgh, a true story, and it has changed it as Hollywood has done before. The end result is a movie, but well done for those who do not know the story quite differently and inaccurately. The original movie in this story, which Walt Disney himself took care of, used the right thoroughbred dog that was crucial to the story, and did not make John Gray special. He was a poor Shepard who died in poverty at the hostel. If you like the story, look at the Disney original to get a better heartwarming story. It's a shame, the cast, and the potential for a grandiose remake of a classic story. Read the book for an exact occurrence of the story. And if you really like it, you can visit the real Kirkyard in Edinburgh.
