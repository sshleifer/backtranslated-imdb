This movie really shows his age. The pressure I saw was terrible due to age, but there may be better prints. However, this was not the main problem of the movie. The problem was that although the film was shot in 1933, it was essentially a silent movie in which only very few dialogues (a few sentences) of the film were scattered in amateur style. Sometimes the character's characters turned or they talked with their hands over their faces - all in a pitiful attempt to disguise their lips and "cleaverly" (?) Hide the fact that the movie was dubbed. Well, it is true that this Czech film would have to be dubbed into many languages, but to do so was really stupid and obvious. It just looked cheap. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie looked low and was silly. It's really a shame because there was a good story - a young woman marrying an older man who is either gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would be willing to sit through this archaic mess. Even with a few moments on the naked (and a bit chunky) Hedy Lamarr, it's not worth the excitement that accompanied the film at its premiere. Even after 1933, this movie was a bad guy. The only interesting thing about the film is to see how Lamarr looked different in 1933 from the glamorous image that Hollywood created when she came to America - she looks like two completely different people. <br /> <br /> It's such an incomplete-looking and technically inferior movie, I do not see how the movie got such rave reviews. For technical problems alone, the film can not rate 10 or anything nearby.
