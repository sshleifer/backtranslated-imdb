This movie is the proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. Ed Harris is terrible. How could you cast an actor like Rambo as a maestro? He shows no credibility and trumps Beethoven. Especially long hair does not look good on his head at all. The lead actress lacks all subtleties needed for her character. The camera shots are cheesy and too conventional. The lights should close the feelings of the characters. Bad casting and favorable direction. Pity! The only scene the movie pays is if Beeth (I hope you do not care if I call him by his nickname?) Turns the girl's song into a joke. Anyway, I hope Harris can find his way back to the real movie where he can really show his hairless talent.
