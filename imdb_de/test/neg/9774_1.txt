No, really, I'm not joking around here, folks, and I can not believe how many people really made really positive reviews here! oh wait, it's the IMDB comment section, stupid me. It is interesting to note that there were not enough votes at the time to give this film a rating of ten. Nevertheless, there are dozens of commentaries who are enthusiastic about the film. What does that mean, I ask myself? Nevertheless, the script is terrible. The character changes his personality, his motivation and his actions in each scene, to move the film with something vaguely resembling a tempo. It was not even stupid behavior, it was there, but the sheer idiocy of the script was beyond any stupidity the characters showed. For example: karl does not obey because there are two corpses in the desert and "the killer is out here somewhere", so he forces everyone to drive 40km to find the killer, commands to obey everyone , When the hero discovers something unpleasant in the darkness and warns Karl, Karl challenges our hero not to be an idiot, and there's nothing out there, they all go home. In the next scene, he refuses to let it go, and must go hunting, whatever it is. it's just a joke. Yes, the monster is very impressive, but the crap that people say about it just tries to erase its interesting aspects, and the moments of the predators and aliens were very boring. and the end ... the end!?!?! Jesus ... the worst movie I've seen this year, and I saw Bug Buster!
