I am usually not inclined to write reviews about films that I believe deserve no mention. When looking for a writer and film critic, however, I find it important to express my thoughts when I do not like a movie. "Queen of the Damned" is one of those films. <br /> <br /> The popular horror stories of Anne Rice about Lestat, a bisexual vampire, surfaced in 1994 in the successful "An Interview With A Vampire". With two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the film's stylish aesthetics and gothic scene captured the audience. Even though this is a style with style that worked despite its chess, there was something in it (I've never been so in love with the vampire genre in general). <br /> <br /> Since that time Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone to much bigger things. It would be likely that both of them screamed with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel. They would have laughed even more than they would have seen the end result. "Queen of the Damned" is a typical example of the kind of Cr * p Hollywood will spend at a low price, hoping to get a quick price thanks to an average soundtrack and a major marketing campaign for 13-17 year olds Needless to say, this movie is terrible right from the start. Lestat, now played by British Stuart Townsend of "Shooting Fish," wakes up from his dark grave with the sound of ... You guessed it, Nu-Metal. He freaks out some confused punk musicians and joins their band, with the proviso that he only appears at night, what the sun is burning and all day long ... Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student studying paranormal (Vampire Studies 101?), Trying to find out if Lestat is really who he says. On the way she falls in love with him (something with her strange past), but has some competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a vampire demon queen who returns from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her chosen king. <Br /> <br /> The film is shamefully selfish, yet its plump tone leaves room for its pejorative sense of humor. Anyone who sees this movie as anything but a good laugh must generally see more movies! The reputation of Townsend is pleasant. He knows that the role is absolutely exaggerated, and does his best to go the tightrope between hammer-stroke and serious acting. The late Aaliyah is unfortunately terrible in the title role. She has minimal screentime and she does not take full advantage of what she has. The bad make-up and the special effects do not help. Sometimes she sounds like she's talking through a voicebox. <br /> <br /> It is rumored that this film was shot directly to video until the premature death of Aaliyah last year. Warner Bros had the opportunity to see their latest movie and made it available for general publication. Otherwise, this would have been one of the movies you see on the shelf in the video stores. Avoid, however, as you will find that this will just be terrible. In films like "Not Another Teen Movie", you can watch the tide of Teen Rom Com prints. If there is a market where Hollywood can be exploited, that is the case. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is not the movie itself. Hollywood is about making money. So if there's a market for this movie, they'll track it. That's business. But the thing that bothers me most is that people have to go to the movies and pay money! I think that's the biggest argument in the cinema world: is film art in the first place and entertainment second, or is it the other way around? The only people who can decide that are the audience. If you like good movies and fascinate, stay away from this turkey.
