I could not wait until the end. This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. If you thought that just about anyone could make a movie, these people prove that a minimum of skill is required. This is a movie without any redeeming features. It counts in each department a zero. This is more than just "amateur" because the audience is not considered at all. There is no serious attempt to act or entertain. The plot is aimless, meaningless and meaningless. The cast looks very uncomfortable and has no direction. The technical aspects of the film are bad. <br /> <br /> As a DVD, it is a good drink coaster.
