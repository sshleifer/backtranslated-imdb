I did not really hate Mirrormask. I just wanted more of a movie than beautiful pictures. The film begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. While other children (allegedly) want to escape to the circus, they only want to run away from the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wishes she would drop dead. Bad train. The mother gets sick ... something (probably cancer) and needs surgery. The night before the operation, she dreams into a wonderful world made up of her dreams and nightmares in which she "finds herself". Personally, the movie became crap for me as soon as she started to dream. The early scenes show the comic and wonderful world of the circus and juxtapose them to the bleak clinic and the filth of a block of flats. But as soon as she dreams, the entire movie shifts to the CGI country, where almost everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world has nothing of the mystery and wonder it should have. while movies like the Wizard of Oz were tempting to explore Mirrormask, throwing pictures into our faces and then snapping them off to give us a different image. There is little sense and purpose for the design in this film, and although some things are very pretty (the librarian is a masterpiece), they disappear so fast that they are soon forgotten. Helana and her buddy Valentine are annoying and at worst unbearable. Overall, Mirrormask is like a pretty pole that you bite and find out that it's actually ashes. Stay with the children from the real world.
