It is sad that some people find this movie worth seeing. I am russian and disgusted. There is nothing in this movie that deserves praise except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think that this movie was badly designed and directed. Nothing is more irritating and even more furious than shameless speculation in art (if you can call that rubbish art). Balabanov wanted to scare the audience by omnipresent evil, and he managed to create a hopelessly dark film. The biggest shock, however, is the primitive directorial work of Balabanov. I would not advise any of my friends to look at this. Huge disappointment!
