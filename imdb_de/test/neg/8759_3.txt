Well, I've seen a lot of reviews and many promo scenes that always showed the beheading scene. But this strip is hard. And I mean it in all ways. It is difficult to find a copy because it is a low-budget independent release, and since the MPAA was hunting for each copy on VHS, it was not rated but had to be rated for the MPAA. So disappeared copies in the underground scene. All the people involved in this film have done nothing else in the business. So this strip became unique. VHS copies almost never appear on ebay or other websites. If you do, you will pay over $ 100 to get one. But due to US connections, I was able to buy a release on DVD that was sold worldwide. Limited, but it should be some kind of official. From time to time there are still some screenings of this Splatterfestes. But is it worth all the hype around him? As I said, it is difficult to catch, but also durchzusitzen. There are bloody killings, there is necrophilia, there is nudity, but there is also much talk between the copper. And to be honest, if you want to watch the movie in 5 minutes to see the end, this is a flashback in the murderer's mind. The blood is flowing and in fact it is a splatterfest, but not the full 80 minutes, splatter galore for 10 minutes. The quality of the film is fine, the sound is fine, no hissing, the colors are okay, black is black and not blue, as in many low budgets. It's okay to look at it, but you'll never be scared, but you should drink a beer and a pizza with your friends, I think. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
