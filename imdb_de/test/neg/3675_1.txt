It seems that there is a great potential that the plot of this movie is worth a look. Acting was shallow and history lacked depth. The camera work was too dependent, which had some highlights. I have to agree with the other negative comments. I only wish I had read them before buying the DVD. It's worth watching the movie for free, and you're bored with tears. There would have been much more need for action on why there are homeless people in Moscow (ie post-Soviet "capitalism", rampant drug use (ie increasing heroin business from Afghanistan), more development of reasons why Russian orthodoxy flares up again after the fall of the USSR, the archaeologists themselves or even more in the fight against nihilism.
