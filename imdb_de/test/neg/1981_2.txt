First, I will say that I will be as subjective as possible. <br /> <br /> There will be some potential spoilers, so beware. <br /> <br /> I hardly check movies, but this one I felt I had to check it out. This movie Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based on the very popular RPG (Final Fantasy VII) for PS1, has been in the works for some time. After the years of hype and the dozens of trailers (which I had never seen before, that I only saw stills), the legions of fans really got excited because they could see their favorite characters on the big screen. I played and completed the game a few times like any good fan, and as a movie freak, I was pretty excited myself. So I had thought: "WHAT CAN FALSE GO?". <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started well in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand over the course of the movie. Undoubtedly, this is the best-looking CGI animation, but that does not help a weak plot, underdeveloped characters, and excessive action scenes. <br /> <br /> Here is the story in essence. These three silver-haired offspring boys in leather, who have nothing to do with the game, are supposedly clones of Sephiroth (he's the villain of the game who allegedly murdered all alleged clones) and try to kidnap all the kids for some reason Not really explains everything , probably, to make an army (out of children?). They also focus on a kid named Denzel. I do not know who the kid is or what he wants, he just seems to be depressed all the time. So the Sephiroth clones are also involved in some kind of disease that includes a disease called geostigma, which affects only the children. This disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration. Now Cloud has to save the day from these guys. Obviously, Cloud and his teammates have learned the ability to fly. I was a bit offended that these characters were flying around in a city, fighting a dragon and landing on their feet all the time. If the movie is not so overblown, the views relax and then they can be surprised by something incredible. The real problem of this movie is logic. Now I know what you're going to say, "But it's called Final FANTASY! It should have those ideas!" Well, that's a silly way of thinking, the game is based on some kind of reality and the movie should go through that CONTEXT. The context and logic in this film is inconsistent, I could explain everything, but if I did, I would end up writing the script. <br /> <br /> Also some scenes in this film were extremely imaginative and banal. As if all characters from the game are just in time for their compulsory screen time, not to disturb the fans. They turn up, do something and have pretty little meaning in the story. <br /> <br /> If that's too long, here's the simpler review of the <br /> <br /> pros the first 20 minutes first-class CGI animation decent action scenes visually stunning <br /> <br / > the illogical behavior with yielding action / unbalanced action (leaves the viewer at its peak) faint action super human characters = no tension of the J-Rock soundtrack / score (what happened to the orchestra?) awful ending <br /> <br /> BIG TIME SPOILER- <br /> <br /> Now the end of this movie really disappointed me. They could have completed the really cool and sweet end where the cloud dies and meets Aeris in afterlife, but after the big battle at the end, the cloud is shot in the back, the kind of wound the bullet shoots through the chest , then cloud has its 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (Now I remember the life-flow in the game, but it had no resurrection features, and if that were the case, they could have brought Aeris back to life, creating a completely different story.) That brings Cloud back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have an extremely funny stamp / lifetime moment. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie does not have its moments. It is worth seeing for its visuals. but that's all. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's not really a good movie. it is exclusively for blinded fans of the game. Not for people who are interested in action, character and storytelling.
