"Quintet" is definitely not a movie that most people would find amusing or even interesting. There is no scene, dialogue, drama or action development that would trigger a spark. The icy world is one thing, but you really can not stand the confused action. Not only are the characters three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, there are no emotions, and there is no meaning in everything that goes on. There is a world that is shrouded in ice, where no one does a significant job other than playing the quintet, and the rules of the game are never suggested. The houses are not heated, even if electricity is available, but who and what does it produce? There is wood, but there are no animals except dogs, so where does the clothing come from, or shoes for that matter, since there does not seem to be any industry, and everyone is dressed as in 16th century Europe, which is in a curious contrast to This is not so futuristic pavilion backdrop. The entire film seems to be in Altman's imagination, and he has never bothered to share his ideas or vision with the audience. Desolation or hopelessness have nothing to do with the lack of attraction to this film, the world of George Lucas "THX1138" is not a brighter place and characters are no fun anymore, but history has its way. In the quintet there is no obvious or implied way, and in my opinion he does not even provoke reflection on the underlying idea, such as the similar film, John Boorman's "Zardoz". It's not even done in Altman's unique style, so it does not appeal to his fans, and I'm one of them. All in all, Robert Altman had a dream, and he woke up without telling anyone what it meant, not even for him.
