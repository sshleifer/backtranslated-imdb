OK, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader's The Exorcist: The Beginning at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films. With all the excitement around the movie, it was eagerly awaited. <br /> <br /> The director was there and so were the most stars (except Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie was great. It was a real disappointment to me because I was a big fan of both the original film of Shrader and Friedkins (RIP) of 1973. <br /> <br /> What was wrong with that? Most of it actually. The FX (you would think that the digital revolution of Matrix and LOTR never happened: it was so poorly rendered!), The editing (no real tempo or rhythm), the acting (sometimes only Skarsgard could convince). The script was an IMO that explained the African scenes in the original film. The film had the feeling of a setup scene, only he contributed nothing. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was Vittorio Storaro's movie, although I saw it better (Apocalypic Now). <BR> <br /> The whole time, I thought it was just a rough cut, a work in progress. And that's probably what it is given the (known) circumstances. This does not change the obvious problems with the script. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to meet Schrader (very briefly), but I did not have the guts to tell him what I thought about the movie and what I thought I was so nervous (that's the guy who wrote Taxi Driver for God's sake !!) that I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his Taxi Driver script ...
