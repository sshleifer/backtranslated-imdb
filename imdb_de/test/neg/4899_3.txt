It's a shame that Barry Humphrie's infamous Sir Les Patterson character made a movie debut in this cooked spy / comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of the Beatty / Hoffman stinker Ishtar (1987). Humphries should have learned from the mistakes the movie made - if you change gears in a concept, do not use spies! As with Ishtar, the first 20 minutes promise something different. It would have been great to see the anachronistic and boorish Patterson running around in the world of Australian politics. One of the characters even points out that Patterson agrees with the current time - one might think Humphires could have commented a day before the Hawke administration (I can just imagine a scene with Patterson and Hawkie in a drinking contest). But instead of a movie that might have been smart and even wanted to take a snappy look into the world, we're kidnapping Patterson as James Bond, trying to save the world from biochemical weapons that run out of half-of-the-puff. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
