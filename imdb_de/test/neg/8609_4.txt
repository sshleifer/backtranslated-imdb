I watched the world premiere on the Starz Action Channel. They call it vampires: The Turning. The story was a bit confusing. There is a voice in the introduction about a 800-year war, and I do not quite understand it. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China I do not think the film specifies this). The couple has a fight, and Meredith Monroe runs away and is kidnapped by a cycling group of vampires. The friend finds a group of vampires who do not kill people and enters a fight with the bikers. A human group of Slayers somehow gets involved, and the final battle sequence takes place during a solar eclipse. This film does not refer to vampires or vampires: Los Muertos. Confusing but decent action. Four out of ten stars.
