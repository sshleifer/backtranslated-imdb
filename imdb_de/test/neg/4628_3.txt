I had a hard time sitting through this movie. If you're not really very pro-adulterer and like to hear people talk ENDLESS about their sexual exploits, I can not understand how you can enjoy this movie. Gosh - most of the main characters behaved like ruffled weasels, and their accusations of their many unfaithfuls became boring. The only element I appreciated was the DISGUSTING scene in which one character urinated and spurted blood all over because he had an STD --- BIG SURPRISE!?! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie, check out the sequel to Barbarian Invasions. Despite the generally unlikely nature of many characters, the sequel is very realistic and realistic - it's worth your time.
