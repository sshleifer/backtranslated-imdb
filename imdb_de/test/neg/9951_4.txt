Not to be confused with the George Zucco movie "The Mad Ghoul" from 1943. "The Mad Monster" is a movie Zucco released the year before. Zucco perfects a way to turn his blind handyman Petro into a wolf-man hybrid with Wolf's Blood injections, former colleagues who mocked his experimentation in this pretty numbers-to-numbers affair. It's really a very simple act and a very cost-effective production. Glenn Strange, who plays the man / wolf here, would soon gain a greater reputation with Franky monsters in films such as "House of Frankenstein" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948). The make-up on him is rather lame, and he only manages to look like a hippie with bad teeth (like "Teenage Monster" of 1957). Moreover, the sets in this movie are rather non-existent, and the resolution is abrupt and unconvincing. I gave the film a very generous 4 stars, partly because I have a lasting love for the horror movies of the 1940s, but to be honest, most objective viewers would probably consider it a ridiculous crap, and I think that's it , It's certainly not a well-made universal affair or a masterpiece by Val Lewton, that's for sure! Nevertheless, Zucco is always fun, even with unpretentious Piffel like this. If you can save 72 minutes of your life, you could probably do worse than "The Mad Monster" (of course not too much worse!). Oh ... something else. This DVD comes from Alpha Video, and you know what that means: blurry pictures, lousy sound (actually the worst sound of an alpha video DVD I've ever met), and no extras. You were warned!
