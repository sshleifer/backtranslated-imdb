for people who have absolutely no idea what a comedy is. This includes not only the people who liked the movie, but also the people who made it. What could you possibly have thought? Madonna plays Judy Holliday? Please, she can not even play MADONNA (if there really is a Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne got paid well. He earned every penny he got, because if this did not kill his career, nothing will happen. I'm sure the few people who actually paid to see this movie felt like their bags had been selected. Madonna is apparently no longer embarrassed because she has almost no talent as an actress, but you can not be ashamed anyway. She has no connection to the rest of the cast; It seems she appeared on the set and said, "OK, I'm here, I'm going to embarrass myself if it makes the very worst Judy Holliday impression anyone has ever seen, now hold on to hell out of the way "and then went on to do just that I know that the phrase" rotten Madonna movie "is superfluous, but that certainly fits. It's painful to see a completely incompetent and talentless "actress" fooling herself, but it does not seem to bother her as she does it over and over again. This "comedy" is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to do it. This is funny.
