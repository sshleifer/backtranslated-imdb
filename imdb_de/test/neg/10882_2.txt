Of course, Raw Feed Video is smarter than all of us who have wasted our money on this movie! They will make millions from video stores and their low budgets will pay off, which will (unfortunately) finance "Rest Stop II". I guess they spent at most a few hundred thousand dollars renting the actors, renting the place, burning a truck and dragging a motorbike behind the truck. That's it. We should all be as smart as these guys, I will not knock them because they have the genius of getting a stinker into a good cash flow. The premise of the film was good, and it could have been a really appropriate horror movie, but it failed because it did not provide a clear plot. I'm always looking for a gem of emerging film companies, but I did not find it here and neither did you. I'm just sorry I wasted $ 3.99 plus tax to find out.
