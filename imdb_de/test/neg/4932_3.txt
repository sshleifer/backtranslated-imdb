I hate guns and have never killed anyone, but even if only half of the events taking place in 'Shuttle' happen to you or nearby and you find a weapon, CLOSE YOUR APPROACH. 3 TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever causes the pulse to stop and increase on you. I think even God would say, "Good call." In a very "hostel" movie, but more realistic? how could that really happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty young woman? "Shuttle" was a decent movie, albeit on the long side. A few good dampers (always calling AAA just to change a tire) are basically just a surprise, but for the most part you could see things coming. And apart from the typical "shackles" instead of the aforementioned shooting, the most annoying part was the revelation of closing from one best friend to another. To pass them, it's fun what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting women traveling home alone from Mexico (wow, that's the original), and one who has lost their luggage to keep them from leaving the airport late. And after an obvious, signed sign language, they enter a "too good to be true" halfway price. Clich√©d Jocks, which were previously introduced, set off on the shuttle to join Alan Ruck's 'Speed' stunt double. From here it's obvious what's going on (I mentioned it was a "hostel" hop), but still I did not find too much of a horror and nothing spectacular. Although it would have served the audience better with about 15 to 20 minutes clearing, I would recommend if you have nearly 2 hours to kill and find yourself in a sick horror.
