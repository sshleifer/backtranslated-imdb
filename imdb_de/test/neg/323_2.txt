Pooh. Pretty awful. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley gets a top score, but her character does not matter much. Who should be, the little boy's aunt? Another user commented on how she got naked in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie, the head and shoulders were turned. There may be some alternative versions of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, Quigley has a bigger role than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens. Carradine appears briefly in a monk's robe and recites vague dialogues. No other characters are in the scene with him, though he is somehow composed, or there are over the shoulder shots that undoubtedly belong to someone else. There's also a really bad photo of him in a cameo medallion (it looks like a bad photocopy) and a decent picture of him in a family Bible. Originally, he conjured Jack-O, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell appears briefly as a horror presenter on television. Brinke Stevens shows in the movie "The Coven", in which she walks in a robe around a cemetery. Obviously there is more Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD, the double feature "Mark of the Witch" and "The Brides Wore Blood". <br /> <br /> Jack-O: What is it about? Damn if I know. A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin demon killer, and he and other kids are afraid of a woman who for some reason is a witch. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their enchanted garage for Halloween (stick your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin killer appears several times to hold on to branches as he watches people or holds his scythe in front of the camera and poses for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand there and actually kill people. <br /> <br /> There are also some flashbacks for a western or prairie family where the little boy also plays the little boy in this family I think his ancestors. I think they are in Jack-O's backstory, but I'm not sure how. <br /> <br /> The little boy is supposed to be the main character, but we learn nothing about him, except that he wears glasses, has nightmares and will fight fights, even if he is beaten. More time would have been needed to establish his character. I would not have been less interested if he had died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, even for Halloween.
