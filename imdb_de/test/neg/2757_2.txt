That could have been so much better than it turned out. Tom Pittman performs well, and some of the older actors do a good job with what they need to work with, but it just does not work. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are far too old to play high school students, especially Howard Veit (Vince). He looks about thirty. Secondly, it is difficult to sympathize with poor Marv, especially since Betty is not so hot to start with. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The end is so weird. It looks as if the director intended to shoot Pittman's character, but there are no shots ... He just knocks on the cement where he lies down until the ambulance drivers pick him up and put him on a stretcher ( covered!). What were his injuries? A skinned knee? Stupid! Vince just shot his girlfriend without any regrets, but he just pushes Marv to the ground and falls off, though he does not make a secret of hating the boy. And to make things even worse, Marv asks the police to tell his father that he is sorry. (Duh! Hey Marv, you've just been pushed around, I think you'll have plenty of opportunities to tell your dad that you're sorry ... personally). And this writer did not receive an Oscar nomination? Skip it, unless you can see it on MST.
