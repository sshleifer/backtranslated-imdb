I have to say, I have seen worse originals of the sci-fi channel, but this nu image shonker by Yossi Wein was still quite stressful. The big problem with that is that it's just not convincing, not just the creature, but acting, writing and dramatization. The direction lacks any flair, and the script by Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner never really works, predictably, often ridiculously, while delivering fewer howlers than a few of these types of films that never offer anything to turn on or raise the pulse. The actors do their best, but with such material their craftsmanship has little effect. Matthew Reilly Burke is a mild observable hero, Meredith Morton resembles a mildly observable love interest. Actually, she was a little less convincing, but at least she was good for the eyes. At least the movie has the dignity to be involved at a reasonable pace, but the biggest benefit is that the octopus is not quite CGI. Even though it does not look good, there are at least some real scenes of characters comically dealing with rubbery tentacles. I also chuckled at the differences between the different representations of the octopus. The CGI shots of the entire creature vary throughout the movie. They differ not only in size, but also in appearance from the practical shots of scenes in which the tentacle action gives the impression that the creators have given up pretending to turn a movie over an octopus and stood up their creature only as a series of different tentacles. The scenes in which the creature attacks humans are quickly getting old, but there are some funny scenes in which other things like a boat and a crane are shot. Yes, these scenes are poor, but they made me giggle. An undeniable climax, however, is a funny sequence in which the octopus assumes a New York landmark. The scene is not much longer than a minute, but she is really inspired and worth a look at youtube. Apart from that, things are completely uninspired (a PG level of lack of flatulence or awkwardness prevents it from moving in the good times of the garbage.) The film eventually turns into a riveting disaster area, but I can not really appreciate it because the best shots of the last scenes are from the Stallone Strip Daylight (which I think is pretty good). All in all, that was pretty shabby stuff and nothing that I would really recommend to anyone except creatures that die hard. Better than a hit in the eye with a wet stick, but not much.
