The history and experience of the past few decades has shown us that intellectuals who talk about sex are something averse and unintelligible, which anyone can do, but that was not so obvious in 1986. Basically, this movie is about characters insatiable striving to find consolation, safety and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them unbearable for themselves - what they hide from more sex. This drive is linked to the "decline of the American empire," as expressed in an early interview within the film. <br /> <br /> So the idea is that relatively despicable people talk about sex and this conversation is supposed to reveal how abhorrent they are as humans. Arcand keeps giving him drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera, isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness and quickly breaking up between them to show how they are at war with each other they have the same opinion. And to honor Arcand, this is pretty much what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to delineate, even if everyone knows that standing means standing alone action is unsexy and somehow pathetic. I think this movie is much more of an aspect of its time than something meant for the long term, which somehow dates it. It's also the kind of mental buffing in dialogue and references to people like Susan Sontag who make art-house films so unpopular in populist entertainment cinemas. All in all, I take it anyway - it basically has its place among the exact characters that are the characters - it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who is not these characters. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
