Incredibly horrible mish-mash of the most notorious of all Roman emperors, who went mad and left infamous party rulers and reckless killings on his way ... I know there are several versions of it, and this is based on the 102-minute I've been watching - but I can not figure out how that can make a difference to get the rest of this movie out of the dirt! <br /> <br /> I've heard a long time about the alleged "shocking" content of sex / nudity (which honestly is not that much of here - and boring when it's there) and blood, but be careful - it does is the technical production that really shocks here: Everything just seems like a movie freak of the Junior Film School project! The camera work is hopelessly inappropriate, full of weird zooms, failed framing, and confusing pans (to and from those who usually look like a giant theater stage!) With a grainy, cheap photographic quality. Lighting and coloring are terrible and inconsistent - whether day or night? Are you inside or outside? Did you change the scenes? Who is or should be in the shot? Editing is the last sin here. Confusing snippets, continuity flaws, and random transitions that destroy any chance for impetus, story progression, and engagement, all become confusing. There may be an interesting dialogue and an equally interesting true historical story ... but these mistakes are so distracting that it is tragic. A story with so many ways to be great is just a gigantic, burnt (and fellini) -like) turkey is only good for a few devouring laughs and Peter O'Toole making a memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, that brings us to the big actors. I would like to put them all in a row and just ask: Who gave you free access to Bonk in the orgies to be there? There I wasted enough lines for one of the really worst films of all time - period! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
