Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series, directed by Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, The Return of the Swamp). Just think about it: it's the fourth chapter of a Slasher series nobody really cares about! How can that be good? It is not good! But since when do slasher movies have to be good? Cheerleader Massacre is entertaining, that's for sure. But in the entertainment area we have seen better, that's for sure! As you can see, I'm not sure where I'm in relation to this movie. Those who look only for nudity will be more than satisfied. This movie has all the breasts, but unfortunately no blood or not enough. I think I am generous with this film because I am well-versed in the film and I really enjoy watching Slasher movies, even though they are as bad as they are sometimes. If you want me to be honest, The Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best and everyone else is a waste of time, so I think I have a lot of time to lose !! Take a look at Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
