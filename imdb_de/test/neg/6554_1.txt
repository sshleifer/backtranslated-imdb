<br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious. It makes every man cry, the clich√© is thicker than 5 year old peanut butter and so it really sucks humor out of your heart. Every single joke was badly timed and would not have been funny if clocked correctly. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, there's a chance you'll never again enjoy comedy ... ever.
