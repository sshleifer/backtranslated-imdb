this film is about people living in a trailerpark. Later in the movie, it becomes obvious that these people are unemployed comedians, mostly old men. Well, more or less, they sit around the movie talking about f *** ing. but there is never anything to do, only these people are talking. At the beginning, I thought it was cool perverse redneck stuff, but after a while it got boring. I mean, how many versions can you imagine, F *** ing, D ** K & C ** t saying? sure that can be weird - for half an hour maybe not 80 minutes. but it was funny to see how these people tried to act. I'm pretty sure they often read their text on a sheet of paper when playing. but it does not bother the movie, it's so cool. because these individuals look so poor, damn they fall down so that the style suits them perfectly. Their wooden, helpless reading of the lyrics creates a pretty good atmosphere, I fell in love with the characters a little bit. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** Later in the film, the F *** ers do some comedy shows (rhymes about f *** ing) with themselves as audiences and imagined applause. then you get an eviction notice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their rooftops - armed with weapons. then they shot. Fin. sounds like action, but it is not. only a few trashy home camera takes. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> but the movie is totally consistent in style and I'm pretty sure that's exactly what the filmmaker wanted. It's the portrait of these f ** k-ups in a skinny home-camera style with characters who can not act but who seem to be interesting personalities, so they're beautiful to look at. But the lyrics about - you know - all the time gets boring after a while. <br /> <br /> The young director, who also seems to be an interesting person, having played some teenage things in popular movies / TV series But now there are more horror movies, which is more his cup of tea, I think. And this is his first directional effort now being distributed by Troma. I have no idea of ​​a publication. I got this version as "Advance Screener" from this year's Cannes, which says "For bootlegging purposes only".
