This is one of those wonderful martial arts films that start with two posses of hard gang members posing in a park; and when the deal goes awry and the battle begins, it turns out they all know karate and kung fu! The always wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, good-natured, good policeman, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners try to break up a fake ring, and when that line of action is exhausted, the story changes to something else and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, great-looking tycoon. Within the film, the budget is currently apparently low, there's helicopter action, speedboat action, car chases, a brawl in which Cynthia beat up everyone in a country western bar, some swimming pool scenes with bimbos in thongs and surprisingly good chase. About a dozen policemen are shot down. There are many changes of action that simply do not make sense. Do not worry about her. (And the counterfeiting of money is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI? I think they were too busy.) The fight choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star Richard Taylor, whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera honestly, it would have made a better movie out of it. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly, she might need it; She looks tired and bored and does her best in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she plays to a pet dog, to whom she delivers drunken drunken monologues. The dog is almost playing it out! She also wears some of the most awful pieces of clothing a leading actress ever wore in a movie: loose-fitting, baggy-leg jeans with pale, acid-infused areas above each buttock were the most shocking. The other actors are everywhere on the map. You can imagine many of the minor characters that are so busy: "Hey, me and some other people I know will be in a movie, do you want to be in? No, Dude, I'm serious!" Then there's the slumming pros: Lydie Denier, the stunning French model and veteran of Red Shoe Diaries, Baywatch, Melrose Place, and many, many other variations of the sexy French bombshell. Here she plays a psychopathic killer, as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI or an "alias" episode and not some direct garbage like this one. There is also the tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, who has been a regular contributor to The Bold and the Beautiful. John O'Leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes, is doing it here and Aharon Ipale, the seasoned Arab character actor, may have been known as THE MUMMY's "Pharaoh Seti" and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most memorable entry in their CVs. I've given this movie a better rating than it probably deserves, because my daughters, who are avid martial arts students, both see a woman kicking her ass and having the big action scenes for a change. They are still a bit too young to care for a low-quality image that it really was, and it was just fun to cheer Cynthia as she made her swinging legs with her high kicks and stick fights. If you like this kind of movie, you can probably enjoy it at this level.
