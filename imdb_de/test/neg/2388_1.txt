Four men (Jacks) go into the restaurant business with a fifth man and lose common sense. They are worse off than textile workers at the turn of the century, without simply leaving the situation. This is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I just hope that I can resell this article to someone who might like it. <br /> <br /> It is true that it attracts your attention if you can not disturb the illogical development of the plot too much. It is very stupid everywhere but especially when a stranger enters the restaurant. Who is he? Guess. <br /> <br />
