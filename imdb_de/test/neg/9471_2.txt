This movie was definitely on the boring side. The drama was decent and the movie looks good, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of soundtrack, I found it ironic that a film about the truth and not about theft decided to use a song in its titles that was a BLATANT RIPOFF of Paul Simon's "You Can Call Me Al" - except that it's not so is to admit at all. Is not there something hypocritical? The scene where the main kid was imitating a game show presenter was my favorite. 10 lines? I have to write ten lines about this movie to be recorded? What a rip-off, I do not think it's too fair to force people to FORCE to write more than they would, just to include it!
