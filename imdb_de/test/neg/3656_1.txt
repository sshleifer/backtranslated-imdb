After reading the back of the box, my first thought was that this is probably a hit on Saw 2. It seemed to me that they gave someone a cell phone with a camera and $ 10.00 and asked them to make a movie. The plot did not exist and the acting also not. It was almost like watching a silent movie about the growth of grass. It did not surprise me to find out later that the entire movie was "improvised". At the end of this "movie" I had lost the will to live and maybe I got AIDS just because I saw this cinematic crap. It was about 70 minutes during which I could have done something less painful. As if I'm jumping from a building.
