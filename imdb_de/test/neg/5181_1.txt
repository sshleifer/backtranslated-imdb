This movie is beyond Horrible AVOID OF ALL COST !! I want my hour and 20 minutes back !!! <br /> <br /> Not funny, you can watch this movie without laughing or a single smile. Vows to sprout like a waterfall from the speakers, with each one getting a little more annoying and not contributing to the comedy OR plot (general comedy - not this movie in general!), It's a lewd, $ 5, diluted "Out Cold." "- Hrzfilm - But enormously terrible. The film focuses on two groups of a city, the Poories and Richies (how obviously stupid is that?), Where the two opposites lead snowboarding matches. (The story is similar to a 4-year-old bedtime story without all the curses and stupid jokes.) <br /> <br /> MOVIE - 1/10 - because you can not give lower ratings
