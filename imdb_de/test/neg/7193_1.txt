Well, do not bother. This movie looks so tired, the drama is so old-fashioned and the plot and the characters so dull that you should study them instead of seeing them. It's really a terrible waste of film; Clich√©s, stereotypes, nonsense and amateur movies. I looked at it with incredible wonder and open mouth. How could such a movie be made, and more interesting, how could anyone find it funny or observable? Old, tired, sloppy ... preferably a junior-high sketch. There is nothing to see, except a study of very old film. Not a good movie, just ancient. This is not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. This is nonsense. Acting is so bad that it may be worthwhile just to laugh. Some movies are so bad that they are good. But this one goes around the corner and again bad.
