Why do I hate this? Let me list the possibilities: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford, but a 32-year-old woman playing a 12-year-old is just stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a fight scene where kids are throwing each other bricks and it's considered weird --- and it lasts for 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Strange how none of the children are even hurt remotely <br /> <br /> The title cards contain many racial and ethnic insults <br /> <br /> For a "family" - Film was much too violent in the fighting (it pleased Pickford to wipe it out with a little boy!) And the humor was just stupid. > <br /> Seriously, after 40 minutes I gave up and turned it off. The insults, the racism and the little children who armed each other with bricks came to me. There was no action I could see. The only thing that could be seen in this movie was William Haines, who was a leading man in the quiet times. <br /> <br /> Simply painful. Avoid.
