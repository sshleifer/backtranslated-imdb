I had some expectations for this film because 1. It was a Yash Raj production 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed catchy. 3. The star cast (??!) Was new. Well, I have to tell you that I just could not stand this movie. Uday (with his red lips - what are the make-up artists thinking of ???!) Trying to look cool but failing miserably. I will not even start his acting (if you can call it that). "Cleavage Queen" Tanisha with all her screaming and raging madness leaves you frustrated with her hair. I think Uday was a bit more bearable than her! She has to seriously take acting classes with her sister. The story is pathetic ... the old proven formula. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing worth seeing in this film. I wonder why it was done at all!
