I thought, this is an incredibly boring movie! I heard that the director can not speak French, so he let his actors say what they wanted ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is great, as usual, but I can not say the same thing about other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> They all look very tired, and this is one of the movie's actions. So they spend half of the movie in a hotel room. After a while I felt sleepy ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4 because of some very nice scenes, including the last one.
