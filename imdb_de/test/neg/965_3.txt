Sometimes Hallmark can do it right - like The 10th Kingdom - but plot many of their fantasy films, and this falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been cut (a demon [?] In the trailer and ads were not shown), but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE: <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie updates the story to the beginning of the 20th century (?) and makes Gerda and Kay ( Called here Kai - a Lexx) fan, I always expected him to say, "The dead do not solve puzzles") 18-year-old. Following is the story of Hans Christian Andersen: The boy has an ice shard in his eye, gets bad, is hanged by the Snow Queen to solve a mystery in her palace, and Gerda looks for him and finds various adventures along the way. <br /> <br /> Since the two main characters are older than the original, a lot of time is spent bringing them together and bringing them "in love". Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not enough in love to understand Gerda's search. By the time the main plot begins, the movie's tempo has slowed to a crawl. When Gerda starts her search for Kai, unfortunately, it only succeeds in accelerating the pace to a leisurely stroll. <br /> <br /> There are a few weird additions to the story that seemingly go nowhere. At the beginning of the film, the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother, but there is no explanation. A polar bear living in the Palace of the Snow Queen is more than he seems (although this may have been the case because the producers realized that the bear's feelings towards the Snow Queen would be fine in a fairy tale, but not in a modern film) , This too is never explained. Also indications that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai, are rejected, but never held. The script is also full of anachronisms that really get you out of the "fairytale" mood. <br /> <br /> The staging looks good, though there are signs of penny pinching: The Palace of the Snow Queen is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived in ice. The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai looks as bland as Gerda at first, but as soon as she sets off to find Kai, she feels warm for her. Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen, but seems to be in every other movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film is unsatisfactory. It looks good, but pulls and has no magic.
