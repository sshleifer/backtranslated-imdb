Actors Tomas Milian and Manny Perez? "Washington Heights" is a low budget drama in a Latino neighborhood in New York. <br /> <br /> A young cartoonist (Manny Perez) wants to escape his Latino neighborhood. When his father is crippled by a robbery, the young man has to lead the family bodega. The film was filmed on a budget (low-resolution video and poor audio) with unremarkable actors. <br /> The plot went well for 85 minutes, but the last 5 minutes were just awful. We do not know exactly if Perez and his girlfriend stayed together and if Angel came to prison for the filming. <br /> <br /> 4/10
