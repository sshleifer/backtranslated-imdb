I can not find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was. The initial bid was promising, but after that it was terrible in every way. Let's go over the key points. Action - good initial idea, but really terrible development. There were many points when I thought "no, nobody would do something so stupid". The end was surprisingly anti-climactic. Characterization - all characters were either completely bland or grotesque cartoons. I always try to think of one that was not - maybe the mother, but that's it. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. Direction - totally amateurish. Cinematography - doubt that they have heard of it. Camera angle / stability / zoom levels are often very bad. I'm totally amused how this movie did so well. It's the worst movie I've seen in the cinema for years, if not at all.
