Nightscream is a TV movie, so it's pretty dreadful, mostly because it's a supposed horror movie. This young girl is dogged by dreams when she arrives in a small town where a year ago a woman was murdered. She is amazed when everyone in town thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl. Citizens are amazed when they enter dreams like trance, revealing accurate details about murder and murder, because the police seem to have misunderstood everything. If they think they are in danger of being found out, the killers (there are two of them) start working out a plan to get rid of them before they come to the true truth. At this time, you probably fell asleep and why the creators of the film have set the "fog maker machine" in the dream sequences at full throttle.
