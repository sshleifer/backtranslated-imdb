I rented this movie after hearing Chris Gore say something about "five stars!" Said. show in this attack of the show. When I turned the DVD over and showed them the three levels of hell, I had to buy them. Just to see the spectacle of a mother shouting at her son to throw her other son into a burning pit. <br /> <br /> I did not expect ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I expected it to be a summary of the movie's seemingly most important highlight. Well, unfortunately, there was no such thing. The 3-step part of the death happens from the beginning, and from there it goes quite downhill. Nothing really happens in this documentation. It was pretty raw, naked and unbiased. Not bad, but there is a narrator in this. You would expect him to have opinions on this documentation, but he has none. What would have been nice, a message or a reason for this document. There was no real reason to have a narrator, there should only be text explaining some of the less obvious scenes. <br /> <br /> It does not. It does not really explain the lives of these wrestlers. It shows some moments of dramatic scenes that sound interesting, but the reality is not as great as it sounds. For example, when Mama wrestles her son for the first time in a public park with lightbulbs and thumbtacks. Instead of seeing their response to wrestling, they show how they react to the camera rather than interviewing later, or just witnessing their reactions. Legitamit documents are not. The starting material was initially weak. Nothing really profound or interesting really happens. No conclusion for some of the more interesting stories, no real point or last thought of backyard wrestling, badly edited together, and it's basically a cheap, failed rip-off of Beyond the Mat. Wrestling wise, that is pretty boring. The better bumps are at the beginning and are slowly becoming less amazing and shocking. If you've seen Japanese wrestling, indie wrestling or even backyard wrestling DVDs, it will not shock you. If you want wrestling, do not make the same mistake as me and see this. Get some CZW ECW or XPW DVDs instead. <br /> <br /> The only thing I got out of this documentation was how stupid people can be. Not to support self-mutilation or perform dangerous stunts, but to commit their causes. The backyard players seem to be stupid for wrestling. Most of them are unemployed and probably have some problems in their heads, and wrestling is a kind of therapy for them. As the supporters seem even more idiotic. Mothers basically take the whole argument "if you can not beat them" to deal with the fact that their sons basically kill themselves. School board officials support their students in their dangerous stunts because this is an alternative to joining gangs and drug abuse, which is funny because this segment took place in a rural town where similar people live 20 miles apart. People are stupid. That's what I extracted from this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the reasons and thoughts that make someone brutal in wrestling and what the back side of this DVD basically promises, you get UNSCARRED: the life of Nick Mondo. It is more amazing and interesting than the backyard and much more entertaining. Oh, and it's really good.
