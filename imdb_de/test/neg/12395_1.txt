College students (who are actually in their late 20s) on the Boston campus (which looks strange as the Isle of Man) are threatened by a ferocious monster (gathered during a Blue Peter episode). The new teacher has to save the day (though he really ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I start with the positive aspects ... there's a beautiful take on Eastend's new Gal Samantha Janus May be in the obligatory campus shower scene with her best friend Katy Lawrence. Something incidental: Katy was hired to audition with her sister, as well as moral support for her sibling, but she landed a role. Oh, joy. Picked out of the darkness to ... revive her stupid buttocks in a meaningless scene that was added to the tickle, she was killed after 30 minutes for her troubles. Her last (and only other recognized role) is as Probationary Nurse # 5 in Atonement. I wonder if she looked at Keira Knightly (when extras and stars are allowed to mix) and wondered: where did everything go wrong ?! <br /> <br /> I will give some hints. Katy: If All The other British performers are asked to speak in a condemned mass marketing attempt with American accents, and the only one who can do that is US-based B-movie veteran Todd Jensen. You know that you are in trouble. If you look at your pay slip and it's all about your lunch and your bus ride home, you're not in a movie with a trillion dollar budget. If the premiere is accompanied by numerous family members of the fourth assistant director and causes laughter when the stickyback band monster storms through the sewers, you should realize that this is not exactly an alien. Or even a Critters IV, think about it. So, Katy, in your next life (I'm a Buddhist, you understand?), You might be a bit more picky about choosing your debut feature, instead of jumping impulsively at the first pile of crap that gets in your way. The flashing of the skin in your first film does not guarantee long-term success. Unless you are Sylvester Stallone. And he had the script for Rocky to support him. <br /> <br /> In every way, this is a 0/10 movie I've ever seen. For unforeseen laughter and pure stock value, however, it receives a 1. Well done;)
