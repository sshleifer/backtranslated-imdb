From the second, the music swelled (the second of the movie) and it was a movie-threesome, I knew I had a very long ride. Terrible stereotype - (I laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended well before the end) - they did not use Louisbourg very well and the costumes and hair were kind of horrible. (My particular favorite make-up moment is that they only make Depardieu as old as I could see him by putting on a smooth hair wig instead of being wavy.) I could talk for a long time about the ridiculous inappropriateness of the music - the movie could be massively improved by a score from the 18th century. <br /> <br /> (ETA: AH, it's horrible filmmaker Patrick Doyle who is responsible for the score - say no!) He's NOT allowed to be near historic films - he should not care about the settings of the 20's The "visit to the remarkable portion of the people" was also very funny, especially his little visit to Madame Pompadour, who was not played very convincingly. <br /> <br /> I thought that the only actor who ran aground in the last century was Michael Maloney as James Murray. He absolutely stole the show for every 30 seconds he was on the screen. In a tragic way, he let you see what the movie could have been. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had some heat - the two main points were breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The Most Terrifying Scene for Historians Here they meet for a great dinner in the UK before Wolfe sails, and he raises his glass and says the first two lines of "How's the glass?" or "why soldiers why" as if it were a toast. Absolutely painful failure of historicity, much better to omit it. Thousands of people know the damned song and thousands believe in the rumor that Wolfe and Company sang it (probably drunk, not all as stuffy as this group). Batty.
