This is a really horrible movie. There are a few jokes, and the tempo is an endurance test to the right. The only funny thing about this production is the comparison with the classic movie "This Is Spinal Tap". <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if it were one of the pests of the bible itself /> <br />
