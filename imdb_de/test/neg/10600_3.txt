This film had great production values, good lighting, costumes, stage design, film and drama. But somewhere someone took the script and replaced all the dialogues by barely reading writing at the elementary school. I felt my IQ lose points when any character spoke. <br /> <br /> Did you do this on purpose? Was this just an accident of Brain Dead Studio Executives? At this point we do not know. <br /> <br /> I just know that this movie was a big mistake from start to finish. We can not even see the Squad become cops, and instead of a character development, we get what feels like a bad TV movie from the '60s. Or whenever. <br /> <br /> Find the scriptwriters, beat them with a sock full of quarters. Everyone else, good job, but next time read your scripts. <br /> <br /> 3/10
