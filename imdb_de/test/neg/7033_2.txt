This was a terribly bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was terrible, she had no charm at all from Shirley Temple. That ghastly smile she would do when she twitched her small, little eyes in a way that I think should be "sweet" and get the audience to - "aahhhh blessings!" I just wanted to beat her. She must be "oh my good god!" about a hundred times in the whole movie. She could barely utter a sentence without accompanying him with a false giggle. Horrible HORRIBLE movie .. If I could rate it minus 10, I would do that. Do not waste your money on this junk, buy a real Shirley Temple movie!
