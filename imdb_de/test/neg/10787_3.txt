I think the manuscript of this film was written on the toilet paper. No consideration for many important details that make up the movie. The names of some Serbian terrorists (whom I remember) include Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What names are these? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! What a name, I laughed for days and thought about it. Probably an implication for Karadzic and Mladic. Second, there have never been cases of terrorism committed by Serbians. A journalist like the main character should have known that. Third, the actors who play Serbian terrorists are neither Serbs nor Serbo-Croat. Besides, this movie is solid, but the story is paper thin and full of holes. Sometimes that makes no sense at all !!!
