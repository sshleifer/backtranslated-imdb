I saw this movie at Temple University. I can not imagine anyone ever seeing this movie in a theater (projected on film). The acting is similar to "Saved by the bell" (The TV Show). The plot is simple and unimaginative. The tone recorder likes the sound of wind and the DP needs a light meter. Vampires, vampires, vampires. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
