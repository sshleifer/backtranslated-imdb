"Snowball Express" by the Disney Studios is not quite as contemporary as some of their releases from that time. There are no hippies or hot rodders, it is just boring how Dean Jones inherits an orphaned hotel / ski resort from a deceased relative. When Jones and his family move to a sleepy town in Colorado, the people who direct them - looking like extras from "Deliverance" - are strangely vague about the hotel (we expect it to be a one-room shanty looks like), but actually the accommodations are very nice. Jones' teenage daughter has a sour face on her face (which does not stop one of the local yoos from smiling at her), and of course the clumsy pop Dean Jones is a regular stumblebum on the runway, leading to many Pratfalls in the mud. Maybe this one has square scenario benefited from a magical mood, because this script is frozen. * from ****
