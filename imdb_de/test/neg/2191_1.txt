I read all the other comments that made this movie a great movie. I have not seen anything of the stated quality. I found it long and boring. I tried twice to see it. The first time I fell asleep and the second time I made it within six minutes of the end and gave up. I suspect that it was mainly my fault that was received with high expectations, but I do not think that would have completely ruined the film for me. The movie was just bland. It had nothing spectacular or unique. The plot was not half bad, the action sequences were not there, the dialogue was enforced and the movie just went on forever. I would not recommend this movie.
