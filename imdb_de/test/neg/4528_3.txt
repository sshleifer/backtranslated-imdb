In another miserable attempt to make a quick deposit of one of Hollywood's greatest masterpieces of television, Peter Segal has created a monster. Taken out of context, if you did not know Brooks' work before watching, the movie would be a lame, big budget movie that's not sure if he wants to be a fat joke and stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action movie that does not work offer has continue. As a young generation of Y'er, who was recently obsessed with the five seasons of Get Smart, the 60's TV series, for two months, this movie made me painful from the moment I stepped in and saw Steve Carell the role darkened. The background stories, in which the agent 99 was plastically operated and as an analyst formerly morbidly obese, embarrassed the complexity of the original duo and painted a boring reassessment of them. It seems that the scriptwriters, who can not be genuinely funny either in dialogue or in the situation, resorted to lame settings for the famous lines of Don Adams, flashbacks to the thick camp, references to Carell's part in the office in the interview camera angles , and a female chauvinism falling flat on his face. <br /> <br /> For those who saw the original, the authors of the film thought they would include memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now a worthless tiny furry dog ​​Carell desires), the shoe phone, the cone of silence and his classic red car, and the doors and phone that introduced the show. The classical music is back, but now everything is being updated, generally for the worse. Cone of Silence is now a weird blue telekinetic force field. The control centers are located directly under a museum that preserves Control's past. The film lacks any creative random technique and is replaced by crossbows in Swiss Army Knives. A lot of "humor" in the movie is Carrel, who hurts himself, or another person who gets hurt. Be it that Carrel spent two minutes shooting himself with a crossbow or being beaten by security forces or thrown in planes. In the original, Smart would insult a great enemy, attack him without success and try to date him before he was pulverized. In this he attacks unsuccessfully and is beaten. It seems that screenwriters did not understand that humor was established through dialogue, not senseless violence. It's like taking the names out of the show and cutting out everything that made them good right from the start. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Carell's face beyond Hathaway's. The film is also afraid of anything that could make him good. They combine classical music with overdramatic action and romantic music in big budget movies. While the original has a camping feel, it replaces the quality with massive doses of CGI explosions and pow sound effects. I was looking forward to it when I finished the original series just two months ago and ranked it in my top five shows of all time. However, this was a massive disappointment. The contributors say that they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in everything I read on the Internet, they were largely excluded from the writing process. Conclusion: If you want to waste your money on a low-value deposit without regard to its namesake, you should try it. But be prepared that the ride is not what you remembered. <br /> <br /> PS: I almost forgot the humor of George Bush. They mention "Nuculor," falling asleep in fine art, President working for their vice president, appreciating approaches to solving real problems. If you hear the same jokes that you heard 3-4 years ago in the form of a big budget movie, put your money here.
