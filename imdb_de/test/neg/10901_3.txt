Young couple on the road, taking care of their own business and occasionally having sex in his car in broad daylight. But suddenly they are threatened and terrorized by a confused psychopath in an old and rusty pickup truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premise? Oh yes, now I remember, we've seen this a thousand times and about nine hundred and ninety of the other cases were way better than "Rest Stop"! This feeble and wretched new movie is offensive even to the intellect of the most unpretentious horror fanatics, as it does not have a single original twist or memorable gimmick. It's very sadistic and uncomfortable, but every Teenkill Slasher movie is sadistic and uncomfortable these days, so that's no surprise. The absolute main problem with this production is the unbelievably large number of stupid plumbing holes and meaningless negotiations. Writer / director John Shiban has realized damn well that the ultra-thin basic storyline was almost not enough to fill an entire movie, so he stops his movie like a Thanksgiving turkey with stupid and nonsensical upholstery. Nicole's friend disappears at a deserted and dirty rest area in California. The instant killing of her character would not lead to a very long movie. Therefore, she meets a motorhome family of freaks who suffer from visions (?) In which she talks to the former victims of the confused murderer and she is deeply emotional (and boring conversations with a policeman who just does not die, even though a truck him run over ... twice! The stupid negotiations are never going anywhere and they are definitely the most miserable and desperate attempts to extend the length of a movie I've ever seen, instead of the pointless upholstery Shiban would have devoted more attention to building up suspense and his main characters have to be a little more sympathetic.Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is an annoying and mindless girl, and you do not care if she will survive the ordeal.His friend Jesse and the cop are both wailing losers and their brutal death has always been not painful enough if you ask me, I counted exactly three sequences, sc torture and baseless mutilation that were bloody and exciting enough to bring a sadistic smile to my face. That's still not enough for a horror movie of today. Basically "Rest Stop" is just a lousy attempt to exploit the success of such films as "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but you should see the originals better. This was the first movie of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'. They make a name for themselves with great horror, but they have to come up with something better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe that.
