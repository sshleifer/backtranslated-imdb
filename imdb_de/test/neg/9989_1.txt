It's a rare sensation to come across a movie that is so embarrassing that you feel the urge to turn away from the screen. But if you see a posh actor like Sir John Gielgud, surrounded by naked, copulating couples, you just want to do it. Add Peter O'Toole, a syphilis-infamous emperor, Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell, who has a finger in the ass of a male victim, and you begin to understand that Caligula is only of interest to addicts of sick / shameless films infamous Roman Emperor Caligula (McDowell), a highly distressed person whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, beheadings, betrayals, killings, incestuous relationships, and lesbian sex scenes. <br /> <br Although Caligula was crazy in real life and probably succumbed to his basic instincts, the movie is still inexcusable filth. Sex in film is not used as an aspect in a multi-layered story - sex is history. After a while all nudity, butting and sucking of the nipples becomes boring due to the pure repetition. The performances are completely undisciplined, especially McDowell, who throws caution into the wind and delivers a performance that's all wild-eyed. O'Toole seems to treat the script with the contempt it deserves (surely he's just there for the money ?!). There are rumors that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's approval during post-production, but in truth there is not a single minute in Caligula that is dignified or well done. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will ever be thrown back into pornography. In that sense, Caligula is a unique experience ... on the other hand, it is so monumentally awful. Perhaps the fact that it is "unique" is a blessing in disguise.
