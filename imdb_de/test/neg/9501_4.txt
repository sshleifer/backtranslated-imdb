Underwood's stupid story about a young man (Arquette) convincing his friends to kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is ridiculously written, the direction is weird, the dialogue is wrong and confused, the actors did not do it much justice, Arquette annoys everywhere, Ian Nicholas was nonexistent, Macy was decent, but only because he was pretty good is an actor and probably only his best, in order not to come out of this project with an embarrassing performance, he was at least bearable. This is a stupid movie in my eyes, sometimes boring, not entertaining, just a movie I would not recommend to anyone. IMDb Rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
