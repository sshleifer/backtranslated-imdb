I just saw this movie yesterday. Within 30 minutes of starting, I hoped it would end. <br /> <br /> It had a promising start; The first 10 minutes The premise of this film (friendship that goes nowhere after spending days (and years) together in "separate" beds in hotel rooms) simply is not believable. He kisses her somewhere on the way and she feels Ohh, so terrible. <br /> <br /> Very little substance to arouse your interest. The spectacle just does not last. He is very passive. Regardless of how much of the film is shown, the viewer never builds any kind of nurturing connection with the characters on the screen. They learn that their next statement will be just as boring as their previous one. ("Do you have a cigarette?", He does not smoke, he wants her to quit smoking, she does not know now). She calls him in the middle of the night. She comes through after a year's absence the door in, they hug or kiss or express no emotional connection. He does not even lean forward to lift her suitcase to help her. That's not how real people behave. This is not how the best friends behave. <br /> <br /> When he gets a call in the middle of her phone At night (she's in town for a day), he shows little interest in seeing her face, and looks more like she does they burden the night. At this time they have known each other for two years and he has not seen them for a year. Not believable, not real. He supposedly wrote a book on entropy and enthalpy, but we never see him writing, reading, or discussing something of her interest in physics, not that she could handle the discussion. We learn that a watermelon in L.A. costs $ 50 (it was not the type of silicone type) that he has no problem paying for the fruit. We also learn that the airport is shut down when really fake snowflakes fall from the sky. I'm sorry, but was that also in LA? We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see how they fight, they are always on vacation. They have endless time, they have no worries. <br /> <br /> Nice life. Unreal life. Unreal characters. Bad title. Bad movie.
