This is a fair-looking show that is neither the best nor the worst. I have seen it for a long time and do not like the new stuff. This show has turned into a teen garbage and lives very differently. I do not like this crap ... I have no IQ why they have completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really nice to watch and was partly amusing. The second season is just stupid. I really do not know why the writers / directors changed this show. Many more people liked the first season better than the second and third. From now on, I will only see the first season of this series whenever I see a new episode change or change the f * ckin channel. It's going to be 3/10 because I enjoyed season one a bit, but I hated the second and third
