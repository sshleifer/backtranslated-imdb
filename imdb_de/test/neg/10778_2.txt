Yawn, that's my reaction to this movie. I was really hoping that this would have been a good modern Slasher, but that does not fall into the Slashers category. Instead, it tries to be something it is not, what a psychological thriller is, and it fails so miserably. Even the title "Freak" suggests that this could be interesting. Adjust this with the cover on the DVD and you think "OK, maybe I'll try it". Not worth the time. <br /> <br /> The story actually starts off a bit interesting with a poor, deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head and chained by his fat mother. She screams at him and probably beats him, because in one scene we see her beating him for no reason. After all, he decides that he has had enough and hits her face with a stone. Today he is in a lunatic asylum and is relocated. On his way he breaks out of the van and escapes. Also introduce the 2 main characters, a little girl and her older sister. They move and set off. So the biggest part of the movie is that they ride around in the car and talk to each other. But the bandaged "freak" is now on the loose and on the verge of raging in a grueling murder! (I'm totally sarcastic) <br /> <br /> I can not believe how boring this movie became. The budget was at the lowest level without any special effects and the dialogue just could not interest me. This is one of those movies where the packaging is better than the movie. And to compare with Halloween?! Rubbish! I'm not even a fan of the Halloween series (except the 3rd), but Halloween is far superior. At least with Halloween we have a great score and some really scary moments. So there is almost no music except here and there and there is nothing uncanny about this movie. Maybe the movie would have done better if it had a solid score, because even the worst movies are bearable with good music. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my opinion of the movie. I thought it was only half the time and money. But since the film has an IMDb rating of over 4/10, there must be people who like this movie. I do not belong to these people. 2.10
