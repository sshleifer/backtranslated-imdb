A new guard in the armored truck gig is recruited by his staff to steal 42 million from the truck. No bad guys, so nobody will get hurt, right? Of course, things go awry and the new guardian decides to have a conscience and get things right by saving the life of a dying person. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was not really interested in film, but I was not interested in Fantastic Mr Fox, and this film was my top ten of the year. Armored is even more of a disappointment than I thought. As heist film he does not deliver the goods, it is boring and full of action holes and jumps in the logic that one will hurt oneself when thinking. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie has a really good cast, but the movie does not use that to its advantage. Everyone seems to be wasted on wooden figures making stupid decisions. Columbus Short is an uninteresting track that is never charismatic and never wants to make the audience crap. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the raid and he first plays Mr. Nice Guy. When things do not move in his direction, he quickly becomes a villain. The rest of the impressive cast includes Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco of Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia of Heros. None of them does much, and if they actually do something, that's without much thought. <br /> <br /> The film is relatively short, but even with a running time of less than 90 minutes it felt leaked. How long can you shoot a movie about a guy caught somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more limited. The logical leaps in conspiracy are tragic. 42 million and all the security arrangements they have are checked in about every hour? In my understanding, the whole plan was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Act as if you are hit and burn the trucks. They would then go away with the money. Of course something goes wrong or there would not be a movie, right? Through a series of unfortunate events, a so-called hero with a wounded officer got stuck in the truck. The rest of the movie consists of Dillion and his crew knocking on the doors to get in. How very exciting. <br /> <br /> The script calls for our hero to have financial problems, he could lose his house, which causes him to lose his brother. You see, both parents have died and it is only the two who are looking for each other. Now he has a reason to join the raid. At first he did not want to go in, but his money problems are just the right impulse to throw him in the middle of things. How convenient. <br /> <br /> Armored is all about the predatory box, about an armored truck, about the guys driving it. After this basic requirement, the film falls flat on his face. I wanted it to end earlier and sooner when someone speaks. Speaking of the end, it's shit. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
