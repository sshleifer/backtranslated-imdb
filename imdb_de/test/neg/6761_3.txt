I saw this movie for the first time on a Saturday matinee when I was very young. I thought it was cool and thought about it often. Well, I finally saw it on DVD again. It was still entertaining, but in a different way. It is one of the stupidest, most fueled science fiction films of the 50s. It seemed to be filled with military stocks. The dialogue is graded and the effects are crude. There is a line of dialogue in which I was in stitches. The line that Jeff Morrow says on the beach with the baby. Rent it if you want to see a movie with drunken friends. It is a classic.
