This movie made me so mad !! Here I think that there is a new horror movie here, one with a sense of intelligence and then the movie starts. The landscape, the delivery of linen, the costumes, the wrong bubble, must I continue? There are porn movies with better dialogues. I understand the concept behind the indie films, but goodness, that was not just an indie. This was a high school book report with a camcorder and the performers are all friends and relatives. This is a movie that was doomed from the start. If it was 1982, instead of the new millennium, maybe this movie could fly. It seems to me that someone has hung a stone around the neck of this albatross and it sank at a constant speed.
