Take this movie out of its misery and burn the negatives. What do I say? The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, few would find this movie least appealing. This is what the great American majority would call too much sex and violence. It is likely to appear some days on some non-premium cable channels just to assess the shock, but after nudity (much of the violence will persist), only 45 minutes of really bad action left, with 45 left Minutes in between are commercials. There are just too many starving actors in Hollywood.
