I fully understand the historical significance of Rocketship X-M, but that does not make it a good movie. First, the plot (or whatever is there) is boring and lifeless. Five astronauts start to the moon? You are off course and land on Mars (huh?)? Cavemen-looking Martians throw stones at them? they return to earth and meet a fiery death? The end. Believe it or not, this striking storyline sounds a lot more interesting than it really is. John Emery's character, Dr. Karl Eckstrom considers it necessary to hold long speeches on everything from man's nature to the dangers of nuclear weapons. It's just an exciting minute (sarcasm intended). <br /> <br /> When I look back on Rocketship X-M nearly 60 years later, I would call the portrayal of women funny if not all were so sad and misguided. There are some examples I could cite, but there is an exchange of dialogue shortly after the launch between male chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by the irritating, plastic-haired Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only female crewmember) and the object of Floyd's often scary attention), which illustrates the film's attitude to women quite nicely: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "I was wondering how a girl like you got involved in anything like that." <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horn: "I think you mean women should just cook, sew and give birth to children." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: Is not that enough? <br /> <br /> I think Floyd should have stayed with the cavemen!
