I can not believe Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use that term very loosely) revolves around an army of rats terrorizing an urban apartment complex - at least I think that's what it was all about. The script did not make any sense at all, I could not care about the characters, and the camera work consisted of repeatedly showing silhouettes of rats standing or running on their hind legs. Running is what I should have done. As an African American, I often read requests from my brothers and sisters to "support African American films." I try to help but enough is enough. No one should take care of garbage like this for some reason. Please, brothers and sisters, do not produce directly on video rat deer like these. You're welcome!
