Bubbling just below the surface of Showtime is a good idea. Actually, it's more like two or three ideas constantly fighting for time. This movie not only has its cake and eats it, too; Here is the whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has drug-busting interrupted by the media and a brazen cop-slash actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of an insulting newsman, and the Tiff takes him to a new reality cop show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many mistakes and curiosities in the film, this injured partner is never heard again or hinted at for the rest of the movie. De Niro's best gag is his speech in a small classroom kids to open the picture of how TV cops do not behave like real cops. The funny thing is that his character and Murphys behave more and more in the course of the film as stereotypes with which they allegedly collide so much. In a smarter movie, De Niro's Diatribe could have been played as an ironic commentary; Here is just shown how lame the movie really is. While a parody of a reality-based cop show might be funny, the team of writers and director Tom Dey (who a few years ago did the far superior Shanghai Noon, instead of watching the movie) seems to be on shaky ground instead In the TV industry, they really did put them out of the market (the hardest thing they seem to say about network managers is that they play ping-pong at work). Russo's character has a touch of devilish joy in mind, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress' enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> With little on the screen to keep my attention, my mind wandered, and that's dangerous in a movie with so many storylines. For example; If Showtime (the name given to the police show) is such a popular hit, why does not anyone recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are in the job? If the investigation of the smuggler and his environment televises the man Vargas, why did not the guy tell him he's on his trail? On the other hand, perhaps I should not be surprised at the behavior of this rogue; This is the same joker who is very angry with a colleague for using his new supergun without a permit, endangering a deal, and then dispatching him as if? Of course, with about ten Superguns to level his entire house! It's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /> <br /> Showtime occasionally laughs, but it's just not enough for the movie's nearly two hours running time. Worse yet, the really smart gags suggest that this film could have really done something if they had just submitted a few more drafts of the script. Murphy drinks and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and De Niro looks bored by most of them. After a completely unnecessary fist fight between police and gangsters (which leads remarkably to no injuries and no arrest), Russo's character exclaims, "This is great TV!" Maybe it's great TV, but it's far from a great movie.
