Nothing could be more appealing than the idea of ​​a good love story with Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. The cool, sophisticated English beauty and the warm-blooded American - what could be nicer? Well, that's not the movie. Immediately they ruin it by occupying Kristin Scott Thomas as US Congressman. It's like I'm occupying Hugh Grant as a Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is just the sort of woman you can not imagine, shaking hands with dirty ex-junkies in dirty slums, or squeezing into stinking crowds and kissing babies. She would have been much better staffed than the English-born widow of an aristocratic senator who belongs to the hunting club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half live. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford as a regular policeman. Sure he's tough enough for the role. But the idea that he will love this amazing beauty of high society is hard to swallow. Why could not he have been a tough, but prosperous, blue-collar reformist politician who inherits the Senate seat from Kristin's deceased husband? The two are pretty cool at first, but for the sake of everything, Kristin is kind to him and shows her something of the rough side of life - of things her husband protected her from. Her political awakening coincides with the touching passion of a newer, more collar-friendly lover - one who values ​​her polish and sophistication far more than her aristocratic husband. This is a love story! Instead, however, you get an empty, meaningless "thriller" in which the action draws and nothing happens. Well, there's a ghetto-style scene where Harrison is nearly killed, but it's so abrupt and inexplicable that it's more of a welcome comic relief our sophisticated, beautiful Kristin always looks a bit chilled. If she wants to dream of passion, she looks more like a blanket and a cup of tea! She also looks a bit drowsy most of the time, as if she would rather sleep in bed than break Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that you can not blame her.
