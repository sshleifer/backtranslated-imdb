I found this gem on a shelf of the local video store shop with cassettes interchanged between various rental businesses. "The man who drove down Everest". Hmm ... I have never heard of it. The box reads of a Japanese who always wanted to drive down Everest and actually did. Sounds interesting. I rented it. As expected, it was documentary style. The first part can be summed up as follows: "I always wanted to drive down Mount Everest". Afterwards, some preparations are made for the event. MANY preparation material. OK, I suppose it takes a lot of preparation. Then we have a long piece about the skier, Yuichiro Miura's philosophy of life and so on. More fillers follow and I wonder where skiing fits in with this show. Further preparations are shown and they begin the journey to the mountain. More philosophy is shown. Finally they arrive at the mountain and maybe he might come skiing. Much climbing material later there is a description of the parachute device, which should slow down the speed of Miuras on the steep slope. Finally he straps on his skis and gets ready to leave. <br /> <br /> He goes off ... He's about two yards away and his skis shoot out from under him, he drops his parachute and crashes down the hill in a disgraceful bundle, and that's it. End of the story. What the hell was that? <br /> <br /> OK, I can buy that he always wanted to drive down Everest, made extensive preparations and actually tried it with a camera crew in tow. It did not work, and in the end he crashed and almost killed himself. What fearful hubris would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it Everest? Maybe the title was "The man whose feet were shot out of him and he slipped down Everest on his ass" just too long for the tape cassette.
