I have seen many movies. In fact, I love B-horror movies, they are one of my favorite genres. But this "garbage" (I refuse to acknowledge that he was honored with the film) was the worst crap I've ever had. I really signed up with IMDb because I needed a way to at least say how awful this "garbage" was. I've seen "films" (they've at least earned the honor) made by high school students in basements that are better written and directed. I only feel sorry for the poor actors in this "garbage" because they only wanted to earn a paycheck. They will have this stain on their records now and forever like a virgin who was raped and had herpes! If Writer / Director John Shiban still has any dignity, having apparently overthrown countless people to accomplish this, he should never again be near a camera and try to apply his so-called "gifts" to something that is for him better suited ... Like wiping on the floor of a peep show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
