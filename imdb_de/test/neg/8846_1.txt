Forget the lousy actors that can be forgiven in this kind of movie. Or even the dreadful, unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my subtitles did reflect what they said). Far worse is the blatant absence of a talented or experienced director who may have vacationed while filming with the editor. If you look at the film, it feels completely outdated, even though it was "only" made 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the hereafter? lol? A dial-up Internet connection? Clucky Ghost images were taken in Photoshops photos ("He, look ... is that ... a face?" Zoom on face -ops, sound breaks-"chop" -near scene), scenes and sequences are badly handled and therefore do not flow at all. They will watch as a girl hangs a corpse in a scene at the knot and then, literally 10 seconds later, sees her again in a seemingly untouched place, smiling and walking around. Apart from the many problems I have with the film in terms of production value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus extremely boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'Shutter' instead, an oriental (Thai) horror movie that is well done.
