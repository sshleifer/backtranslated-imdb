There are so many things that go wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridge's funny accent. <br /> <br /> Rita's ability to crack the password code <br /> <br /> The entire script <br /> <br /> The end - especially the last scene, in which two coffees for Jeff and Rita and the publisher are brought to the table. J & R laugh and say "We do not drink coffee anymore". Why did you order it then? You obviously did it. If not, and the waiter brought everyone a standard coffee, there would have been three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
