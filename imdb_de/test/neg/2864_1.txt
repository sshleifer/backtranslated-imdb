About a step above an Olsen's Twins movie, here's a surprise awaiting you, aside from how disgusting the bloated, humpbacked Depardieu looks on the beach without a shirt. This guy should be some kind of heartbreaker? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well, whatever. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a great actress whose career has shown great potential in recent years as a comedic and dramatic actress, but this movie definitely has not done anything to give her a breakout role. Her fleeting character has no trace of personality or self-esteem. She spends her entire vacation crushing a cute boy she considers the best guy in the world (basically because he's a cute boy), but she can not be honest with him for two seconds. Ladies, let me tell you something. If a guy really falls in love with you, he will not stamp with a scream because you've tried to spend your father as a friend. He may be a bit confused about why you are doing something so stupid, co-ordinated, and incestuous, but in the end it will only be something to laugh about together. <br /> <br /> The plot and the dialogue meet exactly the right mood for every mood. No originality and no joke ... but it's rilly, rilly SWEET and bens rilly, rilly cute, so viewers who think Titanic is the best movie ever made will, of course, say that this movie is great, because they do not realize that this is not the case have a brain in the head. A star.
