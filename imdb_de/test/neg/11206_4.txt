This could have been a really good movie if someone just knew how to finish the movie. Characters become "good" and the "bad" guys only get desserts and * boom * ... it's like they have no script anymore, and the cast has just begun to invent everything. It was so bad ... if the cast had continued the character development already developed. However, this is not the case, and the movie soon becomes a silly mess. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie for the last 30 minutes and then turning it off. Imagine, at this point, how you think the next 30 minutes will be based on what you have seen so far. Trust me in this.
