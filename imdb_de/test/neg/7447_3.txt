For most people, RoboCop 3 is the movie that is really the big shame for the Robo series. It has few fans, and most people hate PG-13's shameless commercial approach. Well, I will not say that RoboCop 3 is good. Honestly, it's pretty shitty. But as far as it's a neatly filmed and executed movie, it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos. Yes, the truth is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a masterpiece. What if RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a cartoon-like superhero in an ultra-mainstream production that kids can enjoy? At least it is open. I do not know where RoboCop 2 starts and ends, I do not know who or whom it's about, I do not understand what's going on, I do not understand what jokes are intended and which ones I'm going crazy when I try to understand the characters. I do not see anything of value in anything anyone says. I can not believe anyone looked at the script and thought it would work, and I can not believe that Irvin Kirshner saw the end result and found that he liked what he saw. Incidentally, he probably did not do that, neither Miller nor Weller or Allen. It is not difficult to understand why. Well, RoboCop 2 has its fans, I know that. Mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti-claims rules and dismiss anyone who has expected depth or themes from the first film as apprentices to Roger Ebert Sith. It's just fun, good action and great entertainment. Yeah, I guess if you just do not listen to what one of the characters says you might be fooled, we might as well have Arnold in our suit, instead of Weller. Do not get me wrong, I like a good action movie with pure entertainment value because it is only - satisfying - virtue. But RoboCop 2, sir, is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the first scenes. This horrible actor lets Robo repeat that he's just a machine and then goes into that opera speech about how he could never be a man, where Murphy's wife (OCP sued for robotic stalking) comes in out of the blue, this sad little one Wait with him, and then you will never hear about it again! I would certainly like to get into this film scene by scene, because everyone has these kinds of absurdities in them. It's like a twelve-year-old fanboy wrote the script, the characters behave randomly and say that first, then they say it. OCP wants to stop the crime with a new robo, especially with this drug called "Nuke", but it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city ?? The policy is abandoned, I think, understandable in the face of the comic-mayor. The villain (played by Tom Noonan, who made a better version in Last Action Hero and says a lot) is an addict but is still used for this machine. The woman behind it has an agenda that is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> Talking about twelve-year-olds, this movie has the notorious role of "Hub," that crazy kid who swears and kills people he plays, a kid actor. I will not be quite moral, it's a free world, and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie, do it. I do not know how much of Frank Miller's original vision was put into this matter, but the recognitions at least acknowledge him as a gift of "history." If I zoom out, I could see that this is a pretty cool character. It's certainly grim to have a crazy killer kid, but then this is the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised? This whole thing with the OCP trying to get this gigantic monopoly over everything is really dystopian and good too. The idea of ​​bringing RoboCop into contact with his wife and child and somehow embedding them in the story would also be great, and as far as I see a natural and logical move if they now have to do a RoboCop sequel. <br /> <br /> But of course these are just ideas. As many people have said, the script is 100% confused. The child has a scene (the torture scene) in which it is implied that it is really just a jumbled cliche, and then we have this unimaginable scene where he dies and becomes very soft and friendly with old tinhead. Why does not he just take his Uzi and try to knock him down with his last breath? Is not that what his character would do? Does he consider his life there on his deathbed? Not necessarily, since his last words are "it's shit," so why? It really does not make any sense, and you can say that in this movie about everyone, not everything. Is there a strike in the police? Is RoboCop machine or man? What's the deal if you turn Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes? I mean, it's pretty funny that I would not argue that. But why build it and then throw it away? And why the hell is Allen being abused so criminally? and what is it? Weller has an obvious urge to express himself with his character, and yes, the threads are numerous and the chaos is enormous. <br /> <br /> This review is just like the movie. The only reason I give an extra star there is because of the actors in the first movie. I'm sure they had good intentions with it. I mean, it's something stable, a kind of anchor in this sea of ​​bad filmmaking.
