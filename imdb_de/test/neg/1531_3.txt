Since it came from HBO and due to the IMDb rating, I saw in the first season of this series what a waste. The characters are sometimes interesting, but mostly cartoon-like. The spectacle ranges from good to mediocre talent, with a focus on the latter. Not only prisoners, but also spectators should leave at the cell door all hope that this story is credible. It is such a lot of crap that you need an unusually strong testicle strength to continue watching. The violence is, as with most developments in history, tingling and the morale that is supposed to be maxed out is of slight variety. If your idea of ​​excellent television includes the writing, acting and overall production quality of THE SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SIX FEET UNDER, you should avoid OZ. If you want to see a Disneyland for illiterate jerks, look at OZ. Such things give Edgy a bad name.
