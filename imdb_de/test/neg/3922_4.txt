Sci-Fi of the early 50s directed by Lesley Selander. Of course, special effects are very primitive, but pretty good compared to what was there back then. Double fare for drive-in films; still interesting enough to see. Two leading men, Arthur Franz, the brilliant young scientist Jim Barker and the ambitious and earthy newspaper reporter Steve Abbot (Cameron Mitchell), are on a manned flight to Mars by Carol Stafford (Virgina Huston), another scientist, and two other space travel experts (Richard Gaines and John Litel). When landing on the Red Planet, the spacemen encounter inhabitants who appear friendly and mentally advanced. In fact, the Martians are led by Ikron (Morris Ankrum), who has the idea to conquer the earth to revive their civilization. There is a beautiful Martian (Maruerite Chapman), whom Dr. Barker would like to take on the return trip. It is the redeemable element of the film.
