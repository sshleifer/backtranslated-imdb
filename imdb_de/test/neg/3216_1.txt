Some time ago I found this DVD while browsing Netflix and decided to try it with such an impressive cast. <br /> <br /> Never before have I seen a movie trying to become a new version of a great movie (Scarface) that is so spectacular. <br /> <br /> The main problem seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed "villain." His spectacular ascent and his last demise were not sad, it was a great (and the only logical end) for someone who lived like this. Damian Chapa, as a director, writer and lead actor, considers Kilo a kind of hero or at least a complicated guy. However, he does not want to do the grim work of creating a realistic, sympathetic character. He was raised by a white mother, with the exception of the six months of his childhood when his father, a gangster himself, showed his life to him. For reasons never fully explained or even mentioned, he decides to become a drug dealer and actually drives to the bad part of town, goes to two dealers and says, "Hey, I'd like to buy drugs." He drops his father's name, and in a short time they are not only rich; the two men who supply him never behave again for reasons that are explained to him again. Chapa wants you to feel bad if his character is sentenced to prison if a police informant lies about him. But why should you have sympathy for getting him into jail this time? The most obvious case in which Chapa wants to be the Good is in the execution of a white Supremacist / rapist of Gary Busey in prison. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in jail because he has to do quite a bit to get himself up, he's done and moves on. In this case, however, they must shamelessly serve to make Busey not only a rapist / pedophile but also a white suprematist. A little overkill, do not you think? I will not go into much detail in this regard, but her desperate message of "PLEASE LIKE ME! I'm a complicated gangster!" fails on every level. So try it, I did not feel bad, irresolute, or compassionate when his buddies were killed (after a shootout), and his wife is also killed (soon after she called him because of a lousy father and an escape attempt when he decided That it would be alright to drive next to a car with armed men while his wife is in the car, and his later death. <br /> <br /> Suffice to say that his acting can be summed up as quite His only achievement was to take the term "wood" to new heights, and Busey should be credited for doing his ridiculous role, as tiny Lister did well, Stacy Keach playing his role as a Prison Break, Robert Wagner driving for a paycheck Faye Dunaway is a bit dramatic, but still better than this movie deserves, Brad Dourif is in the movie for about two minutes and doing what he can To honor the movie, he makes Scarface one in a nutshell - Jennifer Tilly is now entitled "Most ridiculous attempt at Hispanic accent". (Sorry Robert Loggia.) In short, this movie had an interesting premise, but a bad story arc, disagreeable characters and hit-or-miss appearances. I would advise Mr. Chapa to relax the forced compassion next time - we do not have to like your character, we just have to be interested. Good luck next time.
