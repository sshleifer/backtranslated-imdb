Horrible Horrible movie, I still can not believe that my friend persuaded me to see it! No conspiracy, bad acting, listless scenes and very stupid dialogues. All I have to say is that this movie is the worst I've ever seen, and it's worse than Halloween III, which I also rated 0 stars. So I give 0 stars and a 0 out of 10, well here a 1, but you get the point.
