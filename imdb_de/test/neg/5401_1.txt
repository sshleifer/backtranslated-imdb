I've seen that on Sci Fi, and in retrospect I'm not sure how I actually managed to see it all the way. This is total garbage. It's not a B-movie, it's a "D-movie" at best. <br /> <br /> Basically, this grim thing on a horse (and sometimes not on a horse) looking somewhere in the Midwest breaks everything off America. A lot of people are missing (fatally murdered) and a bunch of mismatched specialist soldiers are looking for them. The best thing about this movie, I say it now, is that there are really nice girls. Let me spoil this now by telling you that all but the cutest are chopped off, cut apart, or hit so hard with a Mêlée weapon that the head explodes. This is not a spoiler ... The blood in this movie is exaggerated and really grotesque. It has no real purpose either. <br /> <br /> Here's what's good: The sets look OK, the actors sometimes seem OK, The outfits and props, some of them, are decent. <br /> <br /> Everything else you can think of is shit. Much of the error lies in the processing. Sometimes it just changes from a fast action scene to a really quiet and quiet scene. Sometimes the characters do not understand things and always part ways, but not in a way that the viewer can follow. Looks like they are separating without noticing, but they all seem to know that they are sharing and agreeing all the time, even when they are in a really dangerous situation and there are bodies and bodies everywhere People die right and left. Nothing in this film is in the least plausible, most of it is incoherent and confusing, and I do not really understand how this immortal, indestructible villain could be stopped in the end, and honestly, I do not care. Too much stupid, incredibly funny nonsense happens in this movie and I do not want to list everything here. And they're all so serious throughout the ordeal, when it's almost ridiculously bad ... just awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete waste of time. There is no excuse for watching, unless the only broadcaster you receive is Scifi and you are tied to a chair in front of the TV. If you're not bound, you'd better do a crossword puzzle, throw a Frisbee, or even think. There are many better B movies you can watch. <br /> <br /> In my senior year in high school, my friend and I in visual communication and design class made a long movie trailer deal for our own movie (There was not a whole movie, just a really long trailer) and us have turned the piece better with Premiere and cut. It was a better job than this movie. That really says something about it and I'm baffled and worried about why Sci Fi would show that when there are so many good low-rate movies they can show. <br /> <br /> The only movie I have ever had to endure was that even worse than Raptor Island (another brilliant sci-fi work) - though it was more flowing and flowing than this movie - but this comes very close and is definitely the 2nd place on my list of the worst movies I have ever seen.
