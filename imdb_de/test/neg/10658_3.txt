Two of the redeeming qualities of this film were cinemap photography and an action that was hard to resist. The script, the direction and some scenes were terrible. I have always wondered why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity underlying the film's plot, but knew that the film was filled with flaws. This movie could have been so much better and can reach a bigger audience accordingly. I think that is, with all the problems of the film, though some scenes were painfully hard to see, I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would be resolved.
