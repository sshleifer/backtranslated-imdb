I have just seen Congo on DVD. In most cases I love this kind of movies, but this one is different. I had to write my first comment on a movie on IMDb. I was amazed how such a team of experienced filmmakers came to this film. You can see that there was a lot of money for this production, but you can not make a good movie if you do not have a good script. And as a producer Frank Marshall gave us many great films to watch; He should never have tried to become another Spielberg. This shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients, but if you can not cook, stay out of the kitchen. If you can make a proposal, do not spend your money on it. If you want to see it, first watch it on TV and decide.
