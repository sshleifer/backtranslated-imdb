Michael Bassett's movie "Solomon Kane" (based on Robert E. Howard's character of the same name) is a disappointing fantasy action-adventure film that, despite a few ingenious scenes with its awkward gait, poor characterization and ... general languor. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of the army of Queen Elizabeth, who fights in Africa, where he faces face to face with the devil slayer. a demon who collects the debts of the devil, d. H. Souls? He refuses to go to hell, evades the reaper and begins a new life in an English monastery. With this new life, Solomon has left his culture of violence and bloodshed behind and instead embraces the values ​​of peace and non-value. However, as soon as he is driven out of the convent for fear of the return of Devil's Reaper, he must return to his home in Devon and make friends with a New World riding Puritan family on the way. On their journey through the British counties, the family is attacked and their daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is abducted by the army of evil sorcerer Malachi, led by the mysterious Masked Riders at the front. Now Salomon is a man of peace and must return to his past life as a man of unavoidable violence and destruction to save Meredith an exciting and long-lived medieval action-adventure film that fails in three key areas. The tempo of this movie is terrible, which has a lot to do with its incredibly short running time of just an hour and forty minutes (and most likely this is a consequence of the fact that they want to turn this movie into a trilogy). , The constant leaping between drama and self-characterization to action and muddy bloodshed kills the excitement of the action sequences. Instead of letting the audience foam on the edge of the seat with their expectant expectation, the movie feels incredibly subdued and this follows the next review, dull. Although referred to as an action-adventure movie or, in some circles, an action epic, Solomon Kane is unlikely to be. The action is secular and boring and usually ends before you can admire the beauty of beheading. Apart from Solomon himself, there is very little characterization in this film. For example, we know little and therefore, no matter, little about the young woman Soloman undertakes on his journey to the rescue. And I imagine the filmmaker will point this criticism back to the fact that there will most likely be a second film that hopefully touches on those aspects that this movie certainly misses. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie totally horrible movie, however. James Purefoy is a fantastic performer as Solomon, the mercenary who needs to decide whether or not to use his conscience or blade, and how his decisions will affect not only himself but also his surroundings. Respect, admiration, and appreciation must also go to Bassett and his crew to create vibrant locations that beautifully reflect the period in which they perform. Sometimes it's hard not to get carried away by staging the beauty of the locations, the composition of the recordings and the staging of the scene. This certainly shows that a lot of time and effort has been put into this film, but unfortunately this does not apply to the story and the characters. "Solomon Kane" certainly had the potential to be more than just an action epic. However, it seems as if the lack of depth in the story and the characters again meant that Michael Bassett just had a Dimensional look at the swordplay in the Middle Ages.
