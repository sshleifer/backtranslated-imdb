Laughing would be a good term to describe this movie. But since this movie does not deserve good, I'll use the term "God Terrible" instead. <br /> <br /> The focus is on the adventures of a bunch of eco-warriors investigating the nefarious acts of the military On a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget quickly becomes apparent. Michael Pare (a real actor, but only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster car chases. There is a vague attempt by pseudoscience to explain the presence of giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer as much as the actors. <br /> <br /> As if this did not offend the viewer enough, the film also contains what I'll call "weapons of never ending ammunition". I have never once seen Mickey Parrot or his female side kick change clips throughout the movie. Still, I can say that in every scene where they have to fire their weapon, they cover at least 40 rounds. Forty laps do not seem to be that many, but we're talking about standard handguns here. I show 15 round clip, tops. And remember, they never change clips and do not seem to carry extra ammo. <br /> <br /> It's stupid stuff that puts films in the eternal fires of Hell's Hell, and rightly so. The third-rate CGI does not help much, and acting is best laughed at, otherwise you'll start crying. Why the sci-fi channel repeatedly throws this porridge out, you can only guess. <br /> <br /> My advice ... give this a big bow ... a very big bow!
