One funny thing happened to me at the sight of "Mosquito": On the one hand the hero is deaf and dumb the director can not understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins ... um, excuse me) corpses) by his Images. On the other hand, at least the English version is very badly synchronized. So I wish I had wanted more and less dialogue at the same time! This movie is stupid (weird how this guy has access to every cemetery and mortuary in his city) and magnanimous (where would we be in a 70s exploiter without our lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how cute!) ... do not miss it. (*)
