This and the previous "Toulon's Revenge" and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two films in which the dolls were not so nice. Basically, you choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as murderers, while the next three are a series of them that are the good guys. This track resembles a cheesy TV series episode to be as good as it was in Part Three, and I've never really had the urge to try Part Five of the show. Basically, a child gets the dolls, while a strange dark lord or something challenges his evil puppets to kill. This dark lord looks like some kind of enemy from one of those Japanese live action shows like Ultraman. However, the movie is over before you know it, so it has to get credit for not giving you a very painful movie. Just too many storylines and things in it, so it can be considered as an okay movie. You see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie, even though you have a very anti-climatic battle and the movie is over before it really starts.
