Why it is none other than Ator, which is played hilariously bad by Miles O'Keefe. Surprisingly, I had the misfortune to go through this turkey before Mystery Science Theater 3000 tore it to pieces. I strongly recommend the MST3K version because it is hilarious and is one of her best episodes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is basically the typical B-movie hacker that Italian filmmakers came out of in the early to mid-80s. This movie was apparently made to exploit the Conan enthusiasm, but it fails miserably at all points. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the scenes where Ator fights a huge rubber dick and also makes a complete movie creating hang gliders during a cutout. <br /> <br /> "Thong, fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> Rating: The movie itself-1 The MST3K version: 10
