There's not much going on with Crash of the Moons. Basically, it's a few episodes of Rocky Jones, the Space Ranger was fused into a movie. It is, however, extremely outdated. Winky's treatment of vena is a good example of this. It must be remembered that it aimed to be shown to children in the fifties. In this regard, it succeeds. If you like 1950's kids sci-fi, have a look. You see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Schultz role. He does a pretty good job. All in all, I would give a 6 out of 10 points. Not great, but not bad.
