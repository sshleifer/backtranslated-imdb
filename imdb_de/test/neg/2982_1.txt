The people at ABC have forgotten to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were just wrong! The actor playing JPII was very rigid, there was no personality. It is very obvious that this film was at the end of the Programming Totem Survey. The script is awful. Conversations like, "You must follow the rules" "No, people are starving." Lame. In addition, the film jumped from event to event like crazy to fit him in the two hours. Awful! Your time would be better if you look at a PBS documentation on JPII. In addition, CBS has published a miniseries on JPII, which is far better than ABC. JPII was a wonderful man, and it bothers me to think that my grandchildren could get their hands on this ABC movie and that's the way it was!
