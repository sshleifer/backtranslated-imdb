The supposed writer and director Mr.Dhawan has copied almost the entire plot of the Hollywood blockbuster "HITCH" with Will Smith. Many scenes are the same. The plot was simply copied and slightly uncomplicated humor (probably from Mr.Dhawan's own creation) and frequent dance was added to raise the movie time to local standards. Some smiles, but it does not fit with legendary artists like them, a part of the plagiarism especially when they ask people to buy pirated copies!
