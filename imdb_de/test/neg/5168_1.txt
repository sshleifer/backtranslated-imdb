Of all the bad comments on this film and the sum, I feel the same way. It may look like the Australians are weaklings instead of brave soldiers. In this movie it was very awful and too graphic. I have not seen enough heroism, only cowardice that is ashamed, because it's none of what I've read. We do not need the end of violence to use our vivid idea of ​​what they have been through. It's like saving private Ryan, where the Nazi slowly pushes his knife into the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is an extreme director for his films, not because of violence but because of historical inaccuracy. Letters of Iwo Jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history (though I could be wrong), except for the flags of our fathers and the bridge of the River Kwai. It's better to read it, it's an insult to the victims and the fallen, if you do not say it right, and the movie lasts too long, there was nothing interesting in the dialogue and not enough retribution from the Aussies to the Japanese kill Soldiers Just read the story on the internet, in magazines and in books. Movies always kill the feeling of realization. What they did to prisoners of war in Singapore and the Philippines was terrible for the civilian population. It just makes me proud to see goodies beating, but movies like these ruin it.
