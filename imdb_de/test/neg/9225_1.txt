If there is something worse than this movie, I do not want to see it. I remember so many amazing things - a nun got out of a coffin to build a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself worshiped as god; Many shots of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should dissuade any idea that Peru is a holiday paradise. The whole thing is so terrible that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treat. This film should be bombarded and shot at again.
