The quality you'll probably remember after watching The Big Knife is how claustrophobic it is. Their tempo is sacrificed to a consistent dialogue texture. It is extremely conversational. Modern viewers will feel that every point has been made (and some), but the film will not move or do the spectators a favor and change the scenery. It is very slow. At the 45-minute mark, I was sure that I had seen two very slow hours. My beleagured answer was, "Good God, where is it going?" It feels like Odets was paid for by the word ... <br /> <br /> This is a good place to mark the decline of the drama from its peak in the 1940's through the resourceful 50's projects and 60s to notice The cinematic merit was rediscovered in the 70s and disappeared again. Here we get spectacular, conventional, emotional outbursts from Steiger, Lupino et al. and camera movements pre-arranged to meet overly-skilled blocking. This is due to the rise of the method; the unfortunate trend of sacrificing every other merit in the film to fill the actors with their most selfish desires. "Great spectacle", has killed ho-hum thoughts in movies. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance's forehead and pompadour retreat, thrusting each time he reacts to something. It is disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is terribly boring stuff.
