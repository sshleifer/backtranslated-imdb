Although I'm not a particularly religious person, I still had relatively high hopes in this film because he has the amazing Steve Carrell, and his prequel, Bruce Almighty, was actually a creative and clever Christian comedy. But Evan Almighty is in no way close to the originality and freshness that the original has and can not decide whether it is a comedy or a sentimental film about faith and family values. If she had chosen a clear path on which to focus on these subjects, she would have been able to fully exploit her potential, but the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very shallow and dry sense of humor, cheesy dialogues and motives, Trying to lend depth to the film, however, virtually offend the intelligence of the audience and also a very confused and clouded portrayal of the film's obscure message. It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was written very badly. There are many storylines and elements in the film that make absolutely no sense. For example, while a large number of exotic animals from all over the world swarm to Evan as he builds the ark for their escape from the flood, their inclusion is really necessary when the only "flood" that happens in the movie is downtown Washington DC is and a suburban neighborhood, which means that they do not run the risk of being wiped out? The filmmakers apparently lacked originality to modernize biblical history, and instead, it only took place in a present without altering the plot, and many elements could not be summed up and obviously made the idiotic motives and writing in the movie. All in all, this work is tragic in that the acting talents of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes are not shown because of the bland characters they portray, and that it was written so poorly that it influences many of the film's attempted themes and motifs a mocking about the first movie. After all, Evan Almighty is also an insult to the brilliant actors and every halfway intelligent moviegoer, both failing miserably.
