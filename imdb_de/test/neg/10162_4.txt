There were many "spooky" Westerns in the '30s and early' 40s, and although this has a strong start, it is not. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stops in a 'Halfway House' saloon, holding corpses full of corpses, the bartender's corpse lies in the bar holding a gun. He watches as he cuts through Randy behind holes in a picture player playing the piano "The most beautiful night of the year." <br /> <br /> It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang to get Ed Rogers $ 30,000. Randy is an investigator who works "alone." He wastes little time to get arrested, escape (with Ed's daughter Sally's help), and literally land in the black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. Everything is going pretty fast. Just too many chases after Randy slows down. <br /> <br /> We even get George Hayes, who gets shaved clean and plays two games - Marvin Black, the most vicious rogue, as well as the good citizen Matt the Mute who communicates via handwritten messages. It was a good idea to play him two opposing roles, but writing down messages is quickly becoming obsolete even for him, when he finally gives up on saying at the end and tells Sally, "Ah, I'm sick of these! " In the series "The Lost City" (1934) George plays a hideous, vile villain with a double crossing. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only "Lone Star" movie the title refers to or is mentioned in the movie! Sally offers Randy her hand and says, "He's not alone anymore!" Then you cut yourself in the arms while they look at a lake. Sally's farewell to Randy seems to be too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared. Too much time spent on horseback to escape the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Not so bad, considering everything, but not that great either. I would really give one and a half.
