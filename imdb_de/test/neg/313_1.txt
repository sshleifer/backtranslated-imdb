I can not believe I even wasted a NetFlix rent on this complete piece of CRAP. How long did it take to shoot this movie? 15 minutes? On a budget of what? Fifteen dollars? I can spend a few hours with my Sony camcorder and come up with something better than this treacherous bile, which is even available on DVD !? !! A very sad thing to think that classics like The Stepfather were not released on DVD, but this haze-dung makes it a format. I hope my rating of ONE ONE ONE ONE will cause the overall (already) pathetic rating of 2.5 to go down.
