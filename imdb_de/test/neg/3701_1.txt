I know a lot of people like this show and I apologize to people who think this show is fantastic, but it's the worst show ever made. I'm sure I would be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson was not there. I mean, I think it's awesome to try cars and see if a car can hit a plane. But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man :. He thinks it's cool to fool radar cameras that measure your average speed by measuring your distance and time by driving down 200 km / h and then resting for two hours. , He clearly believes that he is better than Richard Hammond and James May. He has my best friend who says pathetic things. , He screams at children just for taking a picture of him. I'm sorry, but Jeremy Clarkson is a freak.
