This was one of the most original, boring and clich√©d movies I've ever seen ... and yes, I've seen Pearl Harbor. Even Gina McKee could not work his way out of the dreadful dialogue. It has been called an art house, this can only be a euphemism for boring, terrible and frankly unsophisticated. Why is it that critics think that a film without action is called art? But more confusing, why did America love it? Without you, this movie would have stayed on the shelf where it might belong.
