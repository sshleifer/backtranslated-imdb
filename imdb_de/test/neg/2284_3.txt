It only took me once to see this dog, and I said, "Never again!" It's so deeply unbelievable that I had to read other people's reactions to it before I could remember anything else (1) it was awful, (2) Connery should have stopped while he was in front, and (3) the movie contained something to fake by counterfeiting a retinal scan by the cruelest (and awfully ineffective) means possible. <br /> <br /> Actually, I never understood why anyone preferred even Connery's Bond's best films to the movies to the worst Moore or Dalton outings. Or Lazenby, Brosnan or even David Niven. Personally, I found Octopussy and Moonraker, along with other "canonical" Bond films, far more entertaining than this, and probably for the same reasons why others reject the Moore Bond films, namely their dry humor and their willingness to indulge in the film's insincerity of the entire basic Bond milieu.
