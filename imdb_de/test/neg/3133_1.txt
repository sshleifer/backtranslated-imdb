Great. Another foreign movie that thinks it's Fellini. In addition, we must have more propaganda for the murder of the disabled. <br /> <br /> I see no reason why we need to be inundated with these skinny camouflaged euthanasia ads did not find anything redeeming about this movie. What can be redeemable in a man without the courage to continue despite some adversities? It takes no courage to commit suicide. This is the act of a coward. Sharing this "desire" with his wife just causes her the same illness he has. If this was a movie about a man's courage to go on with his problems, much like the story of Jill Kinmont, it would have made a great movie. <br /> <br /> If You're Interested Watch the movies about Jill Kinmont, the former skier who was disabled after a serious skiing accident.
