I chose this ultra-low-budget movie from the Poverty Row studio, PRC, for playing the exciting character actor Lionel Atwill, and I liked the title very much. Although Atwill often starred in these cheap films, his films always seemed much better due to his excellent acting style, as his film personality was great (his real life is also quite interesting, a kind of bizarre soap opera). The reason why I use the term "Poverty Row" is that this was a nickname given to the very cheap and worst production companies of that time. Many of them were not even real studios, but production companies that rented space and sets from the big studios at night! Yes, there is a good chance that this was filmed after normal working hours - a common thing for such studios. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Lionel Atwill telling his friends a story about something he has been working on for years. A doctor falls in love with a lady, but he is afraid to tell her about himself. That's because his job kills people on Death Row - not a glamor job! The Doc asks his friend (Atwill) for advice on how to break her, but she still does not have the man. Later, you realize that it was their own parents who were criminals. Later, a man is killed and the lady is involved, although it is clear to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved (and a little bit crazy) and the evidence against the lady was bad. But apparently the jury was full of mindless people, and she was convicted and put on death row. Even more brainless is that her old friend was the man responsible for her execution. Do not you think someone else is able to handle this case ?! Until that fateful hour, her friend (Atwill) spends much of the movie proving her innocence and proving that the fuzzy sister knows far more about the case than she is going to admit. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film is not very interesting and a bit stupid. While it can be seen and Atwill (as usual) is good, the rest of the movie never really rises above the ordinary and some of the acting is pretty shabby. It's below average and what to expect from a low budget movie, and nothing more, despite the cool title.
