Sorry, but I usually love French thrillers - eg. Chabrol - but that was a brilliant mess. The fact that it was based on a Harlan Cohen book speaks for itself, because it's not a French movie (strong in terms of psychology and character), but rather a John Grisham roller coaster ride with numbers ridiculous Plot Twists and Flashbacks Update previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned, think 'hmm, he'll be the bad guy!') And groups of mysterious, stereotypical characters who seem to dwell in different films. In the end, I laughed hysterically at the unevenness of the film (the scenes in which two main characters are supported by dodgy, dodgy characters are unintentionally funny), the extremely confusing storyline, the absurd coincidences and good luck (z the password for an e-mail Account) AND yawning uncontrollably (I thought I misunderstood the 1 hour and 50 minute runtime as it seemed to drag for 3 hours and 50 minutes).
