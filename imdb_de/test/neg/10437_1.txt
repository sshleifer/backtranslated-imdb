Have you ever read a book, then watched the movie and wondered how they messed it up? That's one of those. Huffaker's book, "Nobody likes a drunken Indian," was great and excitingly funny ... this movie is not. It seems like nobody cared about the direction, so we took care of the characters. This film, which touches on some genuine concerns about Indians, leaves you wondering why we have not seen more comedies about the Holocaust or slavery. Not well done
