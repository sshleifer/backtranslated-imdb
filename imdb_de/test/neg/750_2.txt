My first disappointing BBC / Jane Austen strip. The sound is over, the costumes are out, the hair is out, the music comes from space, and Robert Hardy, bless him. Even a part of the casting is over. No, I take that back, a good director can turn a sow ear into a silk exchange, so to speak. The performances on this show are so exaggerated and melodramatic that it is almost a farce from a Jane Austen story, which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a kind of homage to the early Gothic novel. I wanted to beat the female lead after a while. Who made the decision that she should be such a Ninny? I immediately had to watch Pride & Prejudice ('95) to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Phew!
