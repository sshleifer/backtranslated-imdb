In the 1940s, Veronica Lake, with her sultry beauty and exploited "peekaboo" hairstyle, made a fast-paced rise to becoming a movie star. She starred alongside big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March and scored screen hits in such films as "This Gun For Hire" and "I Married A Witch." She was also able to compete with female stars and even surprised her critics with her performance as a bitter Marine Nurse in "So Proudly We Hail". But the changing times and their own failures caught up with them, and by the end of the decade, their heyday was over. After having two unsuccessful marriages (and two more in the future), Veronica moved to New York City, where she occasionally appeared on television and in the summer before she was completely out of sight. It was a short message when she was found in the early sixties as a barmaid in a second-class hotel. By now her longtime alcoholism and her years of hard life had robbed her of her looks. Without her, public interest in her soon dwindled again. In various vehicles, she returned to the stage, but their success was minimal. Eventually, she moved to Miami, Florida, where she lived relatively dark. In 1966 she went to Canada for a part in an obscure movie called "Footsteps In The Snow", which had no US release. The following year, she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature. They approached her in their film "Time Is Terror" and convinced them to invest in the project. One author has put it this way: "If ever a movie queen had an end-stop, that's it." Surrounded by amateur artists and miserable output, she could not even keep to a minimum in Miami, Florida. The poor Veronica worked in long shoes quite normal and aged in horny close-ups. As a confused doctor who has come up with a successful formula for restoring youth, with carnivorous maggots !, she looks bored and confused, and her unintentionally funniest moment will come when she is forced to say goodbye while she strives to to fight back pair of rubber gloves. The side occupation is no help whatsoever, it merely promotes conspiracy by speaking to death. Director Brad Grinter apparently just wanted the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them. There was no need for something that resembled the conversation. Weekend At Bernies '' by almost 20 years.) According to Veronica herself, the film was suspended for three years as no master shots were made. In 1970, the production company scraped it together, changed the title to "Flesh Feast" and released it to use the recently released biography of Lake. And because former headwomen like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland had unexpectedly revived their career in horror movies, this travesty was promoted as a "comeback movie" by Veronica. However, this seems to be a curious approach for the filmmakers, as it is unlikely that the (young) audience either knew or cared for a horror film of this quality who was Veronica Lake. As expected, Veronica did not do anything, and she died in poverty three years later. A former reviewer cites a scene in which the detective, a nurse working under supervision in the doctor's lab, overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue, uses the help of a multi-talented chauffeur to cut open the body parts. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," she sighs, "I hope she does not mind leaving her body to science." "Do not think about it," advises the chauffeur and saws off. "I think you're right, Hans." completes the detective: "What's done is done." What a sad end to the career of a still lovingly remembered star.
