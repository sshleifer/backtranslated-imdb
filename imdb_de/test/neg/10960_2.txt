I'm not a director or writer or anything related to a movie. However, watching more than one movie a day has given me the idea of ​​what a good movie is or not. So here it is: The fast and the undead is a rip-off of the fast and the dead. I thought it might be a bit of a parody of a cool movie with many starts. But oh no, I really had a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, the movie is shit. I'm a big fan of gore movies, but this one just makes you experience a lot of gore here and there, but they're not so consistent little squirming. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of zombies, have a look. If you do not ... look for other rob zombie movies.
