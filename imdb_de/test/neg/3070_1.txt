Fragata always seems to have talent in advertising, is own work ... and that leads to seeing what he has done ... but in the end there is always a big disappointment. It's not enough to have a movie full of "hot Portuguese magazine stars" ... especially if half of them can not act ... they pretend to be funny. Here's the only good point for actor Helder Mendes ... one of the few nonstars: he struggles to make some credibility, and in such a messy film of no direction (of any kind) I give him the recognition for the effort But this Film is worth a handbook on "How to make a movie" ... and if Fragatas earlier works were where bad, then this is a "masterpiece" when reaching the title AWFUL.

It will do you good ... and if you make your family movies yourself ... and always feel bad at work ... just spend 30 minutes watching this so-called "professional" work ... Your home stuff will look like Powerful Hollywood Flicks compared to Nula variety.
