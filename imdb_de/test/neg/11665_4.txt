It turned out to be more like a movie of women-romance-soap-suspense than I hoped ... just an exciting thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were exciting, but much of the previous 75 minutes was just boring. <br /> <br /> Ruter Hauer was a bit too muffled and did not play his normal, intense character. Natasha Richardson usually has a stupid look and her character was very unattractive. <br /> <br /> The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I look, but it's certainly not something I would look at again, and the back of the VHS that describes this movie was misleading.
