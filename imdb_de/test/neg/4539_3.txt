Who sees this movie, will find that the makers threw a lot of money in this movie. It's interesting that they have titled "The Hole"! The production values ​​are good for a short film. The hole tries to have a big budget and works in a way, but is hampered by the video format it was taken on. I suspect that if this was turned to 35mm, it would look incredible and increase the content a bit. Many Hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience, regardless of story or content. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion, 3 out of 10 points for this assignment. Maybe the next movie will be delivered by Ishimoto.
