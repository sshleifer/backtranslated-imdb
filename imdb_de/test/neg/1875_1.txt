Stripes, a military training camp comedy starring Bill Murray in the lead role of Ivan Reitman, is one of my favorites. Meatballs, a summer camp with Bill Murray and Ivan Reitman, is a complete waste of time. Four writers need a considerable amount of effort to produce a movie (the word "comedy" includes a work with the aforementioned work), so funny, anemic and boring that is. Murray had apparently come to the same conclusion during the filming, but his normally reliable improvisational skills escaped him, and his distracting attempts to bring life into processes only add to the embarrassment - the scene "It does not really matter" chanting scene is agonizing. It does not help that the cast is robbed of talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then meatballs were made in 1979. ("And introduce Chris Makepeace as Rudy") announce the opening speeches. No, not Chris Makepeace?!). <br /> <br /> Reitman corrected his mistake for Stripes two years later. Murray's Shtick is so much funnier when walking around with people like John Candy, Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Leave that and look at it.
