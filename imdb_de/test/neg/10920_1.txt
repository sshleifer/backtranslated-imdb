Why, oh why, is this garbage considered a classic? I've seen higher body counts in the Simpsons episodes. Virtually nothing happens in this film, and much of the running time is filled with an almost unbearable melodrama straight from a budget soap opera. The Trenton family goes through hard times, and when Dad is away from the mother and little boy to get the car repaired. When they arrive at the ranch, they find that the watchdog has gone crazy. The rest of the movie is just the ones sitting in the car, while the intoxicating Saint Bernard circles them again and again. <br /> <br /> Regarding the child I have never seen a more annoying child in a movie my life. And obviously he is completely Aryan, because blond-haired and blue-eyed children, like the children prominently represented on boxes of children's chocolates, seem to be more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me. Everything he does is cry and moan. The same applies to mom. She gets out of the car, she gets into the car, she gets out of the car, she gets into the car. <br /> <br /> I know that was done in 1983, but I've been terminally ill with horror movies in which the characters make stupid, illogical decisions. If Mommy would use only common sense, she would be able to escape the icky dog. <br /> <br /> It is written very poorly and there is no tension. If you want to see a good "bad dog" movie, then check out John Lafia's best friend. It's funny, resourceful, has a better dog, a taller body and an appealing story. Let this garbage lie.
