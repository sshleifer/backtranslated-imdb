After 30 minutes ... fast forward, cleared from my recorder. The first Critters movie was self-confidently fun. The "conversation" between the critters, just before Granny blows her away from the veranda. This movie is slow and waiting for someone to shoot him and bring him out of his misery. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that anyone who has worked on this turkey is proud of it. <br /> <br /> One was fun, four were just terrible. Do not bother, even if the alternative reruns of a TBS sees "700 Club" donations. They will get at least some good laughs there (and the "alien" make-up is more credible ... grin).
