Due to the fact that it was made in 1979, this film could be cut through a bit. So much is said, he is really pretty grim. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the ridiculous rear projection or the awesome camera tracking supposed objects during the flight, it's the stunts being pulled off the Concorde and you'll blink in disbelief at the absurdity. Barrel swirls, loops and violent "evasive maneuvers" made me wonder why the world's air forces not only fly Concordes as their main fighters. <br /> <br /> So here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese festival: <br /> <br /> 1. The Concorde is at least as agile as a Phantom 4 fighter jet. <br /> <br /> 2. You can fire a flare gun in Mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking out the arm. <br /> <br /> 3. If the flare gun does not discharge, do not drop it. Otherwise it may go out. <br /> <br /> 4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at it. <br /> <br /> 5. A flame deflects a heat-seeking rocket every time. <br /> <br /> 6. Shutting down your engines is a safe way to throw heat-seeking rockets off the track when 5 (above) fails. <br /> <br /> 7. In a crash landing in the Concorde, it seems impossible to drop your fuel before. <br /> <br /> 8. Concorde pilots are all combat-trained veterans. <br /> <br /> As you might imagine, this movie is not very realistic. The effects are primitive by today's standards and, together with the nonsensical acrobatics the Concorde performs, make a movie that deserves little contempt. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
