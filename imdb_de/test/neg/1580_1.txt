I've seen this movie a while ago, and the only thing I can remember is how incredibly awful it's definitely in my top 5 worst films I've ever seen. My reputation has been torn to pieces in the video store, because this movie will ever trust me again. I doubt it, they say something should not be judged by the cover when they saw the cover. Furs / Gang Boys I thought, Wow, that looks great, as there were a lot of skinheads on the front cover, torn open with metal bars were. I can not watch this movie History is bad, it's just bad.
