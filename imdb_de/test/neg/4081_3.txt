Evan Almighty continues Bruce Allm√§chtig's mainstream program, this time with Newman, who will be Buffett's Newman Congressman, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell). God (Morgan Freeman) is a perfectly harmless (and not even self-doubting) man and decides to impose some sort of search on Baxter to illustrate the importance of ... mutual friendliness so that Baxter can change the world "(aka Pay Forward). <br /> <br /> Imagine Evan Almighty as a healthy derivative of "Distinguished Gentlemen." Baxter is not a scammer, but his colleague, Congressman Long (John Goodman), wants his undisputed support a law bill that is essentially harmful to the environment, and the well-meaning Baxter, who understands the importance of networking and visibility, is ready to assist. <br /> <br /> In addition, the new job brings with it more responsibilities, and Baxter is in some ways vilified for not spending enough time with his family. <br /> <br /> So God decides to give instructions to Evan Baxter by forcing him to become the modern Noah. His orders: to build an ark. While it may be a little humorous to see Baxter's transformation into a "weirdo with beard-o", there does not seem to be much sense of the whole thing, which becomes much clearer as the film's climax seethes. (SPOILERS: If none of the population were killed by the Flood, what was the point at which the animals were summoned ... or at least those who obviously did not come from a suburb of Virginia, or Baxter, if anything find out that Long's projects had stalled in their quality, so why did he have to build an ark?). Although such a comedy does not have to be a hysteric laugh, so it is. It was certainly one that was far less enjoyable as it filled with too many homilies (and not all by Morgan Freeman) and an action was meant for a movie with epic events.
