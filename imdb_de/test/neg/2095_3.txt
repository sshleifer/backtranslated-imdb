Snakes on a Train (2006, Dir. The Mallachi Brothers) A zombie curse is placed on a woman who causes her to have living snakes. Brujo, who takes care of her, tries to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several confrontations on the train Brujo's collection succeeds in separating from its owner and going hunting. While all this happens, ordinary, everyday passengers relax. What they are unaware of is that something fatal is approaching them and that they are not. In an airplane I had to check that. I knew that it would be a rip off and that the movie would look cheap, but what I found was the worst to look at. The whole curse plan was stupid and should never have been taken. The special effects are not that bad, but they do not look too good. I had no idea about the end. It was stupid to see and pathetic. The acting was absolutely terrible and looked bad. They just could not act to save their lives. If you want a great laugh, look at this, otherwise you should really avoid it. <br /> <br /> "We have a runaway train, I repeat." - Conductor (Stephen A. F. Day)
