Let me first say that in the past I was a big Carlin fan. I think George is one of the smartest people and best comedians in the world. What made George so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way and to give us his unique perspective on these things. it should not always be funny, but one always respected his views because they were so well presented. but you are all sick, just a long word. He does not give us a unique perspective on anything, he just gives us a long list of things he's in right now. There is no insight, no wisdom, just an old man who complains for an hour about things that we all complained about. and it was not funny at all. They are all ill, appealing to stupid people who can handle nothing more advanced than something simple and direct. i do not mind, mad comedy, but george could have done so much better. I really hope that George Carlin's next show will do justice to the quality that George has shown in the past.
