The combination of Dan Haggerty (elves) and Linda Blair (exorcist) is enough to inspire every horror fanatic for this film. And once you see the cover image of a frozen zombie coming out of its cryochamber, you'll think you're horror heaven in the B-movie. At least that's how I approached this movie. But boy, did I have a shock? <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I also love B-movies. Nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little movie about zombies, monsters, killers and the like. But to say that this film was missing is an understatement. This movie was garbage. You'd think the zombies look like the cover of the box, but instead you get actors with masks that are clearly sold on every Halloween counter sale. In addition, the script is beyond pity. Our main character, Joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks comfort in the warm-hearted Maria Blair plays. Not once do you see a sign of sadness or discomfort from Joseph's character. Instead, we see the chief of cryolabors, a man named Dr. Miller, who wants to get the bodies and experiment with their organs. There are no emotions or anything that you think you should care about in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointing. All the elements for a great horror movie were there. You had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and little or no directional feeling has screwed this royally. Overall, 4 out of 10 points
