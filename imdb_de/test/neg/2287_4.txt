This is more than just an adaptation of Bond: It's a rip-off! With mediocre character sketches that Ian Fleming did not approve of, this movie is described as the worst 007 movie. An older (also sunken) Connery tries to relive his past 12 years later. The result is a humorless, sticky version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore every day!
