The Midnight Hour Alias ​​Alias: Do not tell me lies (as seen in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. One is Merritt as a movie, complete with one storyline (without holes), one good story and credible inference, and the other is through the strip of skin it tries to be. This is certainly nothing more than a B-movie skinsuit whose sole purpose is to show every girl in the movie at least once in an overly long sex scene. If you try to rate this as a normal movie, then this is the bottom line. HUGE plotting holes ruin the plot she promises. For example, if an employee is killed, would you call the police or go home and go to the hot tub? If one judges this film after its skin content, it can hardly be seen. The girls are for the most part all beautiful, but obviously improved. However, the sex scenes were all long and over the top, and that just made the quality a bit boring. Amber Smith could be a decent actress if she wanted. She was not as terrible as you could imagine or next to the rest of the cast, she seemed to be much better than she was. Zoe Anderson, who played Detective Arraya, should not even watch a movie, much less in one. She looked good, so we know why she was there. Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone. Even if you are looking for a good skin film, there are much better ones. I rate that with 4 out of 10 points
