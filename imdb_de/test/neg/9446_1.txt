I never comment on a movie, but I have to say that this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I think it was done by a novice film student so as not to stifle talented film students, but that was terrible! I did not buy the lead actress and felt like she was in acting class while she was in the movie. Her decisions were very safe and I feel like she was imitating other actresses in movies, not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. The end may be a little more meaningful if someone tells the events and not a song. I love Patsy Cline, but she is often heard in movies. Maybe the song selection could have been a bit more original. The song "crazy" was such a clich√©. As I said, I never comment on films and have seen my share of good and evil, but that was the worst. We are sorry.
