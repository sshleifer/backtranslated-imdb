Insulting both poker and cinema, this film manages to make the most dynamic, brilliant and intriguing character in poker history boring. Still a funny movie that you can joke about, from the lame gangster clich√©s of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of the second hour. Hilarious, Stu Ungar wins all three titles in his World Series without playing a single hand on the screen. His notorious dealer abuse? 1 scene. His coke habit? 1 scene. His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They could not get real poker players. What did you cover? Many angle shots from a house in the suburbs. Oh, and a montage of Stu waking up every day buying meat that does not make sense. Why am I so interested in this little Sopranos summer camp trying to exploit the poker craze? I think there is still a great movie about Stu Ungar waiting for someone willing to get it right.
