I saw the first few episodes some time ago and felt like I could not take it anymore. The horrible-looking battle scenes are the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. About one third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and his "mighty" fighting moves. I know that fighting choreographies from that time do not meet today's standards, but that's ridiculous. They do not even try to make it look realistic. Flash Gordon, who hardly resembles a fighter, with his drunken slow moves and his bare fist four or five men with knives, rifles and other weapons. Give me a break! There is also a scene in which he plays a similar role in the water. Basically every episode has similar scenes. For the rest of the episode, I can not remember anything else. Basically, out of curiosity, I saw what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.
