This is hardly comparable to the space adventures of his time. They are Star Wars and Star Trek. And although I am not a fan of Star Trek, I realize that this film has faded compared to the Trekkies series. In fact, I would place Back to the Future in a better light in terms of space and travel. <br /> <br /> The story is about a boy who is captured by space robbers (pirates). In an obviously false and incorruptible fight, the prisoner befriends the pirates and even helps them. Gradually, these Raiders die. In the end, the boy can return home and the last remaining pirates can escape badly wounded. <br /> <br /> The acting was not great. What is really obvious, however, is the total lack of interesting dialogues, effects and actions. How they had even 80 minutes of it is incomprehensible to me. <br /> <br /> If you want to throw a shot at it because it needs space, just keep going. But be warned. "D"
