This is one of their more competent wastes for their recognition, and that's because there's a considerable amount of thrill, and it's interesting to tear down "Snakes on a Plane". But if there are more examples of the inconsistency behind Asylum's latest rip-off, it's the two characters who are illegal immigrants who can not understand or speak English with a Texas man who sneaks across the border Train and a friend meet you for a perfect english. <br /> <br /> Aside from being a pretty poor portrayal of a Hollywood formula, "Snakes on a Train" is absolutely boring. At least with "Snakes on a Plane" we had the chance to see actors funny and to be interesting from afar. The Mallachi Brothers series includes some of the most boring characters I've ever seen, from an electrical engineer (I wonder how it will come in handy later), to some stoner surfers, to our two main characters trying to fight from the snake curse lurking in the wife of the husband. <br /> <br /> "Snakes" is never entertaining, and even if it's very bloody, it's still not as good as it has the chance, because "snakes" could have been a fun short film and takes Instead, just get too serious, and never untangle him. Instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent, they are forcing their small budget to work against them in these shootings. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be tempted, the train seems incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It almost seems like a stage play with these contradictory and hideous bits and pieces desperately trying to look like real wagons. Every now and then it wobbles, the background of the windows is blurry and the sound effects are interrupted now and then, to tell us that they are actually on a train. Not to mention that in such a large, extended train only about ten passengers are traveling. In addition to the draft and a long sex scene, we are forced to face a conspiracy that makes no sense. And not even the directors can avoid the fact that the "deadly" snakes that appear on this turn look far from poisonous or dangerous elements. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie just waits about a minute of queuing and a bad subplot of a former drug trying to bother a passenger. All this boring show ends with a truly ridiculous climax, when a poorly computerized snake (I've seen better animations on Super Nintendo) completely swallowed the move and then abandoned a method that should have been practiced from the start , Asylum scores again. <br /> <br /> Asylum once again scores with a fraudulent, lazy, terribly tedious and boring rip-off of another better movie. "Snakes on a Train" is way too serious, so it's never entertaining or memorable.
