This is a great movie for ninja going out for the first time. If you're trying to impress a sweet little Ninjette, I'd definitely recommend this masterpiece. It's one of those special films that you can use to miss large parts of it without affecting the plot. <br /> <br /> I wondered where a Teal Ninja can hide. Are ninjas so color-coded? Is that normal? If I was attacked by one of those yellow or orange ninjas, I would die laughing before I would kill his sword. <br /> <br /> And I finished my Black Star Ninja test pretty well the other day. I found that there were many questions on how to sneak around and look evil. It's all about the eyebrows and the posture. Basically, the film could have been better if: 1. There were no color-coded ninjas (or the color-coded ninjas could combine into a super ninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to avenge him. 3. Various monkeys were scattered in the file 4. Patricia did not speak and Patricia was replaced by another figure 6. The Frenchman was also a black star ninja 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were added as "Comic Relief 8". Ninja starches came from Miticlorians.
