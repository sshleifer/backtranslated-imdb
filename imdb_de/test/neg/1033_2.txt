I love documentaries. The Andy Goldsworthy Doc was great. I was looking forward to this - but was very disappointed. I knew about Kahn and was fascinated by the idea of ​​his lonely death in a men's room at Penn Station. There must be a story here, I falsely believed. The only story is about sadly deceived women who had relationships with an ugly little famous married man. Without anything like an explanation for this man's terrible behavior, we get endlessly repeated snippets of Kahn's walking and painful long - supposedly contemplative - shots of his soulless buildings. Actually, some of the buildings are interesting, but the thrust The movie challenges us to think about the guy himself. The revised soundtrack points to an emotional trait that is completely missing in the film. Kahn's apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or martyrs of his mistresses. This film seems to want to give Kahn the free passport of the great artist and to make the director and his mother sympathetic characters - I do not buy it.
