D.O.A. is a non-thrilling thriller by directors Rocky Morton and Annabel <br /> <br /> Yankel. Acting is okay and the script is pretty bad. This movie also has some moments that will make you laugh, how stupid the scenes of violence are. For example, someone is shot near a window. We then see from the outside <br /> <br /> the building what looks like the person jumped. I laughed as this happened. This movie tries everything, but ultimately fails. Just watch this movie <br /> <br /> if you have no choice. <br /> <br /> My review: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> <br /> Rating reasons: violence and language. * <br /> <br /> * Due to the age no rating reason was available.
