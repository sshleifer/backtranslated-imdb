This must be the worst thriller I have seen in a long time. The directing, the acting and the adaptation of the story make a potentially meaningful conspiracy a senseless waste of time. Within a few minutes of watching the movie, it was easy to figure out the entire storyline, and there are a lot of obvious clues if you leave no secret behind. I guessed that in the first few minutes and hoped again and again that I was wrong. To my dismay, I was not. The film begins with two FBI agents driving to a remote city to investigate a murderer Spree, who left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a police officer. They are interviewed separately under surveillance cameras and each tell their report on the day. Everyone has something to hide and the day unfolds when he tells his accounts. This part is probably the salvation, and if it was developed, this film could have been done better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The whole story ends with the FBI agents being the real killers, and the young girl is the only one who has thought and they have been uninjured by them. <br /> <br /> Why go through the whole charade to question three witnesses and team up with the young girl if her idea was to kill her at all? How did you end up pretending to be an FBI agent (when you realize that real FBI agents have been killed and their badges found on them)? How did you know how to set up and use surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are not convincing from start to finish. Maybe the idea is to eventually develop their characters for the revelation. Come on, both look ridiculous, stupid and not scary. The character of the young girl is also a wasted potential. There is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to connect with her ordeal. It does not seem desperate, but distanced, which in turn is not explained. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie as a whole.
