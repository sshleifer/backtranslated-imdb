For football fans everywhere - stay away from this movie. It was great! Lame acting, Lame Script, Lame Soccer and no directing! I rented this movie during my stay in Asia and was appalled that it was considered one of the better films from Singapore. It was just nonsensical and thoroughly boring. There are thousands of exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about exaggerated and stereotyped Singaporeans?
