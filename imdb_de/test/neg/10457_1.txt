If you're like me and occasionally like watching horrible movies (I think it's a bit slower in a car accident), you can not do better! The plot is crazy, the special effects are hilarious and the drama is one of the worst you'll ever see! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the "actors" can sleep at night! It's painful yet hysterically funny and I highly recommend it to those who want to punish themselves for something. If you can see this crap without flinching, you are a better man than I will ever be! I wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he (and his money) would get into!
