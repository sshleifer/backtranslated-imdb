During my childhood, I saw and enjoyed the first three Critters films. They were fun and entertaining horror comedies perfect for adventurous horror lovers. I've never seen "Critters 4", so I finally decided to do it. Conclusion: a memorable and pretty bad movie with a remarkably low body count. The script of Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©d, the plot rips off "Alien" and "Star Wars" and the sets seem boring and sombre The sound of the movie seems deadly serious so it slows down and gets boring. "Critters 4" was apparently so low that the filmmakers could not afford optical effects; those who were taken from "Android" seem seriously dated.4 of 10.A to avoid.
