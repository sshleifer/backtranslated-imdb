As a cartoon, the Spytroops movie was pretty bad. It's only 44 minutes long, but there are several battles that culminate with the destruction of COBRA headquarters. A downer was the beginning of the film. An animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie was a kind of battle simulation. That was just right, and the rest of the movie lost credibility. Then there was the issue of Shipwreck tied up with his parrot and thrown into a room where nobody had looked for several days. What happened to surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> The COBRA base had only a handful of characters and the rest were BAT robots. Apart from many corridors, the COBRA base did not seem to have weapons, tanks, trucks or other equipment. Then there was the stupid idea that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. The plot was silly, even if it was meant for small children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls and even Barney The Dinosaur pay more attention to their actions. The characters were not bad except that I could never understand what Destro said, and the Cobra Commander was stupid and not much of a villain. Apart from Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were funny and barely impressive. The GI Joe characters were pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites here. Shipwreck and Beach Head were the worst. Shipwreck was written as a jerk and Beach Head sounded like a surfer guy from the 1990s. I guess the writer, Larry Hama, was trying to make a character who spoke to teenagers, but he was a decade off the mark. I only heard Beach Heads Spicoli Surfer Talk (Fast Times at Ridgemont High). I wondered if the new GI Joes would smoke a dube before the big mission The Cobra Commander had a jerky spastic gait, and the vehicles did not look very realistic at all. The flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. Old animations would have been much better. Since Hasbro claims to be cheap, they got what they paid for. I had problems seeing the whole thing, it was just boring and there was a lack of soul or GI Joe spirit. Even the old commercials of GI Joe would have been better. In fact, the DVD included extras like four or five recent commercials for GI Joe Spy Troops, and those commercials were far more entertaining than the movie. The commercials had more fun and spirit for kids. The ad was lively while the movie was boring.
