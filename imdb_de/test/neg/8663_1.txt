I agree with some of you that this movie was rather boring and boring. I found the main character and the following actors / actresses who came in the scenes uncomfortable. The camera work itself was not enjoyable. Random shots and shaky film scenes annoyed me a lot and I turned off the movie. I will take the time to look at the adaptation of 1999 and hope that it fits nicely with sense and sensuality. Emma; Become Jane and pride and prejudice. I have only a few others besides these films, but I think they were finished with good taste. The music was somehow out of place with the movie and reminded me of another show I had seen this year. It was called Hex and a show by BBC. I found it on the internet one evening. I liked the first season rather, but the second season was dry and pulled things from the air that should stay with the clouds. I found the male lead character that Henry was out of place in this movie. Maybe I just do not like his way of speaking or his size. Well, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless it mutes it and looks at the fashion of the era or the way the houses were held back then. I'll look again at the 1999 version and hope it's a better one and Jane Austen gives her writing some justice.
