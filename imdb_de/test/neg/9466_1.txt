My friends and I have seen this so many times that I lost the count. This is worth seeing for those in the right mood, which means that this is not so much a good horror movie as a movie that is on fire for its witty quotes and bad effects. This movie is best viewed with other like-minded people, so you make someone laugh. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh as Greg bounces around in the lab, caressing his bunny while his hump goes off to his right, lying on his back. "Greg, stop clowning!" Brandon. They are called J.G. laugh. Patterson gives hand signals to steer Greg to the other side of the operating table while his hand is in the shot. And you'll probably giggle when you realize that the last woman has none of the qualities he used to construct her.
