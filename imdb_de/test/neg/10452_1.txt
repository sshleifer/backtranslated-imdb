Sci-Fi channel thinks this is sci-fi; it's a shame. Big bugs, snakes, mythical beasties, over and over. <br /> <br /> Someone from Universal had the mind to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good) and Firefly in their series for a brief moment. I know they know that they make a difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, they were busy with how they were all high and mighty and producing productions that were not just for us mere Lame-o-Trekkies. Thank you, sci-fi! You know, you make movies so bad that even trekkies do not see them, so you've reached your goal! Fire Serpent, Ice Spiders, Manticore, Larva, etc., and later a huge, relentless Miststorm, and they are still faster than the newest flu virus! How they do that is beyond my knowledge. Why they do it, I just do not know. I do not know how to ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and emails, but it's clear that they do not care much about their audience or take care of our opinions! They seem to think that this is what science fiction fans want! One might think that one or two good productions with a sense of purpose would slip through when the green lights of this garbage are on vacation. At least they use the collection of Misfit Toys; Many of the science fiction films of the week have been actors in science fiction shows and now need the money. I love you people and hope you get better work!
