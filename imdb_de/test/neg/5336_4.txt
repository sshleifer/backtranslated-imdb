Before "Miracle in 34th Street," Maureen O'Hara and John Payne made this, this, this movie. I wanted to describe it but could not find any words about how bad this movie got. Adopting a child and Maureen's disease is both a serious and a delicate matter, but still it could have been done much better than it was. It was so extreme in his portrayal that it did not look real at all. Probably the problem started with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a screenwriter who takes a novel and writes a weak film. (See my review of "A Stranger in My Arms.") The beautiful O'Hara was often saddled with such clunkers, another was the Forbidden Road (Britannica Mews), which I may review again. <br /> <br /> If you're emotionally involved from childhood, you'll be kinder to this rather lifeless, colorless and duller movie. But maybe you could find the TV movie remake for something like that. It has to be better. It must be.
