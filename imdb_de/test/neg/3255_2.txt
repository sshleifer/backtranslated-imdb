This movie is shit. It is terrible. If anyone liked it, these people should have their heads examined there. Jackie Mason's character sounds like a delay. The guy trying to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked. Although Chevy Chase was in this movie, he was not funny. This movie had gross and listless jokes and had no Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Although Jackie Mason's character has the personality of Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason's character sucks. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He should have returned! I do not care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should have come back too. The original caddy's hack was Murray's career. If he was funny in the first part, he might have been funny in the second part. <br /> <br /> Final Comment: I recommend this movie for ... NO !!! This movie sucked !!!! It sucked, it sucks now, and it will always suck !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
