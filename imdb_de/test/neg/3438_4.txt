!!!! MILD SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of THE TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, I do not think Arnie's action / adventure films have much to offer. They are certainly better than his comedies, but that hardly says much. The problem I have with all his action blockbusters is that they are exaggerated and have no morality. <br /> <br /> Morale? In my review of TERMINATOR 2, I mentioned the scene in which the good guy Terminator blows up the kneecaps of the SWAT team. Shall we think that the hero in some way admires the people who do their job instead of killing them? This is ERASER's problem when James Cann's character is revealed as a traitor within the US Marshals Division. Arnie's character John Kruger escapes with a witness he protects, but in some later sequences, Kruger kills a fairly large number of marshals working with the villain. Suppose it was all traitors too? Surely many of them were honest men who wanted to stop Kruger because the villain told them Kruger was the traitor? It is a rather restless thought that Kruger killed several people trying to keep the law alive. Despite the cost of one hundred million dollars, the special effects are not that impressive. Look at the scene where Kruger lets go of the nozzle wing and puts on a parachute. It's obvious that the action between the players is a stuntman doing the freefall sequence while Arnie is in front of a blue screen in a studio. ERASER is also a movie that has unnecessary CGI with killer alligators, not just superfluous CGI, but also unconvincing CGI. There are also a few storylines, as in the opening scene, involving a handful of witnesses whom the mob overtook. Kruger opens a trunk, pulls out a few corpses and lights a fire, which throws the amount of smell. Next, you see Kruger rearranging the dental records of the couple he's rescued on the computer. It would be logical to do so, but would all couples' dental records be kept on the computer? Most importantly, we expect the US Marshal Division to have a full-body freezer ready for such events. <br /> <br /> So you go, a typical Arnie thriller that waits a long time for unlikely pieces and lacks intelligence. It is interesting to know that ERASER did not make a big profit at the box office because the production costs are the potential Audience figures almost outweighed. After ERASER, Arnie did not do much at the box office, except for TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. This was an event film, and it's interesting to see if he's remembered as a politician, not as a movie star
