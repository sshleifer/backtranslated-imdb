RKO tried to reinforce the starlet JOAN FONTAINE when she cast her as a flying nurse, strong enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) overcome the responsibilities of this little programmer. TCM turned it into a stepping stone into Joan Fontaine's career. Fontaine is serious and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is all right as a love interest. However, it is obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the looks and cheeky manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared the highest reckoning with Fontaine. What happened to this handsome actor? Why did not RKO advertise it with Fontaine? He showed skill as a light comedian. These thoughts flowed through my mind when I saw this rather lukewarm drama that never quite lived up to its title's strong promise. The story itself is rather tiresome and is occasionally brought to life by Fontaine's temperamental heroine. <br /> <br /> She photographs pretty like the nurse and skilfully carries her serious expression date. Beal has never made an excellent career and his performance here shows why. Strictly dull. But what happened to Philip Huston? Evidence here is that he should have had a rewarding film career. <br /> <br /> Note: Watch Dwight Frye (from "Dracula") as a runaway patient aboard the plane.
