Imagine that: a high school. Except the boarding school, and the children have no parents. Oh, and it's in Malibu. And the kids are all skinny, white and beautiful, with the extraordinary minority or the fat kid playing the "weird" outsider. And there are no sensible rules, such as For example, living together, nuclear weapons in dormitories, coffee stations, a sushi bar and a free laptop per student. <br /> <br /> Here's the story: A Girl Zoey Brooks visits PCA, a former boys' school. Absolutely perfect in every way, she is smart, pretty, skinny, athletic, creative and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost all the boys in the school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. She is the one to whom everyone seeks advice, the one who saves the day with a simple plan, and is just wonderful. Too bad she does not like all that. <br /> <br /> Should we believe that we are bad people if we do not even match Zoey's perfection? Nothing in the show is their fault, and if anyone contradicts it, they are portrayed as the bad guy (Logan). He may be a jerk, but at least he has a sort of brain that thinks for himself instead of having to come to terms with the princess every time. <br /> <br /> Her loyal group of blind followers is: Chase, the average fool's ass who falls in love with her, Michael, the black guy (and the only decent actor on set), Lola, a wannabe actress and an anorexic, snobby airhead, Quinn, the smart but unsuspecting girl when it comes to teenage toys and Logan, the rich idiot who has a soft side. Yes, this show essentially spits out stereotypes. <br /> <br /> But what really matters to me is that they all pretend to be normal kids. They complain that Logan is getting too much money while they have to work, even though they are already in too-good boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can not afford. They drink coffee and regularly eat sushi, have little homework and tan almost every day. Wow, they have a hard time! Any other problems? I am too beautiful, rich and stress free! I think Zoey 101 (what's the 101 for anyway?) Is Nick's attempt to portray teens realistically. As well as catching a glimpse of reality, not liking it, and choosing to give the kids a life like the ass in The Hills. <br /> <br /> But hey, at least the set is pretty.
