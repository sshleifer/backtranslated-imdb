I've had more boring 80 minutes in my life, but I can not think of any. Hell Ride is based on the 1970s retro cult that Tarantino brought with him in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride, unlike PF and RD, is the garbage and character development. From how many films does Bishop think he can steal her? The briefcase in Pulp Fiction, the air rifle in No Country, etc., etc. Speaking of Bishop, what the hell is he doing in this movie? I had to laugh about those scenes in which he is familiar with his pelvis and desperately tries to look like a hardened biker. Nothing in this movie is believable. And why Dennis Hopper? Did you really need the Easy Rider motif? I blame Larry Bishop for his terrible plan and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt to take the lead role. Do not look at this movie, it's a waste of time.
