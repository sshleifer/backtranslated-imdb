Now I love Italian horror movies. The cheesier they are, the better. However, this is not a cheesy Italian. This is a week old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs. It is amateur lesson on every level. There's no suspense, no horror, with a few drops of blood to remind you that you're actually watching a horror movie. With the "special effects," the lights always turn red when the ghost (or whatever it should be) is nearby, and a string that pulls sheets up and down. Oooh, can you feel the shivers? The DVD quality is that of a VHS transfer (which actually more than hurts the movie). The synchronization is even below the lowest standards for "bad Italian movies" and I gave it a star just because the dialogue is so funny! And what do we discover when she finally looks in the attic (in a scene that is one minute during the day and the next in the evening) ... well, I will not spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let's just say that it is not very "novel"!
