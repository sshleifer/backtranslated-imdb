This movie had a very unique effect on me: It made me realize that this movie is REALLY annoying! It's disguised as a "thinker movie" in terms of memento and other jewels, but in the end, and even after a few minutes, you'll find that this is nothing short of pretentious cr4p. Probably written by a collage student with friends to say pity that his writing is shit. The whole idea is? I do not even know if it's been trying to scratch the supernatural, or they want us to believe that someone is filling your head (a very weak, by the way, with stupid "puzzles"), as you learn in elementary school. You suddenly come to the "only truth" about everything, then you have to kill and confess someone? !!! What? How, why, why? Is it just like saying that you have to bake a cake, just add a few ingredients and add water. forgot to cook it? I guess those guys forgot not to explain, but why is that? You must do this if you present a story in which ordinary, everyday acts (riddles that solve riddles) have an abnormal effect on people. The acting was terrible, the girl always tried to look cute in the camera, and the guy from Highlanders, the show, behaved like the heavy metal record store (yes, they're all real, even though it's sob) , The "menacing" atmosphere with the "oh-so-smart" puzzles (join Batman's and Robin's 60's series with The Riddle's guest appearance) and the insane ones who claim to have "the knowledge" behind that grin on their face ?? just awful, terrible. <br /> <br /> I tend to be very dissatisfied with low budget films and tend to be interested in the outsider by praising them more than they might deserve instead of their constraints, you know However, this is just an ugly excuse for a movie in which you want to be good for an hour and a half, and in the end, you'll only complain that you fell for it.
