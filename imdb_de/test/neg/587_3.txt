Wow, do you know the shocking things they use in hospitals to get your heart back on track? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost four hours to watch, because I had to take a break and occasionally bring my brain back to a semi-normal state. I mean, this movie is soooo slow, it's ridiculous to say that the script would have about 10 pages of dialogue, would be generous. They just do not talk !! And while talking is not everything, and I admit that there were some scenes in which only the music was necessary, and the music is great, that was probably the best part, but then you listen to a symphony or forget about it the movie. So many people give these great reviews, and for their time I would say that the special effects and the filmography are pretty good, but when it comes to acting or its lack, it just needs a little more, no shoot-ups or sex etc it is not even an obscenity required, but a little more emotion these men were like stones that sat there only with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm down, just play the movie. Do not start at the beginning, if you've seen it before. Just start somewhere, lie down and relax.
