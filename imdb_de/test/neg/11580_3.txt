A team of amateur journalists and tree hunters are experiencing the wind of a secret government project, Project Carnivore, on a remote South Pacific island. The scientists there produce huge corn, but the genes spread out in other ways and produce unusually large Komodo dragons and a cobra (one that is bullet-proof and floats under water). Can you escape the island with the help of the scientist's daughter and tell the world? Even if I had not seen this movie on the sci-fi channel (which I unfortunately did), he would scream "sci-fi channel" with its low production value, faint drama and some of the worst special effects in the story. The effects here are similar to another creature movie, "Raptor Island," though not nearly as bad. I would guess that there are at least a handful of people who worked on both films, but I did not bother to confirm that and probably will not. It will be a sad day when I watch both films again. <br /> <br /> Which does not mean that it is not fun. I saw it at two in the morning with my sister's friend and can not speak for him, but I thought it was a pretty good time. How bad the whole thing is, it's a funny image when you make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to wear the movie (I think the name of the actress is Michelle Borth). Michael Pare also appears as a ship's captain, and his poor role choice makes his work on "Furnace" actually look respectable (even if the film is unbearably bad). <br /> <br /> I can not be tough on this movie, simply because it was more or less exactly what I thought. Bad effects? Low budget Nameless actors I had no higher hopes. But that does not mean that it's great. To be equitable is not something to be proud of and it will slowly move to the remote storage department. For the one fan who likes this movie (and calls it "KvC"), you should stick to your copy because you're going to fucking get a replacement.
