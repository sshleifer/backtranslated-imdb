I've watched all the episodes of the Star Trek TV series several times since the 1960s, with most of them being pretty good to great and very few mediocre. My opinion is that this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> I think it's so badly done that it's embarrassing for the series. It's not that the story is so bad, though it's by no means exceptional, but the acting is just miserable for the two main characters, which in this case means other than the regular ones. Barbara Anderson gives her weakest performance of all time as the daughter of a mass murderer and is on a kind of mission. She practically calls the role from a phone and shows no real emotional ability. Although she has been used mostly as a pretty face in most of her film / TV roles, mostly in small roles, she has done a lot better. Arnold Moss as her father gives the term a new meaning. Ham 'and is the only actor ever to play in a Star Trek episode of the 1960s that beat William Shatner in the area and makes Shatner look great by comparison. And he can play a Shakespearean actor who gives him more impetus to exaggerate, and he does. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that these two tracks are so weak, the story is such that everyone with every sense has something to say Everywhere in the first 15 minutes one can say who the killer is. I say that because I told my brother the entire conspiracy that ended in the first commercial break when we saw the original 1966 broadcast as Pre-Teens. His answer was yes, you're right. <br /> <br /> Skip this one and watch the much superior Menagerie episodes that were originally aired on television.
