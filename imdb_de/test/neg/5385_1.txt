I recently attended a free soap girls show where the filmmakers were present. Before the film, they trudged around, laughing, taking pictures. I was excited to see her in real life and could not wait to see the movie on the big screen. During the film, the audience burst out laughing. It was clear then that they were not laughing with the picture, but with the picture. This is a pure B-level movie without logic. Throw some nudity, some blood and whale! You have a movie! <br /> <br /> After the film, I approached a bunch of filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this movie. They were all as serious as if they were serious filmmakers. Everyone told me something different: a controversial movie, a funny movie, a uplifting movie, a socially responsible movie. everyone mentioned something different. It was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making, and now they were trying to win their money by publishing this movie so people could see it. > I want to warn you: Do not buy in the hype! Unless you're serious about doing nothing else, it might be worth a movie student's time to study how a movie should not be made. Otherwise, you better save two hours of your life.
