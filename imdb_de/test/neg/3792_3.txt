This is a movie with an excellent concept for a story that has been distracted, but a large number of clich√©d subplots, trite and unrealistic character traits and performances, and some openly implausible (and very random and, not to mention the storyline) points to bring the story to an unstoppable end). <br /> <br /> The absence of anything that marks the main character as truly gay, except for some random hints to Crow Bar or that he is gay, was disturbing. It would not hurt to actually show him anything, even if only a friend would make a drink. <br /> <br /> It is worth to try it and has its advantages. There are not many, not even a few years after the release of the film, in the kind of films that have both a gay lead and a significant gay plotline, and which also refers to African American. It's worth trying. I would not look too hard for it and I would not waste my time looking for her. This is a rental and not a premium rental.
