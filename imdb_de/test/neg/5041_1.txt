There is only one way to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> so bad that it is weird. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that I laughed my whole ass. The male lead in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous that you think he would try to copy a toy action figure. I know that sounds ridiculous, but if you see it for yourself, you can not help but agree. <BR /> <br /> The monster looks like a CGI guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old Sinbad movies. In short, this movie is good for just one thing, a really big laugh about how bad it is to get movies. <br /> <br /> If you want bad acting bad script and special effects go wrong. <br /> <br /> This is the movie for you
