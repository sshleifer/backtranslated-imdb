What the hell was that? I'll admit there were some scenes that caught my eye, such as the 23 Bullshit, where the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 everywhere, but that was pretty much the movie in the nutshell ?! For loud screaming, this was an exciting movie and calling it a psychological thriller, I would have expected it to have at least a catastrophic effect on the mind, but what did we get instead? We've just gotten some shit like an animal in mid-life crisis and on its way to salvation. A bit like an old man, if you ask me. I should probably have rented Wild Hogs, it would not have made a difference. I mean, who we kidnap, they should have made someone else a murderer of this girl. By confronting Sparrow with the protagonist of this book, Number 23, they gave the film to the viewers, implying that he was the killer all the time. How would that have shaken our heads? Shame on all those voters who have decided to show some generosity towards this miserable work that you describe as the film and the praise to most of the critics who have joined in my reaction.
