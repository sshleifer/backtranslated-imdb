This starts with the corporate loans that inform us about World International Network. I knew I had seen this loan before, but I could not remember where he was, but I knew it was the beginning of a really bad movie I had seen. I thought seriously about changing channels on the other channels, this is one of the problems of being an IMDB reviewer. What the hell i thought, it does not really matter if WANTED is good or bad, because I can still check it for this website. <br /> <br /> As I expected, WANTED was not so good. It's an act that I've seen so many times (too often) before I caught a fugitive on the run, a bit like the series THE INCREDIBLE HULK, without tearing the shirt. Jimmy crosses the mob in a completely new way, escapes and works in a completely new way at a Catholic Reform School. Did you notice a frequently used description in the last sentence? "Well thought out" is the answer. Let me repeat for the hard thought that this is a completely fictional film in which everything depends on chance. Another problem I had was the church-run reform school. She is too sympathetic and accommodating. I think this kind of facility makes Alcatraz look like a country club. The chief priest looks like the spitting image of Donald Rumsfeld, you can feel that a lot of sugar coating is going on. To be honest, despite the ridiculous plots of action though it's a terribly good one. I've never really had the urge to turn it off, no matter how mature it was, which is a complete compliment to the movie
