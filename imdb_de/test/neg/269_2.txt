When comparing Oceans Twelve with the 2001 Oceans Eleven, did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same? <br /> <br /> - All stars returned for twelve and Zeta-Jones was added. <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same producers; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same production designer; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same music director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same movie editor. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed things when things changed when the Oceans franchise was founded? <br /> <br /> - Twelve's budget was $ 25 million (30%) higher; <br /> <br /> - Elf received great reviews, but Twelve received extensive panning; <br /> <br /> - Eleven made $ 450 million, but Twelve dropped to $ 362 million; <br /> <br /> - Domestic box office for Twelve dropped 32%; <br /> <br /> - Soderbergh collaborated with another screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Movies are of course a director medium. I nearly forgot that.
