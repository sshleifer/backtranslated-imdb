Hmph. Soul Plane is supposed to be a "black comedy" parody of a well-known movie "Airplane". This movie is black comedy in the worst case. Clich√©s can be funny and often. But in this picture it is disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs and all the monstrosities that connect people today with the "urban" culture. <br /> <br /> Tom Arnold's appearance in this film is the saving grace of this film, if he ever had one. DL Hughley should never have accepted the script. Kevin Hart is a bad lead character here ... his appearance in this movie is likely to be annoying for many. Method Man and Snoop's appearance were by far the worst. <br /> <br /> I'm just happy I did not pay for this movie ...
