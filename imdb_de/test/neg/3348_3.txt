A guy named Karl Rhamarevich learns by telekinesis how he can live on after death. He is buried in a mausoleum. That same night, Julie (Meg Tilly) has to spend the night there to join a group called The Sisters. And Karl's "power" is in full bloom. <br /> <br /> Silly movie. I saw it in a theater when I was 21 years old, and it was generally boring. The PG rating should have scared me off - this is a horror movie for kids. A REAL stupid scene in the end has a corpse breaking through concrete to meet a young man! For starters, corpses are placed in HEAD, which makes it impossible for the corpse to use his arms and no one can break concrete. If you notice such stupid mistakes, the movie does not do its job. <br /> <br /> He has two good scenes - two of "The Sisters" are "attacked" by floating corpses where they are. One day one of the sisters beats a corpse in the stomach - her hand goes into the body and she can not pull it out! This scene has stayed with me ever since. And there is a sweet little bit with a corpse and a toothbrush at the end (which made my audience laugh). But the rest of the movie is a cloudy, boring reminder. Only for children - adults will be bored. I give a 3.
