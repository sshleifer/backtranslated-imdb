This is one of the films that killed the "spaghetti" from the West. It not only loses something in translation, it is also a totally messy mess when editing. Either parts of it were published for an English version. In any case, it makes little or no sense, point. The movies "Trinity" and Eastwood "Man With No Name" look like John Ford / John Wayne. Nothing in this movie is original. Somewhere there is a beginning, a middle and (finally) an end. Except for the end, not everything is exactly in that order. Robert Wood seems sympathetic enough. The rest of the cast, especially the women, should have made better career decisions.
