This is probably the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Independent or not, sound writing is a must. Ditto for directing and acting. I know these actors can act (I've seen them in Sporanos and more ...), but this movie is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's the script, maybe the director. Probably a bit of both ..... Probably a lot of both! Technically OK, just bad, bad, bad ... I have a theory that the supporters of this movie also own the poker magazines because I've seen a very positive rating in one of the magazines. "Hey, we did it, so it must be good, right?" Not so fast Bucky. I know that it takes a lot of hard work and money to even make a movie, let alone sell and distribute, and I recommend these people. But the end product leaves a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> P.S. I won a free rental and selected this movie from Blockbuster. Tomorrow I will get my money back.
