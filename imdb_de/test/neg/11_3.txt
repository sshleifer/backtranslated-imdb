Julie Andrews satirically spurs on her own Goody Two Shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy drama, but when she bravely approaches her role, she's alone. Blake Edwards's film about a woman serving as an entertainer and a German spy in a music hall during the First World War does not know what tone she should aim for. Musicals were no longer popular since 1970, and elephantine productions such as "Star!" This film really tarnished Andrews' reputation and left so much dead space in their catalog until "The Tamarind Seed" came. I've always thought Julie Andrews had made a great villain or a dodgy lady; Her strong voice could really attract attention, and she hits some deep notes that can be either imposing or seductive. Husband / director Edwards seems to realize that, but neither he nor Julie can muster much energy in this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards and neither one has his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews just a fabulous sequence - a striptease. * 1/2 of ****
