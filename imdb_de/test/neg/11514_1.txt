This movie is 3 stories about 3 individuals. One of the worst movies that are available and even better if it is not available. <br /> <br /> The Good: 2 pretty lesbian actress 1 true and touching story about Theresa Chan <br /> <br /> The Bad: The main story that revolves around the blind and lovely Mrs. Theresa Chan, does not have to be told in a film format and rather in a documentation format. No connection between the 3 storylines. Minimum DIALOG in the movie, replaced by SMS and CHAT programs on the PC. No cultural insights from the movie and it lets you forget before you step out of the cinema.
