Let me make that clear ... "The Church" has a security mechanism to keep the spirits from leaving. LOFL! Maybe I miss the plot. Maybe this guy came from Ed Wood Film School or something. This movie is as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe that's the point. The whole baby esq segment of Rosemary was cheerful. I can go to my Halloween costume shop and draw better. The entire movie has to be recreated. Right. There were so many things that were downplayed ... so many things that made me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling. I'm not sure if the mistake is writing or editing, but what I've seen should not be that high.
