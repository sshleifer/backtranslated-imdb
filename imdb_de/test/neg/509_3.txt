I've looked at the 219-minute version and have to say it's dollar for dollar, it's probably one of the worst movies ever. Now, I'm NOT saying it's the worst movie of all time - but considering the cost that an average person would like, this would be a very, very bad movie. I would say that the most important factor that makes this movie a bad movie is the author / director Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much blame a single person. If he had not been so self-indulgent, you could easily have done a movie that was just as bad in about 90 minutes - and save the studio millions! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a completely unnecessary prologue to be set at Harvard. The scene is HUGE but completely without context. You have no idea what exactly is going on, and you also do not know why the students (especially John Hurt) behave so rudely. It's hard for me to imagine a start in 1870 and it looks like 1970. This is half an hour when you have no idea what's going on, who the characters are, or what motivations they have , <br /> <br /> The next scene is 20 years later. The two Harvard graduates (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are inexplicably in Wyoming. So they went to the best school in America and now one is just a lawyer in the middle of nowhere and the other is ... well, what is John Hurt in the movie?!?! He only appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (the prologue) or a pathetic and meaningless drunk hanging around with murderers - even though he is obviously against them! His whole character made no sense. They never explained why he was a Brit who lived in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he was going with the hired army, a thing he did not believe in at all. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and better-defined character made his character more credible, and although he wanted to move to Wyoming AND risk his life for a prostitute, it made no sense at all. <br /> from the sky gate. While the scenes are far too long and had to be trimmed, the worst part of the movie was that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor who has nothing to do with the movie), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there, but you have no idea why. Unlike Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold - quite the clich√©) and maybe Christopher Walken - everyone is totally one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie where you do not know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is also anachronistic. Who would have thought that a huge roller conveyor was built in 1890 in the middle? I am sure that it would have been very, very difficult to get the basic services in this region in the west - and yet it is assumed that trains that are covered with roller skates and wood, instead of FOOD arrive. Perhaps the peasants could afford to buy groceries if they had not spent a lot of money building and going to the skating rink, and avoided the war of depopulated cattle !!! And what about the man on roller skates with the violin? What did that have to do with a land war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem you still have is that it's a movie that happens very, very little, until the big battle starts late in the movie. There are many scenes of filth and flat nothingness. So much nothing, that at the time of the fight many spectators left the film or are now so hostile that it is inevitable that nothing could save the film. <br /> <br /> As for the last fight, it was done pretty well, but had problems. First, this little battle in the prairie took longer than the invasion of D-Day !! Second, while details of the actual events of the so-called "Johnson County War" are a bit sketchy, we know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson were never really there, as both were hung up before the battle. Third, I can not believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the movie - especially during the last battle. While I'm not a bloody heart in animal rights, his need to use animal inspiration and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in film history. Seeing and knowing that some of the horses have died to reach Cimino's "vision" for the film is very sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. Although blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume he's finally using some of that Harvard training for himself. We also see a woman who seems to be one Kris has viewed a few times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the end result is. I read it myself and found out that the film often misunderstood the facts. <br /> <br /> All in all, the statement was that the film was long and needed much more editing than saying that World War II was a "small Tiff". Well, I've certainly seen much worse, but considering the cost of production, I really think it may be one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a movie has it This explicit nudity I warn parents. However, since NO child could go through this movie (even if he promises sex), the warning is not required.
