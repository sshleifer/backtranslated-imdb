The whole exercise is pointless. Why do the movie at all? The lighting is scary, but the sound is just a joke. Like a high school production. Anyone putting together the budget for this film should be pulled and quartered to allow it to be made without the right budget for soundmen with equipment suitable for recording the lack of proximity to the microphone. In every other area, economics should have been done. The entire production is lifeless and only LAME with such an amateurish, half-barren production. There is a lack of warmth, clarity and design.
