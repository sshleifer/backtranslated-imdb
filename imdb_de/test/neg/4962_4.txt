I am a German student, so apologize for any mistakes (I am working on it;)) <br /> <br /> The platinum action of the drama, which is very interesting and accentuated with effective sound effects, does not in any way detract from the horrible bad actor (insincere and unnatural movements and expressions of feelings) and thus makes the relatively strange and pointless story less good. Only the typical Slasher genre with in this case very strange action. Many plays destroy part of the main story and let the observer until the end in the dark, create craziness and divine the senses of actions and the point only misty. Sure it's a hit for Slasher fans, but not for me. But although the interesting style of cinematography and the use of light are good, it is good. <br /> <br /> So not the best ...
