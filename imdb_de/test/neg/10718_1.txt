I would give this a zero if they had this rating. Fun was not fun at all. After ten minutes, I got tired of the movie, but kept to the end and thought he needed to get better - he did not. The others with whom I saw this movie also agreed. The acting was annoying. I'm tired of Jim Carey's exaggerated ham. The side occupation was not better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker that is trodden when a big company goes down, the vehicle would have been a better way. Actually, I did not like the main characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny, but pathetic. I'm trying to remember a scene where I or someone I was with has laughed and can not. A worthless movie and a total waste of time.
