This TVM seems to have polarized the opinions of the commentators on this page, so maybe I can sort it all out by saying that this is a very stupid, not very well made TV movie. How bad is it ? It's a television game that can not even decide what its name is, because while it's called LINDA in America, it's known in the UK as LUST FOR MURDER and usually a bad sign when a movie needs to change its name. And can I also point out that it is not a parody, as someone else has claimed? I'll be honest and say the plot is pretty solid. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple named Jeffries, with whom they get along very well. They get along so well together that they go on vacation together (decide if a woman is being traded) and Paul sees his wife kill the Jeffries. After that the action takes a shock turn. <br /> <br /> In writing the above paragraph, I suddenly realized the great potential of the story and will not say anything to keep you from the premise. It's just that as the story continues after the events I've described, things are becoming increasingly unlikely and bizarre. Not only that, but the production values ​​are pretty unimpressive when the actor plays Paul Cowley, who makes a very wooden voice that irritates, while most of the scenes - outside and inside - look as if they were filmed on a foggy day
