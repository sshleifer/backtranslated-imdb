Ken Burns "Baseball" is a decent documentary that is a clear source of the game, a great depiction of the early years of baseball and its heroes. There's a plethora of possibilities for every baseball fan in this movie ... That said, the movie has several blatant flaws. <br /> <br /> 18 hours are just too long for the human attention span. It is clear that Burns has stretched his film after his "nine inning" concept. It's barely 18 hours ... the tempo in each segment is slow, almost grumpy ... the music is always nostalgic and wistful. Is baseball not exciting and funny at all? Why is every player and his achievements portrayed as a tragedy? Talk head-to-head, turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, hunt baseball as a metaphor, baseball as Americana, baseball psychology and theology ... enough! This is a syrupy, mawkischer drip. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he sold us before. Ken Burns uses the national anthem as the theme song of the series and can often play "Take Me Out To The Ball Game" that you have to throw up. We understand it, buddy. <br /> <br /> Sure, Burns is a faux-liberal neo-Hollywood, so he probably spends a third of the movie in the Negro leagues ... these segments are not spent on chastising the whites of yesterday be open-minded like Kenny today. To shame! He blames baseball because he was separated in the 1930s and 1940s, but he does not realize that America was separate at the time! Burns falls head over heels in with Buck O'Neil, a former Negro League player, and slobbers over any material in which the older O'Neil becomes poetic about his playing days. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Burns would have been better advised with an adult to help him edit his creation. "Baseball" ends up as mushy, bubbly, as Americana camouflaged civil rights propaganda. It's clear that Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise he would know that we see games laugh and cheer, do not cry and recite soliloquies ... listen, Mr. Burns? There is no crying in baseball.
