What is night vision Well, according to the star (Williamson) let's see ... a parcel business owner says to him, "It's getting dark outside," to which he replies that "it's better ..." "night vision." What the hell does that mean? What should this film actually say? It has plotting holes through which you could drive the van of the killer. Not to mention a police officer on duty, Robert Forster strolled through this bizarre attempt to redeem the serial killer madness, and a murderer who films his murders. That's actually everything I remember. <br /> <br /> The film was in Texas, had a few chases and a clich√©. If you look at this movie with your eyes closed, could it be good? After all, without being able to see it, it would be better for the night vision. Did that make sense? Nope. And not this movie either.
