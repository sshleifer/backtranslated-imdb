A version made for Heart of Darkness television seemed to be a good way to give the book more insight. Well, that was the wrong assumption. The movie made it worse. I was very disappointed with almost everything in the movie. I hoped that the film might help to put together the parts of the book that I did not understand, but something like that. It still confused me and lay down. It's one of those movies that makes you feel like it's more fun to see the grass growing than watch the movie. Not for everyone. It was an altogether horrible, boring and slow movie. At first, Nicolas Roeg had to be pretty desperate when he decided that he wanted to take on the task of making the boring book into a movie anyway. It is a guaranteed loss. It's like a knife fight, but forget the knife on the kitchen counter. The knifeless man will lose; and in the case was the Knifeless Roeg. Everything I've heard about the movie is bad stuff, and the movie deserves to say that bad thing about it. When I saw the movie, I got the impression that the people who made the film just flew over the book to learn the key points. <br /> <br /> Besides, although the movie followed the main story of the book, some details were left out and also the end changed. I'm not a fan of it. Roeg stopped when Marlow and his crew spotted the Russian sailor camp. There they found the book. It also did not show up when they came across a sign in the camp saying, "Wood for you, hurry up, walk carefully" (Conrad 110). In addition, Kurtz dies at the end of the book on the boat, not at the inner station. On the contrary, Nicolas Roeg has done a good thing while making his film; He managed to win some pretty decent actors for the film. For example, he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich, who later had a successful career. He added something to the horrible movie. Even if I tear his book to pieces, I have respect for him, because it takes a lot of courage to take over The Heart of Darkness. It's not the simplest novel you can portray in a movie. Although a brave effort! In conclusion, if for some reason somebody really wants to see this movie, I suggest reading Heart of Darkness first. This will give you all the scenes that were excluded from the movie, and you will not be completely lost when watching the movie. But I really suggest that you do not read the book and really do not see the movie. Both will be a complete waste of time. Trust me. I was forced by my English teacher to do both, and now I wish the book and the movie did not exist. If either the book or the movie is tracked, good luck!
