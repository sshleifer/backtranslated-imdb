This was, frankly, the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, the plot was also bad. But it was a good idea. If this movie had better filming and much better actors, I might have something better to say. edgar allen poe was a great gothic writer and this film has just destroyed him. Why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies? The only good thing was when the killer put his head under the floor, which was pretty good. the swinging ax was just awful, there was absolutely no tension. And when the killer hunts everyone in the end, he has gone from one place to another within a few seconds, it makes absolutely no sense.
