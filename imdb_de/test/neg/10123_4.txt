I never understand why, when a studio like Universal buys a musical, slashes it when it's put on the screen. My first thought, seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker, was to see something of MGM that was musically musical at the time. Boy was wrong and disappointed. <br /> <br /> One Touch Of Venus, starring Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway, ran for 567 gigs in the 1943-45 season and Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway played the roles Martin, Baker and Boles have played on stage. Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash Musical with book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a comeback vehicle for Mary Martin, who re-established herself as Queen of Broadway after a disappointing Hollywood venture. <br /> <br /> Look at the names added to this show. Given who was responsible for the book, I expected a sparkling joke in this production. Instead, I got a pretty pedestrian script. It was as if all the joke was going away. Eve Arden plays her usual girl-Friday role with Tom Conway, but it's even too much for Eve. <br /> <br /> The story refers to the shop window decorator Robert Walker, who is a very kissing precious statue of Venus, brought to life in the person of Ava Gardner. When the statue has disappeared, Conway of course cries for the law and is suspicious of Walker, the last person in the statue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Walker, who deals with Gardner and what will happen to both of them. For reasons I do not understand, Ava of course was dubbed by Eileen Wilson and Walker only sings a few lines. The vocals are performed by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan, who play Walker's friends and colleagues. Of course, the songs were played on Broadway by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. You'd think Haymes would at least be Walker's part. It was uncomfortable, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Only three songs have survived the score: Do not look now, but my heart shows, that's him and the incomparable Speak Low. Haymes' silky baritone is best shown in Speak Low, which was sung by Martin and Baker on Broadway in a duet. For some reason, the lyrics of one of the greatest verse members of the last century, Ogden Nash, were taken over by Ann Ronnell. I suspect the infamous code was at work here. <br /> <br /> In Lee's biography of Ava Gardner, he mentions a brief reversal Ava made with Robert Walker when she had a spear with her current husband, Howard Duff. When Duff and Gardner reunited, Walker took it badly and did not address Gardner in front of the camera at all. I am sure that the fact that both were not in their best work did not matter either. <br /> <br /> Hopefully a repertoire company will play One Touch Of Venus, and you'll see it. That's how Weill, Nash and Perelman wrote it.
