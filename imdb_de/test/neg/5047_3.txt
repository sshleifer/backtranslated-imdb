I do not think I'll spoil the experience of this movie by telling you not to see it when you have something better to do, such as cleaning under the stove. It gets dirty among us and you have to clean it at some point. <br /> <br /> I think the movie suffers from sex and violence, even though there is a chase that looks so dangerous that it could only be shot in a country where life is cheaper than beer. "Gargoyles" heart is in the right place, but his aspirations are conservative. At least it's not presumptuous. But I had a great time playing the longtime idiot in the horror movie saying, "What's in here?" and dies for his hubris. I also met Michael Pare. Every movie junkie should work with a B-movie clip at least once before death. And Romanians are the most beautiful people I met. Literally the most beautiful. Walk down the street in Bucharest: If 7 out of 10 women are not absolutely beautiful, walk down a street I did not meet. and be comforted by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 drinks are available. Part of the film was filmed on Casa Radio, an originally abandoned, unfinished building of the classic communist bloc with Georgian nightmare intended to host KGB propaganda ministries, ie Radio Not-so-Free Europe. The building is five stories high and occupies a city block; Best of all, while its facade radiates the state of the Big Brotheresque state, it is located near the city center like a post-apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp populated by dozens of gypsies and numerous wild dogs. Construction on Casa Radio was discontinued when Caucescu and his wife were executed on television in 1989, and there are still gaping holes that fall from the sunlit attic (with surreal views of a modern, quarter mile concrete pavement decorated with is rebar and old car parts, looking out over a ruined ancient city, to the dank, spooky basement (which doubles in the movie for the Gargoyle hideout.) No crash barriers or warning signs for Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Since In the late Soviet Union, Casa Radio has hosted several un-union film shootings, including "Highlander III." It's attractive to producers because it's a cheap location, massive in size and available space, bizarre in appearance, and free of insurance headaches It is still owned by the state, and no one complains if you do not go to work after your production umen All that remains on site is interpolated in the construction of the local Gypsies in their shantytown in this real urban jungle. <br /> <br /> An assistant director was bitten bloody by a wild dog while filming "Gargoyle". The apples provided by the catering were pushed into the service by cast and crew as projectiles to keep the stray dogs in check. I too was bitten by wild dogs in Bucharest, once in a bar (!) And once in a city park. I also survived two car crashes in two weeks, both in taxis, and was viewed by the drivers involved as a reason for stopping the cars. <br /> <br /> GEEK NOTE: The sci-fi network or the channel or whatever was one of the supporters of this movie (the smaller the budget, the more producers on the set), so it's a bit weird No one with the original title "Gargoyles" had problems until it was nearly time to show him on the CD Network, though Sci-Fi already had a non-contiguous series of that name. The title was changed relatively shortly before the release because I have a color-corrected copy with the previous title.
