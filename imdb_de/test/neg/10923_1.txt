First and foremost, I'm by no means a picky movie watcher. I'm not one of those people who get movies just to sort out and criticize the mistakes. I look, like most other people, too, to be entertained. Basically, I'm going to watch any kind of movie, no matter how badly someone says it (sometimes a movie is so horribly made and written that it causes some sort of compassion of humor that gets me kicked). Besides all this, the little pimp was just pathetic. I saw it on TV and just did not know what I was watching. It was too poorly written and too cheesy to be an adult movie and had far too much sex, allusions and curses to be a children's movie. In fact, I doubt that even children would enjoy it. The humor (quite generous, even if he called it that) was so presumptuous and without a fight, I could not see how a half-witted person could even find it funny. The only thing that made me laugh was how people like Bernie Mac and ridiculously hurt their name and time on something that hurt so much. Luda's character was a cheap trick for Lacher, who missed his target extremely. The plot has made no sense at all, the plot must be the worst consequence of events that were ever put together on the canvas. I could go on, but I want to see what people think about my reaction before I begin to discuss concrete cases of pathetic scenes. All I have to say is that it really is a miracle how much time these writers spent on their knees trying to get it done. <br /> <br /> J
