This well-intentioned movie is just a little too short and unfortunately in too many areas. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful, overlooking the north of central Vermont, which forms the backdrop to this mid-century story. Quebec Bill strives to return to his whiskey past to save his farm. <br /> <br /> Between scenes of magical realism and straightforward action back and forth, this film is barely noticeable. <Kris Kristofferson as Quebec Bill seems quite stilted, or it's his lines; or his cross of Yankee and Quebecois accents. Anyway, he just comes as an inconspicuous blow. His dialogues with Gary Farmer's Coville figure, however, sparkle. William Sanderson's advice to Kinneson is solid. Charlie McDermott shows real potential as a young Wild Bill; but his part is not big enough to carry a scene, and he never steals one. Luis Guzman appears on Lake Memphramagog (with an excellent performance on Lake Willoughby) as a monk who does not carry the hood accent of the boys: who knows? And then there's Bujolds Cordelia: an oracle like her namesake, she channels Yoda as she lines up, "You're going to marry a Quebec woman!"?!? Just too funny and not mysterious enough. <br /> <br /> The end is really choppy. Another bad mix of magical realism and concrete. And Yoda never gives an answer we can understand.
