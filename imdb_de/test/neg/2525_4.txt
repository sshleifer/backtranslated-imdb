I worked in the company that originally released this movie, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem as many small independent film companies. They did not have much money to invest in the production values ​​of their films. Not that money alone costs a good movie. Take a look at the water world of Kevin Costner, for example. <br /> <br /> If you have a talented person in the house doing the acquisitions or development, you can create your own new talent. But there was no such person at Vestron, and they were always scarce in some crucial areas. In this case, it was about the director and the writer. Which makes it quite difficult to have a decent movie, even with the great cast of this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the basic premise of this movie was "Let's put some quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens." It's a fascinating idea, but it's not worth it Time to watch. <br /> <br /> Most Vestron films had a distinctive look and feel. My wife and I have developed the ability to recognize this quality in non-Vestron films as well. Many times we could even recognize this quality by only seeing the trailer or the TV ad. We sat and watched the trailer or the ad, and then we turned to each other, and almost synchronously we said, "This is a Vestron movie!" This is a Vestron movie.
