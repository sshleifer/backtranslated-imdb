I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It did not bother me that Lost World was not as intellectual as the original, and here I just hoped for a good monster movie. It was about "dinosaurs eat people". However, it was also disappointing at this level. <br /> <br /> For beginners, there were not enough people to eat, and although I do not know how many people are eaten, it was not enough. Although there was no lack of variety in the dinosaur community, there was not enough dinosaurs by far. And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, have just made cameos and did not think much about how cool they are. <br /> <br /> (START SPOILERS) Then there was the pterodactyl. The characters I read estimated her body weight to be about 15 pounds while the movie got her to get closer to 300. Worse, they could not eat anyone, or even splash them on the rocks, dropping them from above. There was no end to the movie, it was just all the credits. (END SPOILERS) I wonder if the edition I saw was missing 40 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion is that they taught the pterodactylos to sneak their long beaks into their pockets and get their $ 7. Rent the Carnosaur series. At least you will not be disappointed.
