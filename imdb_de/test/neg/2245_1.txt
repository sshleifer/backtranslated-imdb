Every film that Quentin Tarantino made has gotten worse and worse. I would like to think that most people would agree with this statement, but since "Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)" is 8.5 / 10 out of over 100,000 reviews, it does not seem to be the general cinema has any sense. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a "masterpiece." The problem is that the claim that you like Tarantino's work is in vogue. Once this is the case you will receive shiploads of people who are ready to hop on another train car. They will ignore ridiculously horrible spectacles and completely self-indulgent writing just to be part of the exclusive club called "Everyone". This movie is so horrible that I swear that it has to be some kind of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. As another reviewer said, "Previous Tarantino films came from a man in love with other films, this one is from a man who loves his own writing." I could not agree anymore. This film is nothing but selfish and joking writing, paired with acting skills taken straight from a high school. But I'm sure the movie will be released as one of the best movies ever. Bravo, Tarantino. They deducted one of the best practical jokes of all time.
