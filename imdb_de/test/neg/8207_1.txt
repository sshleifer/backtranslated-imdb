Why can not a movie be rated zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies like "Plan Nine From Outer Space" are so bad that they are fun. THIS IS NOT ONE. "The Dungeon of Horror" might be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of them anyway), I MUST bounce through a lot!). Luckily for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my rising age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but fortunately I can not remember them. The sets seemed to be made of cardboard and finished with spray cans. The special effects looked like a C + diorama set of a fifth student in a shoebox. The film contained unforgivable gaffes, such as when the Marquis shoots and kills his servant. Then he immediately gets into a fight with his fleeing victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him without the weapon being reloaded! This movie was so bad that my DVD copy only had name credentials. I think no company or studio wanted to be charged. I think if you film in your garage and put together sets of cardboard boxes, you do not need a studio. This movie is definitely one of the worst films of all time with such terrible sacrilege as "The Manipulator", the worst movie I've ever seen with a real Hollywood man (Mickey Rooney). The only time I see "The Dungeon of Harrow" (or "The Manipulator") is if someone would pay you. (I'm kind of cheap) I'd have to pay $ 7 or $ 8 for Dungeon and at least $ 10 for Manipulator.
