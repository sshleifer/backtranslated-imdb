Director Nico Mastorakis has (according to himself) created a cynical cash grabber that is too cynical to impress anyone except a genre fan in the second year. The most extreme, confrontational genre images that bring a character into paraphrase VIDEODROME, "have a philosophy"; that makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> ISLAND OF DEATH's philosophy is to bring many "shocking" elements into a cinematic mix and to stir slowly. The result is a dish without taste, but with an ugly appearance. <br /> <br /> Not to be confused with Serrador's brilliant WHO CAN KILL A CHILD? (sometimes referred to as the ISLAND OF DEATH) Mastorakis is located on a Greek island where various forms of slaughter, a little bestiality and some great perversions take place. <br /> <br /> Everything moves at a snail's pace violent set pieces are badly directed. <br /> <br /> As "the film the censors did not want you to see," I would guess the censors have never seen it, they just read the press kit until their knees jerked up.
