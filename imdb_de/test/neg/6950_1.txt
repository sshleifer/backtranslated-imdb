I have to put it first by saying that I love to watch bad movies that are entertaining. This movie delivers 100%. It's undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. It's full of crappy stick shots of random material in a city (people walking, traffic, the skyline, etc.) that do not get involved in anything. Then there are the excessively long "sex scenes". This includes a lot of stroking and frequent rubbing of the socks on the bodies. These are by no means erotic and closest to the horror you'll find in this movie. This is especially true of the shower scene, where two of the so-called "barely legal" girls, who could not possibly be over 40 years old, spatter each other with blood, but there is also a crewmember who has blood from outside the girl splashes always smiles at him. No one had to memorize any lines for this film unless they clearly read maps, then they have a magazine in front of them that they constantly look at as they struggle through awkward dialogues. Then there is Mr. Creepo. He throws Ed Wood's name around as if he could somehow compare him, but he is far from having anything of that quality. He walks around in a cemetery babbling about random things that went awry in the movie, which really helps keep the movie from running at all. We could not stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes in which we were pumped out and occasionally horrified). <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 1/10 because it has far exceeded my expectations for a horrible movie.
