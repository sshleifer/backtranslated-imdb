The only good thing about the two problem-child films was to bring together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. Besides, the flicks are just as demonic as their hero. In this essentially unnecessary sequel, the freshly separated Ben (Knight) and his little Hell Racer Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs more screen time) move to a new city of willing bachelors. Ben finally chooses Lawanda (played by the least-used SNL player Laraine Newman), whose Blanche-DuBois tendencies do not suit Junior at all. Adding to Junior's torture, there seems to be a younger Firestarter in younger form with Trixie, who happens to have a sweet, single mother from Yasbeck, who also played Junior's first awful mother adoption. You can see where the action goes from here. Looking for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth. I think I'll go with the gag "Cherry Bomb in the Toilet," making James Tolkan of Back to the Future one of the many adult victims (this guy always plays school authority) numbers. Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried return as parts from the first movie, but unfortunately there is no performance in the Bow Tie Klansman, I mean, Killer (Michael Richards), the problem child was even more fun. I'm sure these films, whether abusive parents have seen them or not, have been miracles for America's redheaded children. We also welcome these proud American Flicks for their great encouragement of adoption. Oh, and dog jokes - I have to have doggie jokes ... Shmucks.
