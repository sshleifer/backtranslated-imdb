I could not last ten minutes with this horrible movie. In and with the age of DV cameras, it seems to have been recorded on VHS without color correction or microphone. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker, I know the limitations of Indy filmmaking and even think I'm amazed that movies can be made so bad. <br /> <br /> The only praise I can offer is that this movie was distributed as I've seen significantly better movies that still seek modest national or international films release. I suppose the box is what she sells ... she has good boxing art, but from there it goes downhill. <br /> <br /> Note: It seems the director has 11 friends since no one is there, the planet would give this movie a "10".
