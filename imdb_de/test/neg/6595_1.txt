This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. I hope the REAL family and other characters have lawyers sueing the hell out of VH1 for their portrayal. The drama is terrible, the writing is worse and the characters are scary. It was supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy for me, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting. Normally, I like Flex Alexander's acting, but this time he completely missed the goal. <br /> <br /> One could argue that he took on this role for a few laughs himself because it was so awful. If you really want to have a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS. But if you want to make fun of bad acting and stupid writing, then please listen. Apart from that, do not waste time.
