Some of the films produced by Roger Corman's New World film company in the 1970s are the best kind of B-movie in which the limitations of the genre actually have a kind of liberating impact on the writers and directors. This is how classic drive-in films such as "Deathrace 2000", "Hollywood Boulevard", "Grand Theft Auto" and "Caged Heat" were created. Unfortunately, his former Confederates at American International Pictures in the 1970s, especially in the absence of Jim Nicholson, had lost their air, and they often produced imitations of Corman's films, sometimes with his own homemade stars. "Black Mama, White Mama" is one of those movies. It's basically a cheaper imitation of "The Big Doll House," where some of the same stars do a lot of the same things. Yes, this is a John Ashley co-production (yes, the same John Ashley, who was the funny Elvis Wanna-Be.) In How To Make A Monster and with Debbie Walley in Beach Blanket Bingo, with all the signatures paired with his productions ?? Women's prisons, in which all except perhaps 2 or 3 main characters, including the inmates and the guards, Filipino are actors in mostly non-speaking roles, in which women and supermodels take on the roles of revolutionary militants and the main joy of the film through rudimentary S & M Exploitation arises. <br /> <br /> The pressure I've seen has been terribly slightly damaged recently (good old Will Viharo described it as "yellow mum, yellow mum"), but I think photography is in the best of conditions and the filming extremely routinely does not have much to do with wi The film itself, because it was always enough to give its films at least an additional production value by filming in public spaces, which would make the movie look more impressive. This movie does not look impressive, it does not have an impressive soundtrack and you just feel embarrassed for anyone with a bit of talent. The only remotely interesting images come from Pam Grier as a fiery whore who was to escape life, Filipino actor Dindo Fernando as her grotesque, complacent pimp, and Sid Haig as a cowboy-style mercenary. The story brings Grier and co-star Margaret Markov into a low-budget female version of "The Defiant Ones," but does little with the melodramatic possibilities this premise offers. It's basically just an excuse to make sure that the two protagonists can stop during a good mud ring game while trying to escape prison together. This is all in the spirit of fun, but the film eventually fails because of exploitation, as there should be some advantage and a certain rawness in those scenes, which instead is replaced by a sort of yawning predictability under the director's hand. <Br /> <br /> So the movie will be of little value to fans of hardcore value? At least in the version I've seen, it's not more explicit than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" from over a decade earlier and far less visually and thematically. For those who just enjoy "so bad, it's good" to laugh at movies, this movie can be fun, but it's not in the top row. It would be more advisable for people to seek "Caged Heat" or some of the others who enjoy their brutality so much that they become a lair. This is similar to less ambitious efforts like "The Muthers" by Cirio Santiago. Unfortunately, the best part about this movie is the title and presence of Pam Grier, who was better in other movies at the same time (especially Jack Hill's "Coffy"). This film may show an incident on Miss Grier's journey from Corman Secretary to B-Movie's Queen-For-a-Day, but apart from its historical "significance" as such, it will be of little value even to Grier's great fans because they are given will be very little to work with. <br /> <br /> It's worth skipping, unless you can of course see it in a movie theater with lots of friends and a lot of beer like me. And even then, the value is questionable.
