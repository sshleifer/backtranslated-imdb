I waited a long time to see this Lone Ranger movie. I finally saw it on the Lone Star Channel today and was very disappointed throughout the movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart played the better Lone Rangers and Jay Silverheels as Tonto, as the two stars in this movie. Everyone played very badly in this movie. Even the plot was bad and far-fetched. I think the horse in which Silver was portrayed was the best actor in this movie. I'm glad I did not buy a copy of this movie when it first came out. I'm really sorry that the characters that played Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels and brought them to life on the screen were so clouded. Unless future actors are found worthy of portraying the characters the way Clayton, John, and Jay were so good in the past, I will not spend any money on the movie. I will not watch this movie anymore. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davies
