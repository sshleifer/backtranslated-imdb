Some movies are just ?? unhappy. These are the films that were obviously shaped by a lot of good will and a handful of potentially great ideas, but simply did not have the financial means and / or the professional cast and crew to make this possible. "The Strangeness" definitely belongs in this category. They really want to like it, but even the most tolerant and unpretentious horror fanatics of the '80s will have to admit that the film is barely mediocre due to its cheap atmosphere, clumsy stop-motion effects, and impenetrable dark cinematography. "The Strangeness" has a rather original plot and attitude (okay, it's similar to "The Boogens", but I seriously doubt that director David Michael Hillman intentionally demolished another unimportant 80's B movie) and deliver the players despite their enthusiasm achievement enthusiasm they are all wrong. A gathering of amateur speleologists set off on a voyage of discovery to explore the infamous Goldspike Mine. Many miners died mysteriously many years ago, and since then the place has been abandoned, but there is supposed to have been too much gold hidden to stay closed forever. Shortly after descending into the mine, the group members hit the slimy ruler of the Gold Spike mine one after another; a lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way of moving forward. "The Strangeness" is a boring and incompetent mess most of the time, which is difficult to track due to the lack of lighting. The characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery, as the only light effects come from the speleologists' helmets. There is little action or horror in the first hour, but director Hillman cleverly captures the audience's attention by showing parts of the monster at regular intervals. As soon as you catch the first glimpse of the monster's tentacle, you're doomed to look to the end. The creature is realized with stop-motion effects that I usually adore and adore, but here they are extremely weak and pathetic. The person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of Ray Harryhousen. The death sequences occur mostly outside the screen and there is little tension throughout the movie. A horror movie with such a setting should benefit from a claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects, but "The Strangeness" lacks all of this. The biggest asset of the film is undoubtedly the beautiful look of blonde actress Terri Berland. She's like a Speleologist as much as I'm Theresa, but she looks good in her tight white top and beige pants.
