It sounded so promising in the rental store, the premise sounded great and I could not wait to get home and see it. It was Apalling that the Diologue is terrible, the action is extremely poorly written and the plot takes a dive from the start. Gutenberg makes a miserable performance, Sean Bean does his best, but with a script that was so bad, he could not do much. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth it, even if you get it for free (borrow it from a friend for example) Dont, as you regret it and waste 90 minuites of your life. <br /> <br /> 0/10
