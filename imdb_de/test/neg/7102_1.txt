I will never know why Lori Petty was cast as a tank-maid. Her acting is poor. Her voice is scratching. It is almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There are several "Modern Pop" references in the movie that I thought was very strange, since the movie was widely adopted in the future. It would not have been difficult to make that premise interesting. A little better writing would have helped with the loading. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts performs as a gentle techno-geek. I think they probably should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> I'll never know why anyone would like this movie, unless he was a Petty fan. <br /> <br /> Try not to watch this movie. Total waste of time.
