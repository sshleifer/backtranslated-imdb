I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story was very thin and the editorial team tried to extend it as long as possible. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unusual character that it was hard for me to support him. Andy's acting is good, but not good enough to make up for the bad writing in this film. Andie MacDowell has done a good job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary's romantic interest. I can not say anything bad about Andie, I always like her when she plays. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so far-fetched and unbelievable. The two do not make a good pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was almost as disappointing as the movie itself. A nod from the pope and everything is taken, come on. The event in which this film has a happy ending and which the authors would expect us to accept is pathetic. Gary does not change and only the death of a dear friend makes his situation better. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great movies that should be seen before this movie. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
