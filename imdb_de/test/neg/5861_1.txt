* Spoiler ahead, but that should not matter as I hope you will not see this anyway. <br/> <br /> If you wanted to see this, I strongly advise you not to. Because this was one of the most wasted 1 Â½ hours I've ever experienced. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a complete rip off of the great movie "Battle Royale". It's as stupid as watching a lame American TV show like "Cops" or "Candid Camera." <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely predictable. One challenger who is pregnant and another is a nurse. Anyone who makes logical thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between these two. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the concept is torn, and the film lacks the necessary force to produce this movie. I mean, the preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or even a trace of the hit in the back. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever without finding anything good, so take your money and get a copy of Battle Royale instead of looking at that piece of crap. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10, too bad I could not rate it lower. Scream 3 is almost a masterpiece ..
