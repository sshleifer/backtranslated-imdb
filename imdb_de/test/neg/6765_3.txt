We decided to watch this movie as an alternative to The Polar Express at our local IMAX cinema. What a waste of time and money! First, it's not cute. The snowman sometimes looked demonic. At other times he was just a zombie. He showed no expression and no emotions most of the time, and his hollow blue eyes were just scary. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Santa Claus initially says it's a film about the spirit of giving. A Santa Claus and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving? I'm all for a little parody, but that was just not funny or entertaining. <br /> <br /> The idea that the snowman's flute is his voice is different. Too bad you will never see or hear the snowman playing his flute ... Not even a thank you to Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The only funny parts of the movie were the "outtakes" at the end of the movie. Too bad they did not use them in the movie. It would have been better.
