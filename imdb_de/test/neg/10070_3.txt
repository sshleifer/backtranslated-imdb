JP3 is missing the Spielberg touch. It's a total assault on the senses that marks the dinosaurs "in your face". Watching the movie was a bit of a roller coaster ride from hell. <br /> <br /> The script is lame; It asks at the same time and leaves too many questions unanswered. Besides, we can not really appreciate people in the movie for what they are worth. For example, William H. Macy is too great a talent to fight with dino bats for our attention. And Laura Dern was especially sympathetic in JP1; In this film, she is hardly a spot on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The entire JP3 experience was completely different. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many dying characters, too much predictable, unfounded violence. <br /> <br /> A word to the wise: choose from this island. <br /> <br /> (I rated it for special effects at 3, the other 7 points I took because they have absolutely no originality.)
