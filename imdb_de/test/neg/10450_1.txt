I'm not sure where to start. From start to finish, bad, stinking bad, like getting into a harbor on a 100 degree day. If you force yourself to see this as I do, hold some Vicodin ready for the pain. I'll never understand how bad blows hit the cutting room without the entire roll landing on the ground. The film is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the Terminator, meets Wally Beaver, who plays cowboys, and Indians without cowboys. I saw better animations in the original cut of the blob. You'll get more entertainment when you see Gone with the Wind while suffering from the puke and shit. Bad acting and hokey lines will make you want to have you rented Peewee's big top or seen every episode of Gilligan's Island back to back. I will now slit my wrist.
