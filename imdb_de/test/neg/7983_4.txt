There's not much about "Reckless" that feels right, starting with the repulsive title (thanks to scriptwriter Craig Lucas, who adapted his own game and brought the title) and continued the casting (Mia Farrow, the woman plays to Tony Goldwyn who is young enough to be her son). The couple lives in an idyllic winter world that seems like a snow globe, but Farrow gets an amazing dose of reality after he admits he hired a man to kill her. She flees into the night and escapes with a very strange couple who wants to help her rebuild her life. The production design and artistic direction of Reckless are fine, but they are services rendered to a completely nonsensical, often alienating screenplay. It's supposed to be a dark holiday comedy, though the cast with this idle, occasionally offensive material has a loss. * 1/2 of ****
