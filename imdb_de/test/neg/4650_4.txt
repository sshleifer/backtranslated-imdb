This is a treat for Z movie fans. Here you find the writing and acting so bad that you can not record anything with Ed Wood. Cameron Mitchell is a former make-up man from the "Paragon Studios," who after a nasty incident at a social gathering takes a fierce Mad Scientist (TM) with a rubber scar on his face, calling him Paragon Actor kidnapped and made into living statues in his Secret Laboratory (tm), which is easily located in the local wax museum. Or is it zombies that make his bid? He is not sure. <br /> <br /> Luckily, many of your favorite movie clich√©s are here. Look at the villain's lab! Are these mysterious steaming vats fluid? Test tubes with colored water without stated purpose? Yay! And what do we see, how arms and legs are arranged freely on a wooden frame? You can bet on it! Marvel at the hobbling detectives who are acting directly out of Plan Nine! Now enjoy a stupid, tame car chase and hear more dizzy bimbo than you would like. Raise an eyebrow at the smeared plotting line, made even more opaque by the completely meaningless ending that seems to have no connection to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Cheese making and have fun for the bad movie connoisseur.
