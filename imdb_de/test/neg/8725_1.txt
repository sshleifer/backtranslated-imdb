This is a weird, funny movie and does not deserve a better grade than David Lynch! The special effects are badly done, the actors are mostly bad actors and this movie is not about a race that is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie that pays homage represents sectarian type of organizations. This is certainly not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six-part epic! Take a look at David Lynch's, that's the perfect homage to the novels!
