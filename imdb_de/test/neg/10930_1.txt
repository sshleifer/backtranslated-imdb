This movie is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. A woman "The EX" pretends to be a number of people to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people without reason in baths to reach their destination. The women I do not think ever went to drama school. She just spends the whole movie making dumb expressions, and it looks like she's doing everything she can to avoid looking at the camera. Mostly fail. She befriends the wife and son of her ex-husband and does so to use them against her husband. When you watch this movie, first think that the "ex" wants to kill their ex-husband, maybe because he treated them badly. But in fact the woman is obsessed with the man and wants him back. The two of them had rough conversation (with whips, of course). My advice to the general public is not to buy this movie, not to borrow this movie and not to look at it as I did (at 1:15 on FOX)
