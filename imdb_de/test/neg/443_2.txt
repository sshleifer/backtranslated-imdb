Maybe I'm too generous if I give this movie two and a half out of five stars, but it happens occasionally. However, as an "An American Werewolf" movie this is a missed opportunity! There is no real relationship to the superior original of which one could speak, but the story is somewhat similar to that of "London." <br /> <br /> * Possible Spoiler Warning * American kids go into a foreign country, one falls in love with a beautiful girl. Another child is slaughtered the night of being bitten by a werewolf, and despite the warnings of his undead friend he sprouts the fur, fangs and claws at full moon! <br /> <br /> But there are some differences in history, for one; The girl is one of the werewolves. Second; There are three American children. And thirdly; There are some weird - @ $$ werewolf cult that wants to conquer the world! As crazy as that sounds, the last one was not a joke! * Spoiler Ends * <br /> <br /> The films suffer from many things, first it is pulled down immensely by the weak effect! The performance of Tom Everret Scott is at best bureaucratic, and he and Julie Delpy, who show his love interest, seem to have no chemistry at all. Second; A weak script that seems to be everywhere. Many elements of suspense and dark comedy that made the original great are missing from this element. And who said that eating the heart of the werewolf you bit will make you human again? Finally, I heard that this was not part of the werewolf story at all! Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are created with computer animations suitable for dinosaurs, ghosts and spaceships. Seems very choppy, fake and artificial when used on furry creatures like werewolves. <br /> <br /> However, there were a few things that saved him from total "turkey". There's a hilarious scene in a Parisian cafe when Andy (Scott) drinks coffee with Serafine (Delpy), drops some condoms on the table and tries to put them on as chewing gum by chewing and blowing a bubble! Likewise; the soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs like the original movie has the word "moon" in the title, the soundtrack is great. And another funny scene, when a rotten corpse, played by Julie Bowen, tries to whistle and jump out her eyeball, making me laugh. <br /> <br /> But as a whole, this movie seems to lack the joke and tension of the original. And the overly invented end does not help much. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half out of five stars (average)
