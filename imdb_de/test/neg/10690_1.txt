My friends and I saw this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. At first it was bearable. it smelled like BAD IMPROV, but it was pretty crazy, though the scenes were too long and boring and the horrible quality (I read $ 400 budget above ... sounds about right) of the movie itself. <br />> The biggest problem was the absence of a script. I know how difficult it can be to keep scenes short and efficient. What happened in this movie was that the actors had to improvise the scenes and did not know when to stop. They stayed with stupid topics forever. At first, I thought that was because the movie was short and they needed long, useless scenes to filter it out. As the movie progressed, I realized it was just a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were many parts where I could see that the filmmaker had a really good idea for a recording, but not the resources (or talent!) to do it effectively. Many scenes were recorded from a single recording (Cause, Improvisation) for a really long time. so boring! If you can stand to endure an hour and a half of the terrible improvisation, look at it. It's really funny in parts, but also really stupid and annoying. The acting ranges from okay to absolutely terrible. it seemed that the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the crazy kid who swore a lot, the barber shop, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> but yes. painfully bad I had literally hurt. After about an hour my friends and I were bored and left.
