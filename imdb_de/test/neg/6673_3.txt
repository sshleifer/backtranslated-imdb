Czech film art travels through dark ages ... this film is tangible evidence. Slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictional people who are characteristic of their stupidity. A young and healthy boy who does not want to work and prefers to live in a dilapidated hut with a wingless alcohol aunt. Because of the idiocy of Tonik, who just announces "Dad, I will not work in the factory" (I really would like to know WHY); I understand the condition of his "house", but I really can not digest the terrible mess. Everywhere limited sentimentality. Why did not Monika accompany her boy to work abroad? Young Czech couples do this very often. And take someone else's children to a devastated barn ... that's too much. <br /> <br /> Irresponsible mother (poorly played by Geislerová), naïve and stupid boy (Tonik), stupid and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, someone has already said that - badly controlled and played soap opera. Actors like Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did their best, but unfortunately the whole thing could not be saved.
