When Kristy Swanson gets an attack of guilt over what she does, she wants to get out. Unfortunately, Madsen is her immediate superior in a company where "a two-week advance notice is not an option." The image of the valley girl seemed to fit. But as an assassin on the run ... well, keep running Kristy. Run, far away! This movie is not a concept that has not been done before, but it has been done better! <br /> <br /> I did not want to see the rest of the movie, but I felt I should do it if I wanted to give a review of this movie. I've always liked Madsen, and his character was a bit predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time both for watching and for producing. No wonder he was never released theatrically!
