I've always liked Bill Murray in movies like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this movie looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically, Murray plays Jack Corcorin, who has recently found out that his father has died, and is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown because he left a big shoe, his squeaky nose and his main leg, an elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to cover 4000 miles in four days and take him to a safe zoo for $ 30,000. Also with Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small, tiny moments of humor, such as the front of a truck leaning forward, and Murray screaming, but overall it makes no sense. Pretty poor!
