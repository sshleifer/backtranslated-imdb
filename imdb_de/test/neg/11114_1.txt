I saw this movie knowing that it would be terrible, but damned if it did not allow new and revolutionary ground in the field of making defecation as entertainment. The action is Deep Rising with gross effects and HORRID spectacles. The lines in this ... Well, wow, there's really no way to tear down this movie because I think the words still need to be written in English. The sad part is that the filmmakers believed they were actually doing something good. You will not believe your eyes when you see how many films they have demolished without trying to hide them. There are scenes / plotters straight from Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers and the list could go on forever. Unlike these films, however, this film lacks celluloid stool. The most incredible thing about this film is, apart from the way it tries to be competent, but fails that Gimli is self-freakin-self. How the hell can they afford John Rhys-Davies, but no decent effects, lyrics, actors or sets. Really awful ... and not the kind of bad that is good.
