This film should be provided with a disclaimer that resembles the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be a biblical movie. I expected this to be a movie about alien UFOs and alien abductions for the sake of entertainment. As mentioned in previous comments, it would be fine to show up in a church, but not in a public theater, at least not without the consumer's knowledge of what the movie is about. I felt fooled by my $$ $$ for this movie because nothing in the synopsis refers to its religious overtones. If you go to church, it will probably be shown there for free for some time. Apart from the cover-up of his true theme, the film was fine in terms of drama and script. But I have to say that I spent an hour in the movie when I saw which direction it was and that I would not entertain but preach.
