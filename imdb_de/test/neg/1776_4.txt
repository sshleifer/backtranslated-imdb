I played as Eugene Morris Jerome in my high school adaptation of the play, and this movie definitely does not fit the script or Neil Simon's idea. I know this piece back and forth and I can honestly tell you that the acting has ended. The production was cheesy. The changes in the game's script were badly done. If you really want to enjoy this game, you should watch the real game, not a Hollywood movie. The Eugene character had no soul and was overly sarcastic in everything he said. The other characters were also unable. A general disappointment, messy, faithful to the game, amateurish executed!
