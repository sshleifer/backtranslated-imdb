1.October 29, 2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Stephenson): An entertaining story about a group of five children forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight in the First World War and England entered the war. They are told not to go into the uncle's greenhouse, which they do, of course, and they discover a sand-fairy that wishes them daily and only lasts until the sun goes down. This is the "IT" referred to by the title, authored by the Jim Henson Group and voiced by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that their desires usually lead to other problems that they should learn from. This part of the film is not very well done because it is obvious that the children, especially the Freddie Highmore character, are not learning from them, but always "it" to solve the next big problem. "IT" is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian Eddie Izzard, who actually did not have much opportunity for improvisation and wasted Kenneth Branagh as an eccentric uncle, even though he is the best character. The kids are okay with their acting skills, but the story would probably have gone much farther into the fantasy realm, but they also had a human story to tell that was likely to cause confusion with the filmmakers. All in all, this was an OK movie, but could have been much better.
