Good attempt to tackle the unconventional theme of May-December romances. The treatment is completely unrealistic. Sure, sixty-year-old men can and will fall for younger women, but usually they are adult women with whom they share common interests and values ​​and points of view ... no neurotic, immature, almost underage girls. Of course there are exceptions and they are almost called pedophiles! I'm sorry, RGV, but it's not credible that a sensible and savvy sexagenarian would throw away a comfortable family life and make a joke on his peers ... anything for an 18-year-old who has no practical mind in mind behaves like an unstable refugee from a psychiatric institution. You do not have to do a doctorate in psychology to see that Amitabh's character is seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved issues about abandonment and father problems. The edge of a cliff thinking about suicide is about as close as if he had something in common with Jiah, acting like a crazy teenager. <br /> <br /> On the positive side: the actors did a good job and good cinematography.
