This begins in Pennsylvania in 1913. A group of children are killed in a mine explosion that the owner of the mine intentionally launched. Cut to 2006. Recently, Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenaged daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and the little girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) are widowing a remote house near the mine. What they do not know are the ghosts of the little children who haunt the forest and kill anyone who is around after dark. The premise is obvious and has already been put to death. There are also big gaps in logic in the story. It has never been made clear why these children are simply killing someone or why they eat their bodies afterwards (yes - it is shown). They are already dead - why do they need food? And why did not they get the main villain in history long ago? He was in the area. Why choose this time to attack him? The characters are not the least sympathetic. Sarah meets the worst. It has a few saving graces. The location is beautiful and scary at the same time, some of the murders were VERY bloody and brutal, and the children themselves looked incredibly loud as they walked through the forest at night. But all in all, I was bored and struggling to stay awake. You can skip this.
