I must have missed a part of this movie ... I was wondering who that is. And when did that happen? It seemed to jump around, but I was looking for it because I was afraid I missed something and everything would be explained to me. I loved Lonesome Dove, but this movie made no sense to me at all. I loved all the actors, but what happened to the rest of the movie? It made me "what" to go? At the beginning of each part .. As far as the scenery - I thought it was alright ... I felt like I was leafing through a book and skipping pages. The end also puzzled me a bit, although I can imagine the boy was waiting for his father and should ask her if his father finally came home to his son and would be a father since his mother left .. I would like Read the book just to see what I've missed The movie ... I do not expect this movie to win any awards.
