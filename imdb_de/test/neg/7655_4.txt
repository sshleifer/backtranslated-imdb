The second woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to do him harm. A girl who likes him wants to help him, but it is believed that his fears are caused by a mental illness. Interesting conspiracy, very good acting, but the result is overall poor in many ways. The story is too simple, or rather simplified (though there are some interesting twists). For example, people say they love each other after only two meetings. I do not want to reveal anything else, but you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie. "Come on, it was the fifties!", You may think. However, I have already seen some movies from that time and know that some of them are not so old-fashioned anymore. Somewhat disturbing was that some scenes were pitch black, which made it almost impossible to see what was going on Ok, it's a movie noir, but in some places it's too noir ...: o) <br /> <br /> All in all, Second Woman is not a masterpiece of the time, but it's not garbage either. Look at it, if you have nothing else to do ...
