This is a strange movie. It seems to appeal to a younger audience but is full of sexual allusions. The whole premise is quite absurd, not just the idea that a few shrunken heads of three dead children have been involved in crime-fighting, but it also means that children who attack a group of tough older men are a bit far-fetched, as well as their parents are mostly absent in the film and lack of authority figures to keep the children in line. <br /> <br /> The cast is good, but Meg Foster plays a very brave mafia leader with the handsome AJ Damato leader. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are well-off as young lovers, though Leigh Allyn Baker is notoriously wasted on a comic actress of her talent. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is uncommon, but I'm not doing anything I do not think that's enough to make up for the poor quality and limping performance. The landscape is all pretty boring and the "special effects" are pretty bleak. Put this out if you're not in the mood.
