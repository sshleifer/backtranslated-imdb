"Disappointing" is the best word I could think of for this film, especially given the glowing reviews it receives from other users. <br /> <br /> One thing that really spoils the movie is that it's inconspicuously partisan (in both senses of the word). Not only does it provide a very selective description of the games (with a focus on the US athletics team), it also contains some inaccuracies, most of which exaggerate the difficulties facing the US team. <br /> <br /> What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes (?) seem to glorify the US sports spirit to the exclusion of other athletes (with some exceptions). For example, the viewer believes that the US won the majority of the medals in the games, even though they actually won only one in four gold medals and one out of six. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective compatriots (hence we have an arrogant Brit and a French wine Frenchman). This attitude contributes little to the Olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate. <br /> <br /> Finally, I believe that this film would appeal to the part of the US audience that is looking for a quick boost in national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games should look elsewhere.
