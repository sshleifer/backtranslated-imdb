Randy Bowers (John Wayne) arrives at Half Way House at exactly the right time to take a break from the trail and discovers a lot of bodies inside, including a man to whom he should deliver a message - Ed Rogers, owner of the Facility. He is watched by the dead of the dead, Sally (Alberta Vaughn), behind a hidden room where she remained unobserved during the slaughter. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" was led by Harry Fraser. Here, as in other films, he uses a film technique in which he transports the action from one place to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. It's pretty well done and looks pretty innovative in these 1930s Lone Star Westerns. George Hayes, lying in front of Gabby, is at hand without whiskers, and I saw him as a villain for the first time. It took him a few scenes to realize he had a dual role, first as a hunchbacked businessman, "Matt the Mute," who communicated over pencil and paper to become Marvin Black, leader of a gang of outlaws. Black's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House to get Sally to sell to Matt / Marvin. Yakima Canutt is also another player, a black henchman named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser / Wayne robber, "Neath the Arizona Skies." <br /> <br /> Between Black's Gang and the Sheriff, there's a lot of time-consuming riding posse, as John Wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. In the end, he saves the day by securing the thirty thousand dollars from Sally Rogers, at the expense of destroying Half Way House, where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe. The greedy Marvin Black tries to open it with his six-shooter, and the explosion is a fitting end to the villain. In his best attitude "Aw shucks", John Wayne falls under the spell of pretty Sally Rogers, and unfortunately Randy does not ride alone anymore!
