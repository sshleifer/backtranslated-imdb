I usually like Lawrence very much, and since I'm in Australia, I have not seen much of his stand. When I saw this in my video store, I thought: Yes, I'll see. I wish I had not seen it now. Obviously, Lawrence had a profound experience that opened his mind, and I think he wants to share this with others, but this was neither the time nor the place. <br /> <br /> This whole experience seemed to be a motivational speech in hell it really did. I think the night's slogan was "ride it until the wheels fall" and he mingles with simple jokes about sex and sexual organs. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong It's not gross humor, but Lawrence lacks the gift of matching him to Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just indecent, the only time I laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. If there were any bad points, I would give them ....
