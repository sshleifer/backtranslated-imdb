This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; At least the poor guy in which he played a major role. It's just incredibly bad. The processing is particularly terrible; It really seems that the publisher (if any) literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and put them together. The opening must be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have been angry every time it was mentioned! I know there are "B" movies - but are there "H" movies? If so, this is an example. And I say that as a devoted JW fan.
