The sloppy hosts do not bother me, and even the cynical, self-righteous attitude that the makers of this crap do not bother me. <br /> <br /> What worries me is the vast majority of episodes are fake I would not even be surprised if ALL the episodes were staged. So, this is not a reality show, but something even worse than Oprah: Zero-Comma Zero-Appearing MÃ¼ll TV. Like the daily TV soap opera, but with more action and fighting and less conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The premise would have been great - if only it had been done without cheating on the viewer. If only this idea were free of all the legal complications that would most likely arise from what would happen to real people and what will eventually be broadcast. So, the only way to make this reality show was to have some pretty desperate actors and improvisations (and what a pathetic and unconvincing improvisation it usually is!). Should not this be obvious to anyone who has finished elementary school? Most of the reviews I read here do not even mention that these are counterfeits, not to mention that this could be anything. Wishful thinking or boundless naivety? <br /> <br /> The actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of unemployed performers who are lying on the floor waiting miserably on desks and eagerly waiting for a call from a talk show (or that crap) Chance to earn several hundred dollars. I even recognized an actress (in the role of the "cheater") that I saw years ago on the Jerry Springer Show. And I only saw 6-7 episodes of "cheaters". How many of these loser actors are still in Springer and "Cheaters", of which I do not even know anything? <br /> <br /> However, comparing Cheaters with Springer is not fair. The Springer show is not all fake; Much of the episode is not staged - so it's often entertaining. No value is found in "Cheaters", unless you are a laborious actor and want to know how to NOT act in front of the camera. The producers use different (very cheap), transparent) tricks to create the illusion of reality to give their films the elusive documentary feel. But it's all right. In the end, the smarter viewer looking for wrecks stays completely occupied. "Professional wrestling" has more credibility.
