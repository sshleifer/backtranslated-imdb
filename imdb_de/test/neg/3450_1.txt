This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The cinematography was boring, with long, boring shots (like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that make little sense to the screen's content. The cut was terrible, the scenes were in line with the delicacy of a butcher. The plot was based on the observer being familiar with the historic night Mary Shelley frankenstien wrote. Acting was forced, with the kind of character development that you had with an intense interest in seeing each of them die terribly (the sooner the better).
