I have to be honest and admit that this movie basically did nothing for me except to completely confuse me. It is burdened with a conspiracy that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which are then associated with the discovery of a over 40-year-old body. The story never seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I've never really understood that) he really started showing his age here. One terrible failure was John Goodman as Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni, whom I suspect is a local mob figure. I just did not think Goodman worked in that role, though I have to admit that I'm not much of John Goodman. Somewhere in the mix, Justina Machado appeared as an FBI agent, though I'd never really understood what the FBI was about, which could simply mean that my attention drifted off the screen. When it was explained, I completely missed it. Fortunately, this is a pretty short movie, so you do not waste too much of your life on it. 2.10
