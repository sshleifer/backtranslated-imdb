Terrible adaptation of the inconspicuous love story of Heminway. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse during the First World War in Italy (Jennifer Jones). What's wrong with it? Virtually everything. Hudson is far out of his depth here. He could be a good actor, but not in this movie. Jones is far too old for her role (she's 21 in the book - here she is 38 ... and looks like that!). Her acting also fluctuated between exaggerated and suppressed! They recorded a simple, unobtrusive love story and made everything disproportionate. The movie is deadly long (just over 150 minutes), selfish and padded to a ridiculous degree. It seems as if producer David O. Selznick believed that he would be "Gone with the Wind" again. Some of the landscapes are really stunning (even on a small TV screen), but there are not enough stories to get the pictures. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The end where Jones dies is supposed to be tragic, but the bad acting and the exaggerated theatrics made me fight, not to laugh! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, actor Vittorio De Sica is really embarrassed. Overblown, selfish, poorly staffed and slow. Pretty awful. This was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended Selznick's career as a producer. You might want to hear some of the scenery at the end, but it's not worth it. I give a 3.
