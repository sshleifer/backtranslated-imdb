This movie must go down in the history of bad movies as the worst I've ever seen. It was not even a bad movie ... I would have rated it as Z. The special effects were ridiculous ... if you could even call them special effects. I think the reviewer hit the nail on the head ... it was the box that sold the movie while the cover art was great and the overview was fascinating (which is why I rented it) but also money. I did not last long. I brought it back to the store and turned it off for another movie. I think my local video business took it off the shelf because there were so many complaints about this horrible movie. My 6 year old could have done better if I shot him / wrote the script!
