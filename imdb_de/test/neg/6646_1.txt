I saw this movie, but not in a single session. What happens when it's on the TV, I watch for a few minutes, find that I've taken everything I can take with me, and then leave the room. During those few minutes, I do not even laugh, I do not enjoy what I see, and am more depressed than this anger. Interestingly, I am told that the psychological states are incompatible, that is, you can not be angry and depressed at the same time. This movie tests this theory. <br /> <br /> I think part of the problem is that I spent almost ten years in Chicago. When I look at the scenes, I think of my own experiences in this dilapidated city and thus of myself. Of course, I bring a lot of my luggage to the play. It's quite possible that I'm ready to admit that if you're not Chicago resident, you'll enjoy the play. If so, I envy you. <br /> <br /> And yet. John Hughes made his films in Chicago and these films worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first-rate writer. I think it was obvious that he knew how to balance his situations and make his characters both sympathetic and believable. In a comedy (as opposed to a farce), this balance is crucial. And it is not easy to reach. If that were the case, everyone would make great movies and we would not have to wonder, as in the real world, when the genius will ever be released. In "Adventures in Babysitting" this is not the case. I hated those characters. <br /> <br /> There is a deep and real difference between sympathetic and simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this movie is a clunker. There is no humor, no humanity, no people to recognize. Only actors who read their lines as if they could do anything to prevent them from shouting them out. Sure, that finally creates merriment, this time with certainty! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It is embarrassing and after a while, usually at the point where I get up and go, I begin to feel compassion for all involved, which is a kind of emotional connection, I think. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. It does not act, certainly not funny, and it is quite possible that she can not. But sir, how she tries. She looks older than 17 and looks much younger than a 7-year-old schoolchild who's sure you'll get such a prize. And she is not alone. It's like not everyone can relax and let the story flow. As if everyone just has no idea what he is doing. Well, this was an early effort for Chris Columbus, and he would definitely improve, and better writers (such as John Hughes himself) have certainly helped, so maybe some forgiveness is fine is. But the movie only stinks of desperation. But as I said, it can work for some. If one of the above points appeals to you and some of the reviewers have clearly done so, get the DVD and beat yourself out. Otherwise, avoid this mess like in a dark alley in Chicago where, if you hurry, you can only see shadows and hear murmured threats.
