The filmmakers failed to link the dots, that is, the sequence of events and decisions that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet mujahedeen to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden, and finally to 9/11. The filmmakers, of course, fail to tell us the background - why were the Soviets in Afghanistan? - but this omission fades in comparison to its failure to disclose the support of Islamist extremists in Afghanistan in the name of rabid anti-communism strengthened the hand of the anti-Western forces and contributed significantly to the chaos we are in today (9/11, terrorist networks , a longer ground war in Afghanistan, etc.). Since these consequences are not substantiated, the film allows the viewer to sympathize with Mr. Wilson (he is watching his latest projects on the Internet) rather than seeing him as a person whose actions run counter to his country's best interests, the West as a whole.
