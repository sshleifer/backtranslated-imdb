This movie is not bad. It is not even bad. It's awful You know you're in trouble when Charo shows up in a movie. She must have had the week free from "love boat". George Kennedy, at least he is a player - he is there and he tries. Actually, he is fine. And it's nice to see Martha Raye. Jimmie Walker is fine. There is a bit better acting than in Airport '75, but which movie is not better than Airport '75? What I liked about this movie was that it was busier than many other disaster movies. At least they made an attempt in negotiations. What really hurts the movie are the special effects - yuck! Not especially if you ask me. This is the kind of movie that is really fun at 2am when you have fun with your friends and are looking for something to laugh about.
