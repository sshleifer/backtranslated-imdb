I'm ashamed to admit publicly that I once held the cover of this movie! This is an absolute reason why you should research the movie before you see it! The "makers" of this film have all called us fools and gullible losers with too much time. <br /> <br /> Based on the mythical Indian forms that transform powerful cobras and rebirth, history takes a painful ride. More than 40 actors (now really?) are the target of their former friend Manisha Koirala (who is in Her coarse, eternal, powerful friend Cobra / killing machine friend Munish Kohli (who fortunately has not been seen since) was a cobra, but now is a ghost! Now you have to know more? <br /> <br /> I agree to study for the upcoming test at school and not for this movie! Give a pass if you are healthy. If not ... then you will probably enjoy it.
