I love bad movies: showgirls, plan 9 from Outerspace, so on. And this movie fits right in. Do not believe anyone who tells you that this is a good movie. It is terrible. Tim Currys accent moves from German to Portuguese in Hungarian. There is a person in a gorilla suit who can communicate with a glove that interprets the sign language of the monkey. There is a scene with a killer horse moving around a river like a great white shark. There are people going up and down. Kilimanjaro, as if escalators were installed there. That's ridiculously ridiculous. So ridiculously I rolled on the floor. It is completely implausible. I enjoyed every minute.
