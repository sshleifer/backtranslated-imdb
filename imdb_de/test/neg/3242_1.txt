Oh, if you ever want to see a supernatural thriller turn into a comedy? Watch this movie <br /> <br /> This movie was a shock because it had so many actors, but what do they do and how do they fit? <br /> <br /> The handling of the college scenes is like a school game in which each person comes into conversation and then the next person comes in front of him. <br /> <br /> Good reasons to laugh about the movie: 1) Akshay, Suneil, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as college students 2) Akshay carries a gun in college 3) some pathetic stunts and SFX <br /> <br/> There are some more mistakes like why the snake does not save his rape lover and comes in so late? Why does not he kill them all together? <br /> <br /> But after all, they have to make a 2-hour movie, so you have a Tortorius movie. <br /> <br /> The film The film was directed by Rajkumar Kohli, who has made such films in the past and had a successful recording of films such as JAANI DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN. Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's nonexistent career. Right from VIRODHI (1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996), all the flops he tried to promote for his son, and he throws big stars for his son to notice, nothing can help his son's career. <br /> <br /> The film has several comic scenes, such as the death scenes, how the actors, after being defeated by the serpent, are so fit that they can fight it again, and the climax. <br/> <br /> Director: Rajkumar Kohli is bad Music is bad /> This brings us to the cast Akshay Kumar - ordinary stuff, he does not have much to do and does not stun Suneil Shetty - the terrible Sonu Nigam - the worst debut The Utante Prize goes to him. He gives the cartoon a new meaning. Aftab- terrible Arshad Warsi- nothing to do, Sharad Kapoorbad Aditya Panscholi- irritated Sunny Deol- is funny in the scene, if he wants to save Sonu LOL Manisha Koirala- ordinary Rambha - Akshays couple Kiran Kumar, Raza Murad are as usual Raj Babbar - for wrong reasons, the girls are terrible. Which brings us to Munish Kohli. This guy has a huge physique, he's even stronger and taller than poor man's Akshay Kumar Akshay. His voice is terrible, his expression is painful. The only thing he has to do in the movie is wearing glasses and a bad face. Rajat Bedi is terrible
