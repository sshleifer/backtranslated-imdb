For a film that has received so much recognition and evaluation, this spin-off of "Rosemary's Baby" is a big mistake. It all starts with Andrew / Adrian, whatever his name is, because he is so confused that he no longer knows who he is, runs away from a cult with his mother, and is soon kidnapped by a strange lady, the caring about him as if he were you She was his mother. Acting is terrible when Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his face lost in the face, an endless grin and Dukes of Hazard clothes seemingly more like a drunk than the son of Satan. In fact, all he does is drink and fall sloppily at himself as he tries to deal with his past and the last reminder that his mother has driven away on a bus that screams to him. He finds a friend who seems like an angel, but in a hilly scene where he looks more like a Christmas tree, he is quickly dead and elitist. Andrew is tracked down and the cult with the members of the first part tests him to see if he really is the son of Satan. His stupid self has failed the test and rises from the age sparkling with myme make-up and jumps off the stage of a nightclub and dances like a clown on crack !!! This scene is memorable and worth watching. The end is terrible and reasonably predictable, considering how stupid he is throughout the movie. Do not watch this garbage or you will lose respect for the first part.
