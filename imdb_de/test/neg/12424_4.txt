I completely forgot that I had seen it within a few days, which in itself is very enlightening. The tenth version of Gaston 'Phantom of the Opera' Leroux 'Country Secret', I had heard that it was an appealing and funny update. So it came from the sympathetic title sequence and a few nice accents in the opening scene, but the film came to a halt very quickly and became vague boring and completely unsatisfactory. As a mystery, the main problem is that it is basically unsolvable by the audience: Like the worst Agatha Christies, it depends on a character that appears in the final act with a wealth of background information that we do not know. As a movie, be it a comedy or a thriller, the key problem is that a characterization is almost nonexistent. With the exception of the murderer, each is a typical version of the typical suspects in the typical murder story of a country house - reporter, endangered heiress, suspect fianc√©, scattered academic father (a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale), etc. There is no depth and little interest, and often overripe or misjudged ideas do not help. Frankly, you are not interested in someone, so there is no danger or tension. Only Claude Rich and, in the final part, Pierre Arditi, get everything they can work with, and only in the last role does the film resonate with a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be truly effective. By the way, we get endless exposures and a few ineffective wannabe comic set pieces (a promising one with a photographer caught in a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought-out to figure it out) while Dennis Podalydes on Irving the Explain the last third of the picture. I do not like Country House movies or Agatha Christie style Whodunits, so those who are may cite it a lot more loosely, but I thought it was a bad show. As Rich says, when the mystery is revealed, "it's all more of a disappointment."
