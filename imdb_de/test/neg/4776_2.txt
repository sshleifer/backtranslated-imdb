The movie started at o.k. A few tourists on vacation in Mexico, enjoying themselves, decide to go for a hike. They cover some hidden paths and end up as a fortress with this huge temple. Angry villagers appear and try to keep them from climbing, but due to the language barrier, people are shot and the tourists climb the stupid thing in the end. It turns out that the plants are evil bloodthirsty things that the villagers do not go near, so guard the temple so that the tourists can not get off. There are some horrors in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. I mean they are PLANTS! Buy or rent the d.v.d. Wait until it comes out on the cable.
