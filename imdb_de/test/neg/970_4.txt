Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that leads to a great comedy. Great expectation often leads to disappointment, and that proves to be the case. When Eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal made by Detective Robert, they torture it so much that they end up drugging a live action reality TV cop show. Logic is not a great part of this movie. The super weapon they spend in the second half of the film is proof of that. A 12-speed machine gun that leaves big holes in the sheet metal and three that destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is more of a fantasy than a science fiction. A five-pound weapon that fires hundreds of shots per minute without recoil is certainly the weapon of the future with the technology of the past. <br /> <br /> It's clear that this movie is not for adults or children. So if you are in between, this is the movie for you.
