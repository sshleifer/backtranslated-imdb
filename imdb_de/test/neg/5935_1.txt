I first read about the Left Behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to find out, as I have an interest in how religion is used to keep people in our increasingly hateful world under control found a copy of Left Behind: World at War in my local library, innocently embedded between the action movies on a big budget. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is extremely poor. The drama is directly from a primary school production and the "special effects" would have looked dated in the early 90s. As the third part of a series, the story would be incomprehensible to anyone who had not seen or read the other Left Behind films, and even with my prior knowledge, he was still quite laughable I do not think anyone who is not yet of the Spirit of the Lord was satisfied, would find anything in the film to convince her to change her ways. How to fear the Antichrist when he has a Russian accent and the worst powers are a pathetic CGI? <br /> <br /> However, my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try this to fool people into believing that it's a big budget action movie. When picking up the box and reading the game, I immediately noticed something unusual ... Nowhere on the packaging was the true nature of this film mentioned. For someone who is not clear, it would appear in every way and intends that Left Behind: World at War would not be different from the latest Tom Clancey. On the copy I rented, it did not say anything about it being the third in a series. <br /> <br /> Considering that the Antichrist deceived the whole world, I find that extremely hypocritical that the filmmakers tried to fool me TWICE before I even got to counter! If you are so firm in your belief, why should not you be honest? <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that this would not have been a "Christian" movie with the built-in fan base that goes with it. I seriously doubt it ever saw the light of day. If Cloud Ten hoped that I would see the error of my ways and surrender to God, I am afraid to say that I died of boredom and / or laughed to death before I ever had the opportunity.
