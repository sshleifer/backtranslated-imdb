This Canadian "movie" is the worst ever! Breathtakingly amateur. When the bad guys rob a boat, we see two women with machine guns, and one of them says in a very low voice, "We're robbing your ship!" She blinks and is totally shy! Very intimidating ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> The two karate hack heroes are 40 years old, two-meter-tall twin brothers! They are really bad actors. In fact, anyone involved in this production is not an actor. <br /> <br /> There are so many continuity mistakes in this cheap production that it is amazing. In one scene, the boys wear a kind of swimsuit. In the following shot they wear completely different bathing suits. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible! A must for every fan of bad movies. I have it on VHS. That's very rare. I appreciate it very much.
