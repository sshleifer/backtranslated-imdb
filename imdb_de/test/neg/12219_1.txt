Maybe it's just the format of this movie, a documentary, but I think the movie would have been better served by good actors and a more solid dialogue. The fact that the actors are also the entrepreneurs is a double-edged sword. They know the emotions and the complexity of the business they are in better than anyone else. However, since they are not professional actors, they convey these emotions very poorly and the documentation suffers. There were some really memorable scenes in this movie and a lot of good lines, but they were delivered so badly that they will fade over time. The only reminder of this documentary is that he had some good scenes that I can not remember. <br /> <br /> Check this out for a first-hand account of the .com bust, and see what happened to the 99% of people in the industry who are not immediately Millionaires were. However, be prepared for vile camera work, bad behavior, bad dialogues, and a bad movie epitomizing the epoch of the Internet boom.
