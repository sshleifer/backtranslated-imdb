Anslinger, the name of the DEA agent, is a nice insider joke - this is the name of the former drug czar who almost single-handedly made marijuana illegal. Despite this little bookkeeping, the authors go on farmers reaping and selling fresh undried leaf, rather than cured buds. <br /> <br /> Also, I find it always amusing that filmmakers are never able to find real marijuana plants for filming. One would think that there is a business that makes real fakes out of the movie business, or maybe they would film a few scenes in Amsterdam or in Switzerland. I suppose that's too much for the budget. <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting thing about the film is the attempt to cover the idea of ​​what's right and what's wrong in society, and how the law handles it, yet tries to do justice. <br /> <br />
