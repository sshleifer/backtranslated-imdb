This is probably the worst documentary I've ever seen. It looked so amateur. Chris Hegedus was one of the directors of The War Room, a great movie (albeit a bit one-sided), but it looked gorgeous. Startup.com looked like it had been shot in the basement of a man. The quality was so pathetic that I could not stand it. I watched for about 30 minutes or so and had to bring it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can not understand how such a thing from someone like Chris Hegedus is so amateurish. How the hell did this prize initially win? The War Room was definitely an award, as was another great documentary called Ameragosa (both awards). This documentary looked like it was made by Uncle Joe, who also hosts weddings on weekends. Shaky, dimly lit, unflattering lighting, bad sound, a 10-year-old could make a better movie than this guy.
