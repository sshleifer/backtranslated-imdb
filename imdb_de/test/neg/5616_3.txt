I actually expected this movie to be pretty good, maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but the fact is that I love Judd Nelson. In fact, he's the only reason this movie is worth seeing, and really his role is not so great. The main highlights of this movie are raunchy sex scenes and boring dialogues. If these are the highlights, I'm sure you'll get a pretty good idea of ​​what kind of movie this is. There is definitely a reason why it is a TV movie. Look at this only if you have nothing better to do on a Friday night or just waste money on video rental. Save time and rent the breakfast club!
