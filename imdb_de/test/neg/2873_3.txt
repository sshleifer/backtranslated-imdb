wow ... I just saw this movie ... Americans have this stereotyped view on Hindi movies like: ALL Indian movies have dances, songs and a love story. This film only reveals the stereotypical Western perspective of Hindi films. Terrible spectacle, horrible direction, terrible cinematography. And all from a Hollywood director. Most of today's Indian films are much more content, realistic, touching and meaningful than this crap. Indian cinema (not just Hindi) also covers a variety of topics. Just like most other Hollywood movies these days, this shows a very stereotyped view of another country where the truth is thrown out the window. This is a very NOT recommended movie. Instead, watch good Hindi movies like Black Friday, Eklavya, Omkara, Khakee, Awarapan, Gangster, Don, Zakhm, Dor, Sholay, Mother India, Lagaan.
