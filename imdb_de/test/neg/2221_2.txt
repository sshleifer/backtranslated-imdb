Easily entertaining and confident cheezy - but what else could it be? Cushing in one of his poorest roles and often sounds dubbed. McClure is simply too Cheezy to be believed, but who can blame him in the wilderness of this film, whose conspiracy on ancient dinosaur birds that dominate humans has a retreat from the 19th century, but not enough literary genre in movies. Nice effort from the actors, but a poorly designed production.
