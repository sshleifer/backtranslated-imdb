I did not quite know what to expect from Future Kill, but I certainly hoped it would be a little better than what I got. I knew the rating was bad and the reviews were awkward, but the illustration of Subversive's DVD cover looks more than cool and I can not resist it. For a very long (indeed too long) time, this film gave the impression of an unofficial continuation of Porky's with lame, vulgar, and insulting brotherhoods. Five mega-dorks, one of which resembles an exact young clone of Jim Carrey, desperately want to become members of a frat house, but their final initiation may only be a little far-fetched and dangerous. They are thrown in the city center with provocative markings on the faces, along with the outbreak of a violent gang war. It does not take long for them to face Splatter, a seemingly half man and half a machine warrior who leads a gang I never really knew who or what they were. Were they a government experiment? Cyborgs? Terminator imitations from the distant future? Is anyone interested? "Future-Kill" is a bizarre amateur film with a scenario that jumps from one topic to another without any logical connection or narration. The plot borrowed vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like The Warriors, Escape from New York and The Terminator, but the end result is a gigantic sci-fi monstrosity. The costumes and special effects are pretty pathetic and there is a lot of cheap and unfounded nudity. Acting is awful, but I'm ready to blame the backward dialogues for the actors. Despite all the cool DVD cover art at all costs. Resist it!
