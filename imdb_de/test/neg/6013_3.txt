This movie should be called Adventure in Cinemascope. It's as if the scriptwriter and director took over Cliff's Notes 3 and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a movie about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue bears no resemblance to Hemingway. This is a fictional version of Hemingway. Hecht, the scriptwriter, is a hack. Take a look at the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. This is a great movie and was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls, where he's stiff as a board and thinks he's a favor in a Western and do not watch this movie. It's best to get the unabridged audio CD and just listen to one of the best novels ever written.
