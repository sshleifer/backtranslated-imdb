This movie has some of the worst production values ​​and editing features I've ever seen. There are several instances where actors pause while trying to remember their lines, actors walking in front of actors who speak, and a point where the movie skips about seven frames. Not to mention that the heroine is shot in the chest, but she hobbles! Oh, and what about the secret passage, which is well lit and in the open air? Dreadful. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent. It has something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and goes to the ends of the earth and to a caveman war. Ator gets a dragon out at a point in the dumbest moment of the movie. The dialogue is stupid and contains gems like "It's all and nothing". and "I can feel it here." <br /> <br /> The film is a mess, a confusing, bland mess. Ator is a mild hero, the sword fights are absurd and the plot is slowly progressing. All in all, this is a movie to avoid.
