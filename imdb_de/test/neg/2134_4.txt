A "40-foot" giant mutant squid with five tentacles, shaving teeth and the ability to reproduce its own cells is terrorizing a small Florida town. Various marine biologists, doctors and bulls plan to kill it. A human monster named Miller offers people who discover that "Devilfish" is an artificial creation used for the greed of some evil doctors! Miller attacks a researcher, strangles her, drowns her in the bath, throws herself in a hair dryer, and then tears her panties off her body! <br /> <br /> Many false alarms are set when our heroes Peter, Stella, Janet and Bob went on a high-tech boat ("High Tech" for 1984, "Seaquarium") to the creature catch, which is often seen in close-ups or incredibly obvious, accelerated film that seems more threatening. And only fire can destroy it, resulting in a flamethrower-armed group compared to a waterworks finale. <br /> <br /> This JAWS deposit is quite tame (apart from a legless corpse and beheading), but observable and benefits from an excellent Antony Barrymore score and a decent monster design for 1984. Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
