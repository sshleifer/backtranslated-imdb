A friend of mine rented this once and thought, since Peter Fonda played in it, it could not be bad. NOT CORRECT! It's as bad as anything can be. There is so much to laugh about and it's not the jokes. For example, Hawken walks into the woods in a scene and when he comes out he suddenly wears a totally different outfit! Where was the head of the director when he shot this scene?!? Probably the same place Fonda was when he agreed to do the film. It's really a shame that such a good actor will dumb in this bad excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody can call acting in this film. Jack Elam is brought here just to increase the number of stars, but all he does is look frightened in a very dark and terribly shot scene in a kind of bar. Not to mention the "Indians", the girl was so god fearing that I wanted to shoot her just to end her and my misery. If I could give this a 0, I would. Too bad that this brand does not exist here. This is really reminiscent of a bad joke or amateur shots made just for fun. This should serve as proof of how bad B films can become.
