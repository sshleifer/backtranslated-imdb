Lonesome Jim is something of a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers. The two boys, who are around 30 years old, live at home, and there is absolutely nothing for them. I live in the Midwest and can not call a family like that. I picked it up because I like Buscemi-theatrical humor. Now I realize that I have to have an antidote to this sense of humor for it to work. The drama and camera work as well as the editing were fine. The first 15 minutes have set you, and the last 15 minutes have contributed to the film is not completely depressing. The female members of my family asked me to turn it off, but I prevailed on the assumption that there was a turning point in the end, and we watched the entire movie. The male family members went out as expected after the first 30 minutes.
