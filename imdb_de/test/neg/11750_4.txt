The most available movie in the history of cinema? This is a strong candidate! Why waste so much money on a meaningless job? The only difference between the HItchcock classic and this poor imitation is color, widescreen and Leila's Walkman !! A movie designed to create tension and fear leaves me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> No, you will say I will urge the younger generation to see the original? balderdash! This "Psycho 1998" is a huge spoiler. <br /> <br /> They could have done something different, for example, by hurling an actor closer to Bloch. s Bates, an obese man. They settle for a disgusting Rehash! Pox on it! And long live Alfred Hitchcock!
