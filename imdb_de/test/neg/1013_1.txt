Naked Deanna Troi! <br /> <br /> Richie's brother Chuck (from "Happy Days") with a reversed wisp! <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 has all this and more, including a clever scene featuring Chuck Bronson's character, a mousetrap-like device that chews a punk when it opens the window. <br /> <br /> Chuck also lays a board with a pile of nails on the floor next to another window and smiles as he returns to take bloody footprints off. All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it's one of the most incomprehensible "serious" movies I've ever seen - full of chaos and almost no police response, use of military weapons to get punks after the score to mow. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, Bronson did not record this movie, but he happily cashed the check from Golan Globus. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy high quality movies, avoid them, but if you want a cheap "Jackass" kind of thrill, give it a try.
