As long as you get into this movie with the understanding that it will not contain any historical facts, that's not bad. <br /> <br /> He's as far as Sam Raimi's "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" comparable to plot, drama, humor, and production values. You will see the similarities in several places. However, most fight scenes are not so good and the movie suffers. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance has never before mastered the screen, and at no time do you have the impression that he gives less than his best level. The same applies to Oliver Reed. The problem is that their strong performances make Don Diamont's unsurpassed theatrical skills even more awkward. The longtime bit player Cas Anvar was also very good and played in the above Hercules a character like Salmonius. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed the low budget swords and witchcraft movies of the early 80's, then you're probably going to enjoy this show as well. It's actually a shame they're adding the name Marco Polo. Contrary to the expectations of most people who want to see this movie, it has nothing to do with Marco.
