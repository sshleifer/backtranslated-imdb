Seeing the film's reputation as the worst of the worst, I was looking forward to seeing Wood's Crappus Opus (my word). It's not necessarily more inappropriate than the other Woods I've seen - but GLEN OR GLENDA does not come from the REEFER MADNESS (1938) filmmaking school br /> <br /> This, too, certainly shows as a horror legend Bela Lugosis Nadir (his first of three "collaborations" with the director): One wonders if he really knew what kind of movie it is (given the actor's story of heavy medications and the sheer futility of his cameo). In addition, Lugose's idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps the most unpleasant here ... although Wood's script is mainly to blame for - given the impossible dialogue (with repeated nonsensical allusions to "puppy tails" and "fat, fat snails") he handed the offending animals Star! Incidentally, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym Daniel Davis) - and proves to be just as worthless in this area and proves to be an all-round dog! Dolores Fuller - his wife and co-star - was similarly talented (she would also appear in Jail Bait [1954]) ... but at least the picture where the latter Glen finally wears her angora pullover was given by Tim Burtons Affection Biopic ED WOOD (1994) his famous poster! <br /> <br /> In the latter film, incidentally, a presumably fictional meeting between Wood and Orson Welles is to be seen - well, GLEN OR GLENDA is in every respect a role model of Ed Woods CITIZEN KANE (1941), which is his joyous inclination to bauble has techniques: in fact, the tightest thread of the plot is filled with a lot of footage (many irrelevant, such as the confusing instances of S & M) and inhumane dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of a mischievous demon, the outrageous bushy eyebrows would bring forth Martin Scorsese crying with envy)! However, the film's sincere attempt to demand plea for tolerance and psychological reflection on the suffering / phenomenon of transvestism is sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurish nature of the approach. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, the issue I looked at the "Extended Re-Issue Version," which included "corrupted" material for six minutes (directed by W. Merle Connell) was censored in the original release! Also, my copy was out of sync over and over again (which forced me to rewind it to get the audio back on the right track) - although fortunately that was the reason for converting the source to DivX, unlike the movie itself ,
