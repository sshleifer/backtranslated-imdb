A terrible deception: controversial film, winner of Teddy in Berlin 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. The actors all recite (well, they are not exactly actors); The film was trying to make a big bet, but ended up as a dubious bet: it remains in the superficiality of two kissing guys and a guy whose lover has disappeared; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homosexuality featured in other films (eg, Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel). Technically, only photography works. Otherwise, the camera is placed in a different angle (to create more art film) and the entire film is in black and white atmosphere. The movie is so presumptuous that it bothers. I mean, it's good to be presumptuous if you have talent to support it. Or maybe it's such an art cinema that it's incomprehensible. The story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. For me, more form than essence. Superb Edition? It was good. Great direction? Do not think so: The film is weak. It was an interesting project. It's a shame. It's a mistake. A star of four.
