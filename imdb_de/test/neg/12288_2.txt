Okay, I had seen this movie when I was very small, and on the day we cleaned the closet, I see that! I thought, "I have no idea what this movie looked like," so I kept going and put it in. OH MY GOD !!!!! This movie is so damn bad! I never thought that this movie could get as close to my favorite movie as before, but I laughed because all the jokes were so hackneyed and ridiculous, not funny !!!! So much stuff in this movie was funny because it was so stupid !!!! This movie is not nearly good. I have to say, if you want to watch this movie, you definitely should not expect anything big and if you've already seen it, trust me, I feel your pain too !!!!
