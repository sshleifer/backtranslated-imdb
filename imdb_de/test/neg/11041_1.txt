***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Good * Tragic <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> Oldboy is not for everyone. It's pervasive violence, its live octopus food and its unimaginative history. The film focuses on a man who has been abducted and detained for 15 years. Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find out that he must find his kidnapper in 5 days. The story may seem exciting at first, but when you look at this bloated and original blood festival, it turns into a porridge of bitter blood and a powerful movie. <br /> <br /> The direction is on average and by no means the standards of a South Korean thriller. Oldboy's acting scenes are associated with boring humor and a poorly written script. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is occasionally presented with thin straw performances that you can only be ashamed of. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: /> <br /> Not for everyone, but the scope and vision are not clear enough to see beyond the gray abyss of the fog. <br /> <br /> * Tragic
