Well, Killshot is not terrible, but it comes close. The production values ​​are decent and the main players do a pretty good job (apart from Rosario Dawson in a wasted role), but the story is just pathetic. I do not know if the Elmore Leonard book had such stupid characters as I did not read it, but I suspect the book should be at least somewhat humorous. The film has no detectable humor. After the first twenty minutes, you shout on the screen, "Oh, come on, no one is so stupid !!" In short, and without a spoiler, everyone behaves in a manner favorable to the plot, which does not make sense anyway. A very frustrating and unrealistic film that may be responsible for keeping it on the shelf for so long.
