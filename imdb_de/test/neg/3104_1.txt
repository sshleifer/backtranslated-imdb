The worst movie I've ever seen, I did not even look at it. I just forwarded it to Burt's Bits and then to the end !!! he is the only reason to see this !! I have to admit I own a copy because I'm a GIANT Burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection Fans of the different stars have always beaten me there. Imagine my disappointment as I sat down and saw this movie. There are only no quality losses for this movie !!! Absolutely NOTHING, WHAT STILL LIKE THIS MOVIE !!! This movie was a joke between me and a buddy Burt. Rob Lowes worst worst hour and a half of my life
