I saw 5% of this movie today and you can tell me that I have to see the whole movie to understand it, but honestly, I do not believe that. <br /> <br /> What the hell is the story in this movie? Movie? I saw a lot of people walking around in a factory shooting everything around. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? OK. <br /> <br /> 1) They were shooting around as if it were the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The entire space is made of metal, but not a single ball was fired on the metallic surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No rebound. Metal vs. Metal will inevitably lead to rebounds, but apparently nobody was hit by a stray bullet. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic balls? In one scene, a villain is facing a good one, when another good guy appears behind the evil and pumps him full of metal. You see the bullets coming out of his chest as they explode in a bloody fog, but the good guy in front of him is not hurt at all! 4) After they've just sprayed a man all over the wall, they tell each other good jokes and they laugh and look like teens playing soft guns. <br /> <br /> 5) Sound? At one point, the good cut a wire and an alarm sounds (who the hell is cutting a wire to sound an alarm?). The lady screams "Alert in sector blah blah" and the villain boss says "Okay .. that .. is .. not .. a .. drill .. blah blah" in a very, very amateurish way. Oh, we're being attacked by terrorists, it's not an exercise, but I sound like I'm not giving a damn. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! First you see the bad guys with weapons. For some reason, the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Deja Vu or scene loop? You literally see every villain get the same weapon and get blocked and charged in the same way. The arms dealer bangs in the clip and the villain extra no. XX locks and loads. When they started to open the fire, you MUST see the running lightning. Boooring !! 7) actors or dummies? One of the alleged good guys threw off a smoke grenade for some reason, and the bad guys are suddenly in the smoke because they are smoke-blind or so that they do not see it coming. They cough and groan as if it were anthrax in the grenade. Then comes a half-boss villain and he does not even cough when he penetrates into the smoke. He pushes the other villains away and they suddenly realize that the smoke is not anthrax anyway. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I think so! A guy slipping down a metal pipe and holding a Uzi in his right hand, apparently shooting at someone at eye level. I'd like to see a man fire an Uzi with one hand and I want him to get his hand after that. Extra bloody mess on a kind of B-strip. Small * pops * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead. Although the first bullet hit his heart, the good guy, who is a super-trained green beret, still feels the urge to dump his clip into the dead guy's coat with an empty clip! How stupid can you be? Always check your clip before facing an unknown number of enemies! 10) Boring scenes. Like the barrel-barreling scenes and the blocking and charging scenes, the film is filled with time, wasting scenes of people walking around in a seemingly empty building. If you choose a B-strip movie, please go to the point. <br /> <br /> My two cents in this movie.
