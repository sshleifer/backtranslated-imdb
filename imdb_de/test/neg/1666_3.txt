This is probably my least popular episode. I lived in Cape Girardeau for a long time. I can tell you that there are no sea or shrimp boats, fresh crabs or clams near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland cape on the Mississippi River. It looked like the number plates were from Mississippi, which perhaps explains why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different states that do not touch each other. There are many roads inside and outside the city, and none of them is Route 6 or Route 666. All this inaccuracy was very distracting. Cassie also did not seem like someone who wanted to look around Dean. I did not buy them as a couple and did not enjoy the long love scene. Jo was more Dean's style.
