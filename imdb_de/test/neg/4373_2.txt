Cops Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon join five black, teenage offenders driving over land and land in poles when their delivery van breaks down. After a deadly invasion with a racist white garbage bitch with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors search the house of a blind voodoo priestess. One of the teens senselessly calls a spell to call Killjoy, who eventually shows up halfway through the hole in an inferior make-up job, making a bigger, smoother look as if he could slip off his head at any moment. He then kills the stupid characters as he spits out some of the worst one-liners that have been canceled since Hee Haw. <br /> <br /> The acting of the "teenagers" is terrible, the dialogue worse, the FX stinks and it looks a lot cheaper than the first movie. Although I enjoyed it in his previous Troma films, Trent Haaga (who tries to imitate Jim Carrey here) is terrible and the hyperactive superiority of Angel Vargas in KILLJOY 1 (who had at least a few stupid laughs) was no match. <br /> <br /> Another nail in the coffin for Full Moon Studios, whose reputation as an entertaining direct-to-vid franchise has completely disappeared since the days of the TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER.
