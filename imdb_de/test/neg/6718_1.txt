Lord, have mercy! Why was this movie made? Why did Seagal and up-and-coming star Max Ryan agree to be there? The Foreigner is so painfully bad in every conceivable way that it overstrains the mind. <br /> <br /> The movie looks very cheap. A budget of a few dollars was far beyond their reach. Worse, the creators know this and try to make it look smooth to compensate. The result is a movie that just does not look right. The fight scenes are so boring and "discreet" edited that Steven Seagal is no longer in good shape. None of them is captivating or exciting. The plot is a nonsense that is not in the least interested or unique. The Eastern European locations (a clever move by the producers to keep the budget low or non-existent) look unpleasant and should not serve as the backdrop for an action movie (what action?). <br /> <BR> And what about the title? As far as I could see, everyone in the film was a stranger. Which title does the title refer to? <br /> <br /> The DVD is a 1.85: 1 anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1 sound. They are not remarkable enough to guarantee even a single rent. The foreigner is not worth a second of your time. I have to love this slogan! "If they think they can stop him, they are absolutely wrong." Sheesh!
