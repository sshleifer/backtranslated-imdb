At this very moment I see this movie here in Tokyo on TV. Beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great climate scene where God destroys the Sheban idol, and much more with de Millean thunderheads the moment Yul and Gina are about to fulfill their love. Yul is doing a reasonably decent job to deliver his lines, although he sounds very much like Yul, who delivers his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders. Gina does a good job with the limited number of actors that she is meant to express in this role, but when the movie is over, she is completely transformed into a reserved, remorseful girl and seems to play in a mother biography Teresa I think "Thunderbolts will do this to you, but it's almost breathtaking how quickly she gives up her own beliefs for her new religion. The supporting players are usually terrible, they lack credible feeling and timing. The usual big battle scenes that went by for ludicrous dances in 1959, and an orchestra that ejects many trumpet leaps behind a huge chorus that sings a lot of "Ah's," but nothing of Hollywood quality. The last sword fight between Brynner and Sanders is on the laughing low skill level of a high school. The film is a big feast for the eyes, but not much else.
