If a movie can not keep your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over in my view. This concept of simply having to deal with a slow first third of a movie and being rewarded later is nonsense. A good movie has to start and end strong. It all seems to be interesting and some decent shots and a lot of promises, but ultimately messy and irrelevant. There are so many other films from Asia, many of which I'm sure most of you have not seen yet, would be the one I would really skip and look for elsewhere. Why does IMDb need exactly 10 lines for ratings? I said my piece and I hope that helps some of you move to the next movie.
