If a group of dumb children (including an unlikely racist bitch) stays in an old house, it will wake four murderous Toltec ghosts. Can Lash La Rue save the day? Will you be able to see the terrible comedy to the end? <br /> <br /> "The Dark Power" is the kind of really evil horror / comedy hybrid that Troma releases regularly. The thing is, they do not have. Let go. This does not excuse the whole thing, as it has a terrible synthesizer score (including poor Native American music and even worse "comedy" music), bad makeup effects (mainly Halloween masks), and cruel acting ( Ok, the fat guy was alright, even though everyone else is terrible, and La Rue, a western veterinarian, seems embarrassed not to be there for really blaming him, but the worst part is the comedy aspects Stupid teenagers are one thing, but when the movie keeps talking about the Toltec ghosts as if they were the ultimate evil, only if it turns out they are terribly annoying, bumbling fools, any hope of disappointment is the combination of horror and comedy requires at least some skill, there are no skills shown here, because everything is just stupid and not "so stupid that it's fun". I mean "smoking and listening to bad punk rock, I'm not stupid", mute. <br /> <br /> Not even a decent face and a chick in small clothes can save this catastrophe. Terrible movie, and not even worth a rent.
