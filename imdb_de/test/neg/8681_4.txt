On the positive side, however, this includes interesting information on a wide range of topics, in particular Himmler, the SS and its research department. It also has good piano music, interesting footage and excellent camera work. <br /> <br /> However, it is a very poor historical work. It has no clear goal, and the whole thing could be summarized as follows: Himmler set up a detachment in the SS to explore the origins of the German race. They went to the whole world. They did some things and made expeditions to all sorts of places ... (Nonoe of these ways was investigated, the results were not shown and the arguments were hardly refuted). They wanted to realize that the Aryan race and the German people were one and the same through historical evidence. You have not found one. The members of this research group were leading professors, members of the SS and therefore associated with the Holocaust. After the war, they were considered OK and intrigued the German institutes, but they are never thoroughly explored, and the program does not propose coherent arguments that either condemn or exonerate them. This does not seem to be the aim of the program, the goal of the program is unclear, it jumps from topic to topic. The witnesses are credible, but few and not supported. Unfortunately, this program does not know where it's going or why and it does not impress. The topics are intriguing, but this program tries to cover a large field of research and therefore does not seem to know what's going on. I would avoid that. <br /> <br /> Also the 'Holy Grail' is the German bloodline, nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology, except in the side effect. Mentions of expeditions to search for the Christian Holy Grail are made, but never obeyed. The title is misleading and the content of this documentation is not convincing and incomplete.
