Like the above poster, I was burned at the title because I thought I had the other piranha ... This movie is all the above poster says, and worse ... <br /> <br /> Bad camera, lousy Acting and just terrible story ... <br /> <br /> There was very little worth what it was worth to be seen ... How this movie was even published is incomprehensible to me. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want ... and not this one. <br /> <br /> The movie I bought was called "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha"! "That's what it is ... That's the only way they sold this movie. <br /> <br /> Peace Out.
