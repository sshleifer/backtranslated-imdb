A blatant rip-off of "Air Bud". This movie is REALLY about parents worrying too much about parenting. All the weaknesses of the characters (eg adult coaches who do not know the game) are so extreme that they are absolutely incredible and not funny. <br /> <br /> There is no glimpse of reality here, people and you will not develop compassion for EACH of the characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the good-looking kits (uniforms) of the opposing team in the dog's first game. Maybe chosen because the shot is near Arlington Heights, Illinois, home of Columbus crew franchisee Brian McBride.
