Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows of the last 10 years. The script for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's Kumpan, is about as pathetic as Wesley Crusher in Star Trek TNG and is played with just as much conviction. In this show people do not respond to the way people react to things in real life - everyone is polarized - everyone is either a pretty good guy or a totally bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2) minute conversation with them and then changes immediately). That's not how life works, people are not. This show does not take place in this reality. <br /> <br /> The plot lines are as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just run into people's homes without getting angry. She can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend back for her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys," acts like a hero from which myths and fairy tales are made, and time itself tends to whet. The lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths in this show are absolutely ridiculous. It's as if the scriptwriter for the role of Wesley Crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter for Bob Saga's funniest home videos (for the parts for "humor") wrote all the scripts for the show. <Br /> <br /> This show is for people who think that good always takes precedence over evil. It is for the elderly. It is for wishful thinker. It is for people who always want to have a happy ending. It is for people who want to be forgotten. It's for people whose favorite drug is their TV. <br /> <br /> I'm scared every time I even see a commercial for this show. My opinion is that this is the worst show that has been shown on television in the last 10 years. <br /> <br /> I used to love Chuck Norris, but this show has tarnished my mind forever. I can not even see his older films without thinking about this show.
