The DVD release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of Sandra Bullock. Her picture (from years after this movie) is basically the cover picture and the back cover picture and the inside cover picture the same picture. Her name is clearly visible on the front, all 4 edges and the floppy disk. She is the first name in the list of stars. Her biography is printed in a suitcase. This movie has to revolve around her character, right? NOT CORRECT! It's her first movie and she plays a subordinate role. After watching the movie, each role seems to be a minor role. The character Dog actually shows some personality. Less than an hour after I saw it, I can not even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> If I look at it several times, I might actually find out the plot, but I do not know. I think it would be worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait, I just remember a funny piece! Shoot-em-up video game fans will love the "Doom-cam". Looks like a first person shooter game. Hands and weapon pointing in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I'm not generally a film-critical person, but this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. I always expected some silhouettes to run across the screen, sit down and start making fun of it. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad that the money we spent on these (used) funds was used for charity.
