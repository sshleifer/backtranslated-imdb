This movie was the worst I have ever seen. No story, no sense, it was not funny at all, not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked so much !! Felix Bean sucked the main character. Susanna sucked. This movie was shot in 1996 and was really in the 80s. What else, I'll never let my friend choose movies again. Hmm, the movie cover said it was from the producers of supergroups who abducted them and stole their identities. Wow, what a waste of time. The only minute that was funny was Freaky Ricky, he was funny, especially when he and Emily had landed together. That was funny. All in all, it sucked, wasting time and sleep. Wow, never thought that such a movie could be made, so stupid that you look at it to the end.
