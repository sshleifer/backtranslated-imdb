I'm the only person who believes that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the US must abhor this omnipresent punch in their faces. A rookie cop first goes to a crime scene where her support is so slow that she has time to send the child who found the body to the local shop to buy a disposable camera. When he returns (still no senior cops, SOCOs or any other support for the pretty Jolie - that's New York, right?), It started raining and she can not work until she's confessed to an Amtrak for the Scene is not disturbed. <br /> <br /> I would like to know the name of this camera, because the photos were so incredibly detailed that the pictures are not distorted by the zoom !! The horror goes on: - not in the movie itself (pretty common, I'm afraid), but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr. Washington. This man is a highly committed Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with years of experience, who, instead of the well-trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiner, entrusts the work to an unskilled cop, a rookie cop, who seeks the overtly found clues You photograph them. This contaminates any object and DNA profiling is nearly impossible. Well, that was a good idea, right? I know you should be able to put some disbelief on hold, but those who think this movie is intelligent must have completely overruled their thinking skills to make this film believable. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4/10 for the great acting of Denzel Washington and for Miss Jolie's lips, which are the only things my unbelief must be exposed to!
