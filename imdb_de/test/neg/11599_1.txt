The Good Things First: I agree with another viewer who said Gene Raymond has a wonderful drunken scene. He does it - I was tickled to finally have a chance to laugh. And there were other moments that I enjoyed - Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the broken plumbing and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery, who wanted to jealousate Carole Lombard by making sweet notes to a stranger. <br /> <br /> But overall, I was upset. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the limitations that the Hays code has imposed on production. But that was embarrassing and terrible to look at. Of course I knew that they would end together, that's a romantic comedy. But it did not make sense, it happened too fast. Also, I can not believe the love professions when confronted with such hurtful behavior, both physically and confrontationally.
