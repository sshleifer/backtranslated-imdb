The film begins with beautiful landscapes of the northwestern landscape. Fence posts jut out of the earth, a freight train crosses hayfields in the distance, cloudbursts, small buildings on the roadside, a motel or a diner in the middle of nowhere. You play a boring but mysterious Twin Peaks arrangement that is appropriately atmospheric and atmospheric in the American manner. Nevertheless, director Jon Jost entangles awkward frames, blocks of letters, opening credits with annoying swooshing sounds, color frames announcing "BLUE," numbers counting for the "12 steps to conclusion" announced in the opening credits. In the first few minutes it is obvious that Jost, although he can capture more than just scenery and ambience, does not care. He has neither the penchant for Pacific Northwest, like Terrence Malick in Badlands, nor the time or inclination of Twin Peaks David Lynch to draw puzzles and intrigues to a specific location. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is more Jon Jost frustrated with experimental tricks that serve their own purpose. The use of split screens is interesting, especially I like how we split the first picture of Ricky Lee in half, one tells childhood memories that matter only to him, the other curses and hits his head against the wall and over it in the process The film features the second Ricky Lee, the casual hipster with the sunglasses, who is hopelessly self-involved and stupid. On the other hand, the stop-motion animation and the choice to play most of the movie in voice-over text do not work. At times, this is because Jost writes well enough to shoot static footage of the small-town American Nowheresville, but Beth Ann's monologues, delivered in the flattest nasal monotones imaginable, are a voice that sounds like Stephen Hawking's computer-language program neighing with a horse Crossing the ear, it somehow defeats the purpose of trying to pay attention. <br /> <br /> Each pair refers to our past experiences, its small triumphs and delusions and doubts and past relationships that have gone nowhere. They say very little and what they say, they say with blank faces. But they hobble like rabbits. This seems to be their only open channel of communication, perhaps the only one they can safely rely on. Jost clearly chooses his main characters in frameup among the na√Øve and insane people who are attracted to an American dream gets mad, but he does not put himself above them. He is not condescending or complacent in his portrayal. They may be misguided, but they are adorned with moments of humanity, as unpleasant as they may be. We are called to feel and show affection rather than show and laugh. This is the most successful frameup will be; The characters of the movie come to life, even if their expressionless faces do not, even if Jost gets in the way with his stilted frames and intrusive camera games. Then, going back to furious raids over the destructive effects of money played over an inserted dollar bill, we get a strange psychedelic sequence in which Jost's camera slips under large deciduous trees that will soon turn red beets red, while Beth Ann repeats the "redwood "Voice over", we even get a sudden turning point in plot and genre when the couple of Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, the losers in the small town who can not go anywhere and nothing that could hold them back, arrived in California are and decide to rob a 7/11. The movie does not rise to an emotional crescendo after the botched 7/11 job, as one might expect from a "few-on-the-run" movie film, it slowly shouts to a halt and one looks out the window to see , it does not really have anywhere else. Parts of the ride were hypnotic and almost touching and funny, but everything else was usually annoying.
