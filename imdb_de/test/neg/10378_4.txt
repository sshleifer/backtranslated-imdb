Is the Cannes controversy meter remarkably esoteric, or are we Americans so callous and cynical that we never read between the lines again? However, with much careful analysis, "False Confessor" at no point seems to be responding to the overheated controversy he set in Cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly sinister and aimless film that better lives up to his bleak American respect-titling ("Low Profile "). <br /> <br /> Building on the familiar themes of bourgeois anxiety and subsequent sexual liberation (somehow), it may be a film that is not without superficial interests. It begins with a grabber as a haunting shot of a deserted highway focusses on a youthful drifter who eventually passes a broken car where a brutal bull's-eye has allegedly left the driver dead a bloody mess remaining engine up. <br /> <br /> Before the school it turns out that the drifter is Armin Steebe, a product from the German suburbs with little ambition. He is constantly pressured by his caring but somewhat distressing parents to find a good job. He endures an interview with every haughty interviewer and anyone who has the same fruitless result. His previously mentioned encounter with the highway quickly becomes full and soon provokes his first rebellious act: He takes responsibility for the crime he has not committed. <br /> <br /> Pretending to fill more applications and getting more and more bizarre sunrise attends sunrise sexual fantasies and street vandalism. As the days get shorter and the nights get hotter, he continues to live in his suburbs as if he's not doing anything out of the ordinary. <br /> <br /> If you're confused about what's going on, do not worry about being the only one: this is about as far and coherent as the story goes. The plot seems to be simple enough, and perhaps False Confessor, for apparent direct reasons, is uselessly confused, in love with endless wrong conclusions, dreamy situations, and graphic sex scenes, to clarify a story in which an inaccurate logic lacks arguments (supposedly numbing the souls Impact of the modern suburban desert or something about the fascination of youth for crime Hey, it could even be a coming out movie). It takes a lot of time to create numerous symbols, allegorically both materially and surreal, but they do not really seem to symbolize anything interesting. <br /> <br /> The most fatal flaw, however, is how the filmmakers paint their characters in a coarse vanilla tone. There are barely distinguishable traits that help understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his more normal - perhaps too normal family) - never focus on the underdeveloped main character of the disaster. How shall we identify with the rebellion of this young, almost adult man, with little sense for the world in which he lives, or with the prominent people who surround him, who express him? <br /> <br /> Many people get in and out of the movie (including Armin's girlfriend Katya and a strange, affluent visitor who for some reason likes the fact that the protagonist eats brownies) and seems to exist for no Reason. In the end, they only seem like a long filling up of an already thin story with pointless subplots, which still prove that the film draws a total void about where to go next. especially in Armin 's nocturnal heroic deeds), it ends with a literal, almost moralizing head scratcher that seems to be stopping questions about a "story" that does little, but puts the viewer in a state of meaningless exhausted confusion. <br /> <br /> Without color it is impossible to shade something important.
