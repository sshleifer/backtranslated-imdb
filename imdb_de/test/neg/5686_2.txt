This film was borrowed for free, I had no misunderstanding that this is a very bad movie. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watches a horrible movie. So you ask, what makes this movie so bad that you only gave it 2 stars? Dialog. Due to the lack of dialogue, this film is perfect for a deaf audience. If you rent this, just turn up the volume to zero and drop any heavy metal CD from your favorite artist. I know you will enjoy it better. The plot of this holiday turkey was so laden with tech and geek that you need a translator for the narration. Well, for all people who enjoy good sci-fi effects ... um, they are not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes when they are worse. The actors, both, do not look too good either. They do not say much about the entire movie. Many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene in which the hero clings to a rocket and fires it into the city 70km away (it never showed how it landed). In the scene in front of it we see a robot guard with a cannon from a distance of five meters, and he misses several shots. It is also said that the political distinction between the antagonist and the protagonist is bio-tech and cyber-tech, but both seem to be cyborgs or improved humans. What told me that this was a bad movie in the rental business was the cover, which looked like a video game cover, and there was only one copy, good new releases have many copies.
