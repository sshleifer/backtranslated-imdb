Good cinematography, good acting, good direction ... can not justify a story that is and can not be acceptable to any society. Amitabh has often used the media to make this junk sellable by saying that if that happens, what then? I would like to ask him if that says something for your own child or grandchild (say, girl). What will you do then? I think all parents have to be extra careful before interacting with a 60-year-old neighbor if you have a - Jia - with you. Such films should be forbidden and discouraged, otherwise inspire more Nithari cases. Such acts are vicious and villains in movies are punished. This should be the moral of the story and not glorify his or her actions.
