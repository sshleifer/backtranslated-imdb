I hate movies that end like this end !!!! This 16 mm catastrophe is full of clich√©s, stereotypical characters, a generic, traditional "plot" and a dreadful dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this "movie" we have the aggressive Black Guy, Black Guy's girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian "Hacker Chick", the pedophile teacher ... Blah, Blah, Blah .. .. and then the Pumpkin Man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone will take the legend too far?" This question is asked at the end of the film. The tagline of Scream 2 goes too far. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** Usually I do not go to Verderber, but I have to scold .... <br /> <br /> A dream? The whole thing was a dream !!!!! This is the most modest way to end a movie. "I do not know how to explain it all, and we have no more money ... Let's make it a dream." That must have thought the director / producer / actor / FX type. Yes, the director is the character of Mr. E. He has done almost everything in this garbage movie. This is an end to be done ... And what about the client? Okay, he did the kidnapping! What did that have to do with the movie? Of course, the blacks are killed, the bitchy girl is killed, the teacher, who in the past had sexual harassment with students, is killed (he is the prime suspect) .... YUCK YUCK YUCK !!! This movie made my heart burn. Pointless, pointless and with parents Visa and Mastercards (which says it's probably still going to get paid), this movie is stupid, boring and just stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the credits. The way they presented the names, etc. at the beginning and the end. It felt scary. Too bad the movie did not fall! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points
