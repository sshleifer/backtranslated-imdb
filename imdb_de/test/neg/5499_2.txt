I loved Tim Burton in the past. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costume scenes were at first the kind of badly made, dull things that plagued the historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the scenes where the head was cut, which left me cold, and that should mean something, I think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and misty evenings, and the rider jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but the movie was boring and pointless altogether.
