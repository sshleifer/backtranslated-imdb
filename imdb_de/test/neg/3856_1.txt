A friend of mine who has a mysterious talent for finding and horror! - I like bad movies and recommend "The Pest". At the time I did not know how really pathetic his taste in movies was, and I decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The story, though clearly torn to pieces From any English sixth-grade textbook on the subject of "Manhunter", it would be amusing under the right conditions - good actor, writer, director, wardrobe and so on and so on, almost without end. These factors are clearly missing. <br /> <br /> "The Pest" should be funny, I think. I say "think" because I just had a slight smile throughout the movie. No laughter, no laughter, no giggling, not even a grin. Best a smile. And that happened so seldom while watching this movie, I even remember how many times I smiled - at best 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> Do yourself an immense favor. Never watch this movie. Avoid at all costs.
