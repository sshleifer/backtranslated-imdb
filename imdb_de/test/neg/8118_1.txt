Unless there is a huge ironic conspiracy, my chin dropped as I read the positive reviews of this movie. I can not believe that this movie was even released, it is so bad. <br /> <br /> I admit, it's not my kind of movie, but I've tried to look at it objectively anyway, you know, it's so bad it's funny and still offended by its terrible fear. <br /> <br /> The acting is cruel, they could not have watched the onslaught and I think there was one take per scene, it's really awful. It's the worst movie I've seen in many years. I would not even call it a movie, it's a tragedy. The gay black friend, whom nobody calls "gay", is only because he is so crazy. Homophobic. This is not good, in fact this is a regular vomiting. The jokes are dying on their miserable butts, the music is so bad that it contradicts the faith. The person composing the soundtrack essentially chose the most reckless songs they'd ever heard and put them into this waste of footage. Oh my good Christ, I can not believe the garbage of the 80s was so exhausted, I grew up through it, and I can not find anything special here. It must have been a dark time to be a movie viewer /> <br /> If you ever consider going to a psychiatrist this movie, it will beat you, you ill, sick person accordingly.
