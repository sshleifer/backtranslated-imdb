I just found out that "Komodo vs. Cobra" and another movie called "Curse of the Komodo" were directed by the same man, Jim Wynorski. That could explain why they are almost exactly the same as films. In both, there is a military-ruled island, a colonel who cares more about covering his tracks than about the lives of his employees, about people coming to a helicopter, lying comfortably in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragon gene experiments with amok. What differences are there? Well, the invaders on the island are now capitalists who want to reveal the secret of government, and there is also a huge cobra on the island. Therefore, the title is "Komodo vs. Cobra", even if the conflict between the two monsters for the two is hardly relevant. History.' "Komodo vs. Cobra" is more or less what you would expect given the title and source of the channel: the sci-fi channel. Although you will occasionally find one that you can address for some reason (I liked a movie called "Komodo"), I hardly doubt that this movie was "<br /> <br />" Komodo Vs. Cobra is not just a boring movie, but also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. In some of these films, there is an atmosphere that suggests that the filmmakers at least tried a little, but I see very little here. This is again an indication that it is just a repetition of "Curse of the Komodo". The CGI for the monsters look like they're coming straight from a second-class video game, the cinematography and the scene are bad, acting ranges from passable to bad, the action scenes are boring and then there are some parts, frankly, unforgivable bad. I see a lot of movies in which a person fires a gun many times without reloading, and I can handle it. But in this movie where Michael Paré fires a thirty-eight pistol and fires it about fifty times without stopping to reload - well, at first I laughed, but even then it got tiresome. That would be the "action". A monster appears, people scream, Paré keeps firing without reloading, and someone is eaten. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only charitable thing worth mentioning in the film is an actress named Michelle Borth, who is not only very beautiful, but also a surprisingly strong actress. Despite the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the script, Michelle Borth did a surprisingly good job, and it just worries me that such a good actress can get stuck in such a junky movie. She obviously accepted it for the paycheck, but it will not boost her career, I'm afraid.
