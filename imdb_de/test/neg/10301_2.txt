I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and also worked at Allison's Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital, and West Houston during his time at Allison. At first, the pictures of the hospital are unfortunately suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a similar population density during the daytime as Wall Street !! There are huge skyscraper buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest children's hospital before it doubled, TWICE! With its 1500 beds, Methodist is one of the largest hospitals in the world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is larger than Memphis. Still, the best pictures Hollywood could muster are those of a seedy hospital in the middle of nowhere (apart from the real picture of the hospital taken decades ago). In addition, they combined several real characters and presented them all in one (super-sister). I actually know the medical technicians who work in the blood bank. Two were actually in action at the time, but the movie shows only a pregnant MT. There was one pregnant MT and another MT taking the expensive patient antibody Rolodex (research "allo-antibodies" for more information). I will not mention their names (privacy). There was no nurse in the real lab scene. Hollywood combined these two technologies (most likely to save time and money). In the film, military helicopters (true) had to bring the babies (NICU and PICU) from UTMB to Galveston! Why would you ask if we have the biggest children's hospital in the street? Because the Texas Children's Hospital refused to accept her. You read that right, they refused !!! Since I was employed by them, I was ashamed. Needless to say, I am no longer affiliated with this facility. All the other comments would be repeated to those already posted by the people who actually live or have lived here.
