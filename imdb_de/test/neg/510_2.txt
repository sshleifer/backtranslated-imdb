It is disturbing that so many people give this film tremendously high ratings. Part of the praise uses such twisted arguments (and transparent agendas that betray a simple love for something that is in any way critical of the US) that they are approaching hysteria. The Heaven's Gate is a bad movie is basically terrible. Endless scenes with elaborate shots that serve no purpose, muddy dialogues, gloomy Nativa, no sense of any topic other than exaggerated ... <br /> <br /> The high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in the perception. <br /> <br /> Look at Lawrence of Arabia before you see the sky gate. You will see how aimless and lost this movie really is. The "problems" he has tried to deal with are lost in a miasma. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with films that treat the US per se critically, but when a horrible movie gets such undeserved praise Just because of this element ... that's a challenge. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing for two reasons; Curiosity and as a warning to young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw it for free at home. Imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through ... confused for 4 hours!
