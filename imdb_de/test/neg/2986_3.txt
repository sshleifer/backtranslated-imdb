This is a bit slow for a horror movie, but the quality is better than you would expect for the sole effort of a director at IMDb. The camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good and acting. though variable? is better than it is often found in indie genre films. <br /> <br /> As a leading actor, Robert Field is quite stiff, which is particularly unfortunate since Claude, his character, the narrator of the film as well as the center of is his action. However, it was the contribution of Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this film? and not in a good way. A turn is introduced in a clumsy way, and slowly becomes slow and overly verbose. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Pete Barker is always entertaining as Father William. He is the simple challenger in a pretty ordinary offer. As the first half hour aroused my interest, I was quite disappointed with the way things developed.
