Technically disgusting (with audible "pops" between scenes) and awesomely amateurish, "Flesh" requires a lot of patience to go through and is likely to turn off most viewers; But the dialogue sounds amazingly true, and Joe Dallesandro, baring his body in almost every scene, delivers an absolutely compelling performance. A curiosity, but the polished "Trash", made two years later, is a definite step forward. I suggest you look at this instead. (* 1/2)
