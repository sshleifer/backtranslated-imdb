After seeing the movie in a classroom and talking to the filmmaker, I found out why the movie was bombarded the way it did. The creators of the film did not intend to name the movie "8MM 2". Originally the movie was called "The Velvety Side of Hell", but was changed at the last minute by Sony Pictures in 8MM 2, without the filmmakers having to do that. In this way, they were screwed out of theatrical releases and condemned to direct video publishing with minimal advertising. Tell you what truth is and what hype is. <br /> <br /> If you think of the movie as "Velvet Side of Hell", that's not so bad. It's not great, but it's not terrible. Basically, it would just be a B-movie that likes to show breasts. But as a sequel to "8MM," the movie fails terribly.
