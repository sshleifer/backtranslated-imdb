I do not know why all previous comments are the approval of this movie. IT IS NOT BY A LOT, BUT THE LATEST MOVIE I WAS LAST LAST OF Clich√©s, Bad Acting, Actually No ... Very Bad Acting and Has a Stupid Plan ... If I Had Seen It In A Cinema I went out after the first 20 minutes. If you hate somebody, watch him / her watching this movie ... it's that bad. A girl who has an imaginary boy / boyfriend who relinquishes a relationship with a real one because his imagination is jealous ... but I think it matters that she is looking for her parents who also have some mental problems ... plus The character that should be, I think, the laughing crowd of it, the thing that should make you laugh, the roommate of Cal is a serious nut case, and I just feel him ... and the whole movie
