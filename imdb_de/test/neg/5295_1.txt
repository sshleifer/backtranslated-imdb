This movie is such a waste of talented people and the budget of Hollywood. I thought everyone in the movie paid a favor to it because it was all out of place, wasting talent in that dreadful garbage heap of a movie. It is a fictional act that is simply pathetic, unrealistic and does not even come close to having fun or interesting play. The only thing that interested me was the movie's many big names, which reappeared for no apparent reason and had no theatrical or good lines to add to the confusion of a movie. I have always expected that there are good things, because all these people were cool in other films. But it never got through. This film should be shown as a prison sentence, but that would be cruel and unusual. You'll be shocked to see so many recognizable faces wandering around such a terrible pathetic script with flat lines and awful drama. This movie reminded me of another complete waste of time with many recognizable faces, BIG TROUBLE (2002), which also dropped from the readable scale of the suction gauge.
