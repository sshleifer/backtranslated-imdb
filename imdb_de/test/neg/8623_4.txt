George Sluizer's remake of his own, superior film is a waste of time. Why was it even tried? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who has limited time) is abducted at a gas station by Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now Barney is portrayed as the type no one would trust on a Sunday in the month - he hops around like Frankenstein's monster, but without sympathy, and Bridge's acting is totally terrible. Sutherland gets a little better when his character becomes a detective with the help of new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). <br /> <br /> A major problem with this version of 'The Vanishing' is the obvious need to take care of it for the Hollywood audience by avoiding the grim ending of the original movie. Here the end is happy, which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely destroys the story. At the time, however, the damage was done when Jeff Bridges turned the bad guy into a huge laugh.
