To judge a movie only by landscapes, decor, costumes ... it just is not right, you're missing the core: THE HISTORY <br /> <br /> A movie has to tell something, tell a story that impresses you Yes , I was happy about the sea, the cliffs, the clear water and all that, but ... there's the plot? <br /> <br /> These are more interesting films with crazy people like: FLIGHT Over the CUCKOO S NEST ... etc ... etc .. This is a crazy woman who loves dogs more than her Children or is tied to their husband. Only a clear psychiatric case !!!! Nothing extraordinary The anger comes from "fishy smell", "sea".
