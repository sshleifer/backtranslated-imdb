Will Spanner (David Byrnes, the fifth actor to play the role in the series) stumbles into another bizarre case involving vampires instead of the usual witches, warlocks, and demons (he's in the hospital to search for his son's son) Seeing a friend who got hurt in a hit and run when they turn a girl who was attacked by a vampire in). He's catching up with Detectve Lutz to help with the case, which is about a secret vampire organization trying to pull together a business alliance to let it legally own all the blood banks in the world or such nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film takes the nudity and the simulated sex scenes rather into the background. (As you can expect from this series, I think). So if I complain about the lack of a good drama or convincing characters or even convincing characters, I suppose that would fall on deaf ears. If you are watching this movie, you are not interested in such "frivolities" and just want some "action". Unfortunately, the movie fails as well. All women are attractive enough, but the way the scenes are shot is just cruel. To do this more or less meaningful exercise in every imaginable way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Both Kimberly Blair and April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows full front; Aline Kassman & Mai Lis Holmes Only Show Their Breasts <br /> <br /> My Note: D
