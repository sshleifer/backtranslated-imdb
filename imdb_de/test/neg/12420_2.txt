This is basically your Run of the Mill, a violent biker band, with chic slangs, crashes and music. OK, so just clap and crash. It's a small difference to most of the other prizes of the MST3K, but it still corresponds to a nail in the kneecap: slow and painful. If I gave the story away, my energy would be exhausted, so I just say it's better to skip it.
