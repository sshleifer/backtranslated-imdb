Too bad. That could have been good. The main problems are the script and the star. The film can not decide whether it is a slapstick comedy (of a very uninspired and routine kind) or a revealing satire about the old GDR and its customs. Their attempts at the latter, however, flop completely. The film does not last well and the end is very artificial and unbelievable. All sorts of clich√©s about German comedy are sad. <br /> <br /> The characters are all stereotypes, and the main character who plays Kim Frank is extremely colorless. He just can not wear the movie and seems to have been widely selected for his baby face. The actor may not be all to blame (he's a pop singer) because the script does not give him much work. <br /> <br /> A plus - the replica of the East German "style" and period is good. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the movie feels kind of dishonest and humiliating. The film seems to have been shaken up by people who did not necessarily give their best and only wanted to get a quick price with a few cheap laughs. (If they did their best, it is indeed a sad case!) I saw it with an East German audience in the cinema and I was sorry. The GDR regime was terrible in almost every way, but those who experienced it deserve more than that.
