Strangely enough, I have very little to say about "The Box", so that will be pretty short. I have never read the Richard Matheson novella "Button, Button", which is the source of the film, but considering what I saw in this "adaptation", there would not have been much for such a legendary work. "The Box" is about a family who discover on their doorstep a strange apparatus with a button on it. Frank Langella shows up and explains how they get a million dollars when they hit the button - the only "catch" is that he automatically kills someone, somewhere ... ?? SPOILER ?? You press it? END OF SPOILERS ?? The whole concept was intriguing by itself, but somehow they managed to turn the movie into a confused Stargate knock-off that triggered it to a rather decent end with a rather profound message. While I try to be as "fair" as possible, I still have to say that this was not my cup of tea and bored me. I think it's from the same director as "Donnie Darko," whom I remember when I saw him years ago. "The Box" would have worked well as a short film, but since it was so lifelessly adapted in this way, I can not nearly recommend it ...
