The story begins in the house of a little girl celebrating a birthday party, and mother and father seemed to be more calm and reserved. They continue to give their daughter her present, which is of both, and it strangely stuck to me the expressions on the two parents' faces when they gave this gift to their child. It was almost like "I hope she likes it"! There is a murder in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, is implicated in the case because of family ties. Julia works hard to become a doctor, and this particular murder bothers her whole life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "View From The Top," 03, is a neighbor next door in the same apartment and lives like Julia. He finally goes to bed with her and tries to help her in a different way. This is not a bad movie, but it certainly is nothing special, unless you like a location in Canada and a good-looking Catherine Mary Stewart, a native of Canada.
