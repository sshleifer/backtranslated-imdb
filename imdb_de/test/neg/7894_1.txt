With horrible movies like this movie, it's even thought that Hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plots and worse remakes. <br /> <br /> I think the viewer is suspected To laugh, her butt ends over the 'black' jokes, the 'souped-up' look and the 'bling'. It's so unbelievably "over the top" and so bad that it even went beyond the brand "So bad, it's funny again" and fell straight into "totally embarrassing for everyone involved". <br /> <br /> I am very, I am very sorry for every single minute I wasted for this moment. I want my time back! <br /> <br /> Save yourself the torment, DO NOT pay attention. The only reason why I only awarded 1 point in the rating is that 0 was not an option.
