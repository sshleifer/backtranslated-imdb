This movie is worse than "Heaven's Gate" or "Plan 9 from outer space". I do not know why it just got an Oscar, it should have gotten a million raspberries, as well as the audience that either left or did not show up at all. The hospital was a first-rate financial failure, but I'm sure the elitist left-wing intellectuals who shut up were far too plebeian to the American public to appreciate biting social commentary when they saw it and on. George C Scott, in one of the most artless and embarrassing roles, along with the aging sex symbol Diana Rigg, spent most of the movie trying to behave increasingly vaporizing as they progress a stupid act. Poor old George faints and is only crushed by the incident, but after a lot of dirty talk between him and Rigg, he rapes her several times a lovely night in a filthy, crumbling NYC hospital that looks so disgusting that I do not want dying Pet rat being treated in it. There are also some sacrilegious scrap dialogues tossed around and also squeaky. Finally, the misconception is presented that unusual stresses without physical exertion always cause cardiac arrest. I never want to see another minute of this horrible movie.
