La Ragazza del Vagone Letto or Terror Express! As it says in the version I've seen, various passengers are starting to take a long-distance train. Three shabby idiots, Dave, Phil & Ernie (Carlo De Mejo), and it's clear they're there to cause trouble as they intimidate and verbally abuse the other passengers and staff. When the train copes with things, when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave, he and his colleagues decide to keep the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with Juliette, except for a hero policeman and his prisoner who wanted to save the day. Um, that's it really ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was directed by Ferdinando Baldi and is totally crap from start to finish. The screenplay by George Eastman as Luigi Montefiori can just as well be described as a really boring pornography like a horror / thriller. It's slow, it takes 35 minutes for anything to happen remotely, even from a distance. Overall, the film lacks the kind of exploitation elements that the Italian Sleaze & Horror delivered at that time. The film can be compared to another Italian production, which is infinitely better. The house on the edge of the park (1980) was made in the same year. However, it is a very broad comparison, since everything that made the house on the edge of the park to the notorious film It lacks in La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, there is no blood, no bleeding, almost no violence, there are only a few really tame rapes, the story has no twists or turns and it's unbelievably boring to watch. Italian Sleaze & Horror from the late '70s and early' 80s is not known for its strong storylines or great screenplays, but this movie really does scratch the ground in every way. The characters are awful, the movie spends the first 30 minutes building them up and giving a bit of background on why they're on the train, but that's all quickly forgotten and does not work. I hated the bad end and I do not know if I missed anything, but was there any reasonable explanation why these three slats would hijack a train? I do not think it was there. I'm sorry, but because your anger about a prostitute is not enough for one reason, the filmmakers could have found something imaginative and interesting, if not more plausible. In my opinion, this film stinks, it is as simple and straightforward as I fear. <br /> <br /> Director Baldi is doing a good job to be fair, he only has a hallway and a few train compartments to work with so I'm going to give him a break after saying that the film is very repetitive becomes. There is no style and he films the sex scenes like a bad softcore porn with terribly romantic sounding piano music. There is not a single drop of blood spilled throughout the film, that's right, not a single drop. Forget about any kind of violence and violence, because you would be very disappointed if you do it as I did. There are a number of rapes, but they are staged amateurishly and have no effect. The evil exploitation and shame of "I Spit on Your Grave" (1978) or "The Last House on the Left" (1972) is not here. <br /> <br /> Technically, La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is fine and the budget is pretty good, but the attitude has obviously helped to keep costs to a minimum. The acting is as usual bad, although since the synchronization the original performances have been lost. Fans of Italian horror will recognize a lot of voices here. <br /> <br /> La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a horrible movie. It's just my opinion, but I was bored waiting for something to happen and when it happened I never felt betrayed, I want those 80 minutes of my life back. This piece of crap is not even suitable for the 99p VHS bargain basket in your local blockbuster, which you should definitely avoid.
