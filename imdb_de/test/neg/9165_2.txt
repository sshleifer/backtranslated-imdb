After loving the animated series in my childhood, I went into this film with half-hearted expectations, and that love for me was almost destroyed. Jason Lee, David Seville in the movie, is terrible. I understand that it can not be easy to work with CGI characters that are not there, but I found his performance, along with all the other non-animated characters, really disgusting. The chipmunks were adorable, but sometimes obviously obvious when they took the plot of the story, and therefore did not persuade me to stay in the theater for more than half an hour. If you feel like you need to watch this movie, you can only borrow it. It's NOT worth eight dollars to see it in the theaters unless you want to laugh about the horrible acting.
