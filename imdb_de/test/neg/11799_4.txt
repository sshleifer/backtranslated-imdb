Ted Nicolaou has made many great horror and fantasy movies. I search all his films to see. I could not find this for 3 years until I found it unexpectedly in youtube. To tell the truth, I wanted to see more spirits and less conversations here. Apparently Ted had a crisis in 1999-2001, maybe in cash. Its features of that time look more like real low-budget Thrash Z garbage films. But I'm not saying that this time he's a bad director. Everything happens. The ending has some nice spooky details and suspense, but the whole movie was boring. <br /> <br /> only for true fans of Ted
