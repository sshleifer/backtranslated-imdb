It's hard for me to find the words to explain how much I hated this movie. The historic trial of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duc de Praslin is a tragic and compelling story that, in my opinion, had the potential to be a fantastic film, but failed. <br /> <br /> Although cinematography certainly had something to say, it could not make up for the film's awful structure, the poorly written script, and most of all the horribly overreacted characters. The worst of them were the Duc's children, who were so foolishly and falsely fake that it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Finally, in this movie, I was nothing but irritated and irritated, deeply disappointed.
