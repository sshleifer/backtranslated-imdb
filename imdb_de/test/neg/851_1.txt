The Italians are indisputable masters of the questionable "art" of demolishing and imitating films. They adopt an innovative, profitable and foreign concept, upholding the basic idea and simply adding a lot of action, sleaze and political impropriety. But what to do if the non-Italian original is already a notorious movie and difficult to beat in terms of sloppiness and controversy? Well, I think, just ignore everything in terms of story-building or style and focus on doing something that's practically a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slavery saga "Mandingo", published a year earlier. However, since the creators were too lazy to conceive another title, you should not expect that even close to a narrative depth appears. Character drawings, insecure atmosphere or thought-provoking statements about intercultural relationships. "MandingA" is a pure and simply a sexploitation effort, in which the plot develops only during the last ten minutes, ie if you have stopped taking care of something long ago. The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards, which of course is to be expected when dealing with rich and vile whites who run a plantation in South America. The elderly and extremely sloppy owner of the place is a widower (who has probably won some Mustache of the Year awards) who exploits and floggers the slaves who work for him. His mistress, who, if I understand her correctly, is also his cousin (?), Is a real bitch of a woman who likes to argue and sneak out of the house overnight to mate with crucified slaves. When the son of the plantation owner from Europe returns after about 25 minutes of pure operating time, the plot finally begins to develop somewhat. The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a few times (even before the slaves, supposedly to "demonstrate" as their masters do?), But in the end he falls in love with the daughter of the cherubic preacher. His romantic preference makes the bitchy woman obviously angry and she plans a cruel, cruel act of revenge that will forever change life on the plantation. Hello ?? I have just realized that this brief description of the plot actually makes "Mandinga" sound like an interesting movie! Well, it is NOT and I apologize if I raise everyone's expectations. It's an incredibly boring and disgusting movie to fight through, but if the topics appeal to you, be sure to check out the already mentioned "Mandingo". The film is less of a blatant exploitation than a truly enlightening portrait of one of the darkest sides of humanity, and it was also a well-produced film with real actors, great music and impressive locations. "Mandinga" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.
