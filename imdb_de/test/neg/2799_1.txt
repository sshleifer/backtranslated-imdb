I think there is a reason why this film never got close to cinemas. It was probably my neighbors in the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera. Acting is very amateurish. This movie is definitely not something you want to see if you are not bored. The actors even seem to double as directors and crew members, without "professionalism." If the directors and / or actors decide to continue making films, I would definitely advise them to update their skills and maybe to teach a few (ok, many) classes in filmmaking and acting.
