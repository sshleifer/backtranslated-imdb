Looking at Showtime, I got the impression that the producers had the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy on a movie in which they both play the lead role. Otherwise, I have no reason to justify the existence of the film. Not that it's not amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so ridiculous that the laughter is a bit muffled. <br /> <br /> The thing that really convinced me was Eddie Murphy's character. I apparently can not deal with the concept of someone who is a police officer, as a strict day job. When I worked on the New York State Crime Victims Board, I had to deal with all sorts of cops who were between the really dedicated and some real thugs, but I can not imagine anyone who thought that was something I do long, until I reach my career in a far away area. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job? Anyway, DeNiro is your hard-working detective who's on the trail of a great arms dealer. He is obscured and Murphy is part of his support. So what the showboating Murphy does, he calls a reality-based TV series like COPS to film the action. <br /> <br /> So DeNiro's bust is blown up, but the producer of the show gets some good shots of Murphy and DeNiro and chooses a new reality-based television series. So these reluctant partners get involved and try to continue working on DeNiro's case with all the television cameras. Eddie Murphy's a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills cop and the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly did. <br /> <br /> I think Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro, and DeNiro must have gotten a hefty pay for this movie.
