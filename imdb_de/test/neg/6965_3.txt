There is a part of me that wants to give this movie a high rating. Considering that it was made in 1953, this is a very courageous film about transvestites, which addresses the subject quite seriously and compassionately (and provides the viewer with much information on the subject) and strives hard not to stereotype. The film makes it clear that transvestites are not homosexuals and that they lead a relatively normal life in addition to wearing women's clothing. It is the pain of not being accepted in society. The story revolves around a policeman (Lyle Talbot) desperately trying to understand the problem because he recently killed a transvestite. Therefore, if you have adopted such a controversial topic (in the context of the year 1953), you must pay tribute to everyone involved in the film. <br /> <br /> After saying all that, I have to say, unfortunately, that this movie is absolutely terrible. Trying to depict the pain of Glen / Glenda (Edward D. Wood), the film turns into stupid (and sometimes surprising - again in the face of time - sensual) fantasies that make it hard to follow history. Acting is at best wood. None of the dialogues is real; The actors look and sound like people who read speeches written by others. And - worse - there is no point in having Bela Lugosi in this movie. This was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took in the final stages of his career. "Pull the strings, pull the strings," cried the poor Lugosi character (called in the credits The Spirit, but rather as a crazy scientist appears). And nothing he did seemed to have much to do with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> For artistic reasons, the movie does not earn much more than 1/10. For the courage, which is connected with the pure conversion, I give him 3/10.
