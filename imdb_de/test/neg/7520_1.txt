This movie is shit. It was predictable from start to finish. There was absolutely no chemistry between Pearce and the Mumba chick. The plot went nowhere and fell into oblivion. All this led to the film being very funny in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the guy just has to go.
