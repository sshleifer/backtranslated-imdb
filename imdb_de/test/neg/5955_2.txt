There is a reason why the world has forgotten these creatures: they are boring. This is a hammer production. Who made this film should, if possible, be hit several times with a hammer - and where it hurts the most. Most people are thinking more about taking a dump than these idiots made this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously now? The movie begins with some cavemen chasing an antelope thing. Now antelopes from the prehistoric times must have developed a lot, because here they actually attack and kill people. After that, it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models, and even a few very old, grizzled grandmas and grandpas. These old geezer have apparently never heard of cave dwellers who have not exceeded the age of 30. They refused to bow to the will of both logic and prehistory so that they could stay alive. One of the cavemen is not bearded; he is shaved clean. Not quite as clean-shaven as Tarzan, the man of the humanoids who roam the jungle since childhood without a razor, but nearby. <br /> <br /> What follows is the obligatory earthquake / lava destruction that causes many of our not-so-hairy friends to face their fate. It is interesting to note that the model models showed their breasts more before the earthquake. After that they must have become shy or something, because they covered their chests for a while (maybe they were covered in ashes, so I mistakenly thought they were covered). More action follows in the form of two fashion models wrestling in the sand; I think the next best thing to mud fighting. After crossing a large part of the desert, our black-haired tribe - how could it be otherwise - meets a blond tribe. Yawning. <br /> <br /> More fascinating things follow. There is this redheaded model who bothers when he sees a cave teens killing a hedge-hog thing. There is also the scene of a woman dying at birth: These cave models are so fragile. Finally, we meet a still dark-haired and skinned trunk, d. H. A bad tribe. One of them becomes WWF champion after actually defeating a huge bear thing in a wrestling match. 1,2,3 ... and it's done: the bear is the loser. We also experience a jealous cave dweller who miraculously recovered from two major injuries: First, he is stabbed in the thigh with a large spear, but he walks away from it as if it were just a scratch. Then he is thrown from a cliff onto a large rock - the blond caveman with two shoes, but he walks away from it as if he had been thrown onto a huge sofa. In the end it is unclear whether he has fallen on an even higher cliff or that this voodoo doll is crushed. Oh well, voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose wives are considered models. It is always important to learn from films. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is as enlightening as it is educational: cavemen liked to fight for the local power and they also loved their fashion models. As if every caveman who respected himself would fight to be leader of such a sad group.
