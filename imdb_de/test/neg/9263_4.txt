This movie is boring. It has many predictable plans and endless feelings from the beginning. It starts off well with a classic number, but seems to be halfway lost. <br /> <br /> Surya & Jyothika's chemistry on screen works really well and a good part of Bhoomika. Why is Vadivelu present? After half an hour he completely disappeared! Santhanam once again proves his wit through timing comedy. <br /> <br /> The melodies of AR will surely take some time. But he could have done better. Whatever the downsides, it's worth taking a look at when you feel at home alone or looking for a good pass.
