This movie looks good, and that's where my praise ends. "Love Is a Many Splendored Thing" appeared in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-colored nonsense like this coexisted with a groundbreaking art fair like "Kiss Me Deadly". As the trend toward smaller, socially aware films such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty" became established in the mid-1950s, other directors felt the need to stick to the indomitable, poignant melodrama of so many other films of the decade classified. and "Love" is one of the latter. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie from the fifties where the Technicolor is used to its sharpest details and the lighting is invariably high-key. Even scenes that take place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to hear the theme song again, as it's often played in the course of the film to last someone's life, and I certainly do not want to hear it sung by the shrill, deafening chorus over the final titles , Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable but everyone could have played these roles. Jones' role is terribly written - her character is unbelievably contradictory, and it seems like the scriptwriters always throw a coin when their character has to make a decision about something to decide what that decision would look like. <br /> <br People will undoubtedly tell me that I'm taking this movie too seriously, that I'm unromantic, etc. But I loved "All That Heaven Allows," the same year and just like Cornball in its own way Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, whereas Henry King (director of "Love") is not. <br /> <br /> I usually enjoy bad melodrama, but in that case I was just bored. <br /> <br /> Note: D +
