Mr. "Uwe Fail" hits again and turns a classic game into cheap crap. Bad action; Bad direction; Terrible adaptation; I mean, the Far Cry game was awesome, it's like a real FPS game, cool weapons and lots of point and shoot. In the movie we had nothing compared to the game. Well, we had something of "point and shoot", but ... I do not know how to explain it, but if you've ever seen another Uwe Fail movie, you'll understand. If you do not believe me, go to the website "Petition Online" and check the "Stop Uwe Bowl". <br /> <br /> This film made my eyes bleed, someone has to stop it once Do not waste your time.
