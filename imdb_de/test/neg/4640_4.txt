Another Day - This movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it. I really enjoy seeing Shannen Doherty and it was very interesting to see how well Julian McMahon and Shannen played the roles they played in Charmed. I can VERIFY the acting skills throughout the movie, including the director, but the plot ... what happened? I have no words because I'm still confused. I have to remain true to the actors who have done a great job in the face of the madness of the plot. I also have to advise you to look at him, because I would see him over and over again despite the conspiracy gate.
