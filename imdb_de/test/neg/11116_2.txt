I did not like this movie for so many reasons that I can not say all. I thought he was done bad, just for the whole story. I mean, who will believe that they captured the Chupacabra and broke it on a cruise ship? LAME!!! It was alright for a lame guy watching a video, but it's not worth spending money on. I can not believe that someone actually gave this film ten. But I think there are people who like this movie. I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was the Chupacabra and the guy was the Lord of the Rings. If you want to watch this movie, I would stay home and wait until it appears on the sci-fi channel. Do not waste your money watching this movie. You can believe me.
