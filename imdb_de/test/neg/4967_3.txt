All boys seem to be sexually excited by Mandy Lane. All girls seem to be jealous of Mandy Lane. But nothing seems to come of it, and the viewer wonders why? Mandy is beautiful and a magnet for every boy she meets, but we never get to know Mandy or any of the characters in the movie. Mandy accepts an invitation from her student friends to go to a remote ranch. Three boys and three girls drink and drugs. In the movie, teenagers drink alcohol like water and take drugs to go on a psychedelic journey. And there is absolutely no sex. In the meantime, the teenagers are gradually disappearing. But the others are all drunk and tall. Nobody, including those watching the movie, is interested or even affected. Nobody, including the public, seems to be damned. Emmet, a fellow student, is the instigator of the entire event. There is a guard, Garth (dashing and pretty played by Anson Mount) who guards and protects the ranch. In the middle of the film, the killer is revealed, the tension suddenly dissolves like air from a balloon. The events are completely predictable and the film is just so bubbling. Mandy meets her match, but we never know why - and at the end of the movie there is still no sex. Does Mandy hypnotize the boys, or does she just kill all the boys and girls? This totally confused spectator can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of the competition between women and men - by killing the manipulative girls and the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Is Mandy worth all the attention? The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to believe that, but not this viewer. The capable cameraman (Darren Genet) provides some impressive pictures, but in fact he seems to focus on Garth, who is an absolute stallion. Not all boys love Mandy right? If you want to get bored to find out how this movie develops, it's best to sleep in the middle of the movie until you see the seductress Mandy and Garth's arched step. But do not wait until something happens. Yes, you guessed it. Mandy stays virgin and there is still no sex. I rate this movie at 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. Why? Because all girls love Garth and all voyeuristic eyes seem in a compromising position on Garth. Unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never seems to go beyond a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to a remote ranch and nothing sexual happens. The audience is led to horror on a ranch - and can not help but wonder why?
