The most notable thing about "Talk Radio" is how bad it is. The voices of the callers all have a fake ringtone. An evening with an annoying big-mouth in a radio station in Dallas is told with the force of a sartric insight into hell. Stone seeks an existential revelation and instead receives an unintentional comedy. Whenever a caller uttered a "profound" (empty) point about something, Stone pushes the camera onto a face of his character, while receiving a traumatic insight that is never revealed to the audience. Bogosian works everywhere in one of the most irritating performances ever smeared on celluloid. Underrated classic? Give me a break.
