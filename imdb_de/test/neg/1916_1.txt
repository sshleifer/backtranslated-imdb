That comes close to the worst movie I've ever seen. The author will start you in a way that will accompany you with Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When he did absolutely nothing wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) leaves him to Kelley (Chris Klein). They do not appreciate what she feels, so her feelings with Kelley are not real to her and her relationship is wrong. It pulls you both ways and it gets pretty exhausting and annoying. The only good thing about this movie was the cast. <br /> <br />
