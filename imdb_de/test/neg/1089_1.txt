We gave this movie a terrible star, but it really depends on how you look at it. We are currently watching Channel 5 at 3:30 and are not laughing anymore. Maybe we could give him a 10, just for the entertainment value. We laughed from the beginning with the stalker's "manic" thoughts, which were passed on in a funny way. Is it me or does this chick from Knott's Landing look like one of the characters from the Dark Crystal? <br /> <br /> I will not ruin it, but you should be pretty stupid I do not think it's smart enough for Double Bluffs. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst / best movie we have ever seen if we played the clich√© locally 'drinking game, then we're wasted now.
