Here's the spoiler: At the end of the movie a little bit of you dies. You will spend the rest of your life searching in vain for the missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. They walk the streets at night and look in their neighbors' windows while they sit down for dinner. Friends and family will try to find out exactly when you have turned into a walking dead. They answer their questions and concerns with a blank look and some marbles about a runaway testicles. If AMC from Tomcats inevitably makes the "Movie of the Month", a number of mysterious murders will take place in your city. They wake up the next morning with a faint taste of brains in the mouth on the floor of the kitchen. Then you crawl into the living room and onto the couch. You stare at the wall, make yourself a little wet and start laughing. Because once you're dead, Jake Busey is actually damn funny in a thong.
