Let's see, cardboard figures like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform exotic drug tests on poplelites who have taken drugs and abducted them. You'll surely laugh when those pathetic excuses for humanoids get their righteous deserts! It turned out that the drug experiments gave them the opportunity to experience a different world ... the world of religious fantasy! - complete with cardboard cardboard demons that look like they're made of paper. Everyone is dragged to hell, except for a poor guy who goes to heaven, where he can probably spend eternity with the fools who created this masterpiece of the absurd. I think I would choose Hellfire for myself. Look at something else, unless you are stoned. In this case, you really like it! Could not hurt
