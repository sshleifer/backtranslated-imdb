The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle / African plains. It is a turkey and some. What it really is is a totally inappropriate material from the early sound and silent films, mixed with poorly recorded footage of the last (for release) men on a safari. There are scenes with a man in a gorilla suit, natives of the South Seas at sea (representing people in the middle of Africa), women in bikinis, terrible stories and a man in a loincloth with make-up all over the body (racially insensitive) I think so). This is a movie to sit on and make fun of - but with lots of alcoholic drinks and funny friends. At any other time, this will be a chore to get through. It's a bad bad movie. In addition, I am speechless
