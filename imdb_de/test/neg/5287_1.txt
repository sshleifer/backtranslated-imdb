The acting was very below average. They had Costas Mandalar as Triple H's stupid Waldwald brother brother, a Scott McMahon-like, as his deputy, whom you should probably be interested in, but there is no emotional involvement. You have the stupid lesbian. Not that I have anything against lesbians. Not only are I stupid, constantly running around in a punishment device like a shirt and a dirty hat, always asking if anyone has seen their dead lover. <br /> <br /> The Villain could be scary and somewhere there is a moral story about trying to fight age and death, but in this movie it's lost. Costas Hurst Helmsley points out that the victims will soon find their way back to the city, while behind them are obviously lights of the city. <br /> <br /> Also a false utterance from Ed Gein, but pronounced Gine. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We had our shares in Monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you will use it, explain it correctly. <br /> <br /> God, why am I watching all these horrible movies? Oh yeah, I'm a glutton for punishment and I look at it so you do not have to.
