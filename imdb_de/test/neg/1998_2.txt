I usually like Casper in his films, a big thank you to STARSHIP TROOPERS. But the box lid of this video SSOOOOO drove the tenants. In my local video, people rent it with a (PERHAPS) Borg like a vampire, and instead they get a bad rerun of Lon Chaney. It had great potential and was very flat. I really think I could have written a better story and a better screenplay. Why is it in any sci-fi movie that it (the cast) constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy? Has none of these scriptwriters or authors stayed up in science lessons? It's a pet of mine, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a WHOLE bunch of solar systems. It's like referring to a can of coke made up of six packs. It sounds even stupider.
