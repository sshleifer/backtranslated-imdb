I did not see Ishtar, but I had the misfortune to see the postman of Kevin Costner. That's worse. Maybe the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen, and if you look at my review for Moulin Rouge? that says something. Bad action, acting was inferior and even wasted (though Michael Keaton was in some of the worst movies I've ever seen), and this movie is worthless to anyone with more than half a mind. DO NOT SEE IF YOU HAVE GRADUED THE FOUR GRADE, as this is an insult to your intelligence.
