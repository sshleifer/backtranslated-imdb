What a waste of great acting talent. That's a shame, because you have to waste a lot of acting talent with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention others less known in America). This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After enjoying his "Kings and Queens" and this movie, I was totally bored and frustrated to the point where I actually went before the end of the movie. The film wandered in its central storyline (including the illness of Catherine Deneuve) and was distracted from any peripheral action and supporting figure that appeared on the canvas. The film also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters did not like each other (this was a story of family dysfunction), so the lack of coherent narrative became even more critical. The soundtrack (ranging from hip-hop to Bach to Mendelhson's Midsummer Night's Dream) was at odds with the film's emotional temperature and continued to hide any emotion that the viewer felt at the time. Photography (the director often started scenes with a mostly dark screen where we only see through a small opening and feel like peering through a peephole that then expands) was overbearing and inscrutable.
