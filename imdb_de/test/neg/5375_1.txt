I have to agree with the other two comments. I've been waiting over a month to see this great new show hyping A & E. What a disappointment!!! The show is pretty much about Ryan Buell. His speakers are belligerent, not scary. It sounds like he's talking in a tin. From the second episode, which lasts about 30 minutes (when you take out the commercials), he is tracked or followed by something he knows to be demonic. He can not say the name, if anyone has to tell this name, write it down on a piece of paper and pass it on to someone. Not very informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us. Why can not he say the name? ... supposedly he would give the demon more power. Funny enough, I always thought that demons wanted to hide their true identity. Knowing the exact name of the demon does not make it easy for you to eject it. Now the next episode, which airs shortly thereafter, is called "Exorcism". So does Ryan need an exorcism? Not to say that it could not happen, but the show has not provided any evidence or evidence yet. I can tell Ryan that if I was a little kid, hell if I was an adult, and someone gave me a small bottle of holy water to chase something that scared me, I was trying for help elsewhere !!! Besides, if you do not use holy water, blessing, etc. in the right way, you do not risk further angering what is already angry with you? I'll probably watch tonight, but if those episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it'll probably be the last time I see them!
