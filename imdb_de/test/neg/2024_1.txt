Have I seen a worse movie? No, I can not say that. That was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He should not be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. God, how I would like to spend my 2 completely wasted hours on $. <br /> <br /> To give you some clues to the "movie": <br /> <br /> 1. (I'm a man), and I'd rather have a paper cut over the opening of my urethra before I (seriously) look at it again. <br /> <br /> 2. There are a few well-known names (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They do not help and her career in the cinema after this "film" is officially over by the way. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue is the worst I have ever heard. "I want to ejaculate with your bozonkas." What kind of writer did you have in this movie? Was he still using Hook-on-Phonics and just mixing up his letters to make those horrible sentences? <br /> <br /> 4. Watch this "movie" backwards. Because I PROMISE you do not want to see it forward. <br /> <br /> 5. This "movie" would make Helen Keller stand up and leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The set of the movie looks like a McDonalds adult playground. I was just waiting for this so-called "Dracula" to fall into the ball pit sometime in the movie. <br /> <br /> 7. I also like that in the year 3000 there are still headsets with wires going to their mouths. No Bluetooth, no wireless headsets, no chips in the brain, but they use headsets borrowed from a telemarketing agency that went out of business in 1983 (Nice job set director in this area.) Really professional, I hope you're currently unemployed Read this.) <br /> <br /> 8. I do not know who is responsible for special effects, but I could have done better with my VHS camcorder, which has no battery, in my backyard. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a devout Catholic before this "movie". But since I saw him, I know that there is no God, because if it existed, he would not have made this film. I am an atheist now. <br /> <br /> 10. I'll be honest, I can not talk about the end. Last time I tried to explain it. I fell into a coma. No matter how boring you become, no matter how curious (or brave) you are, no matter how much laughter you think you will get out of this movie, please DO NOT WATCH THIS. It literally ruined my life. AVOID ALL COSTS! <br /> <br /> Comment on the director: I hate you. You ruined my life. After seeing this, I feel empty. My wife and children have left me and hate me because I can not talk or barely move after seeing this. I have lost my job, my dignity and most of all my pride. I will never forgive you in this or the next life (which does not look good in my newfound faith).
