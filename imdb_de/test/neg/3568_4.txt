For me, this movie is essentially like a pilot episode for a television series. It particularly reminds me of the British remake of the television series Wallander with Kenneth Brannagh. The people interviewed by the police are tough and often as bitter as the weather, the senior investigator has big family problems, investigations inevitably lead to atrocities of the distant past, and the conspiracy is a maze of strange incidents and subplots that only make sense in the end do . Both have excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Jar City's conspiracy is reminiscent of a standard crime series in the United Kingdom or the United States. You could effectively take the actions of one of the Touch of Frost episodes and transfer them to the grim locale in this movie and have an effective sequel. <br /> <br /> The script really could not be more obvious from the cookie cutter. You even get the most famous motives, such as the police going to the local jail to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who will inevitably explode at the end of the interview. I think it's scones and marmalade for a lot of people, but I feel like I need to point out people like me who do not go to the cinema to watch TV. What I miss was the message. The film deals with genetic studies in Iceland. The Icelanders are genetically isolated from the outside world and offer scientists a great opportunity to study their genetics. Many information about the heredity of the population has been preserved, and many genetic diseases found only in Iceland are effectively tracked in a population that has avoided mixing, and are remarkably genetically homogeneous (it's like try to put together a puzzle London Underground map (instead of a puzzle of a field of daisies) A ​​company called deCODE Genetics was trying to build a database of all genetic and hereditary information for the entire Icelandic population, due to privacy concerns This project ended, and at the end of last year, deCODE genetics went bankrupt in Iceland.The episode is a rich topic for debate. <br /> <br /> But in this film, genetics and medical sciences are not there for education, she said are there for a weird atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible movie, w If you are interested in it, and there is often a pathological focus on the food to accompany the events, like a coroner eating lunch between cuts. The worst thing for me was when the head inspector devoured a sheep's head. Unfortunately, this occasionally became a farce. The film attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the horrible with the sentimental, and in the end has delivered unintentional humor. This is cinematically the equivalent of trying to prepare Fugu. If you are not well qualified, the manual skills and the eye sharp, poison the customer. This rather inexperienced director should have lowered the price for his performance. <br /> <br /> I went out of this movie and felt pretty bad about myself and life in general.
