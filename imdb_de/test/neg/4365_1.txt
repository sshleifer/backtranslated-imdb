Some would argue that this is better because of acting. but it is indeed much worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement. <br /> <br /> the source from which all problems originate; the history. In addition to being shot in the chest with a shotgun and survived for hours without medical help, there is a bigger problem. Nic, the gangsta with the golden heart, is ready to do anything for the friend he just met that day. and that includes asking a wicked spirit for help. Ce-Ce, coming out of nowhere with a past in Voodoo, is ready to summon Killjoy as long as Nic can "hook her up." The drama is improved, but still terrible. These people could not convey emotions from a paper bag. the script does not help them either. stupid lines, and I can only accept no direction from the director. This script was read like Shakespeare in high school, with a teacher whipping her. <br /> <br /> while this movie (if you can call it that in its 80-minute runtime (thankfully)) is even funnier than the first because of all these things, it's definitely more painful to watch. 1.10
