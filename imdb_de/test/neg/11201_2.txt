Has this ever happened to you? I go to my local video library and see some new arrivals in the "Film Noir" section. I see a copy of a new movie I've never seen called NAKED ALIBI. It is from one of these mail order companies that offers (mostly) "dupey" looking hard-to-find copies. The description on the box sounds good. The movie has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame and Gene Barry). So I take it home and look at it. After about ten minutes in this movie, I started with second thoughts. About halfway through this movie, I started not to like it. Not only did I not like him until the end of the film, but I also despised him. The film begins with cops questioning Al Willis about suspected robbery. Apart from being drunk, the police have nothing in it. When he pushes a policeman and demands to go home, the police beat him up. Detective Conroy arrives, has the cops stop the beatings and announces that Willis is in free space. Willis swears that he will get revenge. Later, one of the policemen is shot dead. With no other evidence that Willis "hurts" about the beating, Conroy makes Willis his only suspect, even though his boss calls a pair of gangsters a suspect. Conroy arrests him, but Willis is released for lack of evidence. The next day, two more bulls are killed by a bomb. This time Conroy goes to the bakery owned by Willis and tries to make a confession out of him. Conroy does not know, but a local newspaper man whose newspaper accuses Conroy's department of police brutality takes a picture of Conroy strangling Willis and Conroy gets fired. But Conroy continues his persecution and Willis flees to Mexico, where Willis has a lover. Conroy manages to convince his mistress (whom Willis rather harshly treats) to prove to Willis that he is a murderer. What this film lacks is a compelling screenplay. The script looks like it just wrote a rough draft and started shooting before a finished script was finished. Things happen, characters change, plot rotations come for no reason other than what the script requires. Apart from the fact that Willis now likes to drink a glass, there is nothing at the beginning of the movie that makes us believe he is a mad killer cheating on his wife. He treats his wife, child and co-workers well. At the beginning of the film, one has the impression that his Conroy is the one whose loose cannon is. He seems to casually approve of police brutality. Conroy is convinced for no reason from the beginning that Willis has a criminal past. He seems to be acting under the motto of the old communist Bulgarian secret police; "Everyone is guilty, we have not figured it out yet." Later, Conroy shows his kindness towards Al's lover and his little son, now we should like him. We are sorry! The early impression I got from Conroy stayed with me too long. And he is also a stupid policeman. Only after he was fired and goes to Mexico, he checks Willis in the background and states that in Maryland a warrant for his arrest is issued. Why did not he think of that before? Because this movie did not cost enough runtime. The cast is good. Gene Barry is doing well, considering how bad his role is by Al Willis. I'm a big fan of crime fiction in the 40s and 50s, but not only did I not like the movie, but it also left a bad taste in my mouth (something that many modern movies do, but older films seldom do that.
