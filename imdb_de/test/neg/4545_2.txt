As you'd expect, there's a pretty good reason why this movie is so dark and unknown despite the ever-popular premise of the zombies and the lead role of 80s B-movie queen Linda Blair, namely: he's shit! "The Chilling" is trying hard? too difficult? A story with a deep and factual background, while it was supposed to be just a reckless horror movie about frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time for something interesting or important to happen. There is a lot of hustle and bustle about the cryogenics. In my physics class I learned how to study products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. In this film, of course, many people study the behavior of human corpses when they are frozen. It is needless to say that this is extremely boring until two gloomy night watchmen decide during a power outage that it is a good idea to bring the metal cold storage cells to the height of a thunderstorm. The coolers are obviously struck by lightning, and the bodies thaw spontaneously and live to experience a murderous zombie raid. "The Chilling" is a boring and surprisingly horror-free (at least for the late 80s) horror film that does not even exploit a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to create an atmosphere of tension and eeriness fail tremendously, and I can not imagine a reason why the zombie attacks had to be so bloodless. Despite the small budget, they could have done better. The set pieces, make-up effects and costumes are regrettable. The research lab, for example, looks like a real flat, while the zombies with their green faces and foil-wrapped outfits look no less threatening. It's a mystery how Linda Blair managed to get back into such an embarrassing, low-budget horror movie. She attracts lousy B-films, like honey bees.
