I agree with a commentator who says it's really impossible to check Glen or Glenda. lens. In this case, the movie would have to be judged to be quite terrible due to its merits, taking into account the hilarious, intricate dialogue, the generally mediocre to bad behavior of the performers and the production zero values. However, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely intriguing experience of watching this movie as it unfolds. It is not the fact that the subject of the film is transvestism and that in the fifties it was a controversial lifestyle choice. It is not even the plea for the tolerance of people who embrace alternative life choices that fascinate, except as historical relics. No, what makes Glen or Glenda? After fifty years, it's still a fascinating movie that Ed Wood has so bared his psyche that so-called directorial directors like Hitchcock or Godard never did anything despite their far superior talents. In Glen or Glenda, Wood is not afraid to express his own deeply confused feelings of being a transvestite, despite the request for tolerance throughout the movie. The conclusion of the film suggests that Ed Wood's Glen character will be able to "kill" his female Glenda wife by expressing the feelings of love and affection that Glen has for his female wife on his future Mrs. Barbara transfers. The psychiatrist even assures Glen and Barbara that Glenda will disappear if Glen performs this psychic transmission. Although Wood could generally argue for tolerance for transvestites, he was not so sure if he wanted it for himself. Besides, Wood was not afraid to throw anything else that came to mind on his screen. He did it with all the stock footage he could get his hands on. If it did not match, so what? What the viewer saw above all in Glen or Glenda was Ed Wood's imaginative world in all its fundamental strangeness. <br /> <br /> The only comment I would like to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria referred to in paragraph 1. I can not judge the strangely memorable effect that the film has despite its technically vile qualities.
