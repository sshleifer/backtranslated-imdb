1980 was certainly a year for bad Backwoods Slasher movies. "Friday the 13th" and "The Burning" may have been the best, but as always, there were a few stinkers that were not far behind, like "Do not Go In The Woods Alone" and this one. But fair enough, "The Prey" is not nearly as bad as "Do not In The Woods", but it's not great either. One thing is that it's just boring and the acting is not very good, but much better than "DGITW", and this movie actually has some attractive-looking women who impress all three female leads. One thing with the whole senseless wildlife footage just seemed to be pointless, and it looked like the director was using it to fill some time. <br /> <br /> So, what did you like there? this movie? Well, there were a few laughing loud cheese moments - I could not stand a giggle as the last girl made a bizarre, backward moon walk to get away from the kille, and there were some good kill scene darlings, because the girl with the sleeping bag suffocated to death; and the shit. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Prey is stupid, boring, and the killer, whom I did not find horrible at all, could have done much better with this film.
