I've never seen such a story of such talentless hangers that were so ungrateful that their golden goose could not lie. These monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. I was sorry for Troy when he tried to connect all his friends with Hollywood gigs, but as soon as everything got sour they dropped all the troy. Overnight was a deliberate attempt at a self-serving retaliation of a man who opposed the powers of Hollywood to preserve the integrity of the story. Overnight's simple premise is to announce the message, "Look at this guy, he blew it all up," when he's actually following a strong underground and dealing with heavy blows from friends and executives, all in the name of a project like that as he imagined. To be honest, the only productive element that each of these guys played in the entire execution of the Boondock Saints shoot culminated as nothing more than extra bodies in the first bar-room scene based on climbing their rancid efforts on their shoulders the Troy.
