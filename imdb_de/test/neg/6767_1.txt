THE RAP, the book on which this film is based, was one of the most difficult books I have ever read. Nevertheless, I could not put it off. Raunchy, rude, bad, indecent ... They call it, it had it. It also had some of the best characterizations of a novel I've ever read. <br /> <br /> Well, as far as the movie is concerned ... it was unfortunate. I mean, Tim Mcintire as Wasco? Wasco was the worst mutha ... talking to WASCO ... Mcintire as Wasco is as if he's occupying Tim Conway as Charles Manson. What happened to the MAIN character in the book? Small arv. He does not even exist in the movie ... Fast Walking was NOT the main actor in the book. Why is THE RAP even credited with this credit? The spirit, atmosphere, wickedness or drama of the book was not recorded in this film. <br /> <br /> For me, that was not just a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.
