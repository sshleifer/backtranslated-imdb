The idea behind this movie was great. The story of a little girl who is exposed to abuse (both emotionally and physically) and tries to deal with it and survive. What breaks the film apart is the terrible use of voice-over and the stupid dialogue. The actors always have to point out the most obvious things. There is also very boring, almost witty overuse of metaphors in voiceovers. The highlight is the little girl doing. Nice try, but that's a stinker.
