Eoomf was missing in this season, but as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood, Season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity, except for all the garbage that was filled in this episode in each episode You've probably had 6 episodes of real stories. <br /> <br /> Side stories like Pauly's mother, is she or not? was boring and had no other purpose than to further explore his character. I would have liked to see Bobby getting more annoyed with Pauly in this carnival episode, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> And that's it! These secondary stories had no real purpose and were not completed. If you finish these stories in the next 6 episodes, I would rather not watch them because they are not really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Disappointing is a nice word about this season and its finale.
