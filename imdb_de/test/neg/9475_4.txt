First of all, the twins are exactly the same. There is no one who is a girl and one is a tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate) and her friends are not even French, so it's bad because they fake the accents. Lamo. It's not that bad either, not the best. I'm a big Mary Kate and Ashley fanatic. Do not get me wrong. The plot is ok and it's funny to see. It's not the kind of movie you would see over and over again. But hey, when they were shooting this movie, they were still new to making their own movie. The girls behave as if they were over 13 years old. However, if you are a young spectator, this is a good movie. Not so good if you are older than 13, unless you are parent watching a movie with your kids. then it's O.K. Good luck MK + A with your future movies!
