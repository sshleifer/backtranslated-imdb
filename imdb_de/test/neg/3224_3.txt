This film could o.k. his. if not for the whole language in it. I think the plot itself is not bad, but I would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids watch the movie. I know that children will learn all the dirty words on the way, that's true, but parents should not support them by letting them see and hear the stuff under the pretext of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I used to like Robert Loggia quite a bit; He has an unmistakable pithy quality with his rough voice, but in recent years I've seen that he has roles with a lot of language in him. If we had a price for excessive use of the F-word, he would have to be a contender. I think he lost me as a fan. If I see his name in films in the future, I'll think twice about getting that title. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not proud. Sometimes I also use language, in extreme circumstances, but when we see a movie, it is something we hope will bring some joy and escape for the sake of E N T E R T A I M M E N T. I do not want to be reminded of what's happening in the big cities on the streets these days, and it's awkward to wonder if a movie is okay for my family or not. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modine, but it is a pity that he associated himself with a picture that lowered his picture. He probably has an o.k. Job in the movie, but I turned off about a quarter of the way after being attacked too often by other people in the cast. Why can not these actors simply say no if these scripts ask them to continue with this gutter language? As soon as enough actors (especially the big names) make a big splash, the authors will stop putting it in the movies! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend this picture. It's too bad, because I think it would probably have been alright if it had been done well enough for decent families! Thankfully I only wasted $ 2.00 for that!
