The hills have eyes is not a great movie with every aspect of the imagination. For one, the bad guys look almost normal, not what you'd expect from disturbed lunatics. For others, the tempo is sometimes very slow and there are many scenes. The characters repeat themselves. By that I mean that there are many fillers in the film, and many are wandering around aimlessly. The film had no clear direction. The action of the film is hardly original even for his film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out a few years earlier and is a much more effective movie in horror. The movie is not too scary to offer, and the lavish soundtrack served both to distract and distract. I suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much goes through the entire movie, even though its intended purpose was missed. when something finally happened The film had been ruined by sheer chaos and loud noises. I won out because I want to give a film the benefit of the doubt. Yes, there are loud cries, and yes, people are dying, but who cares? To come to any kind of payment, if you can call it that. My buddy liked it, so at least one of us got some. The hills have eyes, is not the worst movie we could have seen, but I doubt I'll take a look again. This movie was redone in 2006 and I will also have a review of this version. Anyway, this movie was sometimes painfully slow, while other times it was chaotic and repetitive. Someone who runs around your block and screams his head should stay away from this movie. A better bet would be the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973) 1.5 * by 10 *, which is generous
