The filmmaker remained faithful to the most accurate account of the 1894 story, which includes a manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) from 1846 titled "Our Family Trouble". To know that this is the only eyewitness account ever written. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy, but little is to be said about the quality of production and acting. The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely bad. It seems that the filmmaker simply recorded scenes of reported events without integrating them into a flowing action or action. If you need to know the story, read about it, it's a lot more enthralling and conclusive.
