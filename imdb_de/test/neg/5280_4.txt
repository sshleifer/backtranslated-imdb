Stupid horror movie about twenty-five stages (3 men, 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they do not know is that Dr. Chopper and his assistants attack and kill anyone who ventures into their forest. They use their body parts for some experiments ... or something. Also five students and two lesbians are thrown to be killed and show a split. <br /> <br /> Pretty desperate. The story is confusing and boring. the blood is ridiculously fake; Dr. Chopper and his assistants exaggerate TERRIBLY; There is a terrible black "humor" here, and people just stand around while their friends are being attacked, or just stand there and let people kill them. <br /> <br /> That was pretty offensive. There are a few pluses. Half an hour was pretty good and the five young actors are really good! Chase Hoyt is great as Reese; Butch Hansen is fine as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good as Tamara and Robert Adamson have their moments as Nicholas. Best of all is Chesley Crisp as Jessica - she was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes between these five scenes were good and interesting. Unfortunately, the dialogue was not really there for her. I give her a 4 for her performances - but nothing else is worth mentioning. Hopefully, these actors will get roles they deserve.
