For those of you who have some nice words for this movie, I suspect you did not see it when it was released as "Parts: The Clonus Horror." <br /> <br /> It was a terribly boring movie. It has missed the mark in at least three ways. It was not good enough to be scary; it was not bad enough to be funny (even though MST3K took care of it); and even in 1979 the conspiracy was unoriginal. <br /> <br /> Earlier competitors are "The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). It's the same idea (clones as spare parts). The movie is entertaining and had a good cast. Another is "Sleeper" (1973). Yes, the Woody Allen movie. Do you remember the flattened nose? And "Clones" (1973). The last two acts are not as similar to Clonus as the first, but they are older than Clonus. <br /> <br /> They are also several fiction books from decades before that deal with the idea, although often the word "clone" is not used.
