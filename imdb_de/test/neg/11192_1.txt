If you want a great April Fool's joke, then definitely show this movie to someone. However, it is important that you do not criticize the movie in any way, but talk about what an artistic triumph it is and how "they just do not make great movies anymore". If your victim observes many incoherent and nonsensical scenes (such as when a cute dog is stung for no apparent reason, a cow stands on the bed, a woman licks the feet of a statue, or Jesus appears to have raped a woman), you make many comments with words like "brilliance", "side by side" or "transcendent" - all as if the movie really makes sense and is not a complete waste of an hour of your life. Also, be sure to keep a straight face and a shock when (and when) they say they either did not understand it or thought they had all the art of a cow patty. To keep up with them, show them all the comments on IMDb, because almost all (except a few troublemakers like Almagz and Rooprect) are glowing at the genius and the art of this movie! When you're done with this little charade, they'll most likely think they're idiots and make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This is the ONLY possible reason for me to watch this horrible mess of a movie !!! That, or you could show it to the prisoners in Guantanamo to make them talk! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the famous painting of dogs playing poker or a velvet Elvis painting are artistically superior.
