It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing that can deny viewers this movie is graphic violence. In fact, both the disturbing and the cartoonish violence is the last "Oldboy" shortage. The characters are one-dimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. The "intensity," an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served by the cheapest means. Do not confuse a pointless shot of adrenaline with artistic value. At the end of the film, it seems all the cards are exhausted, so the script almost unintentionally becomes funny to find new levels of "horror" silly soap opera "Revelations" have already been served in large bunches. It is hard to imagine that anyone familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema will be impressed by this pompous garbage. Imagine, Homer Simpson hesitates in front of the cinema theater: "Should I go in or should I buy five ice cream cones for the same amount of money?" Be smart, Homer, go to the ice.
