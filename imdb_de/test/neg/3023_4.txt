There were two things I hated WASTED: the direction and the script. I know I'm ready for ridicule, but Stephen T Kay's direction is too much like a .... like a ... well, like an MTV pop video. It is (I believe) on digital video shot in front of an intrusive soundtrack, often blurred and often with a fast cross section. If you are not a teenager, stylistic approach will make many segments of WASTED unsurpassed. As bad as the director was, it was the script that ripped my chain. The story is narrated by Samantha, a poor, small, rich girl who spends much of the movie on voice-over (Strange as the voice never seems stubborn enough to come from the same character) and the pressure of her exams the pressure on domestic life, her social loneliness and all that has made her take drugs. For similar reasons as the separation of the parents that their two male friends (I thought she should be lonely?), Starting to take drugs. Oh poor little Sammi in her beautiful house and her problems, how my heart bled for you and your buddies - NOT. What WASTED does not mention is that no matter what someone is addicted to, be it a drink, drug, nicotine, or chocolate he has to addict to, he is not a victim of outside forces, he is doing an act of free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING have made this point very well, people become addicted because they want. Representing them in any way as a victim is a wrong paternalism and potentially very dangerous. <br/> <br /> By the way, when MTV are anti-drug drugs, do you stop playing videos of stars who openly admit to taking drugs?
