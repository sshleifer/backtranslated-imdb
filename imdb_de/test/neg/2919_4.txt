This is not a classic comedy for all time, but it's a pretty good little movie that you can watch if you catch it on a rainy Saturday morning and do not do much else at the time. Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb, an American who came home after growing up in China, where his father was a missionary. He came home from China to find an American wife and plans to return to China to continue his father's work. His corrupt hometown, as the existing political machine that controls the city, realizes that he is a perfect match Therefore, the current mayor continues to lead the city and its plans, which makes them all rich. Lloyd is not doing the physical comedy here, as he did in his silent films. He makes a convincing portrayal of Cobb with restrained, inconspicuous dignity. Acting was good for everyone, and the story and the script were pretty good as well. <br /> <br /> The movie was made in 1934 and has some racist language when it talks about Chinese, and it also has a typical black character era, but these stereotypes are not nearly as mean as I am from other movies seen from this time. <br /> <br /> Even though Lloyd's best movie is not around, he runs this movie and Lloyd is very good at Cobb. You will not be thrilled with this movie, but it may be enough for your interest in Lloyd and you want to see more of his work.
