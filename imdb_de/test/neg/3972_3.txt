I'll say that first ... the movie would have been a 1970s science fiction classic if it had been done a lot better. <br /> <br /> That is, let's take a look at the plot ... it starts with Peter Graves (or is that Clarence Oveur?), who runs for president, then switches to a daft college-like environment full of authoritarians in stupid trucker caps and headsets and retarded athletes who all pretend to be 8 years old shows a guy who seems to be going to America, celebrating a party, then being taken to a medical lab where he's being drugged 'Wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors pack vegetables for steam packs ... okay, it's actually brought on ice so the doctors can take out the organs they need. <br /> <br /> Then it goes to another stupid man who thinks that the place where he lives is a bit strange after he has found a beer can (of all possible action devices). In a river he sees suspicious (damn beer cans!). He and some equally stupid lovers of love that they need to feel like they're getting to the bottom of it, so he leaves them behind as he escapes through a large college administration building that contains some evidence he's cloning on discovered. ... and how he belongs to it. <br /> <br /> He escapes his controllers after he was shot and an old reporter helps him find his "father" - the man he was cloned from. Coincidentally, he is a clone of the brother of Peter Graves. After a debate over what to do with him and his evidence, he goes back to the facility to find his girlfriend (who has since become lobotomized to be even stupider, harmless, and ready, according to the SOL crew) to moderate a talk show). He is captured and placed in a cold storage room, as is his Nazi-built Retard friend from the beginning of the film. Meanwhile, a confrontation in the House of the Graves leads to several deaths, including Graves'. The reporter and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb. It seems the conspirators have won to a degree ... <br /> <br /> Peter Graves has proven himself to be able to survive by beating the cloned parts with a metal poker and another Voice for me 'speech while reporters deal with him about cloning. <br /> <br /> Definitely MST3K feed, but at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of the overall bad situation.
