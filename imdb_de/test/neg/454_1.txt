Of the weeks and weeks of advertising, "The One" by ABC should be "The Real World" and "American Idol." We should watch these singers living together in a house and competing with each other. The drama! The voltage! <br /> <br /> Where does one begin with this cruelty? Let's start with the "judges" who are referred to as "Music Experts" in this program. "Experts" imply that they have expertise. Andre Harrell had at least one pedigree. He was temporarily responsible for Motown Records. The other two ... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who could be described as Mr. Weird Beard. He dyed his facial hair with three distinctly different fluorescent colors. I wonder how scary he was with a black light! And the Paula Abdul wannabees who did something that I did not believe could happen: She was still sultry and more laid-back than Paula! She then corrected herself and became very critical after the first episode. The farce of the "reviews" offered by these three was a real joke and an insult, not only for finding the best vocalist, but also for the audience, which is now quite clever enough to have done so many times with Fox /> <br /> There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was not a Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as weak as possible. He actually sucked on how little energy there was in the program, dry. How he got this job was the second biggest puzzle of the show. <br /> <br /> The eleven competitors were selected first for this program. This was literally a talent-free talent show. OK. Maybe that's an exaggeration. Granted, the performers must all be relatively close to the ability, because if that were not the case, there would be no "competition." If only one person were "good," there would be no "tension." I understand that they all had to be comparable. But everyone should have had some chops! In addition, the judges held a "Singing Academy", so that the program was also part of "Fame". Obviously, these performers urgently needed these lessons. But you need some extremely talented people to bring talent to people with little talent. And that was definitely not what happened here. <br /> <br /> Casting the show seemed to focus on the "homelife" elements, as all players were equally attractive parts of how badly they spoke out. But the filmed scenes in her house were so sliced ​​and sliced ​​that you did not get into the stories that were going on, so the show did not capture the events there. <br /> <br /> Equally Bad When all of this was thought out, "The One" had an incredible, unbelievable, deadly design flaw incorporated into the results, making it totally ridiculous like "AI". But then, after the audience vote became known, the last three contestants had to sing one last song. The "music experts" chose one person out of the three on the basis of this performance to save for the following week. And then, the safe participants could choose who they wanted to hold for the remaining two, and send the remaining participants home. <br /> <br /> The "design flaw" was that the participants had the last word. I mean, if you've been to a music contest and wanted to go as far as possible, would you choose to make the better singer, or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Anyone watching the first season of CBS "Survivor" could answer that! And that's exactly what happened in the program. The person with the better potential was lost and the participants chose "the one who had no talent at all"! The candidate, who has just been rescued by the "experts" from below, was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the "experts", if they let the candidates vote first, would save the better of two evils. However, this only confirms that this broadcast was not yet ready for broadcast, how unsatisfactory the whole process was, and how misleading the producers were to try.
