Christian propaganda ... Much anxiety disorder ... <br /> <br /> This is not a scifi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction). From then on, it was all about God, the Bible, and the devil. The UFOs are really just demonic deception to get people to believe that there is another intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to make you believe it could be more in life than in the Bible. The kidnappings could serve to explain the ecstasy. Those left behind would believe that it was a mass kidnapping by aliens instead of God bringing all Christians to Heaven. No reason to repent when it comes to foreigners. The deeper message in the film is that if you do not believe in God and have a life in your life, then you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose.
