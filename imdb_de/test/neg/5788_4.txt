Someone commented that Charlie Sheen's character should be brought to justice for doing what he wanted. You may be right, but that's how SEALs are. I spent several months working for a SEAL team in Norfolk, VA. Actually, I should say that they have used our ship for a few months throughout Europe. I was the postal worker on board and every day these guys tried to get their mail. Since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail every day, a passport was issued for one person. Every day, another SEAL appeared and pretended to be someone else. After the third time, I said no to them until I had proof of who they were. They went NUTS !!! I thought they would break through my cage, gag me and then steal the post. Fortunately, not only did I have the president by my side (The Navy), but also the federal government (US Mail). That was the only time I saw that the SEALs did not have what they wanted. They were allowed unlimited land leave, where we had to be back on the ship at a certain time. They killed and tortured a woman in France, and the two SEALs were held on the ship for only a week, while a sailor was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine store and receiving a court-martial. Is it any wonder that the retention rate of SEAL is over 85%? As a SEAL, you are God. So, in this movie, it's pretty much what a SEAL behaves and thinks ... Unfortunately, it's so unbelievable to ordinary people that it seems like a fake.
