I have indefinite memories that this movie is funny. <br /> <br /> After I saw him again, I either changed or I thought about another movie. <br /> <br /> It seems we are supposedly sympathetic to Jackie Mason's character, but nothing in the movie actually creates that emotion. It is noteworthy that he is really the only person to be given a tender dialogue with relatives. No other character has the status of a vaguely human character. <br /> <br /> I do not like golf, but as the movie went on, I really found myself on Robart Stack and the club guys, hoping they would push Mason and Chevy Chase out.
