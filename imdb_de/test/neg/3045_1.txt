As for a routine that babysitting should have made in a secluded lakeside home to a night of horror, high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is threatened by a sadistic stalker while she tries to take a step forward to stay br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good, but from there it went downhill. The remake lasts the first 20 minutes and extends it to an 80-minute feature film. That's a good idea, because it eliminates everything that made the original bad. But if they wanted this movie to work more effectively, they should have hired a better actress, better director, screenwriter, and so on. There is no reason, everything can be found out before it happens, and it's a very boring movie because not much happens. At least there is not much to do, as it is less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premise works, the lead actress has to deliver a realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen and throughout the movie she seemed to read her lines. You get a starring role in a Hollywood movie that is watched by millions of people, and you make no effort! Why did you hire this girl? Sure, she's pretty, but she can not act at all. However, I think that this does not matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this movie. The rest of the cast is bland and especially the woman who plays the girl, pink, forgotten. Even the stranger was lame and his phone lines were not effective at all. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the disappointing horror movie Boogeyman from the last years. This movie was a bunch of cheap fear and false alarms, and When a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same thing. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise, but it's just a false alarm like a cat or a maid. This kind of scene keeps happening until after about 50 minutes the stranger appears. He must be one of the lame killer ever. He wore no weapons and did not seem to be a big threat. The end is bad, but it fits the rest of the movie, so it does not matter. The film is directed by Simon West and it is really bad for him to build tension. He used every clich√© he could think of and the results were not very good. The house was fantastic and I give the film the credit for it. It was an isolated house, so pretty scary, but that's about the only good thing this movie has to offer. If you are not a teenager, you should skip the movie. Rating 2/10
