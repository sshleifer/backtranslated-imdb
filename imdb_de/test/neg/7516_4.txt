Did you know that they want the moon for a real escavation? And in Geneve there is the controversial project that could make a time machine possible. Anything I can say about this movie, based on facts about the future (at the time of the film) scientific projects, but real. I hope the moon will not be like in the movie. Well, about the movie itself, I also saw the original movie and also read the book. I did not like the book, but the movie yes. I totally agree with a previous comment that this film was depressing, unlike the 60s. That was very good by force, this was just a parallel future of what is good movie.
