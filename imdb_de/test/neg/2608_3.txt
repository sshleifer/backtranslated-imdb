It had its moments, but overall, when I saw this cartoon as a kid, I got bored. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was a cartoon, probably my first encounter with anime. It's also one of my least loved anime. I remember others involved in a huge ship in space that made no sense but was more fun because it was in space. I also remember one with these people, dressed like birds that were a bit strange, but more entertaining. While I do not really like car racing, I did not do it back then and that's probably one of the reasons why I'm not interested in this show, even though I'm an avid anime fan today. The characters were also a bit stupid, and then there were the horrible scenes in which there was almost no action that was probably used to lower the animation costs and play the show. The gadgets in the cars, however, were cool and then made for entertainment. Overall, I find this show rather unsurpassed compared to newer anime and some from the same era, but this is just a personal opinion. I am sure that many other critics love the show, which is cool.
