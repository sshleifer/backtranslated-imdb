I found that on the shelf and fainted with joy !! I danced to the counter, knocked down my money and ran home! You know what?! I fell asleep less than half! I tried it again the next day ... YAWN !! What the hell !?!! I could NOT see it! I love all the other things he did (I have not seen that with the monster yet). What gives? Am I Or him? So sad. Boo-Hoo P.S, I liked the camera work.
