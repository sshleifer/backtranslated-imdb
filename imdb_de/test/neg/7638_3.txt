I'm sorry people, but these rave reviews on this prestigious site about this movie "Respiro" are very strange, to say the least. Is madness picturesque, I ask and found no answer. Of course, the film is beautifully filmed, sometimes almost a documentary. However, the fact is that when it comes to the women of Grazia, she shows every sign of a deep illness, and throughout the movie I wondered what the hell she has. Their behavior is extremely worrying and the (shocked) citizens of the village are really right if they want to send them to a proper facility to see what can be done about their condition. She urgently needs a treatment! A behavior like hers is an inferno for all around her, her husband, the poor children (especially) and the fellow citizens. Let's not be wrong romantic! I hated this kind-hearted portrait of a mental patient. WHY, for heaven's sake, should not the husband want to heal her or at least try her? Why the horror of going to Milan (a big city, sure, but many opportunities for capable people to heal them)? Parochialism? Irresponsibility? Anyway, I got inspired on this page to rent the movie on DVD and after seeing it, I had to post it here so others could get an opinion on it. Honestly, I understand why the movie did not go on as a reference to the Cannes selection ...
