This would have to be considered one of the worst films of all time. The film was shown at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After the screening, not only did I want my money refunded, I also wanted to return the 1.5 hours of my life. I have a very broad tolerance when it comes to the indulgences of some European films, but this is one of the films selected for festivals based solely on the filmmaker's reputation. This film proves that while this selection can satisfy the ego of the filmmaker and jury selection, it does not please the audience. There is no character development, the plot is a messy mess, the style is nonsensical, the selection of shots is scary and the editing is worse. At the end of the first role, you ask yourself if you have gone to the wrong cinema, and at the end of the third role you will beg to be released from your misery. This movie is an abomination.
