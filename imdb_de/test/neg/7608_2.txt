I saw a movie called Dark Talon from 1974. The credits for this movie are exactly the same as for Dark Star. So I assume that this is an alternative title. Dark Talon was not nearly as funny as anyone else here. The acting was lame, the cut hatch and altogether stupid. It starts with an annoying 1970s trucking called "Benson, Arizona," which has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Basically, the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber going around unstable bomb sites. The bombs are sentient and react to people. The compulsory disaster disturbs the communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crew members goes out and conducts an absurdly idiotic, existential conversation with the bomb that makes no sense at all. The movie I saw was completed in less than an hour and a half, with commercials thrown, so I suspect that Dark Talon is an overrated version of Dark Star. The Alien is an inflatable red water polo spray painted with a pair of monster hands on which it runs. It was silly and unconvincing as an alien. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that John Carpenter was there. His other films were so much better.
