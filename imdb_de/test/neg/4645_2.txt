After reading _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can not express how disappointed I was with this movie. While I agree that a certain poetic license may be permissible, this film is in constant opposition to the books and does an incredible injustice to the exciting, plausible and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the authors, directors and producers of the film have never heard of Mr. Smith, let alone read his work. Smith's vivid characterizations are transformed into wooden stick figures, all histories are ignored or reduced, the realism of the books has been changed to include phantom monsters that are more suitable for a cartoon. And why does an Egyptian stooge speak Spanish? Geesh, no wonder the movie became a TV miniseries! Did Wilbur Smith influence the making of this film? I can not believe he did it. Terrible, horrible movie. If you have read one or both books, do not waste your time or money looking at that money. You will be very disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Only a moment of extreme generosity persuaded me to give this movie a ranking of '2', and that only because of the beautiful, sometimes spectacular photography.
