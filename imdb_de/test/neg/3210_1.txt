Now this is a real turkey of the overrated director Franco, who gave us classics like "Las Vampiras / Vampyros Lesbos". Yes, I think that bad movies can be great fun. I adore the funny howlers of Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood Jr., but this was too much for me. It is the first movie I rated with 1. Where should I start? The script is absolutely idiotic. The dialogue is unbelievably bad. The director does not seem to exist. The best music cue (used repeatedly in this movie) was taken directly from the movie "The Witcher" (1964). And it is boring! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one shot, Sanders reads a popeye comic while his henchman tortures a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). The only thing that baffled me was that Franco immediately showed female nudity when I thought the movie would benefit - that's real directing ability! However, I am afraid that a movie in which actors pretend to shoot with machine guns is not really worthwhile.
