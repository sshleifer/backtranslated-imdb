I remember walking through the channels of HBO and seeing this. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There is no excitement in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure) driving in a trance to a small town. She stays with a couple who happens to have a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looks exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the citizens agree that they looked the same. What's up, Laura was killed over a year ago. Her boyfriend was missing about the same time she was murdered. It looked as if he had killed her. <br /> <br /> When Drew settled in this city, he begins to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares could prove that Laura's friend is not the killer. Throughout the film, you find out that Ray Ordwell Senior (Denis Arndt) is the one who has frequently raped and killed her over time. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long and boring. The film just keeps going on and on and on and on. Amazingly, after the so-called (cloned) 1997 I saw another TV movie, which was good, but later discussed again. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 out of 10 stars. Avoid this TV movie. It is not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!
