Well, I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I admit, zombie movies are usually not that good, but I like them anyway. Despite the crappy theatrical and worthless dialogues found in almost all zombie movies, this is by far the worst. There are a few basic rules for zombie movies. 1. Zombies are suicidal. Tactics are rarely used and NEVER look like a boxer. They do not hit the head, they take him with an ugly smile. They do not try to punch you in the face, they grab your arm and bite it! 2. Zombies can not speak. Only in bad dead. Otherwise, they do not speak. 3. They do not fight zombies with melee weapons. They lose in close combat against zombies. Firearms are used. But in this movie, melee is the way to go, which is wrong. Very wrong. <br /> <br /> It had NO redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a zombie movie, you will find a movie with an average rating over 3 at IMDb.com
