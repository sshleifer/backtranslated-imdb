Amazing that such a thing could find its way to be seen by the public. I knew it was from Uwe Boll, and I found it in a $ 2 store (still quite steep, considering) in the bargain basket, but curious curiosity made me see this and: I'm pretty sure that this is a rip-off of Seven, Silence of the Lambs and American Psycho, all in one, with a dialogue possibly written by Preteens. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the main character, and he's so bizarre and scary that everyone knows he has to be the crazy serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays the "good cop" who invites a serial killer to her home for a home-cooked dinner, and what does she get for her annoyance? I'll let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" police officer who drives a VW bug in the new style, that is with a siren. A VW bug ... that scares the criminals when they see it. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien separates from his fianc√©e, but she still has a "non-engaged" party with "no wedding cake". Imagine that everyone is surprised that he shows up (he was of course invited) and they all get shot. <br /> <br /> 6). Actually, this should really have been number 1. The killer in this one is known as "The Monkey Maker". This is undoubtedly the dumbest killer name anyone could have found in a million years. Presumably, it has something to do with "Do not see anything bad, do not hear anything bad, do not speak evil" with monkeys. It's possible that monkeys had something to do with the script as well. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh yes, and there is a club Van Dien visited at the beginning of the movie. There's bad disco music, I mean, really bad, and a fenced cage where gang members hit each other with baseball bats. That's what it looked like. And of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The really cool stuff (?!) Continues in the basement, where a questionable "actor" gets a woman to sign a confession before she gets shot, a snuff film? Not exactly sure how that fits in with the rest of the movie, and probably Boll was not. So if he was not worried, then I'm not worried. <br /> <br /> An unbelievable piece of entertainment that gives you the feeling of seeing something from a parallel universe. A parallel universe that is KIND like ours, but where things are just enough where they do not seem right. You entered "The Boll Zone". Finish as soon as possible and do not look back. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points.
