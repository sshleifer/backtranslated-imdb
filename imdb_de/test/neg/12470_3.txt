The beginning of the film was confusing and the rest was predictable. It was just one of those movies I came across in my Netflix queue, and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips reunite since Bully. Unfortunately, "interesting" never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does whatever she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the guys (Renfro) out of the "crowd" and finally starts to hang out with them. And of course, as with all other movies, things are good (or you assume, since the movie never points out that things are good) and then things do not get so good when you hang out with the rich kids. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It's just a dead lifeless movie, after you've seen it, you feel like you could have done anything better. Some scenes (those with Renfro's parents) do not even make sense in the movie because the director and the author did not even comment on it. <br /> <br /> All interesting things COULD played through, it was simply completely ignored and that's almost like watching an episode in front of the star (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from the OK). <br /> <br /> The only bright light in this movie, and the reason why it does not get an ONE rating from me, is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her. Renfro just looks like he brought something from Bully. And for heaven's sake, the title is BS, change the name.
