This film is poorly written, difficult to follow and offers poor performances and dialogues by the leaders Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The premise, which is believable but weak (a masked narcotic drug that succumbs to the drug underworld), deserves more than that flop of Lili Fini Zanuck. The competent minor cast (Sam Elliott, William Sadler and others) was not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film contains the absolute worst "love scene" in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Also, the soundtrack is heavily overrated. Especially the repulsive, sappy-without-substance "Tears in Heaven" by the otherwise legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is completely uncomfortable from start to finish. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
