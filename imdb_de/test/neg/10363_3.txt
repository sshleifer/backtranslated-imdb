... Or even better, look at Fandango if you want to see a really smart and fun street stripe for college-age men. Rolling Kansas sounded promising (in fact, the program guide gave 2.5 out of 4 stars, which usually means he's pretty good at seeing), but I'm fast forwarding pretty fast. Usually Road Trip movies have great music, but I can not remember if there was music. The only highlight was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise, the jokes and the timing have missed all the way. The four main characters are unknown actors, and I do not remember seeing them in another movie. (Oh yes, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was there, but he is good at everything, bad or indifferent). This movie is as funny as someone else who is stoned when you are not.
