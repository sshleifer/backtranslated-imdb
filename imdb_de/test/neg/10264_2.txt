This movie SUCKS !! It looks like they just choose to put random scenes together. Good, but little conspiracy. Sally whines and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I figured she had PMS. It sure seemed like that. The synchronization in this movie is terrible. A scene in which the woman was talking, and a few seconds before we hear audio. I knew by then that my suspicions were correct that he was not from the United States. I tried to follow, but got lost about halfway and found myself even for a horror movie hard to believe. Some good characters, but not many. It's not worth wasting your time.
