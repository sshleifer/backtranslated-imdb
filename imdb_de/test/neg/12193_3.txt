What could have been an excellent hostage film was totally ruined by what looks like a bored director. The last 45 minutes or so, the film leads to an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ... and sex machine? ... That can not be true! The theatrical talents of people like Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical film. <br /> <br /> The director ... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other bloody blows such as el mariachi, desperado, once in Mexico, and the last sinful city ... really keeps your attention well-executed in the first half ... which makes you think that you are having a fun time ... but then, for no reason at all and without provocation, madness begins ... there are even weak attempts to make parody and comedy. .. really annoying !!
