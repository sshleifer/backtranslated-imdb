I always thought that it could not get worse that "Army of the Dead", but that amount of crap makes the aforementioned movie look like "The Godfather" !! The special effects are HORRIBLE (makes the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When it comes to acting, I say it that way, I went to a play with my six-year-old niece and she gave an Oscar-worthy performance compared to this D-List (and that's good) actors and actresses. So if I have a gun on my head and head and can choose between watching the film again or chopping off my own arm with a blunt knife, that's a difficult decision !! Do you know what, who needs two arms anyway?
