I do not know about you, but I go to horror movies to be scared, and that was anything but scary. The film had several possibilities to be really scary and failed EVERY TIME! Some of these supposedly exciting moments have been haunted by some of the worst widening you'll see this year, maybe a decade! I mean, when I say the CG looks like a TV channel, I give the TV station a bad name, I've seen better things on the Sci-Fi channel. What I'm really sorry about are the actors (they linked their name to this movie), they did a good job, most of the characters were important to me, and I felt their performances were pretty good, but that was not enough Take this movie out of the gutter. What's really amusing is the reuse of some sets. If you have seen "Exorcist: The Beginning", it is easy to see the reuse of some buildings. However, what I thought was the worst thing about this movie was the main demon even over the CG issues. He was just not scary, his form, the way he spoke, he was extremely bland. All in all, this movie was a terrible experience and I would have gone out of the theater if my wife did not see the end.
