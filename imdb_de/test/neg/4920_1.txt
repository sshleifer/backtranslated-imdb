Well, at least this was the last sequel I could find at Blockbuster because this movie was just awful. I can understand how hard it would be to get rid of a bad house. We are talking about a terrible fire, bulldozing, flood, etc. But a mirror? How hard could it be to get rid of a mirror? This was the most horrible movie that could have put the title Amityville in the picture! <br /> <br /> Well, a bunch of friends who are pretty much from the beginning are a bunch of freaks. One of them is some photographer and buys an enchanted mirror from a homeless, scary guy. He teaches me a valuable lesson, does not buy stuff from a homeless scary guy. Of course, the terrible dying and chaos of this group results, though I can not imagine anyone missing it. <br /> <br /> Please skip Amityville: A new generation, I already have some complaints about my generation I think that was a premonition. Do not sound so crazy. : P But believe me, this is terrible, not well thought out and not even scary! I feel so bad for the original authors of The Amityville Horror, they have to cry every time someone is watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
