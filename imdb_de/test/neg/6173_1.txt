Really horrible waste of space. Me and my friend tried to finish this movie but had to turn it off about 30 minutes before the end. And I can count the films that I turned off before the end on one hand. <br /> <br /> The script and the direction are lasting and deeply uninspiring. I would not be surprised if they found the script in a pile of stolen screenplays from 1983. For example, the irritating throat that threatens the estate agent from his home phone. I mean, seriously. The police would slam his door in a few minutes. The scenes and events wash like quark in a river. It's hard to understand what the movie is. The narrative alternates between the characters in a seemingly random way, interrupting the pathetic attempts to build up the characters. Oh and what "characters" are they. The protagonist of Rourke is terrible. He could just have sent out a box and stayed in bed. After about 60 minutes of the movie, I had absolutely no attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Only a disfigured dummy from a shop window stings through every single scene. His motivation can not be recognized from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Just those dead eyes staring out of a disfigured piece of meat. And the Indian theme is just awful and pointless. <br /> <br /> The good guys are unlikely at best. A dull stereotype of the white collar and a simulating neurotic ex-wife stereotype. The archetypal woman with the gun faces the villain, "you will not shoot me", that is tired unoriginal and annoying. <br /> <br /> The Richie Nix character may seem interesting at first, but soon falls into an irritating one-sided psycho-character. What is contrary to the apparent intention to make the bad guys somehow sympathetic or at least realistically motivated. Roasario Dawson's character begins with some promise, but soon falls into a disgusting and childish parody of gangsters from chick scenes by Jackie Brown. Should I really believe that her character was so attracted to Rourke's attraction? Or, worse, she's just a swimmer sleeping with something that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /> <br /> Summarized a complete confusion of a movie. Desperate characterizations and performances. A leaky and hackneyed script along with an unthinkable direction. And finally extremely boring. It is not even bad. Rourke's hardened face laughs quite old after the first 15 minutes of the movie.
