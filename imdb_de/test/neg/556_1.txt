Hillary Swank is an unattractive work in this unattractive work of a film. Desperate for work and all sorts of work, Pat Morita agreed to reaffirm his role as a "karate teacher" and bring his karate brand back on the screen, except that Hillary is "skank" the student. <I can see how the Hollywood writers are thrilled with the idea that a "tortured, spoiled brat" takes on the role of Ralph. The film does not work on any level and is boring at every level. There is nothing interesting here, not even a lesson someone can stick to. The movie was made without the idea of ​​making money because it's just so bad. <br /> <br /> I would like to spit on all the actors in this film because I've been involved and the writers have blacklisted miserable and offensive efforts.
