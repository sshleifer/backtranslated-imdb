Okay, now this movie is a piece of work. It's full of stupid Jesus refreshments and dialogues that would question most people, whether they should even make films. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine pull you in, but take it, this movie is shit. The story is incomprehensible and lacks intellectuality. The sets, veihicles, and costumes come from a cross between Bablon Five and a bondage strip. I'm sure there are pornos with better dialougue.
