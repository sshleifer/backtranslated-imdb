Why can virtual "x-rated" video game women talk women through their mouths, but the World Combat Combat Champion Dante must use a combination of telepathy and dramatic facial expressions? I feel they either had to occupy someone who looked more villainous (Michael Bermardo's big brown eyebrows are not really scary in the hearts of Wells - anyone but maybe Casting directors who consistently use him as a villain or a villain is a heroic one 'Bad Boy') OR they just had to let him use his real voice (and move his mouth) and maybe give him a costume that would not force him to walk like a painful thumb across the street. (But of course this is the future and we have to assume that bad fashion taste is the norm.)
