There should be some sort of prosecution to punish producers for financing this filming. I have the feeling that some sort of criminalization of the bad movie could lead to more films of this idiocy. Sure, it has an interesting cast of characters, but I do not think I've seen more pasteboarding in a whole cast than in this uniquely shitty piece of crap. This director should somehow be punished because he did not make any performance out of these people. The separation is therefore an issue (no, really, with this they beat you over the head). This does not mean that every character has to recite his lines as on NPR. Did I mention that this movie is shitty? In the end, I'm not sure how his memories of terminal bone cancer would connect, but I'm pretty sure if you were completely brain dead your cancer would continue to grow. This film is an insult to cancer patients, medical professionals and non-retarded people. Oh, and finally, bumblebees fly because they generate sufficient lift for their mass by flapping their wings like any other flying insect. I absolutely despise people who present false knowledge as fact. Next time, do some research before using a stupid misunderstanding as a premise for a whole crazy movie. ONLY CHILD BELIEVE IN JESUS!
