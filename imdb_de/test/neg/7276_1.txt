I have never really been interested in cannibal films and until a few months ago I had bypassed this film genre. <br /> <br /> I recently had knee surgery and found that I had a lot of time My hands, since I could not work, I decided, after watching almost every horror movie that our local video library I would risk it. <br /> <br /> Christ was a mistake! I've never seen such a bad movie in all my years as a movie addict. This is just a bunch of cunt stuck on a DVD and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have great respect for other horror fans who can turn their brains off long enough to enjoy this crap, they are more brain dead than I will ever be and that's an achievement! 0/10 and that is generous.
