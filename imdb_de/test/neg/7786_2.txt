If a BBC murder thriller is so brisk with heterosexual dysfunctions, you know who the killer must be: the homosexual. <br /> <br /> Who brought the sexy blond teenager (who is also a pathological liar) home on the way home from school? Let's see, could it be the mother who (against all common sense) has her teenage son make unchecked visits to his serial killer father behind bars? Could it be the melancholy son impressed by his father's sober attitude towards women? Could it be the serial killer himself who is able to manipulate events from behind bars, a la Hannibal Lecter? Could it be Mama's friend, a teacher at the school whose affair with a former student led to his wife's suicide? Or could it be the daughter of a friend who beats the secrets of everyone at school and causes unspeakable misery? No, it's not one of those probable suspects. It's ... The Homosexual! <br /> <br /> The only mystery to the viewer is guessing who The Homosexual is. Of course, it could be anyone, since The Homosexual's only qualities are shameful secrecy and a tendency to murder, making life otherwise "complicated" for ordinary people. The homosexual is the invisible cause of the diseases of society; Only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the broken family come together and things can return to normal ... whatever that is. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially beyond their expiration dates. The world could be doing fine without ever seeing anything on screen again, but as long as the BBC has roles for The Aggrieved Woman and The Misunderstood Man, I suppose they'll come back in films like this one.
