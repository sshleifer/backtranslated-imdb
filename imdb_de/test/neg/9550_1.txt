SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> A clich√©-puzzling film that somehow makes an anti-death statement with dignity, though it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed forensic officer who has suffered and died in the last four years (apparently he wrote his huge sales book just a year ago, so it's not all desperate). He arranges an assisted suicide with his doctor, who will return in a week. In the meantime, he helps with a serial killer case. He's recruiting the brave, I do not want to do it, but I'm just so good at it, cop Jolie, and they're seeking out impossible premonitions that jump to extremely unlikely conclusions in moments. Hey, that old bolt means the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel at the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. It is ridiculous. But no is smart enough to find out that the doctor who will help him is the killer. When he comes to Washington to kill him (prematurely), he has a change of heart and struggles unbelievably for his life. Cut to the compulsive evil that is about to shoot down the good scene when BANG fires the weapon - but the evil did not shoot! No, the woman steps out of the corner, she just shot him in the back.
