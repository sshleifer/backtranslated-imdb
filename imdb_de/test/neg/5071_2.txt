I would like to write a small summary of the storyline of this film, but ... there simply are not any! If you just take a look at the action keywords of this title, you know the entire contents of the movie: Sex, Breasts, Exploitation, Female Nudity, and Women's Prison! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more. "Escape of the Island Women" (an alternative title not even listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial women's class classic, but it lacks brutality. WIP flicks are meant to mix graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced by more sex. Director Erwin Dietrich certainly can not compete with specialists in the field, such as Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and he would have had to stick to producing normal soft-core punches. The only aspects that look a bit like a cult cinema are the likeness of the tyrant president to Fidel Castro and the gang rape of a (small) girl by soldiers. The girls, however, are gorgeous and the filming location in Ibiza looks very charming.
