I would not recommend it to anybody, except moviegoers who want to laugh about a movie, not with the movie. <br /> <br /> A promising premise and a number of actors are increasingly deteriorating over a movie that ends with perhaps the worst end ever seen in a movie. I'm not going to ruin it, but basically the most used movie clich√©s are made bad and half-hearted for the most disappointing last five minutes to a movie of all time. <br /> <br /> The film also features The Dreadest Scene Ever, an attempt to show chemistry between the two main roles on screen when Angela Jolie is lovingly caressed in close-up by Denzel Washington's finger. It may be the only thing that could move it, but it is a mystery to me why the viewer is being heard with a zoom of Washington's finger moving between the dimmed lights and the music appropriate for a sex scene. I laughed loudly and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The direction of the plot is very similar to Se7en, but here it is much simpler and too obvious. It would be an understatement to speak of an Armenian Se7en. This is really nothing more than a television movie, and even the best efforts of Jolie and Washington can not convince that it is a movie.
