Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO during a test flight - but there is nothing on the radar. Then planes and ships disappear and more UFOs are reported. It turns out it's a huge monster bird attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> This has all the right elements for a classic. It has a pretty entertaining script - I was never really bored. Acting is good (for a monster movie of the 50s). Morrow is not exaggerating the macho hero act and Mara Corday is pretty good as the necessary female love interest. She is also strong and takes care of herself - even if she is to get coffee and food during the movie. The problem here is the monster. Dear God, it is terrible! It looks like a confused turkey! It has a long neck, a funny, stupid BEAK, a few teeth, a few strands of hair on the head and claws. And - oh yes - it squeaks! Not yelling - screaming! The actors had no idea what it looked like - it was added after production. The actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theater. Morrow said his audience burst out laughing and quickly left the theater before the movie ended! Responsible for this was the producer Sam Katzman. He wanted to save money and gave the world the dumbest monster of all time. And you can see the wires that move it too! That gets only 4 stars, because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. There are no stars for the pathetic monster - wait until you see how it attacks what is obviously a toy train! It's worth it if you're a horror fanatic to see what the dumbest monster of all time must be.
