"I remember I was waiting to be born ..." <br /> <br /> "Vision seeker who was the American West." <br /> <br /> "We went to a clairvoyant ..." <br /> <br /> "I'm sure her first reaction is that she's a cuckoo." <br /> <br /> ".. The place is being followed ..." <br /> <br /> "I think there is another dimension here." <br /> <br /> An artist ( Marta Becket) and her husband left the bustle and culture of New York many decades ago and moved to a godforsaken city of ten residents in Death Valley. There they renovated a theater - painting is a very homely / folksy way. And when she was done, she did not dance for almost anyone. In many ways, it is reminiscent of the Werner Herzog film FITZCARRALDO or FIELD OF DREAMS - although AMARGOSA is a documentary of a real person - not a mythical madman like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Her husband finally leaves - much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she has chosen. Today, she continues to live with her ten cats and a Burros shelter along with her new male companion Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think about this documentation depends on your prospects. If you are interested in New Age ideas and are open to these sensations, you will probably appreciate the movie. Her talk about her remembering her birth, ghosts, visions, and psychology made the psychology teacher wince in me, and that would definitely be the case for many people. In addition, their burro sanctuary and attempting to get horses in the desert will most likely appeal to PETA and many other animal lovers, though with my environmental and biology background I see the burros and horses as a miscarriage destroying the natives Plants and animals. For two different reasons, I tend to think of Marta, on the contrary, who is more of a "feeling" and "feeling" person. Depending on how you feel about it, your opinion will definitely be colored - and I'm pretty sure most people either think that they're a genius or a nut! You just have to guess what I think. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, the movie is interesting and Marta's life is definitely NOT boring - especially as in recent years people have started to travel to the desert to see their performance. There is a certain following for her and her unusual little world. While I would not be nearly as positive as most reviews, I can not be as negative as the one review because this strange documentary has a definite benefit. I like movies about unusual people and Marta is certainly unusual! I also appreciate her love for her art and her happy life - that is a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology at an art college and it would certainly be interesting to show this to the staff - where I'm pretty sure we get a strong positive and negative reaction to the movie - probably depending on whether the teachers teach the art class or the core curriculum! That would be interesting. By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when Marta's husband was dating, who was it ?! After all, they lived in the middle of nowhere and I wondered where he would find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you want to see her appear and / or stay with her. The hotel can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/. The website is in English, French and German and the hotel rates are reasonably priced, as are the ticket prices.
