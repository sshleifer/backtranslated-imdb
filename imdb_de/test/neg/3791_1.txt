Terrible writing, government and action! The author / director has portrayed the Southerners, especially the Southern prosecution, as ignorant, hillbilly, homophobic and racist (a very popular but ignorant stereotype that the film industry likes to perpetuate). Acting (or overclocking) and writing seemed amateurish and low budget. The storyline is the same old Hollywood tale of racist and homophobic rednecks that are ultimately defeated by the enlightened Newwww Yoke Ceety people. I grew up in the small town of Louisiana The movie was filmed and was looking forward to seeing the movie, but was immediately disappointed in the first minutes of the movie. The film begins with a gay bar in the "swamps" of Louisiana. How ridiculous a concept! There are many gay and gay bars in South Louisiana, but no gay bars in the "swamps" or small towns of Louisiana. Then we are introduced to the sheriff, who uses the phrases "homuh-sex'l" in the worst southern performance. Then there's the scene where local police are watching porn in the police station. I could go on with that dreadful cheesy acting or stale clich√©s or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his crew were received in this small friendly town and showed true Southern hospitality. The citizens of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana should only be insulted and demoted in the final editorship. The good people of Lake Arthur were thrilled and excited that "Hollywood" was in town. They did not realize that in the end they were portrayed as ignorant, racist and homophobic country bumpkins in a low-budget amateur movie that ran straight to DVD. My tip: skip it or watch Cinemax late at night if it's ever shot.
