Not the best of the WIP's, but not the worst. I honestly feel guilty when I laugh, considering it had to be career low for everyone involved. The acting, the dialogue, the absurd scenarios and the omnipresent boom microphone hit me every time and certainly contribute to their bad movie charm. As much as I am a Linda Blair fan, the best (or no) awards go to Sybil Danning. Special praise to Henry Silva, who is the only one in the cast not taking his role too seriously. When I look at the film now, I take a closer look at Stella Steven's character. She plays the chief officer, and I have to wonder if Hilary Clinton has decided to take on her current looks and behavior. I'm sure she did not have to look beyond her husband's video collection to find this movie. Not that I judge. I've seen it myself several times, and I wonder what would have happened if Mr. Clinton had installed a hot tub in the Oval Office. Hmmm.
