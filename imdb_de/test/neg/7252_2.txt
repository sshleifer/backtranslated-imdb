I do not believe that the number of military and strategic mistakes in this turkey can be beaten. Everything in this mess was made cheap and the soldiers really looked stupid. Examples: At the beginning, the 2-Star General is strategically advised by a Lieutenant and undoubtedly accepts this. The card used by the lieutenant shows enemy positions, but they seem to have only one narrow valley to advance the battalion (though the card shows a dozen more). The rear guard occupies a position from which they are clearly detected and exposed by the enemy. They beat our heroes from height, but this superior firepower makes little difference. A single enemy tank advances towards the end (initially referred to as Panzer Division) and departs from a lonely infantry location (!) That moves extremely slowly without scouring the area, and then forfeits the tank if it feels that he would save - a very strange scene. The soldiers take cover in a cave. There is ice and powder around them, but there is no deep puddle in the cave through which all wade repeatedly - their feet would only take a few minutes before they freeze. Later, the survivors waded pathetically slowly and chest high through a river to return to their unit. Remember, it's a deep winter and the ground is frozen. Yeah right! <br /> <br /> And on and on it goes. They call commands to higher positions, drop mines near their own position, and warn each other not to step on them (!). At the beginning, a soldier, who was awarded the Medal of Honor of the Congress, will be honored. Was he blind or did Director Fuller just ignore him? Truly the most incompetent soldiers I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> One of them hits his wounded leg with a bayonet and finally pulls out a piece of shrapnel without a twitch or moan. He announces that this should qualify him as a surgeon. That was funny.
