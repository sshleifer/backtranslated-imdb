The most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in Ice-T's drama. The plot; Two rival gangs who have to fight back, with the underground betrayals, power, and change, are worn plans, but painful in this case. The run-down scenery, which made something believable in some places, and questionable lighting, constantly distracted the interest / identification with the characters (the actor's forehead / nose appearance was dazzling, not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) Halfway through the movie, I wanted to know more about how and why it came about, not what was happening on the screen. A disappointment if you have seen Ice-T in other roles. Kudos to other actors / actresses who seemed to enter their roles despite the weak direction; Corrupt's Side Kick and the other restaurant worker.
