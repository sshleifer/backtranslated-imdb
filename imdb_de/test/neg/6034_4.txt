This movie is pretty bad, aggressive, not well played, not well directed, seems low budget, low quality, emotionally weak and incoherent. after looking at previous comments, you've seen it, but if you compare it to Apocalypse, PLATOON, or others, you're really not on the trail. This film looks like an old and pure movie from the 60s with cast Neanderthals, not to mention (or even to do), without paying attention to details such as changing rounds, low budget fireworks and all sorts of badly filmed peculiarities. is however visible, if you want to see it as an early development of the film document ... do not go back !! <br /> <br /> ps - after all, the boys are fine.
