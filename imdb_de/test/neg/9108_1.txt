This is so bad that it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I'm going to. It is clear from the beginning that Steve Gutenburg took this role seriously ... the other principles went through their lines. I think they got a taste of how much it stunk early, and they went through the applications for their paychecks. Sean Bean "acted" as usual, but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles until the final scene looked like an actor stepping onto a high school stage as defined as the one Contrast was defined. Some actors look bad. Some actors should not play for a role. These two statements apply to "Police Academy" Steve. His unkempt facial expression translates to foul and unyielding, and his puffing makes him look like a lumpy potato that is not buffalo. Combine that with one of the worst script dialogues in Hollywood history and you have BAD movie. I can only assume that all the principles really needed the money for the transformation or signed something or their agents before the script was written by the monkeys who had to type it. I would like to know the background of this disaster.
