The only reason I bought this DVD is because Cynthia Rothrock is there. Now everyone knows that she is the queen of martial arts. The problem is that this is not a martial arts movie. Cynthia Rothrock has about a minute of fighting in this stupid movie. If you were a filmmaker now and had cynthia rothrock in your movie, would not you like martial arts? All she does in this movie is to walk around and look bored, just like I was when I saw that bunch of crap. I own a lot of their movies and they are all B movies, but at least they had some cool fight scenes in them I'm still crazy. I wasted $ 4 for buying this DVD
