That's what this movie really needs. A big piece of cheese. This movie is about a sister and brother of Bonnie and Clyde who create their own party line to lure, capture and kill their victims. But for what reason? Just for fun with it? In comes Richard Hatch, who appears as a filthy, washed-out lady-man. A real BAD version of a lady's man. And he's busy figuring out who's behind the murders all over LA. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer, and the rest is for your fun and entertainment. But there are parts in this movie that really make me feel like the scene in which Lief Garret in his mother's wedding dress looks like a sissy in front of his sister telling her that he needs her and can not live without her watching her Can slap him in the face and dominate him. I can not believe that was the job !!! Well, I think I could. But it's worth seeing just one of Garrets worst films he's ever made.
