I sat at home leafing through canals when I came across something that might sound like an interesting movie. I like Destruction movies and have decided to watch them. I do not know why, but I took a look at it for the whole 2 hours. We have seen this kind of movie, I do not know how many times. <br /> <br /> From 1998 to 2000, there were dozens of films dealing with global destruction. The best on my list is Deep Impact, which was more credible than this one. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) Cheap special effects, like something from the old computer. 2) no background information or explanations on weather patterns. If you're shooting a movie about the weather, you should at least have a decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) How come that only two or three people find out that the storm is gathering in Chicago ... no more experts in the field? 4) Where are some interesting characters? I'm really not interested in anyone but the pregnant woman. I felt that there was no character development. 5) no thoughtful moment, which is so and in fact wrong topic. And this is just the first part of the movie. I bet the inference will show us some destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation, as it has been done many times before. With the special effects in the first part of the film, I can only imagine what we should expect. In the end, of course, the main characters will survive and life will go on ... as original
