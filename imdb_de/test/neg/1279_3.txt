Some people think negatively about Sweden: too neat, too clean, too serious, too organized and too Nordic. A people tortured by their own religious destiny and history, sometimes resulting in depression and compulsive rudeness. This does not have to be a problem for a filmmaker because, for example, the late Bergman has shown us what can be cinematically possible under these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not expressly comment on that identity as such. Andersson, however, does the opposite: he only comments on this identity, thereby breaking down his people to the bone: in his world Sweden is synonymous with hell on earth. But he does not get on with that and for me it's just not an art, just an annotation. Despite the extraordinary time the filmmaker needed, he has serious limitations that he clearly can not get out of. <br /> <br /> Compared to his previous film Sånger by Andra Våningen / Songs from the second floor there is also no much progress to watch. The intention was that this was more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that should appeal to a larger audience are not the best in the movie. The same absurdism and minimalism still apply, there is the one-shot camera position and the (missing) action before this setting. Yes, the stills are well done, some scenes actually work and the coloring and positioning is amazing. But does that make an interesting movie? Negative thinking, the cinema has taken a step backwards. Andersson's background as a commercial filmmaker seems to get through in the elaborate settings, but I think his films are as empty as these commercials. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without much depth.
