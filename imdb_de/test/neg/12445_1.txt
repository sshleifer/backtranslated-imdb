This movie was awful, not only was the plot weak, but the drama was unbelievably bad and sometimes pathetic. Very unrealistic dialogues with which people in real life do not speak that way, and there are no emotions or feelings in something very monotonous, with the exception of the almost indistinguishable whisper that is constantly occurring. Even the editing is bad, the cuts are terrible. The camera work was slack and shaky in close-ups and fluctuates in conversations back and forth. There is nothing positive about this film and George Katts has to work on heavy machinery or something where he does not have to talk to other people because he obviously does not know how. How did this movie win for awards, oh my god !!
