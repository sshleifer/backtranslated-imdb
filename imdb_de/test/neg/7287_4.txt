I think I'm getting less and less excited by Disney's sequels in movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for direct filming is not the same, but these films do not even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If anyone has seen the preview for Stitch-The Movie, you will see my point of view. But I digress, this film confirms my point of view. The animation is sloppy, the plot is similar to the cartoons on Saturday morning and not all original voices are available. I was very disappointed not to hear Michael J. Fox's voice. It was so blatant that the person who played Milo's voice sounded like Fox but was not nearly successful. <br /> <br /> If it says something, my kids at the age of 10 and 6 did not even sit through the movie.
