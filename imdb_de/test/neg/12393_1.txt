I was shocked, there were 18 pages with good reviews. This must be one of the worst films, especially considering that it was recommended. I have to admit that comedy is not my favorite genre, but this movie was the worst thing to do, trying so hard to be smart that I felt compelled to look at it. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is similar to audition week on American Idol. They watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew that this movie had no bad actors. So how funny would it be if good singers try to convince them that they should not approach an American Idol Tryout? It would be pointless how this movie was. <br /> <br /> The use of improvisation is overrated. We were all in this environment where a group of friends play a role and everyone breaks down with tears in their eyes. I think that's improv. Improv can not be activated just because the camera is running, as this movie shows. If you like the Drew Carey show with improvisation you will probably like this movie. All in all, the jokes were bad, the improvisation was sophomoric and the over-function of Guest & Company was a campy. ..and those are my compliments to this hoax. If a man playing the trumpet at the same time, and the drum at the same time is funny, that's good. For me, I prefer rather intoxicating things like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". <br /> <br /> But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 80s, so maybe you like that g-rated humor. I've always waited for a person to identify themselves as an animal keeper and then tell us that there is no zoo in the city. That's the humor you can expect. <br /> <br /> My only wish was that I could rate this as a minus.
