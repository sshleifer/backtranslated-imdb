MGM has tried to connect young men to the Divine to show them and try them out as leading men. Gable and Garbo had chemistry in SUSAN LENOX, but it was a lousy movie. Here in INSPIRATION there is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery and the script is bad too. What did they think? The modern, fast-talking, wise-cracking Montgomery and the suffering Garbo? It's a story like CAMILLE. The young student falls in love with the woman of the world and is repelled by learning his past, rejects it, takes it back, rejects it ... you get the picture. Garbo is absolutely credible as a top model of the Parisian artist and at home, although bored, her life is at the forefront of society amidst her artistic friends and her relaxed morale. Suddenly she fascinates these innocents. She finally gives up her life for him and sinks in poverty, only to be rescued by him and housed in a separate house. Ironically, he intends to marry her and keep her on the side - so much for his pure morality of yesteryear. The scenes are unbelievably boring and boring and not much happens. Only Marjorie Rambeau as Lulu is able to breathe life into the processes, such as "Unfortunately, weak women have a strong appetite" and "Odette, where is your sting?". <br /> <br /> Only for Garbo fans.
