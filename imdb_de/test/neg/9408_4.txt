Al Pacino was once an actor who was able to perform a role work without having to resort to constant use of profanity. In other words, if he could act, he did not have to talk like a street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he also promoted the word "F". This may be the kind of society in which they actually live, but most of us have the decency to observe what we say in mixed society. I do not remember the exact words a professor used to explain the constant use of obscenity, but it was something. "It shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and disrespect for those who need to listen." Maybe it's time for Al to take acting classes again to sharpen his talent. Oh yes, the movie ... Probably the worst thing McConaughey played. Hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo was hot as always.
