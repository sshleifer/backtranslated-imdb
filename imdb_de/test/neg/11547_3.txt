This film actually starts out pretty interesting, but for my taste it has become too boring and predictable melodrama. None of the performances is particularly interesting and the camera work is just a standard movie for TV movies. So, there's really no reason to see this movie unless you're so big fans of Jeff Bridges, I suppose. <br /> <Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is leaving college to take to the streets. His parents believe that he "just plays" and talk about "he has no plan". He assures them that he has a plan and that he must discover his true self and his place in the world. So much so that he invites her to go out on the street with him and buy an antique bus that he and his father are repairing in a real TV movie father-son relationship. Until that point in the movie, I was a bit interested in the storyline and the characters, and I wanted to see his stuck mother (Vera Miles) react to life on the street. There is already a funny scene where father and son have to get them to take the trip. They show her the inside of the bus, and gradually she's getting more and more interested. Finally, she starts off with a kind of talk about curtains against blinds on the windows. Bridges wonders about his father (Carl Betz, equipped with radio speaker voice), that she has changed her mind. Dad assures him "Electric oven ... works every time!". <br /> <br /> But the movie almost goes downhill as soon as they take to the streets. It turns out that Mike's only "plan" is to introduce them to some "friends" of him who turn out to be random people meeting them at a hippie rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival, I was a bit disappointed ... especially since it became clear that the rest of the film would be on the festival campground, not on the street. But at least I thought there might be a decent band, well, if they could not afford Hendrix or the Stones, they might at least have Canned Heat or Little Feat or something like that. No cube - apparently the only music at this festival is a terrible choir ensemble with orchestra that sounds like a bad imitation of the fifth dimension, paired with an annoying announcer who is supposed to be humorous. <br /> <br /> We too are presented with a series of hippie festivalgoers and their various medical melodramas. Kathy (Renne Jarrett) is a pretty blond girl with existentialism and a sense of nature who falls in love with Mike before she reveals the fact that she needs kidney dialysis to live and run to the festival to die. And two other campers are determined to have a baby in their rough tent, introducing the struggle between modern medicine and hippie ignorance (or something like that). The longer it takes, the more painful the movie will be for anyone who is waiting for surprises or real dramas. Basically, this movie is a waste of time, even though it probably amused someone who really is into the late sixties, early seventies and movies of that time. I would be just as happy if I never see it again.
