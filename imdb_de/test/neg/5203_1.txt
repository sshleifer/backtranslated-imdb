As a big fan of the original Operation Delta Force, I thought I would pick up this movie. I thought it could not be that bad. Here's a list of things I learned from considering Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. <br /> <br /> - Although the Delta Force is the elite of the US Armed Forces, they are usually slightly overweight in their 30s and early 40s. <br /> <br /> - Although the Delta Force is the elite of American forces, they carry standard police guns or AK-47s for their key missions. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite of the US Armed Forces, has not learned to take your eyes off stealth missions, red ski jumpers, and running around in open spaces. <br /> <br /> - When you throw a Molotov cocktail into a tank, it explodes outwardly like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - If you are hit by a tank fire, you can run away, although the smoke may present minor breathing difficulties. <br /> <br /> - You can die from a standard shot, but you can live too, even though you've been hit multiple times by a sniper rifle several times with an AK-47. <br /> <br /> - In close combat, members of the Delta Force, despite being the elite of the US Army, are routinely beaten by railroad attendants. <br /> <br /> - When villains approach in a slow moving train, there's nothing to fear - between the four of them, they can not figure out how to automatically fire an automatic weapon. let alone meet someone from 5 meters away with at least 50 attempts. <br /> <br /> - If you have few actors, simply recycle them - the villain of Operation Delta Force 1 plays a good guy named Mac in Operation Delta Force 4, and the guy who runs Mac in Operation Delta Force 3 played Skip now plays another good. <br /> <br /> - It's not right that the Delta Force shoots an unarmed terrorist, even if he tries to reload his weapon to kill you. <br /> <br /> - Grenades explode on impact with the ground when thrown by Delta Force members. When thrown by non-Delta Force personnel, they explode to the point where the Delta Force members threw the grenades back at the Evil One. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can travel faster than standard trucks. <Br /> <br /> - Militias and personal armies use exactly the same helicopter the UN deployed in Operation Delta Force 1. <br /> <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a villain in this helicopter can not see you lying face down. <br /> <br /> - Shooting the chest several times can cause minor damage. If this person is stabbed in the knee, they will be killed within 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force steals cars from old people to move in foreign countries because the US military does not provide them with any means of transportation. This may also explain why they were driven by public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not really the best moment in filmmaking, but it's good for a laugh.
