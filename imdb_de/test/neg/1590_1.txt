This movie was on the Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to give it a try. I watched the first 20 minutes and then turned off. B / c I'm sorry, but plot holes that are crucial to a movie and make the movie nothing but trash. <br /> <br /> The film is about a woman who accidentally drives a child off the road by bicycle, leaves the road to get help, and returns to find out that it's called a hit and run and they are looking for the 'monster' that has hurt them (killed them in the end). <br /> <br /> This is a movie about a woman in a wealthy neighborhood who has two little schoolchildren and is an active, sociable woman. But for this movie to work, it must be credible Do not own MOBY. I'm sorry, but that's a complete BS, especially if everyone else seems to have one - they used theirs to call 911 when they found the girl on the roadside - when our lead actress left the scene to answer a phone 911 to call payphone. When the lead actress returns, the ambulance is already standing by the girl's side, and it is talked about how horrible the person she has met and left. <br /> <br /> Only DUMB. Sorry, but I'm not ready to buy that this woman does not have a cell phone needed for the movie. Please do not insult my intelligence movie, thanks. If this happened in 1970 or 1960, I would buy it, but it is clearly a movie today (back in 1999). ... but wait, if she had a cell phone, there would be no movie. Pfft. <br /> <br /> The woman has been familiar with technology since she has computers in her house and the kids played games. So the movie just had to kill the cell phone in the car, which made her a resort to another way to call the cops ... omitting a cell phone just made a ridiculous act.
