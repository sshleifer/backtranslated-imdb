I want to believe that all the new horror movies coming out of Japan these days are nervous and make for entertaining watching. <br /> <br /> Spider forest is not both. <br /> <br /> It's rare for me to finish watching and ended up wasting time, but spider forest was an exception in this regard. I was very distracted. The makers of the film were successful on one level; Throughout the film, I could not stop because I wanted to see the answer to the mystery of the plot. I could not stop watching. That's why I was so angry when the movie was over. Did you pull me out for this POC for two hours? WARNING: Spider Wood is another Japanese "ghost" story, though you do not realize you are going inside. <br /> <br /> I never want to see a Japanese ghost story again. They are wrong and invented. "It's a ghost story" has become like a big rug, under which you can sweep out all the unsolvable plot holes you have in your storytelling.
