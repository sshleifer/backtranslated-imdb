Cyber ​​Zone, as this DVD was sold in Oz, is about the worst B grade junk I've ever seen. Apart from a restrained Deadpan act by Singer, which indicates that the film would be bad, the other actors fluctuate from actual series of experiments (Swanson and Quarry) or absurd imitations of classic film scenes. Mathius Hues has been the most lazy figure of dying ever since Jim Carrey's Mask. All this without any real thread that suggests the appearance of a parody by genre, period or a common vein is clearly annoying. Do not even try to connect the points with the plot. It's Blade Runner, barely camouflaged for content, actors or scenery due to a very limited budget. "You get what you pay for" is never obvious. There are always annoying reuse of limited sets without focusing on dressing and the special effects that Dr. Who in 1976 would have hit the bottom of the cutting surface. Of course, there are masochists who will play this threesome, but if you watch this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your pay. For $ 2, this DVD is a cheap and interesting beer mat.
