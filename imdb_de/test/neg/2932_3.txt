I suppose that Hollywood did not quite openly celebrate homosexuality in 1997, so they would like to pay a little tribute to those who put together this film because they showed some courage. You just wish you could give them a loan because they put together a really good movie, and I do not think In & Out is suitable for that. It is the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - an English teacher at a high school in a small town who is surprised on the eve of his wedding by a former student who happens to win an Oscar and then goes through something that can only be described a time of self-discovery as he copes with homosexual behavior. For me that was the first problem with this movie. Howard did not really have to turn out to be gay. The film would have been funnier (and perhaps even thought-provoking), despite Brackett's defiance of the stereotypical gay aspects of his life and the city's conviction after the Oscar speech that he was gay. (In fact, I thought that identifying with homosexuals would have been quite insulting in the face of these stereotypes for the gay community, as well as for men who like poetry and good clothes.) <br /> <br Kline was decent in the role enough and contributed most of the movie. Apart from him, most of the other actors (though good actors) were people who were not really known for their big-screen success. People like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors but not big movie stars. I actually thought that the funniest (if very small) role of the movie was that of the supermodel Sonya, played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes, I loved her oh-so-stereotypical model series), I promised to do this photoshoot today Afternoon. I have to take a shower and vomit! ") What really scared me off in the end was the ridiculous ending, starting with the graduation (and, to be honest, even if someone decided to graduate, it was really necessary that the film should have ended there instead of the completely unnecessary one Wedding in the end.) <br /> <br /> Basically, I got a few giggles, but nothing more. 3/10
