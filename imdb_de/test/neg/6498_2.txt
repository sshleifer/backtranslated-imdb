This movie had the biggest publicity campaign ever made in Russia. "Epic film about Russian culture", "Great saga of Russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. For me, this movie was the biggest disappointment. The main character playing Oleg Menshikov is a stupid immature boy who is willing to start his comrades because a woman does not even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the film, the story does not develop at all. People's festival scenes look like they boast about Russian audacity. <br /> <br /> I respect Mr Mikhalkov for his earlier work as an actor and director, but this film only shows his ambition to be considered a "Tsar" of Russian cinema.
