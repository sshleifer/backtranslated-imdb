I had to read in my English lessons why the cage birds sing, and after we finished the movie, we watched the movie. After watching the movie, I regret it. The effects of the book had completely disappeared. The scenes made no sense in their sequences, the acting was terrible and it seemed as if the scriptwriter had never actually taken the book in hand, but opted for the clip texts. I was outraged by how the movie ended. Almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were extremely important to Maya's growth as a person. If you have read ... Caged Birds, this movie will ruin the experience of the book, so I caution you not to see it.
