This is one of the stupidest and most worthless films of all time. It really is not suitable for movie status. It is very cheap (apparently shot on video), acted terribly and just rotten. I could not believe how cheap and incompetent this piece of crap was. It looked like a home video! I mean, I think a guy I know to be a few houses down the road has dug up his video camera and made that crap in 2 or 3 hours. It is so bad. I noticed the name, where did that come from? Asylum? And I'll NEVER rent anything with that name again! If you rent a strip, check if it comes from this "company". However, one thing is true - if you like terribly traded amateur films, you like this loser. It is absolutely boring and terrible !!! You have been warned !!!
