This movie is without doubt one of the worst I have ever seen. It was so boring that I simply could not wait until it came to an end. I persuaded my girlfriend to look after this site got good reviews and after 30 minutes she looked at me like she was saying "your nuts". The scenery was as boring as the movie Wind blowing bits of bush around. The acting was not inspiring and the movie was just a waste of a good idea in the waste of a player. <br /> <br /> Guy Pierce should have stayed with the neighbors since he had at least washed his hair. All he had done was a telephone conversation, but as a salesman he sold nothing. He would have been released weeks ago. His girlfriend (once in Coyote Ugly) should have been dancing at the bar because she looked hot at least. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Vincent (those who saw him) was so annoying on his phone calls that every normal person would have driven to his house and hit him with a bit of 4 out of 2. I do not know on earth what anyone liked about it. I want people to watch this to endure the torture I've been through.
