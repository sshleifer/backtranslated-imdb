Uncle Fred Olen Ray gives us some of his retro-media goodness in the form of this non-classical Cinemax Kemas. <br /> <br /> A dove-stalk pair looks at rocks as they come across a swirling vortex a "black hole" as the smart dummies put it. Pretty soon, a million-year-old attractive cave girl comes on the timeline and embeds herself into the future. Soon, her hard-working other half set off to the future and make her way through the beds of the future. <br /> <br /> Ray returns a passable (but barely) smuggling, but the terrible acting has some decent skin. Yes, it is hardly tickling, but he! If it gets worse, it will cure insomnia. <br /> <br /> S10 ratings: 1/5 or 3/10
