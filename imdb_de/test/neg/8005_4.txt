Circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of turns and developed better. The film has a very talented cast, which usually performs well. However, she basically loses the audience, everyone is stabbed again and not stabbed at the same time, because they beat someone back and work with them ... did I lose you? Well, the movie is even more confusing when it was written by a first timer author. He has some redeeming qualities, although Famke Janssen shines above all as Lily, but unfortunately Lily gets a lot of USELESS screen time when she does not do anything. Dialogues are a bit cheesy and the accents are sometimes irritating, but it's still worth it to see it if you're a fan of actors, especially John and Famke, who spend most of their time on the screen. Remember to look at it with a notebook so you can write down who is double crossed every second ....
