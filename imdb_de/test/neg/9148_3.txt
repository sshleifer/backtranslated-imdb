The positive: It shot pretty well. Has some interesting marginal figures. Likely main character (albeit weak). <br /> <br /> The Bad: Story / Story. Processing. Wasted sign. Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is terribly bad. I do not understand how anyone can hand over $ 12 million to Guy Jenkin. And before I move on, I just want to say that I do not like Jessica Alba - I really wanted to like her in this movie. However, Jessica Alba with her wrong accent and model poses made me unhappy. She has absolutely no screen presence in this movie, and she ruins every scene she's in right now. The romance is not necessarily believable (not even a bit) The actors fluttered their wings and tried to blow this thing up with what was given to them - but unfortunately the movie only sinks. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict and nothing is gained. It's a pretty empty movie.
