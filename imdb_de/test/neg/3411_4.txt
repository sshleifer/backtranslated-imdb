The first of three Aztec Mummies films is the only film that, to the best of my knowledge, has never been fully translated into English. The film was cut and used in other films by people like Jerry Warren (he combined it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to make Face of the Screaming Werewolf) and was featured in Attack of the Mayan Mummy and elsewhere. ) The longest of the three films, a good part of this film, forms the two later films that use this as the basis for flashbacks. In the plot of this film, a scientist performs a regression experiment in the past, in which his subject returns and discovers hidden chambers in an Aztec pyramid. The group and a sinister figure called Bat want to use the information to discover hidden treasures. Instead, they discover a living mummy who has other plans. Long and lethargic, this movie has too little action to maintain its 80 minutes running time (worse, the mummy does not show up until one hour). Probably the smallest of the three films, it's easy to see why this movie was split, and it's the only way to make a movie that does not induce sleep. When I saw the movie last night, I had to fight to stay awake. It was a tough move and I found out that I had scanned to the point where the mummy appeared. If I have the choice, I would take a passport and watch the second two films.
