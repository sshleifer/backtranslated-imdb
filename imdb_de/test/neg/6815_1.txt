Like another reviewer, I really wanted to like this movie. I was with my father, the greatest lover and amplifier of classical music, but none of us could endure this movie. I would not even call it a movie. A better description could be the recording of some chamber concert pieces. As far as I remember, the camera has never moved. Rather, I sat for each piece only on a tripod. The only dramatic effects existed at the end of each piece as the movie blew on trees that blew in the wind, or small wavelets that lay on a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred taking shots of really big waves, but the best he could find was a few inches high on a nearby lake and another stationary camera. Really pathetic. I can not imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than five. When we went out, my dad and I were completely amazed at how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I do not know any good movies about Bach. The world really needs one, but just because it does not exist is no reason to see it. Someone will make one someday. Until then you just have to watch _Amadeus_.
