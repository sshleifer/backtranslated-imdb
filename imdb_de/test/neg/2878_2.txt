I read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it. I'm a big francophile and art lover, but I think this is another case where critics turn something "arty" or "intellectual" into something that is not. I'll be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perversity that I never really wanted to see. Of course the piano teacher has some big psychological problems, but I really did not want to portray them in such a graphic way. The movie is basically disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was pushed off the last scene with Jennifer Connelly, but that was not nearly the kind of disgust and dislike I felt in this movie.
