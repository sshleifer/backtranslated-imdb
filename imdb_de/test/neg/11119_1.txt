I found this movie a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not believable, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the movie I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters were finally killed. The special effects mostly consist of scenes of bloody dead or dying. A typical unimaginative Slasher movie. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe it's impossible to believe that a reclusive creature sneaking up on goats in the middle of the night could be caught by a bunch of awkward, noisy idiots. It is also impossible to believe how they knew exactly that they had to find it, even though the creature of capture or even photography was bypassed. The man who does the impossible to keep the Chupacabra alive is our one-dimensional Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing Dr. Pena is more obsessed than the creature, is his weapon. A darts weapon that worked was just a failure. <br /> <br /> The ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies) is introduced as a "war veteran". He uses his military skills by letting his men shoot at the creature, no matter which ship they are on. The Navy Seals appearing out of nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neal plays an insurance investigator who was taken aboard the cruise ship to catch a thief. He spends most of the movie with the one just trying to kill the creature. <br /> <br /> The creature does not even resemble a chupacabra. It does not behave like one either. Instead of a small, shy, mysterious animal, which is hunted by stealth at night, we get a bulletproof Freddy Kruger, who brings everything in sight. A simple search on Google would have been very helpful to the authors and the special effects crew.
