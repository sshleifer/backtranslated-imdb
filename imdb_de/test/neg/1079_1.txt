I have to admit that I was against this movie from the start, but I have tried to be impartial, which I did, but the idea of ​​reshaping a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, quirky British character full of character has to be from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The people in my house looked at this, so I swallowed my pride and told myself that I should be professional in movies (I finally studied at university). <br /> <br /> As expected for an American film of this kind, the film started with a persecution that was not bad. In fact, many of the action sequences are believable and this alone highlights the markings. <br /> <br /> But the characterization was miserable, the set pieces could very easily have been spliced ​​by an American stag you might have had misfortune and lacked in character. <br /> <br /> The US version seems to be watching the original movie with a failed initial robbery at an oblique angle, and the US version is doing the predictable and introduces an emotional factor to Sutherland's character with the death of Donald. This offers our US cousins ​​many opportunities for sykophant, taunious revenge attacks against the "culprits" that lead to predictable excesses. This is never as obvious as in the scenes with Charlize Theron (oh pretty! Oh, so pretty! Look at her pretty, wounded Bambi eyes, all!) That were absolutely disgusting. Especially their entry scene was something resident Evil or Tomb Raider, both a) were more entertaining and b) had better beginnings, because they could mess up with the British cinema, which was already crowded, no game as with British cinema, for you really feel something, and moments of inspiration. But I digress, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for him just seems to be the most damned maneuver I've seen in a while, and exposes the cynical Hollywood blockbuster lust for what it is. <br /> <br /> If you like one of these actors and agree with the comments above, DO NOT TAKE THIS FILM! If I had had the opportunity to see "Fight Club" or "American History X" after seeing Ed Norton here, I would have refused. Likewise Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is okay if you like that kind of thing). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all sets are as transparent as possible designed to make you think: 'Wow! He is smart! ',' Coo! He is cool! 'Hey! What a tough guy! Then there is the "funny PC guy" who sprayed "Comic Relief" on his forehead, but whose humor can be expected two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you've seen one or two similar films, you could easily confuse them as clones from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable. Not that Jerry is irrevocably terrible, by the way, but he just uses the clichés too much, as everyone knows (or should). <br /> <br /> I have to go in here. I did not make it to the end, so I could not say if the brilliant ending in the Michael Caine version did it, but I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare movies when I say 'It's me in a movie theater, I would have gone out and made a small protest outside. It's not just that there's another identical number after Ocean's 14 or something (Ocean's Eleven was fine, but does not care about the rest!) With all the glitz, glamor, fake-sass, and pantomime-heroics of such a movie, but I am could not recognize anything of the original at all. <br /> <br /> So if you expect 'THE Italian JOB' and not 'OCEAN'S 14', though poorly written, with less established cast and characters, some unobtrusive elements and cardboard cutout script writing then NOT WATCH! I do not mind that people like a bit of mindless fun, but this is a criminal hatch job that does not deserve to be under the title of a classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt fully justified in my indignant and pitiful reaction when I first heard that the film was being shot. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some of the action sequences are not bad at all. So add an extra "1" if you like these kinds of things.
