Did the authors pay people to come here and write positive reviews? I mean, really, it's a bit choppy, and Spike is not that funny. He seems to be the serious guy who tries too hard to be funny. There are so many mediocre performances on this show; The opening sketch was as always "Talk show, apply directly to the forehead", again and again. And another, where Spike and another guy came up, and it was not even funny. They did not even do anything but sit around and laugh. Haha! In another case, Spike spoke to a Korean who ate duck and told him he had a pet duck. Haha! I mean, really, Spike only gets fun people on his show, so people like this show
