It may be, though I still missed two or three. This movie constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape reminiscent of so many hazy scenes from Sherlock Holmes' films, populating it with weird, Kafka-like characters. In the middle of it all is the movie Mia Farrow, who sounds like she's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to repeat his nebulous role in Play It Again Sam. Should we laugh about his stuttering and wrangling? I think I would do it if the rest of the movie was clearly a comedy, but that's not it. At least I do not think so.
