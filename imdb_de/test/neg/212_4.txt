Disappointing Heist movie indeed, I actually expected a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff throughout the movie and there are few of those cat and mouse stuff, but it was just stupid. And it essentially showed all the good scenes in the trailer. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the entire movie because it's easy to predict. Basically, the conspiracy is a few workers from armored truck companies trying to steal the $ 42 million they are supposed to carry until one of the members has a conscience. I thought the movie was better with the actors of famous actors, but I was wrong. I mean, this is not necessarily a bad movie, but it just was not that good or has a certain depth. This is definitely a rental fee, which is not really worth seeing in the cinemas. heist <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
