That could have been the best game ever !! But the game makers have messed up after 3 attacks and the end of everything! This is a combination of Prince Of Persia, Hitman, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). These four games above are considered one of the best games ever made. <br /> You combine the four and get this game !! It has all the good aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills, stealth attacks, open world and HISTORY! For the first 3 attacks you think this game is best !! But after the third, things seem to become so repetitive that you wait for the end of the game. <br /> <br /> I played this on a PC and the PC version is awful with glitches and the stupid side missions are pointless. <br /> <br /> My advice to all. This is a good game, but get you either the XBOX360 or PS3. Do not take it for the PC. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this game came from the creators of Prince Of Persia. Surely the producer is hot, but the game is not hot and it's NOT better than the four games mentioned above!
