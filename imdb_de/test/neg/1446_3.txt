It seems that Dee Snyder could have run out of ideas during the filming. The second half of the movie is basically just a repeat of the first, which makes the movie very boring. Conclusion: Cops daughter is sucked in the chatroom in the party, where she is sexually molested / tortured by a psychopath (played by Snider). Cop saves her, psychopath is put into therapy / prison. Psychopath appears four years later and the whole thing is played again. There are many unexplainable plot elements in all of this: Why was "Captain Howdy" even psycho? What about the unique detour of the personality to a bibeligen climber? How does he kidnap all adults and close it without effort to sew their mouths? And maybe the biggest unresolved puzzle of all ... How does a 6'2 "man with pink hair hide completely behind an average 5'6" woman? These are just some of the questions I had while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Snyder has been trying to make some kind of comment about a) the "dangers" of online chat rooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christian sexual manners, and c) the implications that our twisted Puritan society as individuals has on us. If so, he failed. The movie is just too badly made to convey social entertainment. The torture scenes are stupid and boring, bordering on silly ones (especially when Snyder enters one of his "pain and death monologues") and everything else is just stupid. The call-tracing scene is really lame ... when will the cops get caller ID and * 69? The young partner of the cop's main character is particularly terrible ... he should not actually work as an actor. And the sound in the final showdown scene is really bad. I think they could not afford two boom microphones. <br /> <br /> The rest of the acting is not terrible, but not good either. The policeman is a nice touch, and his distanced quality is not entirely believable. Dee Snyder is not that bad, but he growls and sneighs way too much. Robert Englund (who has earned much better) brings up a weird performance of a hypocritical redneck. If you're a big fan of Robert Englund, the movie is probably worth watching just for him. All others have been forgotten. <br /> <br /> In summary, we have seen how all these elements of action have been done and made better in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HELLRAISER and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one instead of watching this turkey. 10.3. <br /> <br />
