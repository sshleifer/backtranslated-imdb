Two stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer, who looks like a young version of her father, Christopher Plummer on the train, stars in this movie along with Robert Forster - who should have put a little black shoe on the bald spot. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Amanda Plummer in a good movie. She always plays these slightly crazy characters in movies that do not quite fit together, and this too. <br /> <br /> First, we have two young women, sisters, who are not like each other in the least, who can be picked up separately by questionable men along the streets. <br /> <br /> Amanda's character, Sandra, has at least one good reason. To allow Jake (Robert Forster). to pick them up at all. She was apparently torn off the road by a maniac and her car is pretty much destroyed. <br /> <br /> Attention - spoiler ahead! <br /> <br /> However, as we move on, we find that Dr. Jake no longer plays with a full deck as Amanda. He makes every decision on the basis of a coin. <br /> <br /> As Dr. Jake and Amanda arrive at a motel, who do we see only the madman's car, and what's Amanda doing in his station car and snooping? What her motive was is never clear, considering that the man is apparently dangerous and might try to kill her. One would think that the last thing she would do would be to get into such a precarious situation. <br /> <br /> She does not just snoop around, she also finds some money and takes it with her. <br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter we have some other things that do not match. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake, with Amanda as a passenger, has run out of gas, and they both set their car down and leave. If you had crossed a desert, he would have checked his gas gauge - this seems very unlikely. Later he is seen driving the same car. When or how did he get the car back? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake tells Amanda that he knows she took the money. Well, how would he know that? As far as I know, he did not see her, and she did not tell him she did it. Then we have a character named Santini (David Thewlis), the man who it was. If you drive the station wagon, take them with you, and I'll be damned if he does not know that Amanda took the money too. How should he know that? <br /> <br /> It loses credibility the further we go. <br /> <br /> When Alice, Amanda's sister (Fairuza Balk), falls into the clutches of the murderer, she decides on her fate Throwing a coin - one would think she was very, very careful that the coin, the exchanging them for a puncture coin, definitely the trick coin would be - but apparently she is not. <br /> <br /> This destroys the credibility of this movie.
