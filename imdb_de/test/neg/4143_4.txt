I wanted to watch this movie, but somehow I do not find it in myself. <br /> <br /> With a duality of fighting styles, Li shows up. Li in a somewhat decent fight for supremacy br /> <br /> This is one of the films in which the story carries the performances. His acting is extremely amateurish, hesitant and stiff ... for the most part of the movie ... until the end. At first I deceived myself believing that he was only doing it for one of his two characters. They know to show a difference in personality. But it seemed to be inexperience or lack of talent. Towards the end it got a bit better and more relaxed. But that was not enough to save his performance. Jet Li's play improves with his career. I do not hate his acting. I simply hated him at that moment. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the effects were very "B" class effects. What are the effects? <br /> <br /> The story itself had great potential. It was uniquely creative, daring and fresh. Unfortunately, either the budget was insufficient to allow for better lighting, effects, movie quality, and some acting lessons, or the director did not care enough about those little details. He has also not dealt with SCIENCE in science fiction. A fact that greatly affected the movie. <br /> <br /> The combat sequences were a little one-sided, as he seemed to give one character more and the other little. All in all, the story made for a very entertaining attempt. <br /> <br /> As enjoyable as that was, I could not help thinking that this was just one of those movies. You can not help but pay attention to what it should be, not what it is. <br /> <br /> It rates 6.0 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br />> This is a 4.2 / 10 (on the "A" scale) for a good plot, from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
