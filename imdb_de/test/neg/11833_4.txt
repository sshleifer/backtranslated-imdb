For me, films about the everyday are often the most interesting of all films, in the hands of a revealing artist who examines every little detail of everyday life. French cinema often seems to be very good in this respect, and I love French cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was about the everyday. It did not have a big plot. It was just characters who lived in a city, very normal people, and that just happened. But it was not a very interesting stuff and it was not studied very revealing. The film has captured some mood, but not a particularly captivating mood. And although I can not think of much that the film was specifically wrong, at almost every level it has failed to do anything right. <br /> <br /> There were many characters in this movie. Many of them looked so hard to find out who was who and how their relationships were. I do not mind getting into a movie or even looking at a particularly complex movie more than once to iron out the details, but this was a puzzle it's not worth solving. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant - functional, not brilliant, but pleasant. The camera has often taken beautiful postcards. The really interesting little details were rarely found. <br /> <br /> I've seen a handful of not so good films at the Seattle International Film Festival so far, but this was the only one that failed to get the credit rolled. When the movie finally came to an end, I felt a collective sigh of relief. I suppose there are probably a few people who would like it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
