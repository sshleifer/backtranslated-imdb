Someone called this movie a "fabulous horror" movie, and I think that fits pretty well. At least that's the concept. A group of teenagers, each with their own vices, stand up to a twisted sideshow barker. He decides to teach the teen a lesson by making her a part of the freak show. A cool idea, but could have done better. The fate for some of the teens has been too obviously pushed into your face, while other characters may have been worked out more. The end was also a horror. No resolution or big turn or anything. <br /> <br /> But as a horror movie on a low budget, it's pretty funny to watch it. If you like cheesy spooky parties, you should have a laugh if you watch this one. I think one of the mistakes is ... that it takes itself too seriously. It's a stupid movie, and if it were a bit more confident in that respect, I think it would have been better. But at least there are enough nice carnival themes and b-movie monster make-up for you to watch.
