I felt that the movie was rash and the acting was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the main girl was stupid and the guy who played the devil was terrible. The story was confusing and idiotic. The movie did not make sense and was incredible. The movie is not the worst, but not too far away. Overall I was very disappointed it could have been much better. My score is 3 out of 10
