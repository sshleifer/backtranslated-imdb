(Some Corruptors) Boring like a rinse-water Slasher movie that got this confused homeless Harry, Darwyn Swalve, to assassinate estate agents all over the city of LA, because of the high prices they charge for their proportions. He looks like something extra from a Clint Eastwood "Spaghetti Western" Harry, who lives in abandoned homes and eats dog food, gets very angry where his whole lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted. This happens when a number of estate agents invade his space to sell the homes where he is with his potential clients. <br/> <br /> Joseph Bottome plays in this barrel horror movie as a radio talk show presenter. David Kelly, the handsome and popular host psychologist on the KDRX survival line. DR. Kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callers, Tracy, who eventually blew out her brain while surviving her ordeal with the Doc, who could do nothing to survive her. <br /> <br /> The real estate murderer can with Dr. med. Kelly talks about his adventures on the radio, and the police are trying to get the document's phone number and address by keeping him up to date, but he refuses to violate his rating by offending potential callers for fear of surveillance not be called by the LADP. <br /> <br /> Kelly also has a hot and serious affair with a real estate manager and agent, the busty Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbeau, whose sales office is Harry's main victim in the movie. Harry also assassinated Lisa's main housing competition, the plump and hideous Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to ban Lisa by all means, even if he was to kill her. <br /> <br /> Getting Berney Alone and with Pants Down Harry cuts his head while being entertained by one of his clients, a whore, whom he leaves dead and hangs with headless Barney. The film ends with the confused Harry taking Lisa Lisa as hostage and dr. Kelly tries to come to her rescue just to have Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), who looks like he has not slept for a week, jumps out of nowhere and blows Harry's brain. Harry quickly came to life again without the gay matter between his ears and was killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown off a balcony and landing on the floor when a dozen members of the LAPD, M16, tensed and ready to come in Scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie "Opean House" worked with the tension ridiculous to almost nonexistent. Even the hot sex scenes between Dr. Kelly and Lisa did not save the film, as there were far too few, only two, and the sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a bit too underexposed, with too little light and too much clothes. in all of them. <br /> <br /> Harry, the killer in the movie, was also a bit too funny to be taken seriously when he tried to confront Dr. Kelly by phone and personally to say something about the amount of rent and housing prices in the country and how people like him find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live. You can sympathize with Harry's concerns about the high cost of living, but are very critical of how crazy he has gone in correcting it.
