I saw this movie or part of it in the hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that this was just stupid. For one thing, you have the worst drama ever! Lead actress Birgitte Nielsen is terrible, uninspired and barely attractive. And she certainly does not look like a female warrior who could kick a veteran warrior king in the ass, but she does. And what about the feminist attitude, it's just hypocrisy. For one thing, her family was killed by a woman, then she goes to a warrior school or something so she can learn to fight against men. She then joins a fat servant and his children's king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. These two characters are just stupid and destroy the atmosphere that created the movie. After that, I could not recover from Nielsen's painful acting and stupid clich√©s and the lack of some real action. Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this movie that actually made it TV. <br /> <br /> I liked the Conan movie, but that's just crap!
