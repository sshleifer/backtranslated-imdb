As mentioned in other comments, the main problem of the NVA is that it can not decide what it wants to be, a cheap slapstick or an honest parody of the GDR army. There are a few moments that are very moving, for example when one of the recruits with a completely broken personality returns from Schwedt Military Prison. But in the end, Leander Hau√ümann relies on childish humor. No wonder that the film flopped at the German box office, since he was historically not tuned to the actual situation in these training camps and was led by an actor who unfortunately can not give a differentiated performance Camera work by Frank Griebe, who as always a wonderful job makes. Without his beautiful pictures I would have rated the movie much worse.
