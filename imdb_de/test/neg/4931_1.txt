This movie is stupid, made by stupid people. The plot I suspect works well enough for a horror movie, but the actions of these characters are stupid! How unbelievably stupid to the Nth degree! Basically, the entire movie is made up of these four idiots who have been repeatedly captured, even though there are many easy ways and ways to defeat their kidnappers. It makes no sense and is not entertaining at all. To sting the eye is more rational and probably more fun than looking at it. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS **** The end is hilarious !! The only good part of the movie! I would almost laugh in the end! All this stupid movie, and it ends with the mute girl being carried off in a box into white slavery in Asia !! Hilarious! I thought it would be an absolutely fantastic ending to a really crappy movie.
