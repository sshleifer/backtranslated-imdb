The Monkee's "Head" is one of those weird phenomena that struck me. If something makes no sense, people will try to read things in them and give them deep meanings that the Creator never intended. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> The film is a spectacle of the stream of consciousness in which the Monkees float in various sketches, blackouts, set pieces, etc., similar to their TV series. But while the TV show was laughed at, this seems to be nothing but a kind of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state imposed by this brand of psychedelia. All in all, it's The Monkees that sends the same, but now it's "awareness raising" because the laughter track is removed. There is no jarring of humor or sense of the whole. it only boils with colorful lights. <br /> <br /> The music in "Head" should prove to everyone that the Monkees did not have a bit of songwriting ability. The melodies are mostly garbage; The only thing that is audible is "Porpoise Song", which opens and closes the movie. But the thing is, that was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song, and although it's above average for the Monkees, it's below average for Goffin and King standards. It's like listening to one of the old Peter And Gordon songs Paul McCartney wrote for them: You might think it's a pretty good song, but then you learn who composed it, and you realize that it is a way Mike Nesmith's song may be passable, the rest is worthless. Davy Jones has, I think, what the filmmakers envisioned as "the big number" in the picture, because it's the only song presented as a show biz and not cut into a movie montage or a dream sequence, but he does also falls flat because the song is not good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I've always liked the Monkees, so the movie is a real disappointment. Sure, they were cheesy, but they were so happy. <br /> <br /> They knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it. But then they became ambitious. In "Head" they actually joke that they are a pop product, but the truth is they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and be taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something that approaches. "Head" proves that they have failed on all counts. 1 * of 4
