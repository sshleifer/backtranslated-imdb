I bought it because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was there and a friend of mine was around, and for $ 1.99, how bad could it be? Then I read some commentary on the movie and started getting excited - maybe this was really a lost gem, one of those great little B movies that everyone had forgotten but deserved to be revived. NOT CORRECT! I'm not sure how anyone else can praise this thing from some areas here, but I found it one of the most boring and blatant films I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about Richard Carlson's hokey Texas accent (straight from the Georgian part of Texas, I think). It's just stupid. Nobody in the movie behaves like a real person. Nobody. And nobody does anything credible or interesting. It's not even a clich√© feast. There are only about 80 minutes frames. He even managed to make Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya and C. Aubrey Smith boring. That's incredible.
