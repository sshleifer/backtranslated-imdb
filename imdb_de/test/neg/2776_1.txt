In the Muslim land of Khalid (fictional), Reed Hadley dies as a benevolent leader / dictator as Amir of cancer. Amir dies and a desperate plan unfolds. His body is wrapped in aluminum foil and in a secret operation (the population does not know his death), consisting of his physician (Nigserian) and Mohammed, undertaken outside the country to perform a risky brain transplant. The operation is being carried out by the nefarious Dr. Kent Taylor, who believes there is no chance of failure, and has two assistants. One of them is about 3 meters high (Master Blaster actually led Barter Town) and the other is a mutilated and traumatized 7-foot giant named Gor. What could possibly go wrong? <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention Amir's deathbed, the American blonde Barbie wife Tracy, or that Dr. Kent has a dungeon with female slavers and megalomania? How about a brain transplant that was not taken? There are a lot of double deals in this area and people are being killed but I will not lie to you anymore: MISSION COMPLISHED. The purposes justify the means. If you can accept that, you do not have to waste 80 minutes. I hope that warns enough. Do not say I did not warn you. If you have to watch, then you do not look alone and have plenty of medicine available. <br /> <br /> celluloid rehab
