I saw this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival and would not recommend it. It's two and a half hours in which not much happens in one step through the porridge. <br /> <br /> The main characters are coreless and have no charisma or personality. Nobody smiles during the movie at all (me either, if I had his life), and even though Domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite, she does not seem to have any sex at all. <br /> <br /> The whole experience is depressing and cumbersome. The director stuck to every scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than impressing me with the beauty of his technique. <br /> <br /> Too many questions were in my mind: Why is that doing? he sniffs the head of the Algerian? Why is he hovering? What is he looking for over the Kleinzaun? Why is he kissing Joseph? Why did we look at this garbage instead of ordering another bottle of wine in Bouzy Rouge?
