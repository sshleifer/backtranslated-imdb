After not reading the original book or seeing the previous movie and not knowing anything about the history of the film or the current movie, I came to this film with an open mind. <br /> <br /> It's really difficult to know where to start commenting on the movie because it all seems so confused. It seems there is a point or a message or something in the movie, but what that is is completely unclear. <br /> <br /> The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was implemented very well and the motivation for the time travel was clear. From here, however, it went downhill. <br /> <br /> All the time travel seems to have only the most indefinite connection to the quest that was set at the beginning. There are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated events that really do not flow and make the movie seem disconnected and lost. At one point, one wonders if the main story of the movie is the fate of the moon. <br /> <br /> When Hartdegen arrives in 802.701 AD, the film becomes very frustrating, as he apparently can not find anything important about the Eloi, and though it seems obvious there is something to be known, it remains annoying elusive. This is a weird change from the previous time travel and one wonders why all of this was suddenly abandoned for a whole new story. So many things happen for which there should be an explanation, but there is no discovery. I really wanted to know what the movie is all about, what to discover, but to no avail. After reading a summary of what's going on in this book, it seems like a half-hearted attempt has been made to reproduce this in the movie, but it has been so simplified and "dumbed down" that the meaning and context are completely lost. <br /> <br /> Just as we hope to finally find out where it all leads, the movie suddenly changes another major directional change and becomes a thoughtless action movie with no real action. It's as if the director at this point just stopped giving the movie a meaning. Meanwhile countless important things happen without explanation. Hartdegen does not take the opportunity to return to the past two times for no reason, and then suddenly loses his interest in time travel for no reason. The film comes to an abrupt end when Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi. <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie is very disappointing after a good start. Hartdegen's adventures spend too much time before they arrive with the Eloi. The worst part of the film, however, is, in my opinion, the most important part: setting up the situation with the Eloi. The whole point is completely missed, and this undermines the rest of the movie. After that, the film focuses too much on effects and actions, and all attempts to revert to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things going on without explanation, the movie seems to be losing and losing direction. The final, in which Hartdegen decides that he no longer cares about time travel, is the most inexplicable of them all. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the entire movie was like a collection of incoherent incidents. The meaning and context were lost, though the gaping hole where it should have was very obvious. However, what was so frustrating was that there was so much potential here: it was not a bad movie, it could have been so much better. The start was very promising, the time looked fantastic and could have worked well if it had not been tangent, and Hartdegen's experience with the Eloi could have worked so easily if a few more correct questions had been asked and not Such a temptation would have been to "stupid" and simplify. I only wish I had a time machine to travel back in time and to discourage the mistakes that were made.
