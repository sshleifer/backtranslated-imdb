There were only two reasons for me to watch this movie. First, there were Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei (both good actors), and I had nothing better to do. When I saw the movie, I immediately thought of something better: SLEEPING! This movie is a waste of time. It's a standard ex cop strip. The ex-copper is the best that ever existed, but it was fired. He always does things against the aversion of his former friends and he saves the day. All the big surprises (NOT !!!). Go to sleep, or if you suffer from insomnia, try it here. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
