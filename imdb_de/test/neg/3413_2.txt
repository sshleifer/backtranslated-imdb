I just saw this movie in a nice, air-conditioned cinema here in Bangkok. And since the outside temperatures are 37 Â° C and very high humidity, my 100Bt were not wasted. This is the kind of movie that delivers a taste test, so to speak. Anyone who claims to like or love him immediately goes to the same list of tasteless phonies that still talk about the superiority of British television. At least the gormless old wide in the wheelchair was good for a few taunts. <br /> <br /> Pseudo-abundance and fat lips, which are characteristic of many French cinemas, do not actually make a good movie. I'd rather see Independence Day ten times in a row than sit by that stinker again.
