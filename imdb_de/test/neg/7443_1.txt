The violent sequel to RoboCop was led by Irvin Kershner (Never Say Never Again, The Empire Strikes Back). He will never be as good as the original, as he is almost humorless and extremely mean and should be classified as NC-17. Because of scenes in which infants were involved in shootings, people threatened to brutally murder very young infants with REAL automatic weapons, and even scenes with a 12-year-old who used much explicit profanity and gave drugs to many random people shooting and graphic shoot up and kill police and SWAT officers, open the fire on police officers when many small and young children are present, and a whole group of children who use strong profanity and the shopkeeper (who is a very old man) one Electronics store beat up stealing and destroying many objects there. This movie gives a new meaning to the term "horribly mean," but the effects and action sequences are extraordinarily incredible. Overall an OK movie.
