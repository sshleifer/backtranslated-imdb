Am I the only person Amadeus has seen and remembers? Each scene in "Copying" has its counterpart in Milos Forman, Amadeus - from the galloping carriages that are accompanied by raging strings, to the entrance of Anna through the dark hallway, preceded by the man with the key, to dialogue with the conclusion Anna to Beethoven's feet Ã  la Salieri before the dying Mozart. Does anyone else remember the dialogue in this script: <br /> <br /> Salieri "Time?" , Mozart "common time". ..... "We start with the strings ..." and "copied". <br /> <br /> Remember Cynthia Nixon is leaning against a jamb and tears are falling on her freckled face - the same scene, just replace her with Beethoven's nephew. Even the scatological humor (Furzwitz) is the same. There is even a cardinal, followed by a plate of sweet biscuits, reminiscent of Salieri in the ballroom. Does nobody else remember? And the scene in which Anna cries to God, "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And beyond that we have a youthful screenplay with an opening show that reads like the character identifications you would find in a children's story. "I am Mr. Beethoven, I am the composer ..." <br /> <br /> And what is the purpose of the bridge builder? Unlike putting the technical against the artificial ... a comparison that is not developed at all - probably because it has no meaning, especially when it comes to Beethove, who was a master of the technical. <br /> <br /> There is only one great scene - playing the ninth. First, the music that brings you to tears. On the other hand, there is the very erotic interaction of Anna, the copyist era, and Beethoven's conducting, which surpasses explicit sexual intimacy. So intense that it is almost embarrassing. <br /> <br /> But please - the rest of the movie - Where is the collective memory of the world? You've seen it all before ... and better!
