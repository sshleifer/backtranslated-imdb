Last fall (2001) I attended a film lesson taught by the director of this film (Mark Hoeger). His extensive knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to analyze every scene in a movie, and winning an Oscar in an obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. When he mentioned during a lesson that he had just finished a movie called "Full Ride" and was in the post-production phase, my interest was aroused. However, this would be the last time I would hear about this film project. Until last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week I saw in a TV program that "Full Ride" is shown on the WB network. This immediately brought a red flag, as I can not help WB but associate WB with teensploitation shows like Dawson's Creek, Charmed and so on. Besides, the fact that Full Ride would appear on television was not flattering in itself. Nevertheless, I took this time aside and sat down to see the emergence of my former film teacher. After two hours and the credits began, I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB quality show that lasted for two hours. In fact, it almost seemed like this movie was made with the sole intention of showing only on the WB network. The criticism of this film is basically like criticizing a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? The characters are flat, the story is literally a clich√©, the scenes are completely thought out and character development is forced and unbelievable. This movie screams "unoriginal". <br /> <br /> The main character, Matt Sabo, is a hot shot of the wrong side of the tracks (in the truest sense of the word) who plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then dizzy away into a life of the crime. He is then offered the chance of a full-ride scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously he agrees to play football with an all-star football team without much choice, but is not exempted from his classmates because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude. <br /> <br /> Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a sympathetic figure, in contrast to the always very abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost applaud her if she rejects him first. But of course, the inevitable comes. She falls in love with him, changes his attitude towards everything and seems to be good and happy. But now it's time for conflicts! <br /> <br /> Earlier in the film, Amy Matt explains that she does not want to score with him because it would be "shameful" for her and her mother. This is very much to Matt's dismay and his football colleague (yes, they are finally getting warm with him) who bet he would not get one. But of course, Matt accepts these terms and decides that he's not just concerned with the Nookie. Here is the exciting plot thicker. If you do not want me to ruin this surprise, take it one step further. <br /> <br /> [BEGIN SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Matt learns from some indigenous men that Amy Lear apparently always tries to score points each year with a man from the All-Star team to try can use it to escape their life in the small town by working in a cafeteria (which is even amazed), and make it into the big city. Suddenly he realized that he was being used and that his love was a scam. Matt tried to commit another crime and leave the football camp before there was "the big game". Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time, but he's too hot to buy it. So what does Matt do? Will he bring her back? Or is he going back to gas stations and is an all-round fool? I will not ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you. <br /> <br /> [END SPOILER] <br /> <br /> So if somehow I pumped you up for this movie, then please realize that was my sarcasm and not real enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of Varsity Blues or Summer Catch. And that does not say much. There is hardly a comedy to save it, and the characters are too shallow to take care of it. What else do you have left? Not very much. <br /> <br /> What I disliked most about this movie was how much of an ugly picture Hoeger painted in this Nebraska movie. It seems he's been trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is too stereotypical and too shallow. The big hopes of the characters in "The Big City" and the actions they are taking are very exaggerated, and they just make the stereotype that Nebraskers are a bunch of pans living on farms just farther. I'm not sure if Hoeger's intentions were good at putting his homeland in the spotlight, but I think he had a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken one or two notes from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply uses Nebraska as the backdrop for his films, Hoeger incorporates them into the plot of Full Ride and so gets into his mind where he fires, throwing out superficial garbage that seems to come from a movie outsider. If Hoeger had actually lived here, you'd think he knew better. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm completely disappointed with Hoeger's first big movie, and I hope that the next time he can combine it with a bit of originality, to create something else and make him think.
