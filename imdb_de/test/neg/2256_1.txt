I'll just start with some quotes from other reviewers who describe it best. <br /> <br /> "This is by far one of the most overrated movies of the year and probably the worst movie Tarantino has ever made." "The ONLY good thing in this movie was Mr. Waltz's performance." <br /> <br /> "I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie rank 40 of the best films of all time is the only thing that goes with it, leaves me open-mouthed." Well, read for more information The "Hated it" reviews. <br /> <br /> One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats the audience as a lot of stupid people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know that Tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictional acts, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazi officers will be in a film premiere in occupied France, and you have only two guards in the whole theater and in the area? Wherever an American-African walks around freely, with steel pipes locking and setting fire to the doors. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds, opening the door for our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler with about 100 rounds in place ... very stupid. At least, challenge our intelligence and create a smarter conspiracy to kill one of the most dreaded tyrants of all time (Go Walk Valkyrie). Besides, Mike Myer's imitation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy who does Hitler. Imagine that, what further ruins that is that the only clever and powerful character that has ever met The movie with its psychological and insane questioning is effortlessly tricked by the movie's most mindless character. After seeing the movie, I sympathized with the Nazis, who were shown more courage and humanity than our Basterds !!! Imagine that. <br /> <br /> My recommendations, if you are suffering from insomnia, wasting 2 hours 33 minutes or you want to give your mind a break, go watch this movie.
