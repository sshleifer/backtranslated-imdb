I consider myself a big fan of low-budget horror movies. The more bizarre and resourceful the movie is, the more blood and guts the better and I really fall in love with cheap movies if done right. Luther starts off well ... his circus origins, a scary passage in a supermarket, an attack by an old lady and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse made for a good mood. A hot sex / shower scene occurs when the daughter of the daughter and the friend of the woman arrive in the house. If Luther steals his friend's bike, the movie gets worse. <br /> <br /> The characters have many options to: A) rescue their relatives, B) help the police, C) escape or (most importantly) D) KILL LUTHER !!! I can not feel empathy or fear for characters who are too stupid to help themselves. Chareters have the chance to arm themselves with weapons and knives during Luther's absence. A police officer finally arrives and is just as unable to stop Luther, even though he has a rifle aimed directly at Luther at one point, while Luther claps and makes his interpretation of the Polish chicken dance. I was in vain trying to train my TV: "Make sure he's dead!", "He's gone, get out of here!" Or "Kill him!" <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he is hardly Hannibal Lecter. If you can not outwit that ego, you deserve what comes to you. Half way through the movie you'll be so lethargic to the fates of the madman that you can only wait through curious curiosity for the mildly amusing ending. This movie was named one of the 101 best movies by Fangoria you've never seen before. Well, Fangoria is only halfway right in the case of Luther the Geek.
