The man with Bogart's face makes it his mission to reduce the nostalgia of the audience for the film era of the 30s to 40s. It is miserable for several reasons. First, Sacchi, though somewhat reminiscent of Bogart, and even as he occasionally speaks as he does and uses his manners, lacks any kind of Bogart's charisma or acting. This is really obvious when Sacchi does not clearly imitate a scene from a Bogart movie. Second, the film does not have the top-notch characters Bogart could work with. There are no Peter Lorres or Sydney Greenstreets in this, folks. Certainly we are served with performances by Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft, but they just do not have the same caliber (or do not have enough screen time or are wrong). Third, all attempts of "modern" humor fail. All underwear jokes, Marlowe almost never took off the damn hat and trench coat (even if Bogart did), etc. are just not funny and really pull this movie down. Fourth, I've never heard a goofier theme song on this side of Mitchell. After all, the film's false reverence for Bogart (and the work of other classic actors) is really irritating. Bogart * almost * never played a hero, on those occasions he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This film makes Bogart a triggering, moralist doer. While this may be the case with some movie characters, Bogart's characters rarely fit in this bill. It's films like these that make people not see the cinema of the past. They think that everything is hokey.
