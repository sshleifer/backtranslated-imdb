Everything that this movie has tried is being done better - and great in Run Lola Run. The Red Haired Hip Cutie, the critical dates, the endangered lover and the message "Crime sometimes pays off". BUT unlike "Lola" it just is not believable or well put together. It is a laborious blow that could have worked for me if I had seen him in front of "Lola" - but by comparison he fades. Yes! The Falling Beetle was nice! But that was about the only surprise in the movie. Do yourself a favor and see the Real McCoy - (and the GENUINE HÃ¼ftkopf!) - in Run Lola Run!
