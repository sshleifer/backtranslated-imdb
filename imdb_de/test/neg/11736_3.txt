Normal ally I do not mind making remakes. There are some pretty good ones out there, BUT this one is a stinker! Considering that it was practically scene by scene, it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied the direction of Al virtually flawless and added color (I'm not one of those who think B & W must be classic). It should be at least a mediocre movie ... but it was a pee-pee-caa-caa! I do not understand how it could have been so bad. If you must, you see it as curiosity, but I would suggest that you do not bother.
