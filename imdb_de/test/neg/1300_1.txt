From an earlier poster was derived that the military in a disaster, as shown in the film, would not report to the police. In fact, the military role would be to assist the civilian authorities on request. The civil authorities would keep the priority. In practice, the army would need about 48 hours to mobilize itself. There is no large army presence in London, especially with current commitments abroad. Even then, they would need to call the TA. <br /> <br /> As far as COBRA is concerned, we had the impression that it was a complete state emergency department - even in relation to a police department of the police. In fact, COBRA stands for Cabinet Office Briefing Room "A". It's just the room where the PM or DPM meets their advisors to discuss the current emergency!
