This story begins in the end! The opening speeches of the film advise us. Unfortunately this is not true, as we then get about 70 minutes of a typical B-science-fiction film of the fifties. The story is bleak; The plot is very weak and was obviously taken on a low budget, as was often the case then. The story could have covered any situation in which people seek refuge in an isolated house and be threatened from the outside. It was simply adapted to a science fiction story. <br /> <br /> The scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes and smoke. - Oh yes, there was a pool of water. Someone wore a rubber mask with a beak-like face and something that looked like feathers. <br /> <br /> Written by Lou Rusoff, who was writing several sci-fi stories at the time, including The She Creature and It Conquered The World was completed within days, leaving the actors no time for their characters to develop better. The low budget constraints also prevented the film from reaching its potential. It could have been a much better movie than it turned out. <br /> <br /> Mike Connors and Richard Denning have given the film some life, but even they could not bring this movie into the category where you could say - "I liked the movie" Richard Denning's acting career began in 1937 He starred with Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember and later became known on television in the series Hawaii Five-O and The Flying Doctor. Director: Roger Corman, who as a director and producer many Can show films. He made some good movies and still does. He became well known for directing films from the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, often with Vincent Price. He also made other low-budget films; Some were good and entertaining for some reason, and most were much better than that. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> Darnmay <br /> <br /> 10th September 2007
