I've recently seen a bunch of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies and think of them a lot. <br /> <br /> This SRE movie seemed to be much smaller than any of the others I've ever seen. Maybe that's because this is more of a comedy / horror movie than a horror, and maybe it's because the humor did not register very well with me. The credits start as the last ten minutes begin. There are a few outtakes, stupidities and behind the scenes as these credits roll. <br /> <br /> SRE movies tend to be short and still feel unpadded. This is no exception, in some scenes that tend to take too long. <br /> <br /> The story is about a poor kid in Christmastown, California, who was picked up by all his classmates. He had stolen a shoe and could not replace it, he was called "Oneshoe McGroo". Due to an obsession of pirates his parents gave him for Christmas a eye cross with a Christmas tree on the eye-click. Many of the classmates are killed and the few who remain meet to decide what they want to do. They are gradually being picked up by McGroo, who is chirping to the sounds of the bells of sleigh bells. <br /> <br /> The characters are pretty much all wide clich√©s, like the nerd named Dorkus, etc. scene in which a perverted couple has sex; The woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man is carrying a large watermelon slice of paper over his head. This reminded me of some strange sex scenes by director Rinse Dream. <br /> <br /> The image quality is good and there are many extras. But basically a pretty stupid movie. Well, I guess you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. Nevertheless, there are many other needy holidays.
