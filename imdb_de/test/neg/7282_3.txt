That's how it happened. In the top rated commentary on this film, someone says "Nishi is an honorable man". "Really?" This is a guy who mainly kills and maims people in the movie. He takes a short break to rob a bank. Honorable How would you like your children to go to school with the children of someone who calls that honorable? Wait, there is more! The person also says "we can say he thinks all the time." How can we do that? Well, do you know this joke "How can you tell if a CEO / politician / lawyer is lying?" ... "His / her lips are moving." Well, Nishi's lips never move, so I think he thinks. Of course, this is the existentialism to warm the hearts of the victimization cult. Existentialism allegedly emphasizes that an individual takes responsibility for the consequences of his actions. Not Nishi. Borrow money from the yakuza. What do you want back? Kill her. The cops learn it. Kill you and your wife. <br /> <br /> Really honorable.
