Well, I'll come in and admit that as part of my study of history, I was forced to watch this movie, and then, as part of my grade, write a short film review film alone, in my sole discretion I found it extremely boring and absurd. The style is outdated over the years, and acting is a farce. Instead of using dialogues, they instead exchange glances on themselves or sometimes in the air. For me, such exaggerated acting is not a major emotion, and after seeing an extremely close face of Ivan for the hundredth time, I prayed for the end of the film How Wrong Is Ivan's Character. This man was evil, the murderous thugs of his bodyguard and his character cowardly. For me, the film was just a piece of Stalin's propaganda, inaccurate and boring.
