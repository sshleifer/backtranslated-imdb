This movie did not excite me. During a holiday in Turkey, I noticed that it was played in the local cinema and decided to take the opportunity to see it. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, but the story runs in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> One thing that I did not fully follow is how Borne got the money for the bribery guards. <br /> <br /> The other thing I did not like much was the missing part of Khan's life. It did not go into details of how the bad guys could find him and lock him up after he had been missing for so long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rated this movie as (4) because I liked the action sequences, but it was too few to justify a higher rating, as the dialogue made me less impressed ...
