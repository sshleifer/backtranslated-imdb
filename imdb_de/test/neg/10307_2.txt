I love this program. I have seen every episode in the last year. I bought the DVDs. I'm watching tonight and for some reason you see that you have retooled this great show. And you took what it worked and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show, which was 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I also love the other characters, but they are good in little dozing like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It's as if the show has lost some of their families and everyone else is trying to fulfill them. It's an overdose. While things are funny in small doses when you're concerned with them all the time, it gets weird and annoying. I was so looking forward to the return of this show. So please bring back the charm. Even if you could not get Piper on the show, at least bring Lizzy back. But I loved these girls. They brought the fun. The show was about how Sam tried to live his business life and also to handle his private life and his friends. That was the charm. And also this great dog. <br /> <br /> I hope the network (FOX) has forced the authors to do so, and the authors did not do it voluntarily on the show. I'll give the series a few more episodes before I can give up, but the episodes this evening were bad. I made a big deal out of the show that came back tonight, and I had people passing by and I felt like an idiot because no one but two or three times laughed. I apologized to them and said I do not know what happened. And after about ten minutes of the episode, I realized that they would not show Piper or Lizzy and this was no longer a necessity to see a television comedy.
