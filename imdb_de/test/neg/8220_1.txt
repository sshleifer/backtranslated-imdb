For those who could send me nasty emails, push it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those who produce quirky films are immediately closed to criticism. Garden State is usually one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Sure, Zach Braff, the star of a rather overvalued sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that does not justify the praise such a movie received. The story is often too thin and too shallow to give a real insight. People have compared this movie to The Graduate, but these people are trying to outperform the independent cinema. Indie films are subject to the same hit-and-miss mentality that normally affects the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie movies than good ones. Garden State is not cruel, but it's not great. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is too fast, which causes Large to reappear fairly quickly in his earlier life. After ten years, people tend to pretend he never left. Where is the awkwardness? Of course, the situation is always solved by a fast-paced drug cost scene (which, I would like to say, was fairly well represented). The film seems to have many emotional inequalities, giving us the idea that the emotions will later be deeper and more thoughtful. However, these fronts fail, so we wonder why the path to some of his decisions and moments was quickly resolved (like Peter Saarsgard's heavy predatory tendencies). It was not completely catastrophic, but maybe we should stop praising the film for something it is not.
