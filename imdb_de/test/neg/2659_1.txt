It was not until I saw Sidney Pollack in the picture that I connected him to this film. This is his worst movie. Absolute dirt. The dialogue is made of wood and incredible, the plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas is wasted in this movie. There's nothing about her character that you really want to believe in this story. Harrison Ford is like Valium. There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this film. The script is awful and he's too smart not to see that. So it smells like some sort of payout, be it a studio commitment or something else, but that's just BLOODY ROTTEN!
