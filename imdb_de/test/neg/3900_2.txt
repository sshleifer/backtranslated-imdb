When I started looking at it, I immediately realized that I could not understand what someone was saying. I turned up the volume. Now that background noise broke out, I could hear the voices. What do the actors say? Will not the movie be synced? Do you speak Spanish? After some confusion, I realize that it was English. At least I think ... The Amazing Jess Franco has put the microphones too far from the actors. Therefore, we can not fully hear what they say. He has done that before. But maybe that's the intention of Mr. Franco? If we do not know what people are saying, we get into a mystery about what's going on and have more visual cues ... maybe it's just me, but I'd like to know what's going on! How about a few tips? The basic requirement (I refuse to call it a "conspiracy") concerns a young exotic dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman), who has a boyfriend who invites her to a small island that belongs to some fat rich people. It is somewhere off the coast of Spain. For this visit, Paula is promised a large cash payment, which the friend receives. He then flees from the island to return later. Why? Pay close attention to the scene where the friend opens Paula's US passport. Though his hand has tried to cover it up, you can see the REAL name of the actress Amber Newman printed under the photo below on the passport !! In any case, back to the "story": On the island there are other slippery, rich and beautiful characters with ambiguous motives. We experience sadistic games (they are real or wrong) and unsightly dining scenes. But the food must be good because a fake French chef has prepared it! There's a young woman who walks around naked and never talks. Is she really dumb? And are we interested in that? Of course, all the women in this movie are mostly naked ... Well, we can at least be thankful that the men (over 50 and overweight) stay dressed! What I've always admired about Jess Franco is the incredible ability to film beautiful naked women so that the viewer is completely turned off. This movie is no exception? I needed fresh air after seeing her! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I am pleased to inform you that, regardless of what Mr Franco dreams of, I am still attracted to women.
