I swore some time ago never to get another Joe Castro movie (maybe after "Near Death"), but somehow I accidentally came to this movie because it was a Troma release and I did not read the cover carefully have. Oops. Well, I have seen it, and it is by no means good, but it seems to be a kind of "tongue in cheek" ... if not, it seemed so. Some intrepid people from the University of Rio Grande set out to find out if Chupacabra exists because GOAT BARN CCTV cameras were shown by someone to make this strange thing jump across the field of view. And also because the person who had probably killed this thing was the uncle of the leader of the expedition. There are a couple of cameramen, one whining all the time, and there's a former Marine called "Army" (?!), Who's a kind of munitions expert. In any case, the Chupacabra find themselves on the ranch of a man and set off in search of two supposed witches. The creature itself looks rather ridiculous, with spines on its back and a large, long tongue that would cause Gene Simmons to die. Finally, after a series of people are done, the Chupacabra is killed and they take him back to the university for an autopsy. So is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creation from a laboratory in Puerto Rico? Uh, they do not really tell us. Not exactly fascinating, but not terrible either. By no means a wide audience. 4 out of 10.
