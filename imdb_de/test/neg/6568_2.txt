Although I'm not a fan of the "Star Trek" movies or the universe of shows and books and the like, I still find some fun in some old-cast films and in the case of "First Contact" even the new cast. Although this film was sad to look at ... he seemed to want so much, but he failed on so many levels that he was one of the worst Star Trek movies. The storyline is very far-fetched and seems to combine three or four stories in an ultimate trek adventure, but it gets a little listless when attempted, not tense, if it wants to be, and not action-packed, as if it were trying to mess up inconsistencies. The whole movie to take a sentence from Spock is illogical. The effects are nothing special as I've seen episodes of Next Generation that are just as good, which means it's fine for a TV show, but not a big movie. The conspiracy is ridiculous when the gang first tries to stop Spock's brother, and then comes to him in search of God, yes, you read that right. The Klingons make an appearance that will actually build the much better Undiscovered Country movie. All in all, you know that it's bad when Kirk, Bones and Spock are the rudder of your boat. Well, Spock did not really sing, but rather asked for the lyrics.
