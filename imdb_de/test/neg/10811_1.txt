That's how I was when I left this "film" (staggered). I could not go because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I got stuck in the middle. Captured. <br /> <br /> The tiny fragment of the original footage that has attempted to connect this film features some of the worst performances ever seen on the big screen. The daughter was an outstanding appearance - stand out in the bad sense. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the camera was disgusting and consisted of disjointed frames and some of the strangest light sources I've ever seen. > As for the footage ... at first glance ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why am I checking this movie? Why do I recognize his existence? Please, do not look at it. Do something useful in two hours of your life and watch as some paint is dry.
