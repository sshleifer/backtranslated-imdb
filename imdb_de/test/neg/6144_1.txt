What exactly is the sense of pretending to "cheat" people of things like ski passes and pizza? I do not see a point. I would be neither smart nor original and it seems to me extremely pointless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone does not seem very down-to-earth or even nice. He has very little charisma and as good as anyone can do what he does on this show. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this bitch is the fact that many phone calls are being readjusted. So they are not just the poor people on the other end of the phone, they are also the audience that does not have enough time to read the "Disclaimed" that flickers about half a second across the screen at the beginning of the show only that, but also He also claims that he lives his whole life. What a lie. Nobody could live his life like that and the fact that he says that this is not just another scam to see his show, but it's also one of the most fabricated and blatant pieces I've ever heard. This guy is a @ $$! <br /> <br /> What makes you think that you're trying hard to write and record a song, for example, to make someone get a HUGE picture of you and two colleagues, and actually get into dance lessons traveling a ski resort - is it just worth getting free ski passes and some food? What is the meaning of it? It is very hard to just go for a few ski passes and some snow. <br /> <br /> As far as "comedy" is concerned, this is the end of the barrel.
