A carnivorous octopus, where does this guy Boaz (what the ..?) Davidson inspiration? Anyway, even for the low, low standard of both the giant marine animal that kills the human genre and me, this one is just terrible. The Octopus is one of the most annoying, laziest and weakest monsters I have ever seen. He has just landed in the (ahum) East River because Sea World has fed him. The actors can be seen repeatedly as they helped the octopus. A lot of idiots, he will never learn it! You all want the other giant killer Kraken (that's the right plural, by the way) to laugh at him? Meanies. <br /> <br /> Until the octopus comes to a standstill, there are wind, razors that are hard to handle, and special seaman Nick Hartfield and his partner, who will retire in a week, but will first be eaten by the octopuses must.Hooray, Octopus has won the fight! A few more and he will evolve (the scars stay in my head). Nick of course tries to help him I do not do any damn things (does not he have a gun or anything?), But no, that does not help. <br /> <br /> Okay, enter the love of Lake Police Officer Rachel Starbird. Is this on a comic book or something? However, they try to stop the octopus together by walking in the park. They hope this helps because it is the 4th of July in a few days and the octopus can join the party. And you do not know what he's like when he's drunk. Rachel gets a school bus out of nowhere to make sure this movie will not end while Nick feeds the squid with more sea crabs. <br /> <br /> But everything is shit and ends up shit. Nick manages to break the octopus into pieces a few times, and a few children who happen to be there cheer and laugh. You know, on a pharynx, this would probably get a R.In real life, I would say, any age, but somehow I like every age, so my final idea is: For absolutely no one suitable. There is no sex, no gore, no nothing. Do not forget that this movie ever existed. Join the club.
