Wow, that was a real stinker. This early science fiction movie has nothing to offer but pure stock. There are so many scientific mambo jumbos in dialogue that it's ridiculous. The female character played by Osa Massen is only a plot for male characters who are supposed to make sexist remarks throughout the movie length. Look at this with your girlfriend. I guarantee that it will bring her blood to a boil. The only good thing is the music that skilfully builds up the movie's moods. The special effects are rather crude, but not bad considering the vintage of the movie. With some good B-stars in the lead roles, the drama is not so bad. But the lines given to them must have challenged them. The challenge of not laughing your head.
