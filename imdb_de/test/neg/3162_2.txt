When I previewed this movie, I thought it was funny and in a good mood. Unfortunately, it was a standard case of "The funny parts were in the preview", not to say that everything was bad. But "the good parts were in the preview". <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a youthful movie that will make you sleep, then watch this movie.
