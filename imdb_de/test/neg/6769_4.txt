Apparently cut episodes from the Gangbusters TV show on the big screen. While this was often done in the 50s and 60s because people did not have a TV or color television and the producers wanted a higher return on their investment (big ticket ticket sales or when it came to selling a small screen in a series, this is not so (not syndicated), the results were usually less than the sum of their parts, the only time I've ever seen it work were multi-part stories (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or horror anthology (The Veil and 13 Demon Street), where the stories of American thugs in the 1920s and 1930s (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) are linked together while a narrator talks about how the FBI persecutes them weird mix that does not work out because it's clear there are things that do not belong together. More than once, I strangely looked at the TV, because things did not seem right. In fairness, I do not want to describe the cheapness of the production, because that was the early television (and the series). It's not bad, but it's not very good either. To be honest, the series episodes I've seen work better than single episodes we do not expect so much. Given the choice, I would rent DVDs of the show instead of the movie.
