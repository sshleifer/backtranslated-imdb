Wow, what a racist, profane bit of celluloid waste and what an insult to the great Western genre. <br /> <br /> Exploitive? Sex scenes abound, profanity abound, violence and gore abound ..... anything that gives modern films such a good name, especially among those who prefer classic-era films. This kind of sleaze gives the old people ammo against today's movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow I can not imagine naked male bathing scenes in movies by Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey. I also can not imagine hearing "Motherf --- um". called here and there. I sincerely doubt that the word was over 100 years ago. Yet, the F-word is so prevalent here that you think you've seen a story in the center of today's city, not the old west of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Prejudice? Well, what if all white characters were good men and every black man was the evil, brutal villain? Do you think someone could complain about a racist movie? At home, we hear no outcry when the backside - as featured in this movie - is shown in hundreds of movie theaters across the country? Mario Van Peeples wrote, directed and starred in this bomb. Remember that name. Apparently, he is the "Ed Wood" of today's filmmaker. Even Spike Lee would not be so racist. You can not be much worse than this movie.
