I'll be honest - the souped-up purple plane with Snoop Dogg on top is an amusing visual gag. It would have been a decent concept for a 30-second commercial or maybe a 3-minute music video. But the producers have committed the age-old concept comedy to stretch 30 seconds of material in one and a half hours of film, and the results are predictably lame. The rest of the 89 minutes is full of typical racist and sexist humor and fart joke, offensive and - worst of all - painfully unsteady. The worn action screams under the weight of their devices. Avoid it best, unless you are drunk or drunk.
