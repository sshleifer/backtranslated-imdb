I find "Category 6: Day of Destruction" very unrealistic. The digital effects were like a kid cartoon. <br /> <br /> The actors did not act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot, she behaved as if she had sprayed tomato sauce on them. <br /> <br /> The movie was boring, but I looked at it because it's running. <br /> <br /> The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, he was funny! <br /> <br /> Please keep the special effects. <br /> <br /> I liked the comment: "What have we upset Mother Nature?" I do not know what else to write to fill the 10 lines. What else can I say, the movie is so boring, I think my comment will be just as boring.
