Not a good movie in any case, but nowhere as bad as some would paint it. Nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man who had disfigured his face in a typical Flashback scene, and takes revenge on those directly responsible and indirectly on the losses in his life - especially the love and camaraderie of a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell plays the artist with his typical, if limited, flair. Actually, I thought he had shown one of his better performances. What does it mean exactly? Mitchell wears an eyepatch, smokes endless cigarettes, wears a colorful tunic and speaks with his wax creations. They are not ordinary wax figures, but people who are alive and controlled by a serum, losing control of all neurological functions. They become zombies. I thought the premise here was inventive, if not different. It has some ridiculous explanations, but it serves as a conspiracy. This is a 1960s film with some psychedelic camera work by Bud Townsend and his company. The acting is mediocre, but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kroeger give interesting twists. The waxworks from Hollywood's past era are very effective and most of the locations were very credible. The end of the film breaks down into something that is not quite real - either another example of 1960s cultural cinema or the writer's creativity. I rely on the latter. Despite its many shortcomings, I liked the movie. The opening scene, which showed how an actor was needled, was done in the same way as a police chase on the water.
