I've seen a lot of movies in my time, and this is really the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of filmmaking around the world. It took me three efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, possibly because I was already tired because it was late at night. At the second effort, I managed to survive 35 minutes, but I fell asleep again. I can go on and on, but I think you understand the point ... in this film, nothing ever happens. A complete waste of time and money. This movie is really shit. Look at it and you'll know what I'm talking about. If you can get into this movie for 40 minutes without shaking your head and wondering what the hell of the whole thing is, then you're actually a masochist. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is that 0 was not provided as an option. I just thought the world had to be warned before it was shut down or even worse ... buy that garbage. LATER!
