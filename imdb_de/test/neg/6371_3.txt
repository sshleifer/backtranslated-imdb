I'm a fifth grade language teacher and after reading this book (which the students loved) we watched the movie. They laughed out loud! Unfortunately it is NOT a comedy! The acting was so awful, I felt like I was watching a group of kids in the neighborhood perform a play. My students imitated the lines and were fun. I have to agree with them, sometimes it was pretty bad. Nevertheless, I would show it to the students again, just for fun and to compare the movie with the book. We did a Venn diagram (the teachers know what that is) to show what was the same in both and what the differences were. I noticed that another adaptation for 2005 is being shot. We can only hope that the show gets better!
