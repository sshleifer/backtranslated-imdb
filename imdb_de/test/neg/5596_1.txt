Certainly, this strip in Eastern Europe is full of sexy, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the Nicholas Cage Strip "8mm". The daughter of an ambassador and her fianc√©e confuse her with a local woman who is glued in threes. The tape is used for blackmail and the stakes are getting higher as the couple tries to figure it out instead of going to the authorities. <br /> <br /> The sex comes and goes - and that's the only reason I rent it if you like this sorta thing - and is pretty unfounded in the middle when we drive through the porn scene and after the "other Woman "looking. I'm definitely wondering how Blockbuster came to be, even with a Youth Restricted sticker, considering how close a touch is over the edge of the soft core. (Oh, that's right, it's the double standard.) Actual art-house flicks like "The Dreamers" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" are spayed, R versions, but "Straight To DVD" scraps like this bring the UNRATED Banner proudly whatever.) <Br /> <br /> The acting is awful, the plot is stunningly unoriginal, but the really worst offense is the idea that this is a continuation of 8mm. I would give the strip a D for a grade and be nice, but if you tried to turn me over, you will get the F that you honestly deserve.
