As I post this comment, IMDb currently rates Alfred Hitchcock's subpar saboteur as 7.3 / 10. I personally rated it less than half. Honestly, I can not say how such a bad movie could have come from the probably consistently best director I know. I've seen about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30s to 60s. Dizziness is my absolute favorite, while saboteur is the worst. It's hard to believe that Hitch 7 years earlier used the same formula in The 39 Steps far more proficiently. My recommendation would be to see it instead and avoid it like the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie I shot before the end and does not want to see the rest. If you need to see it, then rent or borrow. Do not make the mistake I made and buy the DVD in good faith earned by Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window and so on. Even a master sometimes messes up, I think. <br /> <br /> EDIT: Maybe I was a bit harder in this movie than I should have been. It's certainly not close to Ed Wood or Manos or anything like that, but there are three reasons that I think I need to rate it that low: <br /> <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" brings with it certain expectations of quality. This movie delivers a few of them, but they are overshadowed by the damnable, almost nonsensical conspiracy. <br /> <br /> 2) I'd like to balance out a bit for all the 8+ reviews this movie gets. Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of directors. Real fans will find reasons to consider something of his as a work of art, but the high rating at IMDb gives more casual film enthusiasts like me the impression that this film is far better than it actually is. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 for that. If it cost me $ 5 or even $ 10, I would probably be a little less bitter. ;)
