Oh man! This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is unbelievably repetitive; Each scene seems to consist of people being shot down, running around screaming or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very boring. I would not mind if the fight was good at all, but it's not like that. The main character, Phillips, pushes the various crooks around with ridiculous ease, and no matter how many times he has the tracker in view, he is never hit, even though extras and smaller characters are shot around him. I've rarely seen a worse cast of actors (especially Don Wilson, if you can even call him an "actor"), but that's not really surprising given the dialogue they have to work with (example line: "Computers killed my brother The chart is a minor rip-off of the excellent Terminator, the special effects are ridiculous, all in all this movie is just terrible, and why is it exploding?
