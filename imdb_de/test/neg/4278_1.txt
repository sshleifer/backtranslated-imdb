For all who have read this book, Fanny Price matures to her own wife, a beautiful woman ... with a brain. Le Touzel looks like she's taking medication. Terrible spectacle, it just ruins it! Henry is a bit tall for his character. He is too feminine too. Mary Crawford is brilliant. Edmond is a bit too old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical- OK, this casting decision works. Rushworth is perfect, too. Yates looks too feminine. But Le Touzel is just terrible. This is not a good character for her. Poor Fanny! I would only recommend this film because it contains an almost complete textual description of the language Austen uses in the novel. The 1999 version is much more fun, but terribly incomplete. If they could repeat this version with an actress more suitable for Fanny, that would be fabulous!
