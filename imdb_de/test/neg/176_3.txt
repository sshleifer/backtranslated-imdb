The filmmakers try to equate the influence of the Mondovis and Robert Parker as a travesty of the German occupation of France and the rule of fascism. However, they never find a victim in this movie. We hear winegrowers, critics and traders who complain that the wine industry is growing, but it is becoming more homogeneous. However, the film never argues that this has led to a loss of good wine or the exploitation of people or cultures who are not naive wine spectator readers with a lot of money. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a boring wine, so be it. <br /> <br /> If this was a movie about the diamond trade, where the market dominance of the DeBeers group resulted in human suffering, this could have a bad style were appropriate. But as it is, it's just anti-American, anti-modernizing and anti-capitalist. Had the filmmakers been in the 1870s, they would most likely protest against the refinement of American vines to save French wine.
