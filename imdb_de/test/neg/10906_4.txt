The cookie cutter is working overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. The act as it has been created a trillion times, so it is not necessary to tell anything about it. Suffice to say that all 12-year-old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make faces. Even the soundtrack is terrible! It's not that I do not like figure skating, although I do not like that I do not like clich√©s, bad movies.
