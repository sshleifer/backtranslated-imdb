Alleged documentary that seeks to examine science fiction films of the fifties and how they influenced (and reflected) America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill is told. <br /> <br /> Pretty awful. The "insights" that are given are nothing new - for example - the Cold War and the danger of a nuclear war affected a whole generation of children. Well, you are! They're trying to cover all the different sub-genres of science-fiction movies of the fifties - the big bug movies, invaders from space movies, etc. That's good, but they pick the most obvious movies, and they've been too much analyzed already. It was cool to see clips from "Rocketship XM," "Destination Moon," "Forbidden Planet," "The Thing," and "The Day Earth Stood Still," but everything the directors said was to every viewer so unbelievably obvious that it was offensive. Although less than an hour, I was bored for 30 minutes. This has a 2 for some clips, but nothing else.
