I would not recommend it. It was like I was stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I could not go and watch a partial porno movie (except, they did not pull out - it was the body language and definitely the language). I have to say I was embarrassed. The shooting was very low, not a good dialogue. Yuck actors stank except The two best characters who were killed (?), And they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. Kill Bill and this old movie had a crush on the two guys riding the dessert on their choppers. You know what I mean. bla bla bla. The shooting was grainy and of very poor quality. There was no one in this theater who liked the movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
