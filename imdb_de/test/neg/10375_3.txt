I just saw it at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and had a hard time staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, non-enlightening little movie. It's a 75-minute movie that felt like 175 minutes and about 20 minutes of modest, engaging material. It is in no way offensive, it just repeats things that have been said many times, more interestingly and provocatively. With only a few exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and make little emotional contact or context on the whole topic. It is more of a guide on how to do something that is no longer possible. I lived in this time, but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.
