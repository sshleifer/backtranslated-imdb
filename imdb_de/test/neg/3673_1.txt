This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. He has almost no action and the action he has is very distracted. The storyline is missing in terms of content as well as content and in subtitles, because what would appear as a storyline, lies in Russian. The set seems to be just a room with different lighting effects, and the moment you think that something good is going to happen, you will be disappointed by the total lack of drama, drama, suspense, horror, blood, plot, and mythology. The directing style was made to death (the fisheye camera). It seems that the only action in this movie is taking place within the last 10-15 minutes, and the action is made worse by the actors' inability to properly portray the tension. The only interesting thing about this movie was my dog ​​barking in the surround sound.
