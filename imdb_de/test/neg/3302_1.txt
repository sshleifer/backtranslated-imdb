What can one say about a movie that lasts two hours, like three weeks? The hero starts in Ninjaville, Japan, experiences an identity crisis (saves a Shinobi), travels to America (rescues a slave named Sam), conducts a small Wild West campaign (rescues a French / Japanese aborigine named Julie), goes hunting for pirate gold and then returns Japan back to fight a war. The movie obviously has no idea where he's going at any point; I think the director modeled every scene after the last movie he saw. If you are watching this movie, it's a good idea to rent the subtitles so that you and your colleagues can talk openly about how stupid the movie is without talking about the movie, which may well be another stupid act. <br /> <br /> Movies The director saw while filming this movie - An American Tail, Fievel Goes West, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kungfu, Vampire Hunter D, The Ten Commandments , <br /> <br /> Comments of Interests - The most fear inspiring line of all time. After about 90 minutes (or 19 days), the main character has just defeated an American villain, and just as they walk to stop the pain, the hero calls "Let's go back to Japan," and the agony continues Week.
