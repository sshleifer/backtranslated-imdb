"Quit while you are ahead" is a sentence they never learn. A typical Hollywood scenario: If the first movie was just shocking, the second was not. One can assume that the third film is the worst this year. Even worse are the prequels, whose events have already been explained in detail. If you have not seen the first two movies, you will not like this movie. It's like starting Lord of the Rings or Star Wars with the last trilogy movie. "Stand Alone" is not this movie. <br /> <br /> Remember the first movie about Lucian's revenge? Do you remember the second about the long-lost wild brother? Well, if you could see and put together these two 5-minute moments, would you get? a 5 min prequel. But the creators felt that these 5 minutes were an important historical event or just wanted to give jobs to actors, actors and crews and perhaps earn some money. "I have a lot of money, I make films for my living and I'm bored, what am I going to do, I know, I'm making a movie." So you get this 5 min prequel and stretch it for 90 min? that's this movie. And you know what will happen to the "immortal" main characters, so there is little tension. By the way, all the drama of the movie is in these 5 minutes. The only thing that raised my eyebrows was killing a mother while begging the movie. Sick. The rest was Braveheart Remix. If you want a comedy, first see Braveheart and then this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to rant a bit? the movie puts me in a mood. Who invented the concept of "Vampire vs. Werewolf"? It's older than me and just as old. And why do vampires look like goth girls in the heat, while werewolves look like psychobanks? Hiding bad movies behind the split fails. Is not it time we got some leaner werewolves upright? How can their unchanging werewolves even multiply when they all tear to pieces? And why did not the vampires with all their power rule the world? Blaa, Blaa, Blaa? What a waste.
