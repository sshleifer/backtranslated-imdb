This movie is without doubt the worst action movie I have ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of the movie (this movie is supposed to be a serious movie) is when a chicken is walking across the street at about 100 miles an hour. This miserable cutting mistake makes the movie absolutely funny for about 2 seconds, then it's "on the edge of the seat" again while you're trying to find a comfortable place to sleep, action!
