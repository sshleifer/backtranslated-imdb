Not as bad as Billy Bathgate, but close. Warren Beatty could not believe it as a bugsy. Whenever he freaked out, instead of being shocked by the violence, I was pretty embarrassed because it was so fake. The other actors are also not so good. Annette Bening just does not have what it takes to play seductive women, she has a certainty. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have been better off if the script had him as a more credible George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel appeared unscathed, but this guy can make those films asleep. And Robert Beltran steals one of the great Beatty Bening scenes with just one line. With these films, I'm never sure if the director intends to make the gangsters look like normal business people, or if it just seems that way. Either way, I do not like it. These guys were killers and no matter how much Las Vegas is owed to Bugsy Siegel, I do not think a movie should be made to glorify the guy, especially a movie with a big studio.
