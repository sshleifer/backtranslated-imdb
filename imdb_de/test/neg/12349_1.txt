All professional comments on this film claim that the film is balanced. That is their main justification for giving the film a high price. But a film is not balanced if the main culprit investigated in each topic receives the last world. The director herself admitted this at the first film festival in San Francisco. She argued that she could not waste the opportunity to gain access to Fujimori. That may be true, but with so much of Fujimori's attitude to the subject, the film is clearly out of synch for Fujimori and unbalanced. I dare every other commentator to prove this as a mistake. Tips 1: The assertion that Harvard professors, intellectuals, and Latin American diplomats agree with you does not help your argument (use logic). Tip # 2: Disagreeing with the Director Does Not Help Your Argument (The director says that Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and she portrayed him so)
