I was not sure where this should lead to the end. when it turned out that all this was a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to the European Wimps and the United Nations. What a load of right-handmates! Incidentally, Canada's accession to the US did not really have much to do with the plot, and the idea was never developed. The only point seems to be that the main character was qualified for the presidential nomination (but they could have just made him American and renounced it). In any case, this was a lot of bulls and not worth the time. If you want to do that well, check out the brilliant BBC political thriller "State of Play."
