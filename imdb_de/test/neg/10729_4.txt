Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) are on the line of unemployment when the company Dick is working for is caught in a corruption scandal. After trying desperately and unsuccessfully to find work, the duo turns to a crime to get them out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been a while since he did a direct comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty, which was pretty good. He has proved that he can make serious plays, but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves he still has it. Although the movie was funny, it was still disappointing. It was not as funny as I thought. It's worth taking a look, though, unlike most of Carrey's films, it does not have a good replay value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised that the script was weak, as this is the same guy who made The Forty Year Old Virgin. Some of the jokes just drop off and sometimes they seem to be trying too hard. If Jim Carrey was not there, the movie would have been a lot worse. Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. She's an okay actress, but she's just not funny. She does not fit well with Carrey and seems to be on the phone in her performance. You should have gone with someone else. The minor cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and he actually gives a decent performance. He was not as annoying as most child stars. Alec Baldwin was fine and Richard Jenkins was trying too hard to be funny. To be honest, I'm a bit biased here. The movie as a whole was pretty average, but I liked it more because of Jim Carrey's performance. Fans of Jim Carrey should enjoy it, but that's about it. In the end, fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes, but it's not very memorable. Rating 6/10
