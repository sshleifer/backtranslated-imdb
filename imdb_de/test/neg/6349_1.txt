I got bored last night and decided to watch a movie titled 'out kold', which I once bought from a video store along with many other cheap movies. Apparently it was a good old action movie, so I took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxed evening. Well, the pain started from the beginning. The main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy I have ever seen. Of course as a good person he has to be nice, but he is just a pussy! That does not even go with a boxer who has 28 KO and starts working for a pimp to make some more money. Even nice people can still be cool. Well, then came his first fight when he worked for this pimp. Each shot was missed significantly and that got even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the punches. Then there is this completely worthless spectacle of the entire cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this film as it is. I gave him a 1 because I've never seen such a bad movie.
