An American family moves to Spain to live in a remote house. Regina (Anna Paquin), the teenage daughter of Mark (Iain Glen), who is ill and has mental health problems, and the Nurse Maria (Lena Olin) notes that in the house and with her little brother Paul (Stephan Enquist), but her mother does not believe in her. Reggie decides to explore the origins of the house with her friend Carlos (Fele Martínez) and they find that forty years ago the place was the stage of death of six children. Reggie decides to ask her grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) for support to protect her brother from the house and her father the names of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martínez (from "Thesis" and "Abre los Ojos") and Giancarlo Giannini. Besides, I really like spanish cinema. Still, I found a horrible screenplay, a terrible direction, and a lamentable drama of outstanding actors and actresses. The intention of the story is good and in some moments easily reminiscent of "The Shinning", but unfortunately it is poorly developed, and it is never clear what causes and motives mean the move of the American family to Spain or the terrible relationships between the members the family, mainly the situation between Maria and Reggie. The direction is confused and tries poorly to use dark shadows to give the story scary effects. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this movie. Lena Olin is a cartoon of the great actress she is. and Stephan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martínez performs well in his secondary character. I liked the open end of the story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sétima Vítima" ("The Seventh Sacrifice")
