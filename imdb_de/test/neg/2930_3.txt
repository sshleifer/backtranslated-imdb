Well, I generally like Iranian films and after watching "10" by Kiarostami the night before, I expected a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is by far the worst Iranian movie and one of the most boring Asian films I have ever seen. If you've never seen a Kiarostami movie, you'll see "ten" instead. If you want good Iranian films, you can also try "Sib" or "The Apple". This movie is divided into 5 parts, and only the fourth movie with some funny ducks is worth a visit. If this is the first Iranian movie you see, you probably do not want to see it anymore. I'm not blaming you, but you'll miss some great movies.
