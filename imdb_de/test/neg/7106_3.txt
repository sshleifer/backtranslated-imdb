I have made the mistake of buying this since collecting comic-inspired films. Even at $ 6 it was too expensive. I thought it might be fun, "so bad", it's going to be a good mood, maybe I was wrong. I had seen it a long time ago and could not remember anything. Now I know why. I was bored, looking for distractions to do something different. I'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl does not work on any front. The script is bad, you do not care about the characters and the humor is usually lame, except for a few amusing one-liners. The special effects or locations are bad or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too uncomfortable compared to live action. It's like they do not have the money to do the cool stuff, and so grab drawings, no matter how cool they may be (an uncensored animated feature would be much better for Tank Girl now if I think about it now). The action scenes were cheesy, but not on a kind of b-movie. The tank itself was anything but impressive or dynamic, though it was decorated in an interesting way. In fact, the best action scenes with the tank were animations. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting songs from well known artists like Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of improving the atmosphere, they just do not fit most of the time. Once they even broke into a ridiculous song and a dance number that was simply pointless and horrible. I think I totally adjusted that. I suppose Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, looks like a soiled punkette part, but beyond her "attitude" and sometimes barely amusing retorts, it's two-dimensional and more superficial than the worst cartoon characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the film's only saving grace, and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell played his usual role as a villain. It may be a cult movie for some, but keep in mind that it really differs from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie itself (see the entry for Tank Girl on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
