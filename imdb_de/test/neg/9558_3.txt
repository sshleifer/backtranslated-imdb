My girlfriend wanted to see that (lol, that's a lot of the case) ... so I rented it. Then I saw how much it was praised that this was nominated for 10 Oscars. GREAT! that should be a good old drama. This movie had a lot of potential ... The direction and the way everything went was very good. But when the movie was over, I could not help but wonder if it really was worth making a movie. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was extremely annoying, I just could not stand her character. Warren Beatty was excellent in the film, but it was hard for me to sympathize with his character. He just came out as an idiotic, hot-headed gangster loser ... life first. How did he ever get together with Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano? This movie just left me with a threadbare but uncomfortable feeling ... What was the big deal with this movie? I have not experienced completeness with Bugsy. Beatty's antics worked quite well, but seemed too arbitrary and illogical. I suppose that's how Seal really was ... but it was just too much of it. It just did not seem like a real story here. My basic assessment would be "a hot-headed Playboy, a below-average gangster falls in love with a woman loser, comes up with the idea of" Las Vegas ".... but his failed attempt at the casino he builds, along with the fact that he has no regard for the money of his mob bosses, kill him. "<br /> <br /> What else is there? I just did not see the big deal and it was a big disappointment. There were probably not many films that came out in 1991. How it was nominated for 10 Oscars is a mystery to me (though the two who won are eligible). 1.5 / 4 stars.
