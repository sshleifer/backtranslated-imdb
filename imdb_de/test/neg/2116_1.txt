I think this film can be called a film of misguided anger. The characters of Joe and Bob were relics of the WWII generation that did not quite understand their children, who reject the war, take drugs and listen to rock'n'roll. But I think her real anger was the fact that America began its long decline from the heights it left behind in the war. "Joe" itself is a low-rent archie bunker that makes fun of everything that has infuriated him and left his life in quiet despair until he teamed up with Compton, a guy who joined the Wants to avenge hippies who have ruined his daughter. Honestly, most of the movie looks stupid, the characters are worse than one-dimensional, they are ridiculous. Peter Boyle could do better things.
