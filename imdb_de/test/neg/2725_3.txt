The Vindicator begins with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage ripping a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This arbitrary act of violence sold it for me and I am glad to say that the rest of Vindicator was a true feast of cheese. The Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who has almost killed an explosion in his laboratory, whose tattered remains are put into an experimental body suit / armor. For some inexplicable reason, he's equipped with a Rage Response Activator, a device wired into his brain that kills him when he comes in contact with another person. They give a stupid explanation of how it is a necessary defense mechanism, but I can not see the logic in installing such a device, unless you wanted a raging cyborg killing machine. It is particularly ridiculous to indicate that the suit Carl wears is actually an experimental space suit. What need would it be for an astronaut to transform himself into the incredible hull during a mission? He is expected to break out of the lab and fight the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit along with Ninja assassin Hunter, played by Pam Grier (No, really). <br /> <br /> The defender himself looks pretty damned stupid. It's basically a guy in a tattered golden vinyl suit. He also has a perplexed look in his eyes that does not cause fear or pity. I think you can not blame him for that, most people watching the movie will have the same look on their faces. <br /> <br /> The acting is of the really bad, stilted: 'I'm not sure what the character's feelings or thoughts are this point, so I take a fool and spit out my dialogue in a random tone, while I try not to look at the drama school of the camera. The actor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part. <br /> <br /> After this first accidental death, the Vindicator goes after the scientists. Strangely enough, all the fury reaction activist touches me, and I'll kill you. That thing does not matter as much as you might expect Carl following his former colleges in a somewhat distant manner. There was a scene in which he brutally kills some street punk that push him around. I know that it is essential for street gangs to randomly attack the main characters in Eighties movies, but one of them must have realized that attacking the hulking cyborg man might be a bad idea, even if he looks like C3PO's retarded cousin. They do not seem so surprised when they see a grueling golden cyborg walking down the street as if it were a common occurrence for them. The only other time this rage reaction activist appears in the movie is when old Carl can not hug his wife. When Hunter tries to turn against him by throwing her into him, forcing him to kill her, he casually remarks that he has reprogrammed himself (off-screen, of course), so this does not happen , They could have skipped the whole thing with Rage Response Activator and just dealt with a pure revenge story, and that would not have made much of a difference to the movie. <br /> <br /> There is an amusing sequence in the sewers Grier and her cronies are looking for the defender. Because of his armored skin, they are all armed with weapons that fire "vaporized acid". For some bizarre reason, when firing these weapons, they are represented on the screen by cartoon-like red lines that Ghostbusters are alluding to their targets. The Vindicator defends itself by ripping a gas pipe out of the wall and burning all Grier's thugs in a huge flames series that comes out. The resulting fireball is so big and powerful that it comes out of a manhole from the sewers and blows up the transporter that some scientists are. Strangely enough, Grier flees, plunging herself into the centimeter-thick water, even though she was closest to the defender. This is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie, including the death of a funky black scientist as the defender sends his van off a cliff. (This is serious after they've captured The Vindicator by trapping him in a giant lump of Gello-No). <br /> <br /> There is also an unsettling and lengthy sequence in which Carl's treacherous, overweight friend, who looks like the poor Ned Beatty, reveals his love for Carl's wife and tries to rape her. It takes about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy who is sobbing over the woman's face, turning on her and trying to take her dress off. It's icky to say the least and seems to be out of whack with the rest of the movie, which is somehow cartoonish and more powerful than life. <br /> <br /> The finale of the film includes the Vindicator's bout a whole series of other types in combat suits. For some reason, all these other guys are less exciting than Carl, some are sent by the woman just by tearing out a protruding tube at her side. Fortunately, Carl's suit lacks this crucial design flaw. The only truly memorable part towards the end is the death of Grier. When I do something I've never seen before in a movie, a villain in the middle of a confrontation with the Vindicator decided that she really has no chance against him and in a way blows her own brains out with his pistol.
