The people who gave this film a ten would have given 100 for the truffle fiction. This is the level we are dealing with here. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad, but by no means is it like "OMG, the best movie since Pulp Fiction!". Some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of the indie variety. Personally, I found that my interest in the film diminished after half an hour. The act defies logic and belief. You need to hear why the woman did what she did to "save her husband." Yes exactly. I guarantee you leave the theater and think, "Hmm, that does not make any sense now." This is a movie where you really have to override all logic and beliefs. <br /> <br /> Those who said the music was good probably listened to their MP3 players. It absolutely killed the movie in some parts. <br /> <br /> Finally, just watch the movie if you have nothing particularly important to do. I give a three, because there is a long sex sequence in the motel that is decent.
