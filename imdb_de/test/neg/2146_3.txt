After more than 50 years of enthusiastic films, I have come up with some simple rules for good films. <br /> <br /> 1. Introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour. 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. When you customize a novel, combine features and actions of minor characters <br /> <br /> in one person. 3. Make sure your character's actions are credible. If necessary, create additional scenes to set motivation. 4. Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it must not be confusing. 5. Get the best music you can buy with money. Often it is more important than acting, taking pictures, etc. 6. If a movie is not very good in the first 10 minutes, it will not get better <br /> <br /> 'Cannon for Cordoba' example of a textbook, what happens if these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's result is Rinkydink, one of the worst I've ever heard in a modest budget movie. This is surprising when you look at Bernstein's testimonies ("Man With the Golden Arm", "The Magnificent Seven", "The Great Escape", "Sons of Katie Elder"). Paul Wendko's direction is lackluster and confusing. The performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti), with the usually reliable George Peppard falling somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising considering the mediocre direction and the amateur script that violates Rules 1, 2, and 3. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time. I give "Cannon for Cordoba" a "3".
