As a fan of almost all eras and as a great Jane Austen fan I was appalled by this adaptation. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I constantly compared the two, and that was far behind. It felt enormously rushed and very one-dimensional, so it got boring very quickly. The relationships, especially those of Fanny and Edmund, did not seem to be subtle, and there was little atmosphere, even though they were set in beautiful surroundings. Although I had been looking forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas, I put it down after an hour and went to bed. I'll be interested in seeing the customization of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, which I do not have a popular version, to see if they bore me that much.
