I came across this movie on a local TV station last night. Honestly, I have never heard of this movie. I just lost sight of Seagual's latest films, because everyone is worst than the previous one. Here again we have a boring Seagal, as if he had insisted on his girlfriend making that movie, and he accepted energetically. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is below zero and there is no aspect in which the film does not fall apart. I just have no idea why Seagal made this movie. Man, it's even worse than "Out for a kill!" If you watch this movie, you will regret Seagal. It seems that he runs out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something valuable.
