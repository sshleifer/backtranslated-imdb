Dakota Incident must be one of the strangest westerns I have ever seen. Not good, but definitely weird. <br /> <br /> A driverless stagecoach takes all killed passengers to the town of Christian Flats. It is planned to continue, but few, for obvious reasons, want to risk the Cheyenne on the warpath out there. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Lund, Whit Bissell and Ward Bond both have reasons to keep going. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette in a shootout after Doucette and Skip Homeier shot him and left him in the desert, is so worried that he's ready to drive the team. Of course, the Cheyenne will attack the intrepid group of passengers when they are forced to cover themselves in a dry wash. Who lives and who will die is the rest of the movie. Dakota Incident came to the end of Republic Pictures before Herbert J. Yates pulled the plug into his small studio. Westerns were her specialty, but usually of the kind Roy Rogers made. This would not have been a Rogers product. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's incredible. The characters are not in any way a reality. Whit Bissell picks up his testimony, but Robertson discovers his iron pyrite, the fool's gold. Toomey is a guitar that plays cynics and goes mad with thirst. Darnell is after her fraudulent manager, but does not know what to do if she finds him. Lund wants to bring Robertson in, who has committed a crime for which he has taken the rap, but has to bring him alive. He would need help for that, but he has none. <br /> <br /> But worst of all is Ward Bond, a United States senator who sits on his own peacekeeping mission in the Cheyennes. In real life, Bond was a right-wing person, and I'm not sure if this was a kind of caricature of what he would perceive as a Liberal. He's really a big fool, but I think that might have attracted him to the role. The end was a bizarre fantasy, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Enter three stars for the actors involved.
