Surrender Cinema is known for its extremely erotic, almost explicit science fiction films. While they are generally very good (Femalien 1 & 2, Virtual Encounters), this particular entry seems to be just a repetition of the old band. Any number of girls - some recognizable and some not - are in this film in all phases of nudity. There are also some clips from other films that are outstanding if you have not seen these other films. There are a number of solo nude scenes that do a number of things - some playing basketball, others talking, others playing with themselves. The only thing that matters about this band is the very last scene - a short but erotic one Girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and entertaining Sandy Wasko and a rather subdued Tammie Hainum. Not very recommendable.
