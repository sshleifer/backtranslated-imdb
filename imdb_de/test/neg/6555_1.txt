I told a friend about the time when my grandfather chose that terrible bitch so we could see him one night in the theater. He never picked one again! It was so bad! In any case, my friend told me that her father wrote something for this trash. I thought she was kidding. It turned out she was serious. She had never seen it before and said that this quickly brought her father's writing career to a standstill. I told her she should not waste time. But if she actually collapsed and watched, she would see within the first minute why this ended her father's days as a writer. I mean, even for the 80s, this crap is indescribably bad. I mean, Joe Frazier as Terrible Tucker? And why should two policemen be interested in a house full of ghosts? And the movie poster? A ghost with tongue hanging out? Why is? None of this makes sense. Well, I told my girlfriend that this crap not only ended my father's career, but also ended the careers of all involved. Or at least none of them recovered completely from this garbage in a movie. Let's just say, I'll ridicule my friend forever because he told me that his father was an author of this movie! That alone should tell how bad that is!
