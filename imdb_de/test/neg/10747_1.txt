The last sentence of this review is a big spoiler. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed the work of Joe Dante since Piranha. He has made many different genre parodies that were both funny and honest. <br /> <br /> But that's just crap. This is the kind of satire - in keeping with Thank You For Smoking - that is so literal and direct that nothing remains a) to be laughed at and b) to make the audience think. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the plot and material for a smart commentary are so rich, timely and mature. By the way, there's absolutely no reason for the main character, the Ann Coulter character at the end of the movie. It's just ridiculous.
