This cozy middle-class sitcom was hated by the new generation of talented comedians like Ben Elton in the 1980s. Has it earned such wickedness? Well, Terry and June were never smart, it was never a well written story with different threads crossing at the end. It was the show your mother and father and probably the grandparents saw. They giggled rather than laugh, but they were probably never offended by the show. Therefore, the fact that she had never challenged her was insignificant. Just another Terry and June. <br /> <br /> A few days after the death of Terry Scott, a series aired on terrestrial television, and that was the last assignment. There were only a few repeats of the show on any television station. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Terry and June, the TV comedy has thankfully advanced. It's hard to find friendly words for it - Terry Scott made the most of weak scripts.
