I was very happy when TCM showed this as I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. This film had a glowing Ann Harding, a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan, but the acting of others The film was more of a farce than the wonderful unfolding that the later film showed. Reginald Owens Arbuthnot hurts, and you can not understand why his wife loves him. After watching the movie, I found out that it is based on the stage play in which the film from 1992 is based on the book. The original movie also felt like it was part of a larger piece and felt incomplete. Too bad that it was such a flop.
