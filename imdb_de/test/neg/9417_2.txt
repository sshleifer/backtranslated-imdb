Solo is a bad movie - that can not be ignored. The acting is for the most part very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solos Creator Bill) and the story is small enough that you would probably forget it when you watch the movie. However, these films are more about action than action / drama, and as such, the action set pieces live or die - that's the purpose of such films - to make 14-year-olds smile watch films of the actual substance. And even on this solo can not succeed - what a little action there is, is bad, boring and uninspired. After watching the trailer on TV, I was hoping for something like Predator with a robot replacing the Predaot. Instead, I got a pretty lifeless action movie with a poorly constructed attempt at depth by accepting the message that robots can feel as well. Look at Terminator II or Predator instead. Both classics that this movie absolutely wants to have, unless it lacks inspiration or, to be fair, the budget.
