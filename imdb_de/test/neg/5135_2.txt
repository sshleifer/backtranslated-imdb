Yes, I made it to the end. It was pretty tough, though. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wondered if there was a director on the set at all. Acting ... well, I do not even know what to say. I thought the girl Emily was playing tried her best with the boring, sometimes crazy and sometimes predictable dialogue. <br /> <br /> I know the budget was low, but the hollow noise and lighting made it look and sound like a 100-minute audition tape. <br /> <br /> I will not even talk about the end ... <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie was the music. <br /> <br /> That said, I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who can not watch many movies, this is not something you should waste your time on. If you're looking for a sad lesbian themed movie, watch the kids lesson, Lost and Delirious or High Art. Everyone will make you depressed and gloomy, but you will not have to suffer cinematic hell.
