Boring, boring movie waffle. I could not believe how bad this movie was. I only saw it because of the many people who raved about it on this page. Did I watch the same movie? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in the past of Garps influenced the future (or that of another), and nobody was affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about plays: If a scene with no effect can be removed from a game, then it should not be there. Obviously, the director did not know this rule and stuffed his "work" with one bleak scene after another. Even the plane crashed into the house and was not surprising, but it was unexpected! <br /> <br /> It's worth noting that at the time of writing (December 1, 2002) there were a lot of people saying it was one of their favorite movies, nobody bothered to add a memorable quote. The reason is that there are simply none. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this, but see a plank curve instead.
