"The James Dean Story" is introduced as "Another Kind of Movies" which explain, "The presence of the main character in this film was made possible by the use of existing footage, tape recordings of his voice and by the means of a new technique - dynamic Exploring Still Photography. "The only" tape recordings of his voice "are a short shot of Mr. Dean during a visit to his Indiana family. He wanted to record all the family memories of his great-grandfather Cal Dean, who was fascinated because he played a similarly named "Cal" in East of Eden. Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and learns that the relative was an auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and obviously had a warm relationship with his family. This is the only 100% accurate disclosure in this documentation. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> A stunning "Screen Test" / "Outtake" from "East of Eden" appears near the end of the movie. It's a black and white scene between Dean (as Cal Trask) and co-star Richard Davalos (as Aron Trask). Dean is of his fascinating side. If this scene only appears here and no "East of Eden" movie is finished, this documentary would be an indispensable, highly rated film. But the scene, a perfect "10" in isolation, should be considered the "East of Eden". Worth seeing is also the "Traffic Safety Film" by Dean. <br /> <br /> There are the expected interviews with family and friends. My favorites were the guy (Lew Bracker), who was doing a box of things that Dean had left with him, and Dean's family. There was not enough of Aunt Ortese and Dean's letter to his little cousin was very nice. Further reading of Dean's letters would have been welcome. Dean's unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film; Filmmakers might have considered development as their main focus. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman's tutorial on how Martin Gabel reads Stewart Stern's script is terrible. What did they think? Maybe filmmakers can be forgiven for the closeness of Dean's death. Do not expect "The James Dean Story". This film is more about Dean's effect on people (both the fans and the filmmakers) than the man. It is clearly an early piece of the myth legend of James Dean. Tommy Sands sings "Let me be loved". The narrative refers to Dean as "He" with a god-like atmosphere. The shots of Dean's family, seemingly "knowing" when he dies, are really miserable. <br /> <br /> ** The James Dean Story (13.8.77) Robert Altman - James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
