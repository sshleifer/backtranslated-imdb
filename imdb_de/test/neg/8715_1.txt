It's amazing that some people saw this as art. We saw it as badly filmed (shaky handheld camera and all), (usually) badly traded, blank jumble that looked more like a high school movie project where kids experimented in black and white film production. The injection of poetry wings instead of a story does not make an art film. When we saw this in the theater, people got fits of giggling (we included) because of the endless stupidity of that self-indulgent, confusing chaos. And believe me, it seems to be infinite. If we had finished our sweets and popcorn, we too would have left the theater with the other two dozen people who banded together and gone in search of something more interesting!
