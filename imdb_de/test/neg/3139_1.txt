This movie must be one of the most boring movies ever made. The only thing I like is the use of Argento lighting in most scenes. The music is awful and the tempo is so slow that you can watch it at double the speed and even then it would be slow. The story does not exist. It does not even have shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It is (at least on this site) classified as horror, but it is not. It's a kind of art film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you are interested in such things and can stand the slow pace, then look at it, but I would rather recommend something Japanese to you (eg, Ichi the Killer) audience that commits collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this movie. These 80 minutes of length would have been better spent drying the paint. <br /> <br /> I gave her 1/10, simply because there is no 0 in the pulldown menu
