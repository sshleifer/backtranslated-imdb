I can not believe that some of the results of this film will appear on the IMDb website! Did I get the Special Edition naff version? This film produced by Bernard Matthews should be shown in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the UK-centered references, but if you're elsewhere and you do not have to cut toenails or have a coaster collection for cataloging, this movie may be worth 90 minutes of your remaining worth of life (as long as you do not have any paint to dry out ). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings, and the direction and finish is amazingly hard. What is Irons doing in this movie?
