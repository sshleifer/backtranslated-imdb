Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. It's bad writing combined with worse action. You can choose to drink the Gatorade drink after the school special, but I did not, not even because of his twenty Toby Robbins / Islander philosophy, the motivational moment. It's too much to be entertaining and not content enough to be informative. I respect the coach and program that inspired this movie, but the move itself is awful. As someone who has been playing rugby in the USA for almost 20 years, I had hoped for a better rugby movie (including one related to rugby). And I can tell you that the haka played by a group of Haoles and Islanders is not intimidating (as it's being performed by the All Blacks today, seriously guys, everyone has seen it, it's time to put it away) ). If you want real intimidation, face a number of South Africans (the real eye that crushes rugby convicts). This is a fake and badly made film about being a sincere and good person.
