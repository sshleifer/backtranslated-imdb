The key rule in creating this movie seems to have been, "Never make a 1-minute scene if you can do a 10-minute scene". This was a principle that was defined from the beginning with an endless exposition of the 1870 graduation of the Harvard class. The purpose of this scene was to introduce some of the main characters in the story and to tell a little bit about them background - which is reasonably effective comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation party to the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it just keep going, and that sets the scene for a movie that's always absent-minded. Nothing worse, by the fact that I considered a significant part of the dialogue almost incoherent. In the end, I could not even look at it in one session. I went through about half of it and had to set it aside for a few days before retiring to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> My reaction to this film is in many ways a shame, because there are positives here. The performances are generally high-profile, especially by Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story, which is close to the omnipresent alien nothingness, is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and the efforts of a local livestock company to stop them through a series of killings Cooperation with the government and the military. There are also some absolutely stunning scenery shots. Nevertheless, the whole thing could have been done in half the time - and should have been. In the end, all those potential positives will be washed away by the stunning nothingness that the movie seems to be shooting at. Seriously - 2/10.
