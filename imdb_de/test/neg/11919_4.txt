We had no idea what this movie was about, but due to the fact that John Leguizamo appeared in the movie, we decided to look at it. Well, it turned out to be not the smartest decision. As stated in another commentary in this forum, we were embarrassed by the actors who participated in this film. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is by no means terrible, it makes no sense at all. The exaggerated performance of William Baldwin also does not help the situation. John Leguizamo is a versatile actor who deserves better. The basic problem seems to be the film was a project that began with the intention of making a little comedy, and the leaders had no more ideas along the way. The result is an uneven movie.
