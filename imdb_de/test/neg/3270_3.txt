Every time I see this movie, blood streams from my eyes. Yes, you read that right: I've seen this miserable, dirty thing more than once. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 has gone wrong for so many reasons: Harold Ramis chooses a script and abandons the directional task, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) left the project because they did not allow him to work on the script , Bill Murray showed excellent judgment and was not part of it, and a puppet was pushed forward as a feature player of a cast who had earned much better. <br /> <br /> I can not help but think about Dyan Cannon and wonder why she is always laughing and laughing. The only conclusion I can draw from that is that she is actually the face of pure evil. Stay with me for a moment. She must have watched as the film came together and reveled in the indescribable agony that would make countless soon-to-be-consumptive moviegoers suffer this movie. She may also have been extremely drunk. That's what I have to be now to flush out the unpleasant taste of that utter failure. If I'm lucky, it will be washed out forever. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie several times. I blame several of them for childhood and am a very dull and dull child who apparently did not have an aesthetic sense. Maybe puppets are just funnier when you're a kid. No, the Muppet show is funnier now ... I guess I was just boring. Caddyshack 2 is this rare kind of movie that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the credits that it could not have been that bad. It was. It is. It only gets worse with time. <br /> <br /> My reasons for returning to this film are mercifully diminished. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as attorney for Jackie Mason. His opening scene is not bad and produced my only giggle. We see him a few more times, but he gets as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate speed from randomly amusing to spoiled wasteland. Randy Quaid is doing well, and this movie owes him a lot of time, because if there was a reason to view this movie as something other than a torture method, it was him. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's the trick of the movie. It has enough potentially lovable qualities that people see it, appalled by what they did to themselves, but later, because the selection was so slim that they can only remember what they actually enjoyed. Years later, they unknowingly meet again and the cycle repeats itself. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason has a lot of blame for this movie, but in fairness I'm not sure he deserves it. He's really trying it out, but it's impossible not to realize he's spending the entire movie on a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. Who the movie was written for, but I'm not sure he could have saved it. Ultimately, this fails miserably at the terrible direction, poor editing (should continuity failures be counted?), And a renewed warming of the same story, without the humor or heart that made the first movie appealing, trampling, and Randy Quaid's Bulldog -Choose up to three out of ten instead of two. It's not bad enough to laugh about it. I've definitely seen worse, but trust your memory - this one is a dog. If you have never seen it, you have made excellent life choices and I welcome your outstanding judgment.
