This movie was sheer, slow torturous torture. I'm not a fan of Slasher movies and prefer the classic horror. I may not be the best judge. Slasher fans may enjoy this as an early entry into the Slasher genre. I really want to have the 90 minutes I've looked at this. The only reasons to see this are 1) a young Vanna White (in front of the wheel of fortune), who has about 3 minutes total image time. 2) an early role of Scream Queen Linnea Quigley (with nudity) and legendary beauty EJ Peaker as a school secretary who added a little humor and sex appeal. Otherwise, there is an 80's band called Felony, which, although interesting, stretches far too long. Just like the movie ... I always had to check how much time was left and could not wait until I "graduated" a better movie.
