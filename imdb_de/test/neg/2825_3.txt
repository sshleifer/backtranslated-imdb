Well, the movie starts off well, but after half an hour it gets boring and stupid when it comes to Karen's pregnancy (that's the girl's name, right?). <br /> <br /> The end of the movie It's really crazy and the characters really stupid. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is stupider, whether the girl, because she came back with her old friend or the boy, as he needed it for her. Anyway, my conclusion is this: definitely not the best 80's comedy, just a movie like many others with nothing special, they could do better, but they ruined it if the plot was just another one It would take away the stuff for pregnancy and definitely ruin it, so the final conclusion: I do not like it.
