I loved this movie when I was a teenager. I loved it. But it did not grow up with me. Maybe it's because it's a melodramatic load of old trash, full of macho stance, cheesy dialogues, overworked slo-mo, and characters that say 'Goddammit' a lot. The lumpy narrative lumps are from one figure to another, one storyline to another, without bringing everything together, and it does not help that William Baldwin's monopoly of a performance is wet enough to erase any fire in the film's overlong running time. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland are worth seeing, but here nobody is really at the top, and the women are becoming particularly thrifty. The only real effect comes from the impressive firefighting sequences and the majestic score of Hans Zimmer, who is still one of my favorites.
