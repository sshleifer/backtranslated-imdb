A really horrible movie, really low budget, with a terrible spectacle, an intricate and inhuman action, a modest reworking of the vampire stories, mixed with modern science most of the parts with very limited and cheap effects. It's not even fun, like some of the low budget independent films of this kind. <br /> <br /> Waste of time
