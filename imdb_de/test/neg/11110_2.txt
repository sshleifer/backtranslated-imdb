Excerpt from the TV GUIDE: <br /> <br /> This week, Captain Stubing has his hands full on THE LOVE BOAT as a crypto-oologist walks aboard with an unexpected load! Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun Halloween special. Guest with a guy in a really bad lizard suit as Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> This is a typical lame sci-fi channel fare. The captain of a cruise ship, played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies, takes on a Carnival cruise along the Mexican coast. His daughter is on the trip, and she earns her living by being the ship's kickboxing instructor. Make sure kickboxing will be useful later! It should be noted that the captain's daughter is rather uncoordinated and painful. It would have been good if she had attended some kickboxing classes before trying to play an instructor in a movie. Captain Stupid and his daughter come to Mrs. Thurston Howell of Gilligan's Island, a daring crypto-oculist and a dark, mysterious stranger on this 90-minute ride to boredom. <br /> <br /> That's right, I told crypto-micro. He repeatedly mentions that he has brought valuable cargo on board, which he has to check out. Needless to say, the box contains a chupacabra that someone wants to dismiss. From this point on, a man in a Chupacabra rubber suit runs around the ship killing people. Captain Stupid is powerless to stop it. He decides to invite the Marines, but tells them there are a lot of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> The Marines react. They say all the marine-talking stuff like "Hooya" and "Get Some." But these stupid marines are no match for a chupacabra. They really do not tell anyone where to go, so no help is in sight. I think nobody will really miss a lame battalion of lost Marines. But remember ... The daughter of Captain Stupid is fortunately a kickboxing teacher. Yay for a little stupid! She arrives just in time, beats the bloodthirsty Goat Sucker and saves the day. Chupacabra means goat sucker. That's why Chupacabras suck. But there is no way that Chupacabras suck as much as this movie.
