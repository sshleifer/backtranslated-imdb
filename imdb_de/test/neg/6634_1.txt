First and foremost, this film has the stupidest action I've ever seen, and unfortunately I had to see it. I leafed through the canals one day and stumbled upon this lousy excuse for a movie, and it confirmed what I've said for a long time. Carrot Top is not an actor and is NOT funny in the slightest sense. He looks like he's a great comedian and thinks he draws the audience's attention. Honestly, he has the acting ability of a 10-year-old clown. A scratch that a less than 10-year-old has the opportunity to compare with Carrot Top would be a serious insult to her good name. This movie tries to be funny with boring missions that seemingly have all been lifted from the 50s cartoons. In the end I would have done anything to clear my memory of this movie, but unfortunately the memories stay with me. The only thing I can do is to warn others not to see this movie. It proves, however, that the rumors are true that Carrot Top is worth nothing.
