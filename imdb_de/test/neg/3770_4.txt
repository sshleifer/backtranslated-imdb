The director does not know what to do with a camera ... too many options and she always chooses the wrong one ... she has had travolta taken over ... and he controls the movie from start to finish. The characters are not developed ... maybe because we have to watch them sing ... no pace at all, sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow ... misunderstood: travolta ok ... johansson, she's too big for her to be an 18 ... even if she is really 20 ... <br /> <br /> the happy ending? Well, it looks like there should be one, so the story is sad, but not too sad ... travolta does not know how to play a guitar, but the director does not look that way too much makes sure that he is completely in sync ... <br /> <br /> the idea is the only thing that's great ... but how did it develop? Well, it's just full of stereotypes and too often heard lines ... <br /> <br /> too bad, another missed opportunity ...
