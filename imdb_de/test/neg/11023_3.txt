Ever since I bought the DVD, I've seen as much of it as I got out of my wallet. The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first writer who has engaged Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love and marries her. Complications follow. <br /> <br /> Douglas is usually considered to be an intense actor who is credited with dramatic roles, sometimes a hero, sometimes a rat. He is not bad in this thoroughly funny part. The problem is that the part is not very funny and nothing else. <br /> <br /> The story continues. A dozen "quirky" characters come and go - most prominently Keenan Wynn as Douglas' friend, who does nothing but funny comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this sort of thing. <br /> <br /> If the plot is weak, it could still have been salvaged through sparkling dialogue, but there is no reason to speak of it. Some gags are stupid. Others do not delete this bar. Here's what I thought was an amusing line. Douglas has just set Day and would like to take her to the beach house and seduce her. The day is disturbed and it is noticed that she has never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn asks if she liked Douglas' last book, Last Year's Love. Yes, of course she did. "Well, most of 'Last Year's Love' was done at the beach house." Ha ha. <br /> <br /> Nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There were better sitcoms on TV.
