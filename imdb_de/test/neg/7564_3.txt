This movie is a real low-budget production, but I will not say anything more, as it has already been covered. I give this film a low rating for the story alone, but I met the director at night when I saw the movie, and he gave me another reason not to like the movie. He asked me how I liked it and I told him that it was not easy to like. My main objection was the lack of basics for the relationship between the two main characters. I was never convinced that they were tight. I also told him that the scene in which the main characters were presented as being friends with friends was too late in the movie. <br /> <br /> He told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. That they were added because he felt that the two main characters did not appear in the vicinity. He further explained that these scenes were not turned to his satisfaction, as they had no money. I agree that they did not do much for the film. <br /> <br /> Another fact about the movie I did not know about is the actor who starred writing the script based on his own personal experience. This is usually a bad step, as some authors do not take the viewer's emotional reaction into account. The story is so close to home that the author makes too many assumptions about the audience's response to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, it did not work for me as I was never interested in any of the characters, least of all the lead role. What was offered were two evil people who make money at all costs, regardless of who gets hurt. If Ms. Young's character decides to give up the evil ways, it seems that she is doing it because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is doing wrong. If the movie contains a message, I suspect that only the author is informed.
