Alien Express is one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. The aliens look like rubber sock dolls. The effects would have been mediocre in the 1970s but are terrible by today's standards. Could not they take a real move instead of using an obvious model? <br /> <br /> The spectacle is not great, but dialogue is the worst part. It bores into your mind. "Do not die on me, not now." If you ever manage to put up unbelief long enough to get drawn into the movie, you'll quickly be painfully pulled back to reality by the aliens, the model train, or the clich√© dialogue. I did not give this movie a "1" because it did It did not deserve to be rated so badly that some poor guys might see him out of a really bad movie.
