To be honest, I could not stand watching this movie all the way through, so I have no idea if it gets better half way through the movie. But the first 30 minutes are among the worst I have seen in a long time. Children under the age of twelve could get a kick out of the poorly written, theatrical, and controlled slapstick humor, but adults who have full control over all their abilities should dodge that stinker.
