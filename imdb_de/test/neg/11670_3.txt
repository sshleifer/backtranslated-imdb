Smart summary, right? <br /> <br /> If Mad Max was something simple, straightforward, nothing special, but not just any movie, they made up for it with The Road Warrior sequel. Theoretically it would have been a great trilogy with a third great movie ... not now! <br /> <br /> Such a big disappointment was Beyond Thunderdome! The basic requirement is pretty cool, with an "underworld" (think of a mixture of Metropolis and The Time Machine), but not everything is done with too much conviction. Add the disgusting Tina Turner and the not-good story of the people waiting for a plane, and this is just a big stinker. <br /> <br /> Maybe they can lighten things up with Part 4 (though this one) is probably just a huge budget explosion, as this just is not true. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
