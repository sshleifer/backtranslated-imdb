Who cares about the shop here? How could a producer / network manager / director cast a crew of the most delicate plastic palms in film history into the sands of a wintry Canadian beach and try to see us as tropes? These trees were real palm trees, which is a pink tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree for real fir. And who had Dermot Mulroney with painted gray hair in front of the camera, who would not have passed in a high school game? And did not any of the geniuses who did the quality control on this thing think that correcting the (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gas instead of gas? Anyone involved in this clumsy slug of a "movie" - writer, director, actor - has done not only good but brilliant work elsewhere. Too fast between events, deadly slow in them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, expository, and fictitious process - this may seem like one of Lifetime's worst movies because of the red carpet hype it was presented with, is bad. And I say that as someone who loves life. What is it, people? All in all, a certain actress is working on a certain critical twist in the movie (and if you've seen it, you know exactly what I'm talking about). was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 of me if this was the whole movie. Unfortunately it was only about five seconds.
