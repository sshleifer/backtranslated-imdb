I just can not understand, freaks on the planet say this is a must, they even dare call it exploitation, because the obsessive girl seduces priests and masturbates all the time. Do not make me laugh. I've seen the movie, seduction is just at the end of the movie and does not call it seduction, it's just a bad language she talks to. And the masturbation scene is also a big laugh, she tries to seduce her father masturbating, let me be clear, with her clothes on you perverts out there. It's not bloody or bloody at all, everybody vomits at Beyond The Door. Well, let me say that one is better for me than this movie. Only the last 5 minutes, in which the possessed has vomited and has funny eyes. If I knew it was that bad, I would never make a copy. If you really want to see some exorcism exploitation, check out Angel Above, The Devil Below, or other cheesy ones. a waist of time is that.
