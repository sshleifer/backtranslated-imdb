This ultra-low-budget kitchen sink is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK because everywhere in the world there is the fact that a market must exist before a green light is given. Most likely self-financing, this is clearly an attempt to solve important issues, but ultimately undermines its existential point of view by asking who would ever put money into the distribution of these funds and, secondly, if a market audience does not exist, buy or rent This movie, why would anyone care about it? In my opinion, this sounds unfairly hard for the first time as a director, but this type of film only affects the commercial feasibility and quality standards that a British film industry has just received. Reviewed in Edinburgh. 2 out of 10.
