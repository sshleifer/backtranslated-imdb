STMD! is not a terrible movie, but it is completely forgotten. The lighting is intentionally bad in many scenes and inadvertently bad in all other areas, so you're probably out of sight with a headache or eye strain. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The indispensable nudity indispensable to teen slasher flicks is, of course, along with the archetypal teenagers, but the whole movie just does not do anything. What we needed was a snippier dialogue and more humorous humor. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend that you spend your time with this movie. I often take a look at a movie based on one or two scenes that demonstrate fantasy or humor, but these are unfortunately missing in this film.
