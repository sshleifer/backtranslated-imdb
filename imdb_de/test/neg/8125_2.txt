I tried. I've really tried to think of something that deserves a rating of more than two points. It's not that I did not understand it - I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that in its construction, the film is infantile, lengthy and painfully incoherent. <br /> <br /> I think if you are from Alfred Hitchcock's school of thought: "Do not tell them, show them". then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still be hard on it. <br /> <br /> First of all, The Terrorizers try to create a stream of consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fail. Edward Yang seems to understand the basics of technology, but is very awkward. (Maybe he gets better with age, I do not know, since I have not tried any other Yang movies yet.) The point is, he uses a lack of "Show, Do not Tell," which is really just for that to interrupt the procession from the story. Sure, he has some visually intriguing images, but they do not pull the story together and they do not help make them even better. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the main concept of stream-of-consciousness and "showing, not telling" means that the viewer draws his own conclusions with the right pictures, the right drama, the repetition and the close correlation can. not to say that this will draw the right conclusions, but these can be changed as the story progresses, and every director should seek part of that kind of interaction with the audience. In that regard, Edward Yang is painfully disappointed. The viewer is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to be involved, no reason to consider the characters or their motives, no reason to be emotionally involved, and really, no need to stay awake. <br /> <br /> Finally, Yang loses himself in the story he wants to tell, not the story the movie itself tells. His art moves in one direction, but like a big dog he can not control, he constantly pulls the leash and tries to get him back on track, not the one he naturally follows. The most frightening example is the end. The end should actually have happened in the moment of the revelation of the husband. The end of the book on which the film focuses (and subsequently a possible end to the film) has already been communicated to us. If Yang had decided to end up at this point, he would have had a much more powerful piece and kept the observer on fire - playing the story the way the book says, or is Yang's "real world" different? To ask the viewer to think about it is the type of viewer interaction that painfully requires Yang. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell and strains the natural conclusion for what? The mere reason for staying with a protagonist - we did not have to know about her anymore, and Yang would not feel the need to tell us if he had not made her a veneer, rather than worry about making her one more engaging and deeper character. <br /> <br /> Why else does Yang prolong and torture his movie? To get even more of these "visually striking images". The movie really suffers from that. It wants to end, it has a conclusion that feels natural and unsettles the viewer, but Yang is pushing instead. Instead, Yang constructs a complex ending that guides the viewer and constantly urges him or her to "so what?" The first end ignored by Yang was good. The second end, well, my thought was "so what, who cares?", Because it's not like it's introducing anything that's not already been put forward in the storyline ... but the last end? That was a waste of time. Not only did the "real" end let me go, but I also felt it was an insult to what the story could have been. Yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the blistering, melancholy-noir-colored ending he had insisted on all along. My last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself, but with its after production. The subbing (if you see it underlayed) is terrible. Long phrases remain for a second or two, while short phrases stay up too long. Since Yang changes images quickly, subtitles are removed from the screen. This is one of the rare cases where subtitles can be displayed on the screen, even if the picture has changed, since there is not much dialogue going on anyway.
