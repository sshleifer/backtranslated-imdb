The Calu-what now? Yes, I thought it would be a stupid name too. Chris Carter does not know about the scum in his writing stick. Let's start with the usual merry X-Files teaser (a baby run over by a train) of this episode ... Well, I can not really say it's going downhill, because to be honest, things never went uphill , Badly written, since we do not feel any pathos for any of the characters (except maybe the baby at the beginning), the author makes us hate characters before he brutally kills them. It is the worst technique ever. Should we apologize for the characters of hatred? Do not ask me. <br /> <br /> Not only is it boring and scary, it's like seeing a really bad omen successor with overcrowded and disgusting death sequences and lazy special effects (though, to be honest, the least worry is). <br /> <br /> Sara B. Charno started her X-Files career with a whimper and thankfully ended it with one. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: <br /> <br /> In the words of my math teacher Mr. Laverack: "Horrible, Awful ..."
