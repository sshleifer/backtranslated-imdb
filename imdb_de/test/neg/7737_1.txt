As a native Chinese, I can not accept this notion that some people have to die for a "better world". I said 'better world' because it is a lie that the Chinese have been indoctrinated for a thousand years! <br /> <br /> I think the Western public may not know Qin Shihuang (means first emperor). The king in this movie is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia (Chinese word spoken by the king means "land and people") spoken out of his mouth is a lie. From then on, the whole king in ancient China spoke one by one, but only a few did what they said. Another fact is that the empire of Qin Shihuang existed only twenty years ago. It was destroyed by humans. <br /> <br /> Well, I like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but I can not accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
