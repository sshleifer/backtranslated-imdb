First of all, I admit that I have not seen Vampires: Los Muertos yet, but I have seen the original vampires movie and am thrilled. I rented this movie after I did not hear it. I did not expect to be impressed. It was not me. <br /> <br /> I love the idea of ​​relocating the action to the Far East, which should have opened up a lot of new possibilities for the action sequences and plot, but not enough was made of it. The fight scenes and the motorcycle hunts were painfully boring. <br /> <br /> There were some parts that I liked, like the way the Slayer team was not shown as heroic good guys like they were in the first movie I've been hoping for since I came before Years ago, the old Hammer movie Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires saw that someday someone would shoot another good Asian vampire movie. That was not it.
