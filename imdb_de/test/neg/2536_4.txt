Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon launch in Switzerland as the world's leading detective Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) outwits the Nazis and manages to hire a brilliant scientist named Dr. from London. But is London as safe as Holmes thinks? Dr. Tobel has developed a revolutionary new bombing system that will change the air strikes forever. He has agreed to turn it over to the British government, but these Nazis are as much in favor of bombing it & selling it to the Nazis. Join the limping inspector Lestrade (Denis Hoey) of Scotland Yard, Dr. Tobel's love interest Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), murderers, mysterious scientists, and a puzzling coded message add his bomb ... <br /> <br /> Director: Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon were the fourth of 14 Holmes films filmed between 1939 and 1946 featuring Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson. The screenplay by Edward T. Lowe Jr., Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartmann is based on the short version "The Dancing Men" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is not the tradition that represents Holmes murder mystery, as it is more of a war history , To neglect what Holmes is all about, solving complex crimes and secrets is a big mistake for me, and the involvement of the Nazis and the war as a background to the story feels out of place, awkward & just not sitting there good to me. The dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty feels almost like an afterthought, as if they can not think of a rogue, and overall, he is far less committed than others in the show. At least it's short. <br /> <br /> Director Neill does his usual efficient job, but you have to let it go, remembering that it was made over 60 years ago. It has no real style and imagination and lacks both atmosphere and intrigue. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is OK if it is unspectacular. The black and white cinematography is fine, although I understand that a computer-colored version is also available. The acting is ok, Bruce & Hoey make their usual comic relief curves & Rathbone's hairstyle in this regard looks ridiculous and I'm glad he changed them for later installments. Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon were a disappointment Compared to some of the other great submissions in the series, there is very little that I can recommend. Everything the others did so well seems to be missing here. Leave this to last and see some of the better ones first, only for the tough fans.
