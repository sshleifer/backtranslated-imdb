Although the trailer and the poster of this film suggest that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I was perhaps not so shocked to discover that she was just an inferior (and I mean underage) character in the case of this film should be told by Sally's own character family! I mean, if you're going to tell the story of a family member who was ignored by history, would you really tell the story of the man who veiled her into the main character? His other lover (who happens to be white) as the real love interest? I know, I would not do it! I'm as pale as they come and usually a big fan of Merchent ~ Ivory Flicks, but I can not stand the treatment of poor Sally Hemmings with this movie.
