If I guessed your "Palabra", will you let me go through it? - asks William Geld, a Tim Robbins who always behaves as if they are telling him a fantastic joke and he tries to laugh. > He tries to get to a forbidden area. The woman who stops him continues to blab: "Your" Palabra "is Carrefour. <br /> <br /> -how did you know? - the lady asks surprised. He answers in the name of wisdom: - I heard when you did not speak. : / <br /> <br /> Yes, that defines the movie. That exactly. It does not matter if Carrefour in French is "road link" or if the future is cold bureaucratic and mixes languages. Or if Samantha Morton has nothing, nothing of Spanish (Maria Gonzalez is her name in the movie) with her Irish-Scottish tone. <br /> <br /> It's boring and boring. If you believe that there are multiple symbolisms, buy the most bizarre and ailing love relationship in a future that could be in seven seconds. I can guess the palabra of this movie: it will be "painful".
