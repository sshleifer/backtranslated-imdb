A girl named Isobel is possessed by a demon. The local priest (who used to be with Isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the bigger issues are the mistrust of the family and not the demon in her daughter. This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, the author of "House" and the author / director of "House II". I loved the first movie and liked the second one better, so you might think that this would be a winner. Unfortunately, it looks like it was thrown together by film students in the first year. Dawson Leery could have done better. I've been thinking of accusing the new writer Ellary Eddy for it, mostly because the idea is hardly original (are they trying to exploit the fans of The Exorcism of Emily Rose?), But Wiley could have done it <br /> Also, you would like to think that horror star veterans Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this film. Russo (who plays the bishop) hardly shows up and Combs plays a great role as sheriff ... for the five minutes he's on the screen (but I love the mustache). No help here. <br /> <br /> After seeing "The Exorcist", all other exorcism films have to be compared to the classic by default, right? And the demonic obsession in this movie was in no way scary. No head rotation or paranormal activity. Only a girl with a deep voice and liquid make-up. The whole "demonic" stuff concentrated on the father, who accused everyone of sleeping with his wife. Another reviewer wrote: "Isobel hops on her bed like a trampoline, hides in her closet and jumps out of a hayloft - yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese who's wild." Unfortunately, this sadly sums up the extent of the "evil" in this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about family members who make up allegations and shout at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room camera, that's the movie for you. But if you do not mind saying so, you have a terrible taste in the movie if you're looking for that. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to focus on the father who accuses a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who did not sleep but slept with his daughter) and the veterinarian who slept with his wife has (which would have, but denies). And then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and instructs the family to call an exorcist, but as soon as the priest arrives, the gardener declares that he does not believe in God. What was the whole biblical quote that you made five minutes ago? A terrible exorcism movie. Terrible examples of what Combs and Russo are capable of. And such a sad demonstration of the "House" series of films became a classic. I'd like to pretend that Wiley has no part in making this shamefully derived and unoriginal, uninspired movie. The power of Christ compels you to avoid this movie as if it were a major sin.
