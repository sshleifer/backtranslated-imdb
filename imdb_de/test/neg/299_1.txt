"Hoods" does not deliver the goods. This half-baked mafia comedy has a stellar cast, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly, and Seymour Cassel, as well as a series of faces familiar to those who watch thrillers, but it's really been a misfire ever a. Writer and director Mark Malone, who wrote "Dead of Winter" for "Bonnie & Clyde" director Arthur Penn, has a pedestrian potboiler with a sickly but vengeful mob boss, Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel), his son Angelo ( Joe Mantegna from "House of Games") to beat Carmine Della Rosa. It seems that a rival mob bombarded one of Pop's warehouses (in the opening scene) with fire and Martinelli wants to pay back. The problem is that no one has any idea who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mob comedy, such a complication may be amusing, but here it is just flat. Angelo and a wealth of wiseguys, including his best buddy Rudy (Kevin Pollack of "Deterrence"), spend half the time figuring out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to do the hit, so they go to a crazy mob hero Charlie (Joe Pantoliano from "Bad Boys") to do the dirty act. Before they can convince Charlie to make the hit, they have to find him and reveal to Charlie's sloppy wife Mary (Jennifer Tilly from "Bound") that he's locked up in a mental hospital. Our inappropriate heroes drive to the mental hospital and break out Charlie. About half of the movie is over before discovering that Carmine is a short-haired kid (Vincent Berry) who is bland and harmless. In fact, Carmine has the only decent line in the movie. As our brainless hero rolls out of his house with him in the backseat to take care of the business, Carmine warns her that they must take him home in time because his father will kill him. Charlie tries to freeze the villain, but he can not. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to return to the mental hospital so he can tell the good news to his doctor. In the meantime, after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the boy puts his paws on the gun and jumps off some aimless laps. Angelo and he fight for the automatic. The pistol slips out of its collective hands and hits the ground, goes away and blows a hole in Rudy's chest. Well, remember that Rudy did not want to shoot the boy at all, and Angelo and he argued about the madness of the hit. Rudy lands a deadly wound on the ground while Angelo tries to stop the bleeding. Talk about a boring death scene. Angelo himself has come into conflict because his father has ordered the hit and Angelo fears that daddy will kill him if he does not execute any orders. There's a flashback to Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a weapon that gives a glimpse of Angelo's reluctance to grab a gun. There is nothing that can remotely control this depressing comedy that comes to an end. Things get worse, and if you stick to that 90-minute nonsense, you'll see what I mean. The comedy is largely laughless. Good actors wallow in sketchy roles that are not even funny. Maybe the director Malone tried another comedy like "The gang who could not shoot directly". If he was, he missed a mile. The busty Jennifer Tilly shows some scenes with Mantegna and growls through a few scenes, but otherwise she does nothing. She is the stereotypical slut who does not even undress. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish. At first I had hoped that this could be a "Ransom of Red Chief", in which the boy drives the smartie crazy, but here no luck. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a child, but it's not the kind of surprise to watch the video until it resolves. Canadian DVD label? Seville? And contains only the most basic features. If you hate predictions that betray the plot, do not look at the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of the first questions should be why he produced this Yawner. It is neither funny nor dramatic. There are no quotable lines, and none of the characters are interesting or sympathetic. The DVD from Sevilla shows the movie in full screen without subtitles or subtitles.
