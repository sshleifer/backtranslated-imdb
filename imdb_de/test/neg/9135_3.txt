The first two films of this series were characterized by their images of nature and ordinary people who are in the midst of society. This movie has nothing of this natural material that I know is part of the point, but it really does make the entire video component of the movie look like randomly glued pictures - ones and zeros flying around, computer models of human skeletons, and so on. Occasionally, the footage is used effectively (the nationalism / finance segment at 35:00), but in general, the video does not seem to have meaningful content, and requires that you are more likely the context of the stock photographer than the context of the director. It's no better than the video shown on a karaoke machine. Three stars for the Philip Glass soundtrack.
