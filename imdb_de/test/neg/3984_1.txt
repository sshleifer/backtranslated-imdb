'You're in the Navy Now' is painfully bad: most likely the worst movie Gary Cooper ever made. It is supposedly based on a true story, but the incident that inspired this film does not seem to have enough action to support a feature film script. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on local television while I was at home for my mother-in-law in Long Island, New York. Outside there was a blizzard, and I was literally snow-covered. If I could leave the door, I would definitely have stopped watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting names in the cast, notably Charles Bronson (under his original name) Lee Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget it. Everyone stinks in this movie. Even the normally reliable Millard Mitchell is terrible. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are so brief on the screen that there's no point in looking for them. Gary Cooper plays an obscure naval officer assigned to command a ship powered by a new experimental steam turbine: Basically, the whole ship is a huge teapot. Cooper recognizes that the job is not a prestigious one: if that were the case, he would have gone to a better officer. Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply had no capacity for comedy. He has done several bad comedies and this is his worst. Jane Greer has always bored me, and she bores me here more than usual. This ship went down with all hands and sank without a trace. Did I mention that this movie stinks? I rate 'You're in the Navy now' as one of 10 points. Toot! Blow!
