This love story between an American journalist and a Eurasian doctor is not a source of conflict, as she is largely westernized (studied in London) and no fireworks, as she is more reserved. The low interest that the story can arouse is further suppressed by the wood dialogues. They are said to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but they speak as if the words were taken in the mouth by a Hollywood hack that is not much of itself. The film also suffers from an amazing lack of realism - a deserted beach in crowded little Hong Kong overrun by a million Chinese refugees? And a presumably savvy American journalist in his forties who does not know what a hysterectomy is? Hollywood ideas. Finally "the song". After listening to it about twenty times in the course of the film, he started directly with the guy's tensions and tended to lose some of his emotional impact, I'm sorry to say.
