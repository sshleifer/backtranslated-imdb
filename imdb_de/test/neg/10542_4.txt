Oh man! What can I say to Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed. I thought about ... A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll see him kick people and punch people and break bones. We could even see him having a stick fight with someone! Excellent! <br /> <br /> However, I had a rude awakening. This movie can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Take an episode of the A-Team and remove the lovable and mischievous characters like Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. Then get yourself a writer / director who draws up a plan, even if Ed Wood would be ashamed and too big fans of The Matrix and John Woo movies. Throw a bunch of people with really bad acting skills and no real names. Finally, add a main star who becomes limp around his stomach and apparently is no longer able to do his own stunts. <br /> <br /> The result? Half dead. An action film that is so ridiculous that at least I consistently made myself smile. The action holes are surprisingly large, z. B. Prisoners who, when the prison has invaded, fight the intruders and try not to flee. Or how about the prison itself, which has an armory containing heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers? They also have a helicopter (which has a striking resemblance to a huey) with a kind of video game machine mounted in the nose. <br /> <br /> Then there is Seagal itself. I like the guy. He can fight. He's even funny in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But throughout the movie, I've always hoped for this great, formative fight scene. Never happened. Instead, we forced people to fire rifles and not hit a hell. I mean, if you run through a narrow corridor and shoot at him with a submachine gun, there are not many places where the bullets can go down to the target other than the corridor. But somehow they miss? Even the A team would shudder at this stupidity. And then, when it comes to any physical one-to-one things, we get a shabby Matrix rip-off, without the benefit of enumeration time. People who are kicked twenty feet in the air, and other ridiculous acrobatic nonsense. <br/> <br /> Come on, Steven, you're better than this. Your career can not be over. Say it is not like that! <br /> <br /> This is immediately forgotten (unless I force myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you look at it, try it in an A-Team manner. But I doubt that anyone on the list of "recoverable" is at the top. That's not the case for justice. More like for lunch.
