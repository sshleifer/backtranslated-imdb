A mixed group of "experts" (explorers, divers and scientists) ventures a mile underground and travels another 3.9 miles underwater to an even more secluded place where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some big razors Find. winged, computer-generated creatures lurking around. The cave is sealed by a rock fall. Then the monsters attack and kill all while looking for an exit. And that's all she wrote with this effort that does not combine action, science fiction and horror at the most elemental levels. Imagine someone giving $ 30 million to people in the sci-fi channel to shoot a monster movie. That's exactly how THE CAVE is. sometimes unsettling in its inability to be full of clich√©s and almost completely dependent on the special effects. The only difference is that they had more money to build sets, more money to polish up the monsters, and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who are doing horrible performances anyway. Otherwise, it continues as usual. Some of these films are still fun. This is not and there are many reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) It takes too seriously and has no sense of humor. So you get a totally unoriginal and predictable movie that does not even realize how unoriginal and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence is for no other purpose than killing a few minutes and contributing to the redundancy. <br /> <br /> 3.) Unoriginal-looking CGI creatures will not impress anyone today and age. <br /> <br /> 4.) Using shakycam and the quick cut for your horror scenes is just lazy and uninspired. And why would you want to further darken the action by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions such as blazing fire and blast? It not only makes these scenes hard to see, but also unmotivated to enjoy. <br /> <br /> 5.) Even if you want it to be serious, the script is full of stereotypes, the dialogue is terrible and no attempt is made to determine the characterization. Casting 25-year-old model types as brilliant scientists and hard-core veteran researchers may be a feast for the eyes, but it completely shuts off the credibility of a movie that's otherwise absolutely straightforward. Sorry, you can not have both. <br /> <br /> 6.) There were two exceptions to the model rule, as they had decided to hire an old man and an average-looking Joe. These were the first two killed. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a little change, they also forced a black and a Chinese. Oddly enough, neither one of them gets a big voice in this film and essentially stands in the background while Whitey discusses what the next step will be. Offensive. <br /> <br /> 8.) How many movies do you have to make when a black character sacrifices his life at the very end, just to make sure that Hot White Female Lead and Hot White Male Lead end up together? Pooh. Give me a break already. <br /> <br /> 9.) Much of the acting was terrible. Cole Hauser's appearance was completely ridiculous. The other male lead role looked as if it had just come out of the set of a soap opera and ran with the patented bead-smile-make-all-the-ladies-swoon technique, which corresponds to the PG-13 gender switch, to my Big Boobs-All-Men-Swoon Technique, which is often used by women in R-Rated movies. In any case, his performance was completely called. Daniel Dae Kim (from the TV series "Lost") and Piper Perabo also stank the room with their staid and monotonous delivery. <br /> <br /> 10.) the end a joke? Absolutely terrible. Please, God, we do not need a continuation of this garbage. So basically, I would not bother with it, unless you've never seen a monster movie or are just desperate and the only other thing is "The Simple Life". The sets were good, the blue toned photography is fine and some of the actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) did their best, so I decided to increase the rating by one notch to "2".
