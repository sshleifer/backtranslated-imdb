I do not know where most of you were, but where I saw the movie, we did not sing people, as some have said, they laughed, mostly on the Campy Plot line, the terrible dance sequences and the singing of people like Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed fascinated by the movie were the people of the seventies who experienced the past with the songs. I worked as a DJ in the seventies and in September 79 I was even at the ABBA concert at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton. That's why I valued her then, and I still do today. But this movie should have been just like her marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so badly staged, the synchronization and editing absolutely terrible and this must be Meryl's worst production. I can not believe that a prizewinner from the Academy would bend over so little to make this piece of rubbish. So save your money, wait for it to appear on DVD, and spend your money on something better, like cat litter.
