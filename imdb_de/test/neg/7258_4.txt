THE DEADLY MANTIS certainly does not scare anyone, but as a sci-fi programmer, it's better than most. A volcanic eruption at the South Pole thaws up a huge prehistoric mantis at the North Pole. Military men are missing. Dr. Ned (William Hopper - the son of Hedda Hopper, known as Paul Drake on PERRY MASON TV) is called to i.d. the creature - but at the time, the creature has eaten several Eskimo and is on its way to the Washington Monument. <br /> <br /> About a third or more of the movie is made up of footage: old state educational films, radar military radars, airplanes - and would you believe that Eskimos are at sea? This of course explains why an Eskimo tribe is attacked in the movie. ("Hey, guys, do you think we can handle this?") Mix some negligible special effects, some chunky dialogues and some sexist settings, and you're ready to go. Not as original as THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD, but fans of the 1950s 'Big Bug' hit will enjoy it - and the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn on the screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
