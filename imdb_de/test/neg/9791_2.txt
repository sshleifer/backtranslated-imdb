Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie in which Julius Harris had a role. I did not see all of his films, but Julius Harris was in a lot of good movies and I remember him best from "Live and Let Die", where he played Tee-. Hey and that was full of voodoo references, something that's common here in South Florida! I've always thought that LIVE AND LET DIE is a great movie because, unlike most 007 films, it has some atmosphere and mystique. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his voodoo personality! He has a great style for the mystery and the occult, and his role in this film is excellent. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a comedy. SPOILERS: Three kids who look like they've been fired from the cast of THE LITTLE RASCALS are killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like he's been fired by FAME cast! or as a dancer with DICK CLARK'S AMERICAN BANDSTAND. In other words, these children give the LOW BUDGET another dimension. Julius Harris goes into the morgue mortuary, cuts off the three heads of the children (and no one notices) and then brings them to his condominium unit, where he has a huge kettle of boiling liquids. The three heads are thrown in together with herbs, spices and voodoo objects. At some point, Mr. Harris has those ugly little heads on a table and he spills them with blood and they come alive as talking heads! They can fly, make jokes, roll their eyes and avenge the evil doers. They usually look pretty funny when they fly around, but the effects are not bad. For some reason, one of the children always has a switchboard in his mouth, and he cuts people's necks and cuts holes in the tires. This movie is weird and funny, but only the first time. Meg Foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays a male leader of the local gangster. Strange movie.
