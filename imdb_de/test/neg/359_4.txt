The man with the golden arm (the movie) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, but fails as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You hear again and again how books are "changed" when they are made into films - things are cut out, depressed, etc. Well, you can not even say that the film has "changed" anything in the story. The characters and the setting are the same sure but not ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of the Polish Chicago in the book. As far as the scenery is concerned, it has merely become a stage, complete with the unnecessary "supporting role" to which the city's claustrophobic, outer streets run hurriedly. The film is a completely different attitude to Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie and Sparrow lose their psychological advantage. Frankie's drumming, a modest dream in the book, becomes his full passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as a scam, exploited. The acting is decent, especially the snake-like Louie, who is more threatening in the movie than the book. But it's just a shame that this kind of movie, besides the book he's based on, is the real story of Frankie Machine. The film simply shows that Hollywood can do it all right without damaging it and adding a happy ending. In that case, they've just completely changed it and cheapened an important and realistic Hollywood fluff story. I'm probably damn biased because I read the book first, so I can not really treat the movie honestly, knowing how good the book is. I was actually thinking about turning off the movie (and I never do that), just so I would not confuse its stupid plot with the beauty of the book. But this is an overrated movie, and although it's not that bad, the book should come first, since it was the first one. And it should have been the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.
