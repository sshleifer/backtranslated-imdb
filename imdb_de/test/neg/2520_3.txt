I first heard about this movie when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his "Werewolves and Lollipops" CD. He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. As a lover of horrible cinema, I knew that I would do something good. <br /> <br /> This movie is undoubtedly one of the funniest I've ever seen. Certainly one of the funniest Shlock movies. After all, a demon adopted a human form years ago, the wife died or something, the demon called blood, the blood fell on the bed, the bed is now obsessed and it is eating now. In addition to fruits, flowers and chicken, it also tastes good to people. People can lie between horny teenagers, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy-throwers. There is also a sick man who ate in bed but put his soul behind a picture in the room. Most movies let you discover the storyline through exciting actions. The death bed takes a different path. Essentially, it tells you through storytelling what exactly happens while slow, boring murder scenes take place. I have to say that anyone who ate by the bed is surprisingly quiet. I would think if a bed eats you through the ways of a 5th grade Science Fair experiment, it would sting a little. I think the nerve endings were not invented until 1981 or so. <br /> <br /> The story is crazy, the direction is slow and pretty awful, the sets are sparse, the acting is pretty painful and the brother is one of the most unintentionally ugly actors I've ever seen. Would probably make a great party movie when alcohol and smartass are involved. Certainly one that you should not miss.
