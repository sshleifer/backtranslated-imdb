Obviously, this goal is not aimed at the brain: the so-called "humor" is based on fart and any clich√© about any ethnic genre you can imagine, including gays, unless this is WASP. And a latin cow red? Besides, John Leguizamo has talent and charisma, but in such a movie it's definitely a waste. What is the point of challenging Jim Carrey Jim Carrey himself? "The Pest" of the title could then be this movie, almost as funny as Bergman's finest. Prepare to be upset, not amused
