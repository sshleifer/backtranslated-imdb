Why did you let go of this movie about us? It seems they want to make this film a total slap in the face for Anne Rice and every Vampire Chronicles fan. It ignores the groundwork set up by the interview with the vampire, mutilates the plot of the novel and stumbles Stuart Townsend drunk. <br /> <br /> Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our bellow prince, our adventurous rebel with the best humor. Stuart is a second-rate, boring puller from Dracula in black leather. He did NOT read the books or did not know the character ... is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is a dyslexic and yet he's determined to read the books and know and love Lestat. <br /> <br /> Do not fool yourself, it's not a "stand alone" vampire strip, it's just garbage.
