I'm usually a fan of "art" and "foreign" movies, but when I saw this movie, my reaction was "it has to be called experimental because it does not make sense". The "action" is static while jumping from one place to another. There are not enough titles to show who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently, the main point was to show that in the face of murder, adultery, and generally comic and unobtrusive behavior, the healing offered by the powers is to banish a completely innocent black man.
