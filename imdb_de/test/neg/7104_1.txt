This movie does not know what it wants to be: does it make fun of action movies in general? Is that satirical? Should it be a black comedy? This is really one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. There I said what everyone else thinks. It's bad enough that she's such a horrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she's not even a mediocre B-movie actress. Their screaming voice, weird manners and the bad comic timing make this film through from start to finish until you just want to put your head in a vise and stop the pain. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. You will not regret it.
