I have just seen Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were pretty hokey and had more than a few implausibilities. The acting was not so bad and the plot was not bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details. <br /> <br /> Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) The bleeding from Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown coming out of the back of his hand while his ankles were bleeding. <br /> <br /> 2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lit area? This seemed very stupid. <br /> <br /> I'm not uncommonly picky about a movie, but in my humble opinion, this movie is definitely NOT recommended by me.
