A terribly nicknamed and totally ridiculous haunted house horror movie starring Anna Paquin playing a neurotic teenage who is against the "things that are going on" that plague her and her family shortly after the move, is moving to her new home in Spain (? !). Just over a geographically replanted rip-off of "The Shining" and, above all, "The Others," the faintly plotted "Darkness" is basically your typical run-of-the-MB horror with a few predictable lame scares that Audience a mile away can see (so to speak)! In retrospect, I think that I would not have had to set my personal expectations for this film to be really good, considering that the film was put on hold for almost three years, before finally going to the last year's Christmas American cinemas released the country to the ultimately lukewarm ticket sales and very sharp reviews from critics. When will filmmakers ever find that there's more to making films (be it horror or otherwise) than just the possibility of a small financial gain? (Turkey-zero stars)
