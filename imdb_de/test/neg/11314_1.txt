Leslie Nielsen is down with this absolutely horrible comedy, which is the worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. There is nothing to like about this film, because it is essentially a one-joke movie and the joke is not too funny. How often should we laugh at an almost blind man who makes a fool of himself? That's not funny, that's just pathetic. Nielsen has to seriously start refusing some of those pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong has to stick to Jackie Chan movies because it does not get much worse.
