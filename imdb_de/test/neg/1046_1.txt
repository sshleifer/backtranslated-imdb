"Five characters looking for an exit" must be one of the most boring "zones" ever made. It was sci-fi this morning, and as usual, I switched channels. I put it on my top five list of the worst "zones" ever produced. Boring and predictable and not worth seeing. Serling has edited this theme to death (Earthlings in the hands of aliens, which were often giants), and in this particular version it just does not work. If you have not seen it yet, you will quickly find it out. This is another of Serling's philosophical sentiments that may represent the plight of those in captivity or concentration camps, where detainees may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their captives. William Windom, the last soldier to "come by", is the only one who bothers, and it does not take long to figure out the result.
