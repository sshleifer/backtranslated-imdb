They used footage from a real protest that was discussed with a woman who talked about a society where there was no man who seemed to be cheering on men's gendercide. The funny thing is, you can see a man cheering his own death in the background. OK, the conspiracy. A lady says that there should be a society without men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) thinks it's a great idea. Then all men are killed or something. So there are no more. <br /> <br /> Then this blond scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can not become violent. The male is growing very fast and is soon a grown man. Not long after he takes the VW Beetle of the blonde and drives to the city where he was discovered. Now you think the lonely man in a city full of lesbians would be the luckiest guy ever, but by no means. The police are chasing him. <br /> <br /> I did not watch the rest, but it probably ends up running against the clock and some people, or something bad is likely to happen. Somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion. Those brave warriors who hid in a stadium might have a plan that described exactly how they got rid of a planet full of women, but I did not watch. And you should not. <br /> <br /> If you are surfing too late in the channels and this happens, do not watch. See everything except this. You'll find these displays for Bowflex or women in bathing suits asking you to pick up the phone to meet women like these who can provide more satisfying entertainment in your area. <br /> <br /> (Oh yeah, there's this weird thing when they drive in their cars, I do not know what they did, it looks like they drove very slowly and carefully, but then tried to speed up the movie to compensate, but it just looks weird.) <br /> <br /> The blonde girl was kind of cute and I feel generous, so ... 2/10 ,
