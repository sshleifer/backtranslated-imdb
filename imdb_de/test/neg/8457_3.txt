"Terror in the Aisles" may be the ultimate treat for horror fans, but in fact has very little to offer. Granted, it presents a decent and versatile (too versatile?) Selection of horror / thriller fragments that are considered classic, but ... what's the point? This documentary is primarily aimed at the horror lover, so we've already seen all of these clips, right? The only really praise for this project is the editing. If you're into screaming queens, chases of vile murderers and such things, "Terror in the Aisles" has some nice compilations of the most famous sequences. All these different scenes are connected by a lame, choppy story in which Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sit in a movie theater. Between two sequences the observer's address and "explain" why we love horror so much. These speeches are inherently embarrassing and quite obvious (it's in our nature to be scared ... blah blah blah) and I do not understand why many people love the concept. This is worth a look in case you are a loyal horror fan. On the contrary, if you still need to see a classic genre title, make sure that parts of it do not interfere with your future viewing. The main reason I did not like it all is that it shamelessly ignores many lesser-known but basic (foreign) titles that focus endlessly on "Halloween." However, this leads to a cool insider joke as Donald Pleasance screams his own character on the screen.
