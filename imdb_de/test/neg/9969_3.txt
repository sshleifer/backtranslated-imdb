Okay, last night, on August 18, 2004, I had the clear displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a screening of The Manson Family at Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. I have to say the following. At first, the film is an obvious rip-off for any Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone, and Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen. Second, in a brief question and answer session after the show, Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he had never contacted the actual members of the Manson family or Charlie himself, called them liars and said he did not want to have anything to do with them Film was based on his (Van Bebble) assumption of the process, after seeing everything from his living room on television and in the news (and I'm assuming the autobiography and the book Helter Skelter, imitated directly by the narrative). , So I asked questions a second time, asking if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n' roll, and not necessarily the true story. This question was obviously pissed off that the director, who had since been swallowed, had started shouting, "F *** you, shut up the torch, that's the truth! All these other movies are Bullsh **!" <br /> <br /> Well, I did not even think about how ridiculous that was until I read the tagline for the movie the next day: "You've heard the laws of history ... listen to the story now as she is told by the Manson Family. "Excuse me, if this guy has never talked to the family and considers them liars he does not want to be involved with. How can he tell the story for her in God's name? This is the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard! The film was obviously intended for the audience of sex drugs and rock'n'roll musicians, as he had no trouble putting on the small, dimly lit theater, and even more so through the sex-drug and rock'n'roll He could not even see his own movie without getting up every ten minutes to get more beer or scream some kind of Rocky Horroresque callline to the actors on screen. This movie does not do much more than turn the audience's image of actual events (which has shaped the state of America and much of the world today) into a sort of slasher / comic / porno / rape fantasy, by an obviously shallow person was conceived. <The movie was definitely very impressive. The soundtrack was refreshing as it included current samples of Charlie's work with the family from his Lie album. The cut was nice and choppy to simulate the worst uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all, this film would have complemented the catalogs at Mtv much better than the Underground Film Festival or the minds of all intellectual observers. I felt like I was Rocky Horror at midnight, watching the audience dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good, except for Charlie, who was more reminiscent of some sort of Dungeon and Dragons enthusiast than the actual role he was playing. The descriptions that the movie gave him of being full of energy, throwing ten things at you, and being very physical, did not match the slow, lethargic and chubby presentation that was actually presented. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie basically explains itself, as Sadie (or maybe Linda) explains in the end, "You can write a lot of Bullsh ** books or a lot of Bullsh ** movies make ... etc. "Case study. Even the "Based on a True Story" disclaimer is a dead gift that signals that somewhere beneath this psychedelic rubbish heap lies the foundation of a true story with content that makes a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little alchemy to separate the truth from the shit, or in fact you could just avoid everything and read a book instead. <br /> <br /> Anything I can say When the movie ended, I got a free beer, so I'm glad I left, but I'm not happy to get fifteen dollars for my ticket to have told me that he should shut down the scammer to ask the director a question. Peace.
