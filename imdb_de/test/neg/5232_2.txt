Needful Things was one of my favorite books by Stephen King. But this movie is one of the worst book customizations I've ever seen. They changed so many things that I got sick. Even if the concept of the book was deception, things that do not always seem like a memory were not shown in the movie. Althogh was as enjoyable as many Stephen King movies, but like many Stephen King movies, this one did not follow the book and became a piece of Hollywood trailer garbage. 2.10
