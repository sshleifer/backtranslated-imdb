This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen! My husband and I own over 600 DVDs, most of which are sci-fi and horror B movies that are not of the highest quality but are still entertaining. Dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities! The writing was terrible and the drama was even worse. We made three attempts to keep the whole movie going because we could only tolerate it at intervals of 30 minutes. We thought it would have to be better ... we were wrong. I would rather see a corpse being embalmed than having to go through it again !!! When it ended, my husband just looked at me like "Um ... is that?" The end seemed to be longer, but they had exceeded their apparent $ 500.00 budget and were like, "Oh, shit ... we're broke..if it's now ... fast ... roll sets!"
