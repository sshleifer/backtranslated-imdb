In Showtime, two popular actors are put together, like De Niro and Murphy, who play a police and an actor. Although they have most of the screen time together, they do not achieve their expected benefits, such as films such as Analyze This, Meet the Parents, dr. Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The movie starts off interestingly, but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy that is pretty disappointing. It feels like De Niro does not like to be in Showtime. That's a shame because he really shows his feelings, that's what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used wisely, this could have been a more interesting piece and could be followed up with a sequel like in any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I do not think there will be a sequel to this casting, which will see De Niro and Murpy re-cast. ** out *****
