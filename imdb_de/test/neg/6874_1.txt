This movie has wasted my time. I only saw part of it and cried over the time I could spend doing something productive and useful towards this earth. For those who have seen this movie more than once, I blame them for global warming because not so many black balloons got out of this piece of crap, and if they were from another movie, I would forgive them Robin Williams lowered his standards to actually participate in this movie for more than 10 seconds, and Tim Robbins, as he went from this movie to the release of the Shawsank, I have no idea. Please do not watch this movie for Earth's sake. Stop firing black balloons out of a movie they should never have funded or published. Please burn all copies before others are allowed to see this crap.
