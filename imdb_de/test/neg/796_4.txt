Ha ha. - oh no - what should I say to this movie? Yes - green eggs and ham are more useful than this movie. Where do you start? Many good things have already been said - so I will not go to the same area. I think you already have the movie summary - so I will not rewrite the movie. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (like me), the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you - this is a movie that illustrates the question you've been talking about as a child on long car rides ( What if you had to choose one family member live, die another, or what if you had to die from drowning or fire?) This movie is a great concept - conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) The Wardrobe Group did a good job bringing us back to the 70s. How difficult is that realistic? ..... Okay, that's all for the better. Let's talk about the bad. <br /> <br /> 1). This movie feels like a 2-hour episode "Twilight Zone". This can easily be 90 minutes. That could have beaten the movie. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember the movie "From Dusk to Dawn"? The film got off to an interesting start, and after half the movie, he took a deterrent turn? Yes, the same here. I dare say that the authors started with a concept and then had no idea what to do with it. I've got deeper reflections from Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes, we get the dilemma in the movie. We understand the philosophical undertones and the utilitarian approach - but the story jumped way too much, ignoring the current story arc, and taking a totally offensive direction (forgiving). <br /> 4. The end made no sense. Not at all. None. <br /> <br /> This movie would be a great housework in the 101 college philosophy. If you are not up to your mind, sick in bed, or ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a cake, and you can see this free online offer - be sure to go for it. <br /> <br /> If you have to pay something to watch this movie, do not waste your time - you should look old Howie Almond is on You Tube. You get more philosophical stimulation to rearrange your sock drawer.
