I do not know how people can see that. The only people who enjoy it are those who have no feelings and emotions and like to see people die, burn homes, car accidents, babies die and cast members every week. It's the most absurd thing on TV and I still do not know how the ratings pull it. It is so depressing. I can imagine the writers sitting down and saying - "So who should we kill next week," or "Whose house will we burn in a month?" <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, absurd, and stupid thing on TV right now, and I can not understand people's motives when I look at that depressing pile of crap
