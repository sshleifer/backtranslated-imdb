About your horrible movie that copies Beethoven. As a professional musician, it is my duty to watch every film about every composer, and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, this is a horrible combination of cocky, empty emotions and the most unfavorable taste. You proved it in your horrible B-movie. The only thing that carries the movie is the music. Of course, you did not bother looking for good, but to my taste you produced the performances of the Tackacs Quartet, but OK, I have to admit that the performances have at least a quality different from yours different. It begins with the dying DEAF Beethoven, who perfectly understands Anna, who only whispers. Beethoven's hearing during the film is getting better by the minute, but that must be vague divine things. Then there's the rather unplastic, semi-pornographic "eyes wide-closed" dual-line scene, which in the end is overkill with juicy Anna and the weeping nephew (who weeps in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my god, what a performance) , And to crown the rip-off of Amadeus: Beethoven, Anna dictates music not in notes but in total nonsense, which she perfectly understands, but no one else in your audience will even understand trained professional musicians. Of course, your reaction will be that a negative answer is at least an answer, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is spinning in his grave for your worthless creation and reason. This so-called homage is blasphemy and I am so sorry that I rented one of the worst movies ever made, even though it's about my favorite topic. Ed Harris and others, you can not understand the greatness of Beethoven in your wildest dreams, and certainly not after a few lessons in conducting and violin playing. That's the problem with you Americans: They think you can understand everything, even if it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yes, we can do it anyway! Remember that a good product brings with it hard work, talent, dedication and professionalism. All these creators, to copy Beethoven, are lacking. See you in kindergarten.
