Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It is bizarre that they would cancel a well written program like "Arrested Development" and still keep this show and "War at Home". I have the feeling that Fox loved it, that they broke barriers with the then "Married with Children", but now it's just getting ridiculous. "The Loop" is a pointless and boring clock, and its annoying jokes just fall off. For the funny comedy to work, you need to continue the jokes. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because jokes keep flowing. Fox has to pull the heads out of the rectal cavities and give up that his relatives write this mediocre trip. I mean, if you invest money in something entertaining, make it entertaining. Stop using "no-named" actors. It's great to have newcomers, but you need to anchor a show with a well-known celebrity. Duh, Fox.
