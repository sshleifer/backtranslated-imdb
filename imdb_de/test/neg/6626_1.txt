Is this a bad movie? Do not take my word for it. Look at the following press reports from people who tried to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> · While watching this movie, Mr. Harold Faber's brain from Sandusky, Ohio, threw himself 200 km from his skull / h and went ahead to wind across the floor, yelling NOOOO NOOO NOOOO. <br /> <br /> Ms. Louise Robbins from Enid, Oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired housewife, committed with a butter knife ritual Seppuko This movie. <br /> <br /> · Ms. Janine Hosmer from Columbia, South Carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed baby during the movie, even though she was not pregnant. <br /> <br /> While watching this film, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells of San Francisco, California, spontaneously exploded with such force that Mr. Wells's left tibia later burst into the wall of a house in Marin County There were many similar incidents. <br /> <br /> Of those who did not have more serious effects, such as those described above, at least 75% became incurable, violent and understandably crazy after watching this movie. Of the remaining 25%, most were crazy before watching the movie. The rest was either blind and / or and numb or in a prolonged vegetative state. I'm not saying not to rent it if you want. I only report what was in the papers.
