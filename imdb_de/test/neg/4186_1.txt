My friends and I used to joke about movies being made in real time. But this movie is really ... you literally show 4 minutes of nothing but a guy digging with his hands in the dirt. It has no plot and an incredible amount of screams. I really do not think it has won a prize for its alleged tension. If you're like me and saw the first movie and loved it because of its terrible acting, accidentally funny insertions, and low-budget ness on all sides, it does not matter. This is so bad that bad memories even rub off and spoil any good memories of the original. You would be more entertaining if you were staring at a blank screen.
