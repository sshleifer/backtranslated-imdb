The plot of "The Stranger" somewhat reflects the 1969 film "Journey to the Other Side of the Sun" (by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson from "Thunderbirds" and "Space: 1999"). The earth of a parallel universe is the premise of both films. But there is a difference. While the world in "The Stranger" foresees a totalitarian regime to crush the freedom of the citizens, "Journey to the Far Side of Sun" merely showed a true mirror world, in the handwriting, streets, houses, machines of all kinds and much more Of course, the internal organs were in reverse (or mirrored) order. The similarity of parallel earths is thus the only connection of both films. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the TV series "Land of Giants" came before both films, which ran from 1968 to 1970, a world that was almost parallel to the earth, with the exception that the planet was inhabited by giants twelve times the size of the people who crashed there. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government to capture and contain the "little people" resembled the premise "The Stranger" more than the premise "JTTFSOTS". Maybe because of the similar to "LOTG" a series was set to "The Stranger". If it had turned into a television series, it would have been a sci-fi version of "The Fugitive," starring Glenn Corbett, hunted by the bad guys from week to week and hidden in various places. By the way, a stronger script could have helped this film.
