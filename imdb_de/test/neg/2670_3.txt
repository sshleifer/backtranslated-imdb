Avoid this! It's a terrible movie. What if it is very exciting? All it is are pointless murders. And the whole thing with Thorns and Michael's curse, that was the worst thing they could do with the show! Why could not they keep Michael's story secret? He should be the Boogeyman, not part of a stupid cult !! Pooh! Thank goodness for Halloween H20, which has extinguished Halloween 3-6! They all suck! But if you see this movie, please do not expect more than pointless murders and Gore.
