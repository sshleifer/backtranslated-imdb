I believe, how many people, that the 1989 Lonesome Dove was one of the best Western ever produced, may be THE best. When I realized that most sequels (in this case a prequel) will certainly disappoint, my expectations were low. This expectation filled Comanche Moon with his marginal direction and acting, bad casting and, frankly, a lousy script. <br /> <br /> Lonesome Dove created Western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call due to incredibly strong performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Before we lived in Lonesome Dove, we believed that they had fought bravely to liberate Texas from bandits and wild Indians during their eventful years. <br /> <br /> If I had just seen Comanche Moon, I would think these two boneheads were a few incompetent, cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae allegedly tracked Blue Duck across Texas and never managed to catch or kill him. In Comanche Moon, a shot on Call's boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise livestock. There was no decent fist or shooting contest in the entire miniseries. The best hit was McCrea Sucker, who beat Inez Scull, a funny scene but with no character for McCrae. Where was McCrae's wit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunken unshaven slob and a philanderer, was completely implausible. And Maggie's love for Call, a passionate and sullen loner, defies logic. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was excellent and superior to the original. Credit refers not only to the HD technology, but also to the cameraman. The Comanche Moon Miniserie was three nights better than anything on TV, but unfortunately that does not say much.
