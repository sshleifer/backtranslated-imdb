What a shame that a good talent was wasted. This is a boring and overly self-confident movie that could tell its story in half the time. Is that Derek Jacobi under this beard playing two roles? Gosh, who would have thought it. <br /> <br /> The emotional gain in the end was weak and unsatisfactory. Certainly not worth to endure the padded length of the film. I felt pretty disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sound was awful. First, they used stick music. Secondly, during the dialogue it was so loud that the words were difficult to understand. Only three sound crews and a trainee? The restresses included more people, either for the accounting department or the legal department. <br /> <br /> However, some of the camera work was pretty good and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Little time, at least for me.
