Watch this movie to really appreciate how good the original is. I am not difficult to please, but this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It hurt me because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Dyan Cannon. The writing was just awful! I thought Chevy at least got a lot better stuff than he did. There was hardly anything to laugh about in this film. I went in and wanted to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh but almost cried. <br /> <br /> In the starting points it read Chevrolet's Special Appearance. That worried me from the start. Chevy is actually more in it than I thought. It is more than a "special appearance". Too bad that the performance was nothing special. Mason's character would have been a good side character, but grown old as a lead actor. I would rather have seen more (much more) from Dyan Cannon. At least her character was fun, if not well written. I also missed the Gratuatis teen scene. Mr. Gopher turned sweet and innocent into a pesky rodent that deserved to be blown up. Jonathan Silverman is the only character who interested me, and we have not seen enough of him. I take it back. Try to watch half the movie, then ... remember Alamo, Maine and CaddyShack I.
