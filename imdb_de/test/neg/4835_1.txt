What annoys me the most critics after this movie is the mention of "originality". This film contains no innovative element. If you refer to "originality" to pathetic action scenes, overreactions, violence, dull humor and a script that goes beyond intellectual beliefs. "Originality" is something the Swedish film can do without. <br /> <br /> How Röse and Karlsson agree to "act" in this poor excuse for a movie is a mystery to me. And as Eva Röse can be seen after the emergence of this film at the breakfast TV, just disappoints me. <br /> <br /> This film has no story, the script is illogical, stiff and last but not least bad. These two young directors have put together a rather disgusting boy fantasy that includes violence, comic strips, and trivialized psychological portraits. I would not be surprised if the scene where DD masturbates in the kitchen during a microwave dinner is actually placed there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds who claim to be directors would not like this movie to my detriment Show enemy.
