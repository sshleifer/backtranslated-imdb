I admit that I like a lot of films that have low ratings on this page. I think that if I can see what the creators wanted, I can find appreciation for their work. Sound of Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see from which angles the filmmakers would tell the story. By and large, they have been trying to create an entertaining movie. The storyline was invented, but most actions of action movies are. Ed Burns does not know how to carry a rifle, but he's still good as an action lead, considering he's not in much demand. The main issue! Destroy the entire movie !, is the terrible CGI. It is absolutely unacceptable that the animals and backgrounds look so phony. Apart from that, the animal ideas could have been really good, as well as the action scenes, which failed because the production failed. This could have been a really memorable movie if they had just finished it. It really looks like they want to go back and repair all the horrible CGI, but they did not have any money left and released it anyway. Save your money because someone failed this movie. I give three stars because it could have been really good, but failed somewhere where I can not say enough.
