If something can be anything you want or meant, it has to be something special to someone. But just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may seem to one of us, or recall one battleship and another at the back of his aunt and yet another absolutely nothing but a cloud, this cloud does not make that meaning except Interpretation of the spectators.

A love affair with this film carries the same risk as a serious interpretation of Nostradamus.

But in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy; The movie really has no face. Color would help it burn though.
