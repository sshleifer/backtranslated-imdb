This movie almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> For beginners the wrong teeth. Then you discover a nice plastic or drawn set. To make it even more boring, the action is followed by a bright flash of light. Then the talking: The noise levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too quiet, never exactly as in good movies. It also reverberates so much that I think they had a microphone in the entire set. And to make matters worse, have you ever heard of stereo? When the camera changes, the sound is always centered. The actors speak as if they are reading from a blackboard behind the camera. And zooming into another scene, how terribly childish. <br /> <br /> The music is so poorly chosen that it never adds anything. It only destroys randomly generated excitement. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fight scenes ... my 3 year old niece would do a better fight scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even good for a laugh, it's just so bad ...
