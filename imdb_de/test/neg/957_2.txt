POSSIBLE SPOILER - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan. I was looking forward to seeing them together, being married, and I wanted to see their chemistry on screen. Okay, that is, I think the fact that they are actors, their off-screen relationship did not have to penetrate their performances, especially with this script. <br /> <br /> How stupid can a professor be to stick him to someone. I do not remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably tied to his lead actress, probably in an unavoidable way. If I was "connected" with someone, I would be pretty angry. The swarm I had would definitely disappear quickly. Meg did not even show a little annoyance, just a little surprise. Dennis had to kick and scream. The whole section of the movie was so awful - especially when Meg had to go to the bathroom (# 2) at night in the dark between dumpsters. Ewww. No shitty way! <br /> <br /> What about Dennis, who socks every single suspect in the movie? Sock ask questions first. Not once, not twice, but too often. I could have counted if I was so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie was Nick and his family drama. Too bad that it would not be out of action anymore. The supposed off-screen drama that led to this tragedy. I think it could have been written without distracting from Dex's quest. <br /> <br /> My fault lies with the writer of this script. Unless the director and the others have arranged it so much that it is unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> I will not even get into the real reason that poor Dex was murdered. How ridiculous that is. Even when Dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained (a true "Film Noir" moment), everyone on the screen seemed bored. Oh, _____ happened. Oh. (Yawning) "Dex even says that this is a stupid reason for a threefold murder Oh, the tension could be cut with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If there had been anyone else in the movie besides Dennis I have to give him 1/2 stars (just because I've seen really bad ones), but in this case 1 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> For Dennis and Meg stars, see EVERYTHING.
