The DVD for this film is from Alpha Video - a company that almost always produces the worst print quality. In the defense of Alpha, this is often the only pressure that specializes in public domain and cheap movies. If you can find another print from another company, try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded. Compared to most alpha DVDs, however, it's excellent - especially as the sound is pretty clear (and alpha never seems to contain subtitles - even with horrible sound). <br /> <br /> A man has met a lady for a very long time. One night he is a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon after, he comes in to his fianc√©e, she forgives him and they marry. Very soon after the wedding he receives a desperate call from the other woman - she needs him and to see him has just tried to kill himself. When they meet, he learns that she has a sexually transmitted disease, and she wants him to know that he too could have it now. Then, even though there is a nurse and treating her for her suicide attempt, she somehow finds a weapon and kills herself! That makes a HUGE mistake. He does not tell his doctor and he does not tell his new wife. It takes some time and now they and the baby are infecting! At this point, the doctor meets with the man and tells him how important it is to be treated, and they show him rooms that are filled with horribly infected people (actually, these were just films from people with sexually transmitted diseases, the they had spun into the movie - mostly) who have syphilis). <br /> <br /> In a way, the movie is very progressive. It's about a serious topic and it's interesting how the film encourages couples NOT to wait to marry, but to marry quickly and face these sexual urges - but only with each other (not with bad advice). On the other hand, the movie never says exactly what he's talking about. They never use the terms STD, VD or the like nor do they name the diseases. Often these are syphilis, but sometimes they are herpes or other sexually transmitted diseases - the information is simply not clear or specific - a very common problem with such films from that period. The viewers at the time were quite confused about what they saw, and many of the more naive ones probably needed some of their "faster" friends who had to explain everything to them! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "such films": In the 1930s and 1950s, many small and often sloppy production companies produced films that ignored the dangers of drugs and sex (though they often promise only a few things) (Cheese cake for spectators who normally could not see such a fast food in Hollywood movies). Many of them are hysterically funny because they are so over the top and the information is so inaccurate. The best known examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both from the same two-bit production company). Compared to the bad and stupid films of these two films, this cheap movie seems to be in the Criterion Collection !! Interestingly, there are insane out there (I would definitely be there) who enjoy watching the movies because they are often so bad and so awful that they are great fun. However, this is not so bad, nor is the message that has devoured, and the film of the victims is not as grotesque as in some similar films. While the message should be more explicit and useful, it's pretty good for a 1933 film, despite occasional bad acting and the ridiculous suicide scene. Remember children - just say "NO" to suicide! <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, the "two years of treatment" they're talking about in the movie were actually the norm for syphilis in 1933. Today it's much more treatable - as is the rest of the sexually transmitted Diseases.
