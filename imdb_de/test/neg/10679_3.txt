Just like the entire cast and crew know everything about filming. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the adventures and abuses of a modern cockney vampire assassin and an ancient spit with her seemingly blunted vampire lover. This plot smells of clich√©s and promises boredom when a movie like this is on such a small scale, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to say that I do not refuse films. It's B-movies, in fact, some of my favorite movies are B-movies like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but this one misses the mark a mile. <br /> <br /> Anyone familiar with small budget movies I know that acting is rarely exciting and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile brings a whole new dimension of hammer to the screen. Some of the so-called acting are simply indescribably bad, with characters spewing cheesy insets that fall flat, and the discourse expressing as much emotion and conviction as the Terminator does after a few sedatives for horses. <br /> <br /> Part of the film is also taken up by the vampire characters, especially the protagonist, who flutters unnecessarily with his mouth, showing their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. It literally has to happen in almost every scene at least once and quickly became annoying and pointless, as if those many open-jaw looks were supposedly used by creepy vampire faces to just fill a little time and fill up the rest of that shit sandwich of a movie. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what some other critics believe here, I believe that this film (especially the director) is really trying to take this movie seriously in many areas. The sheer number of too dramatic action shots and extreme close-ups seems to signal to me that the director really wanted people to legitimize this film and legitimize it for their genre rather than fake it, and it fails miserably. The attempts of supposedly tasteful sex scenes seem funny and stupid and the action sequences are sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> Also the end of this movie was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I've ever seen a movie, B-movie or not. When films like this force you to sit by yourself for hours, just to reward you with a "oh, it was all a game" ending, it actually ends up sick. The conclusion of the "conspiracy" feels like a reflection of the director, which he found out on the last day of shooting, because they had run to the end of their tightest budget. <br /> <br /> But I did not rate this movie as a star despite the overwhelming crappiness, and that's because of the only plus point I can really give this movie. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I'm pretty sure the parts I thought were humorous were not intentional, and I found most attempts at real gags unsuccessful, but when you look at them with friends, it's a good movie that turns out to be the Mickey can take out.
