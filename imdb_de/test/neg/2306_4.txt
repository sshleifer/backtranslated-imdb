Even though this film was nothing special in itself, I would like to comment on at least one factor that is decisive for its benefit - that of leading female actress Dyan Cannon. Despite the film's ridiculous story and what she's going through here, her best acting role in the film was what made the unbelievable seem more plausible. Her rough scene with the gay photographer David Hemmings has to be seen. Good job, Dyan.
