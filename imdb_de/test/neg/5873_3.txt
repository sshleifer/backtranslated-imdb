I bought this movie at a thrift store. Month ago, my friend told me about it when we talked about stupid movies that we saw. After discovering the tape, I knew I needed it. I saw it that night. I could say that it would be very cheesy and cheap. , , That drew me to it. I threw it in and laughed all the way through. I recognized Gregory (the iceman), but I could not recognize his name and could not remember where I had seen him. Later, while watching the Andy Griffith Show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) was shown extra as he is Ron Howard's (Opie Taylor) brother. I saw the credits and gasped. I turned to my mother, who also saw the show, and said, "That's the ice man !!" She gasped too. This movie is great, but only for laughter and criticism. It is the perfect example of a kitsch horror movie. If you want to laugh and enjoy low-budget movies, you can rent this video.
