Terrible I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you of this warning. I just finished the movie, by the way. <br /> <br /> I love good cross genre movies. This is not one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce or a religious action movie. I will see them all. But you can not just throw epigrammatic jokes on a hike, camp, Schlock horror festival and draw my applause. <br /> <br /> I love philosophical films. This is not one of them. Anyone who wonders how deep the mind is in this movie has not read a good book lately. Or ever. The "thought-provoking" dialogue is at best banal. Maybe it lost something in the translation. <br /> <br /> I love a good horror comedy. This is not one of them. Laugh! I thought I would never start! Winches Only if you try to find a polite way to express my feedback of the movie to the friend who recommended it. Rupert is inappropriately good in this movie, but even he can not revive him. I only wish he had shot the director instead, if the zombies. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the land from which The Inferno was born should be the occasion. Dante would turn in his grave.
