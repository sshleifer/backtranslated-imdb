I just saw it ... the story, the plot, the script makes absolutely no sense !! It is Samvise, the Brave Part 2 (without the RING), his characters appear out of the blue (for no reason), his Hercules are hated by everyone (nobody knows why), his Leelee Sobiesky shows her true talents (two of them), his crappy special effects, there are some good actors who waste their talents (did I mention the two talents of Leelee?) ... do I have to say more ??? ITS JUST AWFUL, also for NBC TV standards !!! It's just the lowest ... what a waste! By the way: How can you give these mini-series so many stars ????? It is beyond me! ... Shame on you! Need to make 10 lines, so this is my final word: AVOID, AVOID, if you are considering buying it!
