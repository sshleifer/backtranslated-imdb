I guess for 1961 this movie should be "cool", but in retrospect (45 years) its charm was as stupid as its entertainment value! Granted, the special effects work well on TV with the series, which started in 1964, but for the BIG screen. I once had an aquarium that was just as exciting! I have to agree with the Octopus scene near the end where she connected to the Seaview. Obviously not well presented ... or trained! All in all, it's pretty bad to play cheap cheap effects, and I still recommend it - for the fun of it all. This was probably one of Irwin Allen's biggest films, and I think he thought about it a lot. Barabara Eden played from then on "genius" at TVV. Micheal Ansara was her husband. That's a cool part about this movie! I have always enjoyed seeing the real husbands of husband and wife in the same movie. Neat!
