The problem with this movie is that it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not dramatic, it's not intriguing, it's not stimulating, it's not exciting, it's not exciting. Not even the smallest bit interesting. I recently watched this movie on tape and was glad I did not spend any money to rent it. It's basically a bad attempt to make movies. I will not even tell the story. History? Which story?
