Ron Hall faces a threefold threat as he writes, directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clich√©d cop-on-a mission, up to the neck in a nasty vampire action. He throws away his badge and looks for the last vampire hunter (no, not Buffy!) To take back the streets and beat the bloodsuckers to the grave. <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is a terrible movie. It rips off so many other movies (can you tell Blade?) That it never tries to make its own identity. The script does not exist. The action is terrible. Who says a micro budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing here that is interesting even remotely. You will not get any of it except headache. Stay away at any cost.
