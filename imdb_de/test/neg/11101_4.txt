After putting a mummy in a local museum, the Cat-Scan goes through a metal object in its brain negative to the procedure, freeing the ghost or phantom, if you like, from the mummy Belphegor. Due to practical circumstances, Lisa, who lives near the museum, is possessed by the evil spirit. Soon she steals the Egyptian treasures of the museum under the nose. Detective Verlac retires to catch the supernatural thief. <br /> <br /> This is a useful problem if you have not seen any other incarnations of "Belph√©gor" yet. If so, I recommend skipping this particular version as it can not fade in spite of the nice locals and the scenery compared to the others. It runs like a (slightly) budgeted sci-fi original movie, and I prefer that's a compliment. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sophie Marceau showing ass & nipples <br /> <br /> My degree: C- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: none
