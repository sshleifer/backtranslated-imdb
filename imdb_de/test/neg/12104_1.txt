... from this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this was shown at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy had no subtitles, so I asked the festival teams if there was a problem with the print they received. "Not so ..." I was told. "The director wants it that way". <br /> <br /> Sorry, my French is hardly a secondary elective (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the initial dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I've missed the nuance and many details between my understanding of some key words. <br /> <br /> I rated this as "1", mainly because of the irony of a director who once worked as a subtitle, refusing to put subtitles into a movie that can be seen by an American audience. Excuse me, even though most Americans would not know where Europe was on a map, not even the audience of a film festival should know "the mother tongue" of a particular movie. Even if some of us can not speak Finnish, I would still expect subtitles for the few "dolts" that are not mature enough to have knowledge in the 37 different languages. I will accept this ego from David Lynch, not from Litvack.
