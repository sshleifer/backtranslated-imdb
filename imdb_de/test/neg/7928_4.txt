For a film that was mostly seen in 2004 in his native South Korea, this was a big disappointment. Shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can shoot emotional, melodramatic films. The movie was over 130 minutes long, but actually, not much happened and everything that happened was what you expected, the plot was so transparent. If you were Korean yourself, you might get involved more, but it did not do much for me. Suffice it to say that the case, as is customary in Korean cinema, revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit and train an elite murder squad of death sentences to kill Kim Il-Sung. <br /> <br /> A boring conspiracy does not bother me if the characters are good, but unfortunately this is not the case this time either. They are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often simply exaggerated, as is common in Korean cinema. Too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the figures remain far away, one-dimensional cardboard cuts. They should have spent more time establishing the characters and showing us less how hard and cruel the training and the soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing we remember is that a lesser of two mistakes is still wrong.
