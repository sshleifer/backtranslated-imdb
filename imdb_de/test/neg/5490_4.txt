This film is on very familiar ground - the confusion of art and reality in the lives of actors. It has nothing particularly new or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather boring. In particular, the final scene is endlessly boring. When I saw the audience crying in the "moving" acting that they see on screen, I asked, "Who do you think they are joking about?" Nevertheless, there are some good performances and interesting scenes, especially from some of the minor characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor who slaps a whole bunch of police officers who arrest him. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken plays an exaggerated wacko again. Remember Saturday Night Live's character "The Continental"; An aging Eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her to bed? He makes an identical turn in the film by chasing his young (male) prey at an antique table and filling it with champagne. Overall this movie was both charming and irritating, but mostly irritating.
