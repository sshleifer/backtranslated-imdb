Oh boy! I really devastated Manhunt in space. I think that this flopper is rightly rated worse than Manhunt. There is nowhere to go and the growth of mushrooms was more exciting than this tripe. <br /> <br /> Poor Cleolanta. She is so misunderstood. Smug Rocky wanders around and fortunately Winky does not mention anything about his "gay nightlife". There is much more talk, a really terrible (for observation) space marriage on the rocks and crappy room cutouts. Then there's Bobby. You decide who annoys more: Bobby or the Winkster? Personally, I would throw them out of an air lock into a black hole before they eat them killer meat and eat foreign mutants. <br /> <br /> At least there is vena. She is just a cosmic girl!
