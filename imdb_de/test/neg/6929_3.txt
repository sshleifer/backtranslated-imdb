I loved the book "A Little Princess" most of my life and was very excited that there was a movie. But I was appalled by this adaptation. The drama is not all wooden and the plot is a confused mish-mash of various incidents in the book, but the subject is wrong. The real theme of the story should be that a girl can only be a princess if she acts like one, as Sara does when she gives a beggar 5 of her 6 rolls, even if she is very hungry herself. The theme of the movie seems to be that all the girls are princesses, which greatly reduces Sara's actions, and is more likely to be on a Hallmark card than applied to this story. <br /> <br /> There are many others The things in this film are wrong - too many to list, but here are just a few of the bigger ones: this story should be played in the mid-19th century in Britian, not in the UK First World War in America. Miss Minchen is hard on Sara right from the beginning, and if Sara remains destitute, her actions will be less exciting than if she were syrupy sweet at first, as she should be. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father is not coming back, he's dead. It's his closest friend and co-worker in the diamond mines that Sara finds and restores to her in the right place. In fact, the diamond mines are not mentioned at all, even though they are the source of Sara's wealth. <br /> <br /> In everything Sara faced, she always behaves like a princess who gives everything she can. and forgive those who hurt them. She would never have called Lavinia a "snotty, two-faced tyrant." Such a thing is completely atypical for her and undermines the entire philosophy that she should behave well, no matter what. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen I've ever seen (with the notable exceptions of "Ella Enchanted" and "Anne of Green Gables the continuation of the story") The plot of the book is wonderfully and skillfully written, so I do not understand why the director considered this necessary to make it interesting. I would suggest that anyone who wants to know this story should see the 1987 version, which is far superior. Or better yet, read the book. It will be worth more time than wasted an hour and a half for this version of the movie.
