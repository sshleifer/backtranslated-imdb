Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. An absolutely good guy like Antonio Sabato Jr and nothing but an embarrassing drip from his mouth. I collapsed at 95% of the dialogue! It would have been better to mute the figure! How Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare could speak these lines without losing control of physical functions is not me! If the character of Michale Pare had prefixed or ended just another sentence with the word "men", I would probably have thrown the iron through the TV (I love multitasking - especially to get through bad movies). It was a lousy year for both to sign up for this movie. Washing your livelihoods would probably look pretty good now. And the bad guy ... if he was that bad, why was not he just shooting all those rich college kids, instead of promising toilet breaks. Even the title was a misnomer. A "crash landing" means that the plane actually crashes and can not only land without causing a sign fire or anyone being injured. Instead of landing safely, the plane would have crashed and burned just like the script. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS A STINKER!
