I have nothing else to say but no time to lose !!! The film had nothing exciting, funny, dramatic or romantic !!! The film had nothing exciting, funny, dramatic or romantic !!! The film had nothing exciting, funny, dramatic or romantic !!! The film had nothing exciting, funny, dramatic or romantic !!!
