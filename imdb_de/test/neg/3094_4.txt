"crazy six" is directed by albert pyun in his inimitable terrible but strangely hypnotic style and is another jewel in the crown of upscale hugo haas (jess franco?) of this decade. "Stylish" overload, incoherent plotting, timeouts in the middle of action sequences for Eurodisco torches - all this seems to be characteristic features for our man Pyun. Most interesting is that he always gets top b-movie performers compared to Wynorski or some other video directors. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles and the very strange Burt Reynolds are not a bad cast, though they often look a bit confused. Check out "Postmortem", "Mean Guns" & "Omega Doom" for more first class Pyun chaos!
