The movie begins when we see footage of a huge drought in America in the 1930s. Then a short story about a scary-looking farmer Elijah is shown, who has made a deal with Satan to get a good harvest. Elijah hired young men to work in his garden, killed them, and used them as scarecrows. He also fed the soil with her blood. Some time later, 2 policemen came to visit him. One of them is shot by Elijah, another kills the farmer himself ... Then the day is shown, and a man named Sean is said to have an old farm as his inheritance. He decides to go there with some friends to see what's going on. Little did Sean know that the next night is the "Payback Night". <br /> <br /> For me, this movie had a good story for a horror movie, but the low budget and bad special effects just ruined it. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of lazy films. For example, we see a scarecrow (an ordinary guy with a funny, cheap mask) chasing a girl. When he raises his hand, we see a normal human skin under his glove, rather than some rotten flesh. The Gore is not very impressive either. There are some nasty kills by our "beautiful" scarecrows, but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Surprisingly, the drama in this movie is a bit OK, or better said, it's believable. Some nude scenes are also presented to the fans (even a lesbian scene), but these scenes do not save it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good music, good story, solid acting. But awful effects, cheap gore and plotting holes slow this movie down. Not really recommended.
