By the mid-1970s, my NYC had apt. The building was finally wired for cable TV and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel to show the latest movies, I signed up for it. As a writer and night owl by nature, I soon discovered that the station was showing films late at night and I had never heard of it until the early hours of the morning - most of them were American independent films and foreign films that have never been there a US theatrical version was released. Many of them had recognizable "star" castes and respectable directors, and thanks to Showtime, I discovered many first-class films that I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never have seen before. Most of these cinematic hybrids were "dogs," but often so bad that they were unintentionally funny. One night, Showtime unveiled a small Italian-made gem called "Redneck" (shot in 1972, given a limited European release in 1973). Although the film has never been released in the US, the MPAA rating was rated "R". Since the director is a Sylvio Narizzano (the director who has made a name for himself with the glorious "Georgy Girl"), and the three main roles Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas were I decided to give it a try. And found me 89 minutes in disbelief nailed to my TV screen. As far as I can remember, Savalas and Testi played two criminals, the former an angry madman, who killed a German family in a scene of ravaging stomach by knocking their followers against a cliff and into the depths the wilderness crashed. So far, so bad. Then, out of nowhere, Testi (as the "nice" psycho) and Lester (all 14 when the movie was filmed) are both seen naked in a men's room. Testi sneaks into the child's body while shaving and arms confused Lester fixes on close-ups of Testis bare bottom. As a not yet jaded member of the film industry and Libertarian with a card (I was as opposed to censorship as I am today), the whole movie made me uncomfortable (and when I thought, early 70's) I had it all in the Dings movies of this one liberated era - including the uncut version of Altman's "That Cold Day in the Park", a real madness drop, until he was rated and spelled "R" The end for Altman's career would not have been next with something called "M * Come up with A * S * H ​​". I still wonder if anyone but me has ever seen "Redneck" and was horrified when it was me. It is a pleasure to throw the actors and the cinema visit in the trash, and it is a pleasure that unadapted filmmakers have happily surrendered since the beginning of time. But he has a highly respected and talented child actor (Mr. Lester) at a time when he was performing the difficult child-to-adult actor transaction (and I'm sure his film offerings have come to rotten rubbish like "Redneck"). ) ... Mr. Narizzano, you should hang your head in shame. (By the way, I should soon befriending actors who had appeared in the future of Narizzano, and without any special efforts, both despised him. )
