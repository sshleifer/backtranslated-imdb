An antique shopkeeper in New York, played by Joanne Whalley (Valerie Alston), is being tried in a US district court. The trial of a well-known mafioso Armand Asante is being carried out by Pirone, trying to get Whalley acquitted of murder by threatening to kill her son and herself. There follows a lot of action, with cruel mob-rub-outs, which spread with Willam Hurt as a mediator. Much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, court scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an end that's unbelievable. 3/10 is probably gentle on this waste of time.
