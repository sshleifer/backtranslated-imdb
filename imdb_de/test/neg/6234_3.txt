I'm sorry, but I do not understand how the studio gets away with it. The movie is just not worth it. Maybe as a play, but certainly not as a movie! And why do they call it a thriller? Acting is good, but I did not expect anything else from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe convinces as Softy "Bad Guy". Helen Mirren can play almost any role and still looks beautiful to me;). I'm also a fan of her British detectives. Nevertheless, they can not save this boring movie, I'm sorry. I hope we do not get many more films from this director "Pieter Jan Brugge" because he obviously does not have the meaning of the words "suspense and thriller".
