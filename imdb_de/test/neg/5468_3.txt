Here are some paragraphs from an essay I wrote about TBOR for the university. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation is an erotic thriller about sex, power and the struggle of a talented dancer to regain his self-esteem, but unfortunately raped by three disguised women: The three women who hurt him have striking body tags, one has a huge birth mark on the buttocks, another a butterfly tattoo in the abdomen and the ring runner has a small circle so he lives his new life in search of these markings and to find them in these intimate places, he does that, What every sensible man does when he has to see as many naked women as possible to solve a puzzle, he has sex with them One hour and ten minutes after the movie, and you feel like you've had almost every woman in Melbourne <br /> <br /> The film is a huge part of presumptuous celluloid, it's as if Grandiloquence is dribbling from everyone. Only at one point does Kok Ki do the final climax of the films nos give a scene the same energy and power as their debut feature, Head On. Like many state-funded films, the film takes itself seriously, so the script and its performance appear more as a gift than a gift, and unfortunately for the talented Thespians, their brilliant performances (especially Tom Long as a broken protagonist ) are stuck within the confines of a pompous Wan k festival.
