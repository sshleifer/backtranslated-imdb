I had been looking forward to watching this movie for weeks just because I was very disappointed after the stations. In my opinion, the only good thing about 'River Queen' was the amazing scenery as background. The storyline was everywhere, Sama's character Sarah was very hard to understand and what were the many close-ups of her face? It would have done absolutely nothing to the story - if there was one! A better actor for Boy could also have been selected. What a pity, because it could have been such a good movie.
