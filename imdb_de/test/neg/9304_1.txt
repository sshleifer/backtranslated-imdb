This is undoubtedly the worst movie ever, and Schindler's list actually had more laughter. This does not just say how little fun this movie has and how great the SL is, considering it's heartbreaking and contains a laugh. I wish I could meet "Yahoo Serious" so I could personally throttle him for this and all the other, very, very, very bad movies he's ever been in. There are very few things to say about Australia as they like that stupid fruit Do not get me wrong, the people (Mel Gibson) from Australia are great, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very angry that people like this garbage (A report I just read said it was "very funny", morbid, not true). Personally, I'm going to boycott this movie and will petition online to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious films, and that's what I underline, says RETARDED. <br /> <br /> These are just my personal thoughts. No doubt, they are shared by everyone who has seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: If you need to watch this movie in the Clockwork Orange style, call me to lull you into it for free.
