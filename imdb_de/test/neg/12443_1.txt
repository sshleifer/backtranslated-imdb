My mother brought me this movie on a DVD. A guy in the rent has recommended it. But, in fact, this could be the worst movie I have ever seen. You know, I did not expect much from this movie, but it did not have a good story, it was not even funny and it was pointless. I was looking forward to seeing Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved step by step. Even she was a big disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the party guys is dead (in fact he was not dead, he woke up later), the house looks like a bomb had exploded, and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to get it done. But then comes a homosexual, a policeman ... There is a total mess until the end and the boys have managed to bridge everything in about 15 minutes. Come on, be realistic at least. Waste of money. Really...
