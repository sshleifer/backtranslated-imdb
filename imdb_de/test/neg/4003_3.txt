Predictable, unmotivated, pointless cartoons Bred actors did what they could. Actors clearly stated that they were embarrassed not to do so. No emotional connection. REAL SEQUENCE FROM THE FILM "Who do you call?" (sic) "The police" (sic) "You can not do that, Stevie, stop listening" (sic) "Jesse has a lot of money for drugs, you can not be involved with the cops" (sic) "I'm not like that sure, stealing money from criminals is a crime, and even if they arrest him, he will at least be alive. " (sic) "Listen to me, Stevie, this is not handled properly, Jesse will end up dead in the end. Now hang up." (sic) Best Friend Begins to Load Guns Brother, "Hey, what are you doing?" No Answer. "Hey, I have a family to worry about." (Remember that his child is sitting there watching everything closely.) Then more and more exposure. <br /> <br /> Note that at no point in the order above does the police say on the other line, "Hello? Hello, Uh, we can hear everything you say, we're just sending someone there." <br /> <br /> Embarrassment for everyone. Oops.
