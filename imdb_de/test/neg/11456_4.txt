This movie is outdated in many ways, it is sensational. You can either laugh about it or shake your fists in anger. <br /> <br /> This film deals with many of the problems of American history, but with the typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: this I-can-do-everything-and-you-me-for-me -for-it-somehow-of-guy. He is so pompous and must never be taken seriously. What a terrible creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the film and a still very whiny but stronger character at the end. Too bad that she still forgives him his bold way after leaving her for the second time. It's just sad that the character has not changed at all. Although she ends up as a strong and independent woman, she is consumed by concern for her adventurous husband. So 2 out of 10 of the feminists among us (and that's just for the good intentions ...)! The problem of Indians' repression is solved quite well, but there is again this condescending narrative. And the fact that all African American characters are the typical stereotypes makes the movie even more hypocritical. I was so angry most of the time! So a point (to try) from the civil rights movement. <br /> <br /> I know the movie was shot at another time. I love old movies and have a lot of patience with some of these dated views. But that was just disgusting! <br /> <br /> What saves this movie are the parts without the main character. The acting of Mr. Dix is ​​exaggerated and complacent. Maybe that's why his character is so unpleasant ... I liked Mrs. Dunne's performance, even though her character sometimes infuriated me. <br /> <br /> But I have to say, the famous land noise scene was amazing. And the way the Oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the movie worthwhile. It's just amazing how civilization emerged from the dirt and dust of the 19th century. And I do not understand the problem that some have with this church scene. I found it pretty funny and amusing. Maybe it should not be, but I liked it. So 9 points for these scenes and the impressive history of the development of the state of Oklahoma. That makes a total of about 4 points!
