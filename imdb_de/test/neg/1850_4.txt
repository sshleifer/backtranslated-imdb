Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and treats the main points to the film. Nevertheless, it is again a difficult movie to buy in the UK. I had to go through "Midnight Video" with a Swedish branch. I went to the post office and bought this and a similar title by mail order only at SKR30. This movie will hang out among many aka's, depending on when and where it's being marketed. I had "The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance" (what you find when you search Imdb under "People" and enter "Krista Nell"). The actor who plays the count on his private island in the last film had dubbed his words. I'm being translated into English by an actor with a voice that's unmistakably sad and rather tired. I smiled as I heard the same voice on the English soundtrack as the police inspector investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the film in question. Of course, I opted for another trip on the d elicious Krista Nell. <br /> <br /> There are rather inconsistent film deals that include blackmail, dodgy affairs with the mothers of girlfriends, a motorcycle hunt that leads to a gangland attack "customers" motorcyclists, dingy photography, cross-border Dressing of transvestites etc., which give this film, which is summarized in a word, a special touch not without explaining where and why it is. Personally, I thought there were too many negotiations and not enough in the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters. Also a professional film The editor was urgently needed, as some scenes seemed to take much too long and made their point clearly, so that the film in some places seemed to be dragging. e.g. The scene of the dancing transvestite. Krista Nell appears in a fruity scene with a client, but this is just a vignette, and I wanted more of her, the director, and the script. <br /> <br /> I love the political impropriety shown in older films (this is 30 years after they were made), z smoking in offices and the way some characters in the office react to each other! I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and rated it as such.
