That's just awful. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I've seen this filth. I think it should be a comedy, but I can not remember having laughed much except for a few obvious inconsistencies and blatant errors. <br /> <br /> An unappealing middle-aged man named Lester meets richly unattractive middle-aged women over lone heart advertising, and she murders her for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. That's the whole plot, and that's really all that happens. Along the way, there's an attempt of intrigue as Lester begins to receive calls from a mysterious stranger who insults him for his knowledge of his secret, but it's so poorly implemented that you may not realize what is supposed to happen. The sequences in which Lester murders the wealthy widows are all pretty brutal, but they also appear to be disguised as comedies. In a sequence, a woman was hit with a wooden pole and then pushed into an oven. It is very cruelly portrayed, but it is played against thunderous big-band waltz music, with Lester faces pulls and uses comedy poses. Another scene has murdered the victim while she's always singing shrill opera songs ... you have to see that to believe it! Actually - you do not have to see it at all, I strongly recommend that you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing, and there is no indication of the flair of his earlier career. One sequence was particularly miserable: The Revelation, when Lester suddenly realizes that he has no shadow. Fulci does not seem to envision a visual representation of these phenomena on screen, so he only films the actor as normal, as a shadow and as a whole !! And so the whole angle blows totally. Either he had a zero budget for effects, or he simply did not care to think of a way to show it. Whatever it was, that should give you an idea of ​​how lame this whole project is. I could not understand most of the film, and there was certainly nothing on the screen worth looking at half the time. Even the end was as flat as a pancake. A real guy.
