Do not choose this. **** Spoiler Alert ***** The plot of this annoying bad movie is that four friends take the shuttle from the airport from a very eager driver. On the shuttle with them is a more militant-looking business type. <br /> <br /> Shortly after their journey, the driver of the shuttle takes a descent and some crazy drivers try to run them off the road. The end result is that they get a flat tire. The driver uses the shuttle to pick up one of the people to make the tire change and the car slip, and the boys' fingers are clamped between the tire and the shuttle. At this point, the driver reveals himself as a kidnapper, and he has taken all humans hostage. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is getting extremely slow and boring as the characters do one lame thing after another. One of the men is killed in an escape attempt - even if he lacks the tension. Finally, it reveals that the milksack business associate is in contact with the driver when the milksack toast guy kills the other male friend by slicing his neck. <br /> <br /> There are a few escape attempts of the women. Milk toast is hit over the head with a tire iron - but it survives. <br /> <br /> The driver is also beaten and somehow survives a head upon impact with a high-speed fence while kneeling beside the steering wheel. Somehow he did not go through the window or was seriously injured in a collision with the windshield. But the woman who drives the shuttle is unconscious - but she had a steering wheel to protect her, and he had nothing between him and the windshield. He is finally able to subjugate the women and make them an underground car park, which is a front for trafficking. One of the women is killed. The other pushes the driver into the leg with a rather large broken mirror and shoots him / her in the head. However, he is capable (in a severely weakened state - severe blood loss, two head injuries and a large leg cut) to pull her out of the shuttle, drag her into a large box, throw her in and close her while she fiercely fighting him. <br /> <br /> Now some people are admiring the news of the movie about trafficking and how it is going today. That's a serious problem. However, turning an extremely boring film about the subject does not justify a higher rating.
