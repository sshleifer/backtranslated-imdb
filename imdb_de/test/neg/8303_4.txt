A true Gothic Horror Trash Classic! <br /> <br /> Um, actually it's a horrible movie. Best of all: Rosalba Neris bare nipples. Intensely absorbable material. Oh, Rosalba Neri is a fine woman. I've never heard of her, but she's a damn fine lady. But honestly, it was her nipples who did it for me, in this last scene, before the movie ends abruptly, all naked and erect ... Total dream nipples, man. Okay, excuse me to get carried away ... <br /> <br /> Basically I got from LADY FRANKENSTEIN what I expected: it's a dark and terrible streak with a stupid Frankenstein monster and a stupid ugly monster a few naked tits. And in it is a castle. So I was not really disappointed or anything. In some places it was just too high (the first resurrection of the creature lasted forever, with Papa Frankenstein just experimenting, talking and trying something else). However, there was a funny, feeble-minded tribute to the original Frankenstein: Instead of throwing a little girl into a lake, Mongoloid Franky took a naked chick here and threw her into a river. It made me laugh. <br /> <br /> But some of my friends raved about this movie a bit too much. Maybe I expected a bit too much. But Rosalba's erect nipples were well worth it ... (Aw shit, I really must stop mentioning her nipples). I think I will finish this user comment now.
