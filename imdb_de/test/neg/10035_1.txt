If someone tells you that this picture is just great, then you probably have something to do with it, whether you make it or profit from it. This film is a real loser, copying horror movie situations on a big budget, not to mention soundtracks. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. It's a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like it was filmed for a movie contest. The acting is awful and it would not surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw scriptwriter. My family laughed about it. A species ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You will not be afraid of this. Here's a little taste of the horrible elements of this movie. When the guy gets kicked by Ric White's stupid depiction of Reverend James Johnston's cane. The boys react like an amputation without painkillers. Watch the DVD Extras after watching the movie. If you see Ric White and others talking so seriously about the movie, you'll laugh until your stomach hurts. How people stretch the truth and what they do to make dishonest money. Do not be fooled like us and buy this failure.
