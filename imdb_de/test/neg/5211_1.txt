How on earth did these guys get money to shoot this movie? The lack of scripts is one thing, but cinematography makes you want to cry. A handheld camera can be very valuable to the look of a movie, but in this case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. I am aware that the actors are amateurs, but it is not a defense, as the director may be the least talented director in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry if he (or anything in the team) gets money to make a movie again and again. This film simply adds to the argument that too many films are shot in Sweden every year.
