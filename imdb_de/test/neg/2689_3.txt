The discussion was held a thousand times. Is the "Merchant of Venice" anti-Semitic? (I think so.) Is not it unfair to always show this little anti-Semitism in an otherwise great work of art? (I think that's not it.) Does this piece affect Shakespeare's reputation as the world's greatest playwright? (I think it does.) Does it matter if he does not do it for a specific racist purpose? (I do not think so.) Michael Radford knew all that, so he added a prologue to his film about the miserable situation of the Jews in Renaissance Venice. <br/> <br/> In vain; Because the piece remains what it always was, and the new make-up gives only a first (but futile) hope that someone has dared to correct something that remains a permanent outrage, not because its anti-Semitism would be particularly shocking but because The play comes under the name of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time showing the hatred of a man - Shylock? Why hire a great and reputable actor like Al Pacino when, in the end, ruined in that vile court scene (but hey, I'm not a responsible Shakespeare-wrote-it) court scene. And now I want to be very specific, just like Shylock himself. <br /> <br /> He claims his right, according to the contract that the - not very responsible - Christian Antonio, who always looked, is on, signed in fully aware of the consequences. Sure, what Shylock demands is cruel and useless, but that's not the point. What we see (or should see) is a man who has been degraded all his life to the point where all that is left of him is his hatred. I think it is certainly a bit inappropriate to teach such a man about things like compassion. <br /> <br /> But what the piece / movie (they are now one and the same) at this point is .. will be a soap opera! The cruel lunatic with his knife, the shocked (but rather shortsighted) audience, the poor "victim" tied to his chair. Antonio accepts his fate, but why can not he just say a word, "Excuse me?" I think we do not need to say much about the ridiculous judgment of the young Dottore from Padua. It is a truly "popular judgment" that does not differ materially from what would be seen 400 years later in Nazi show trials. From one minute to the other, this Jew is deprived of all his possessions, sentenced to Christian baptism and thrown out. <br /> <br /> Is not that outrageous ??? Obviously not. The story goes on to the romantic subtleties of the rings and their happy ending. <br /> <br /> What you can learn in the Libeskind Jewish Museum in Berlin and other similar places around the world is that anti-Semitism often goes unnoticed by the masses because of what minority or some individuals do is devastating, embedded in the alleged greater good for the majority. It should be exactly the task of each of us to develop a sensitivity to recognize and unmask such tendencies. <br /> <br /> I do not accept the excuse that this movie was made to create empathy with the ill-treated Shylock (it just does not work) I do not think anyone can be forced to be merciful. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie. especially not for an Oscar.
