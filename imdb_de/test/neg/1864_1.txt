This is one of the worst movies ever made. I can not believe how bad it was. I was shocked by the terrible masks of the "ghoulies". They are obviously Halloween masks! The mouths do not even move when they talk !!!!! Why did you feel the need to make the ghoulies funny and stupid? Whenever they do something, this circus-style music seems to drown out the BONK and BOING sounds when they meet people. The Bondage Domina Lady is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. This movie is just bad. The action is not present. The mother of ONE TREE HILL is in this case and obviously has a nasal job since this was done. Why did the main character of the first film return to do this trash? BATH BATH BAD movie.
