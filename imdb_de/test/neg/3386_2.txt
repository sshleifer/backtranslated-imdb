Have heard some good remarks about this movie as very bloody and anxious, but that is not the case. Obviously, the scriptwriter wanted to make a scary horror movie while inflicting teenage comedy on the young audience. Fear and comedy rarely lead to good films, the same goes for MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> Not really funny, on another level weird or overly enjoyable age I have seen my share of horror movies. I've seen good and horrible, but the harvest of the films released these days is so frighteningly mediocre that I'm bored watching them. The acceptance of these bad movies these days really annoys me. Let's face it, they made a lot of crap in the 70s, 80s and 90s, but they were considered as such at the time. Today they are considered "good entertainment". - Bollocks!
