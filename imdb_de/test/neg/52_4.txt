Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), a haunting cult icon, is dying of heart trouble (not until he was shocked by a thankless assistant and a commercial director who insulted both with insults). His body is taken out of his mausoleum by some movie students (they want to "invite him for dinner" ... they are pretty big fans). What these children (including a young Jeffrey Combs) do not expect is that Radzoff will be revived by a medium to cause chaos on those who have removed him from his resting place. <br /> <br /> The List of Violent Acts belongs to Radzoff, who pulls out a man's tongue, sets a woman on fire, raises a coffin, crushes a woman's face, decapitates a fellow, and another fellow in a coffin burns. A really funny soundtrack and annoying fog surrounds Radzoff's scary activities. <br /> <br /> Silly Hokum of Troma is limited by a very, very low budget and a slow pace. The movie feels much longer than it is. The movie is not really that bloody and we can barely see violence because the movie is often too dark. Sometimes Radzoff is a menacing presence, but sometimes he just looks stupid.
