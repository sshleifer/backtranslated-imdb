Was that a comedy? The black cape and the skeleton mask are funny. It gives like a null representation. The film begins with an archaeologist and his assistant. You mention briefly that their excavation site is cursed. And then, look ... in Halloween Costume Man's Drop, dressed in the shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask face and an ax. So he kills these two people. Then we go into the woods with a bad imitation of Predator, only the commands are hunted by Halloween Costume Man, who is now riding a horse! More commands appear, but these people are supposed to disguise themselves as a walking group. Yes, the production of the command costumes probably went out. Can you say, low budget? Anyway, they meet a single old Indian who sits in the forest. He is just too funny. And he's starting to babble about something, but you really do not know what he's mumbling about, so they're flashing at some Indians who are being killed. None of that really makes sense. And then we go back to our commandos, where more of them are killed. And that's basically the plot. It's so ridiculously bad that you just can not look away because you want to see how deep it sinks. You can make the same movie with a camcorder, a Halloween costume, and a bunch of your friends with fake weapons. Do not see this thing if you want a horror movie. If you want a comedy, maybe? Or just skip and get something like the real Predator.
