I was also a wife of an abusive husband, although in my situation the attacks were psychic and not physical. To each one who saw us together, he offered a very respectable, responsible and generous personality, which unlike me, made others treat me as boring and unstable. At first I was so flattered that even someone like Gus (who worked in a bank and was very confident) even gave me the time of day, and I totally came up with the idea of ​​him and not the person he was. If I had my head open and got to know him much better, I would not have married him in any case. That is my mistake. It was not my fault to be abused. I did not deserve that, and I did not see it coming until I became entangled in thinking, criticism and isolation. He behaved as if I did not have a business that had a different opinion from him - in fact he kept going. If I did not agree with that, he assumed I had misunderstood and simplified his wording more and more. When I finally lost my self-esteem, I was unable to recognize my predicament, and I had to be torn into reality by outside influence. My dad said Gus called me a slut. Well, it took half a year for the anger that set in at that moment to finally explode, and I grabbed a few things while he was at work and left. .. and it took a few months before I could grasp the fact that I had been mistreated and that it was not my fault that he did the things he did. ..... So please, whoever assumes, it is the guilt of the victim, THINK !!! If a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner, if he has an accident on the carpet in a worried situation, will you blame the puppy? By the time the abuse in a relationship has reached an obvious violent level, the target of the abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized (as in Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to judge the circumstances accurately, because until Then the victim believes all the terrible things the culprit spat out. Have a heart, people. Calling victims' victims stupid idiots is like stepping on someone who has already been badly beaten. -------> and that helps how ???
