I was expecting a documentary about the Sci-Fi era from 1950 to 1965 and got a big old commercial with a left-wing political allusion by James Cameron and a movie-mogul baby boomer who pushed his own works forward. "Watch the Skies" in the past referred to the 1950's "Giant Bug" and "Space Exploration" films, including favorites like "Earth Against the Flying Saucers", "Thing from Another World" and "Forbidden Planet" B "Them", "Deadly Mantis" and "Tarantula". There are examples of the lower budget that are rarely mentioned, such as "Space Monster," "12 to the Moon," and "Cosmic Man." <br /> <br /> This would have been a much better documentary if the few remaining actors, directors, stuntmen and collectors, as well as the non-Hollywood boomers from that time were interviewed. I just wish there was a "0" rating, as a "1" deal is too generous.
