1) If you want to shoot a movie that deals with social realism, it is very important that the audience identifies with the depicted characters. 2) The audience can not identify with characters that are very stereotyped or with situations that are too obvious. 3) If you have a bad actor, you can not build a character. Even if you get nice actors, their work becomes ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictional Andalusian accent. Jes√∫s Ponce ignores these 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of the game place. His script is so predictable: a woman comes out of jail, she meets his old junkie friend, life is hard, etc. Whatever, the fact that the story is anything but original would not be so bad if Not only Ponce would not be complete incompetent writing and filming. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long they will spend on our taxes to make films like this. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 3/10
