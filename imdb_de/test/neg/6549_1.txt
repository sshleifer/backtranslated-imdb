The only positive thing that comes to mind about this decayed piece of garbage is that I finally have a good answer when someone asks me how the worst movie I've ever seen was called it was so tiring to be able to see it better ... much more effort and it could even have been brilliant. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I can not believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented. <br /> <br /> Making the film completely unbearable must have been the point. <br /> <br /> Everything else just does not make sense.
