The Foreigner is a direct video film by Steven Seagal, originally intended to be released as a play in March 2003. However, this intention was allegedly reversed when Seagal's earlier film (Half Past Dead) was filmed at the box office. The film reportedly had a rich budget of $ 20 million, including filming in Warsaw and Paris, and was completed as part of the studio's commitment to a two-picture deal that was negotiated after the relative success of Exit Wounds had pointed out that Seagal still had a solid fan base. Despite the size of their investment, Sony Screen Gems has probably taken the right step to fix this film. It is almost incomprehensible. What do I say? It is incomprehensible. I do not think I understood what was going on except in the broadest sense. <br /> <br /> Seagal is used by a mysterious man to deliver a mysterious package to a mysterious man. Other mysterious guys try to stop him. Other very mysterious men try to kill the moderately mysterious men who try to stop him. Other, really mysterious people are doing particularly mysterious things, all too mysterious for me to find out. The intended recipient's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. As he is a self-proclaimed "consummate professional" charged with bringing the package into the hands of the husband only, Seagal initially defies the wife and later becomes involved in protecting her and her daughter from inexplicable agendas as well as from her Husband. <br /> <br /> Many people have mysterious, cryptic conversations. Many people blow their brains out. Some men seem to die more than once, while in other scenes shootings end up with no clear view of the outcome. So the audience sees someone die but is not sure which of the gun heroes is going to Hill right now. Alliances shift frequently and contribute to further puzzles. Or should I say confusion? <br /> <br /> I do not know who was on whose side or what someone really wanted, and the solution was as unsatisfactory as the presentation. At the end of the movie, I just sat there thinking, "This is the end? What the ...?" <br /> <br /> I could not even find the credits. IMDb says the Australian actress Kate Fischer (from "Sirens") was in this movie, but I'm damned if I know where. Either she was left on the floor of the cutting room or she wisely chose the project. She could have found some activities that were more beneficial to her career, such as an unnecessary operation, tearing out those annoying stock cards from magazines, or attending some community college classes in animal husbandry. Seagal used to be a pretty fair melee, but the action scenes did not make it at all. Seagal is now in his fifties and a very tall man, so he is reduced to a minimum of physical effort and even during this time he is housed in a knee-length coat to hide his intricate Brandoesque belt. It may even be that he takes the wrappings off the candy bars a little, though this is understandable given how many of them he has to eat to maintain his current size. Steven Seagal seemed to be doing a comeback with Exit Wounds, but if his last movie was half dead, that movie almost has to fill the other half.
