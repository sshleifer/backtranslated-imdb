*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Some Africans hillbilly types are in search of diamonds in the desert when they find a hard hill in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoiler: The dumbest begins to hit the hill with a thorn and tears it open. Then he looks into the hole and puts his head in it and SURPRISES! something is eating him. The other two Dimwits will not be seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a pizza delivery guy, but he's on a medical degree (he's about 35 years old, minimum). Bairstow should join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up Bairstow to take him to Camp C has a handful of crazy people who usually populate movies like "PITCH BLACK", "THE THING" and so on. The truck accidentally drives over the first truck and they decide to investigate (how did it happen that the truck did not see the other truck as it drove to Bairstow as it was driving on the same road?). So they find the eaten bodies, and there are some sizable special effects that relate to bones with small pieces of meat. The main madman in the group, Karl, decides that they have to find the killer. So the truck is driving down some tracks in the desert, and finally it has an electrical short circuit and the crew gets stuck in the desert. The dumbest guy in this group had a pile of bones in his hand with his jacket to carry around. When he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket), the creatures eat him alive, and another man runs over and puts his arm in the coach, and that dummy loses his arm as well. Sounds exciting, except that Dr. A few minutes later, Bairstow realizes that the creature is indeed hundreds of thousands of ants using the bones to hold each other so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners have broken up the old hive). Now, the last time I checked, ants could move alone without having to kill people to use the bones for the structure. If all they needed was something hard, they could have put together a set of sticks and made a form out of it. The whole story is really very stupid, and the ant declaration is the only one given. The rest of the movie is all about killing the group until they find the new ant nest and kill the ant brain (a species), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk off in their own tiny cottage. A replacement ant-brain is found (off-camera), which is sent back for analysis, creating a reason for a sequel.
