This is the kind of movie I'm wondering why anyone would have thought of from the beginning. This is the kind of movie I can not understand how people put money in, how the distributor can put the DVD on the shelves. This is the kind of movie I blame myself for hiring him. <br /> <br /> There are good class B films and I do not reject the genre. If they are good, they are interested in the action, they have written characters well enough and acted well enough to take care of them. The effects in some of these films in many cases support the film, and you like it for originality. In 'Coronado' is almost nothing. The topic and the script are on the level of cheap comics - just a clich√©. The effects are cheap - and I do not care that the movie has a low budget - you can do a lot on a low budget, but you need talent. There are as many continuity and directional errors as in ten other films. You do not care about the characters, you do not laugh and at the end of the movie you wonder if the parody was intended or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery, there are some good locations worth a better movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst movie of the year so far.
