Really I love Lucy too ... comedic genius yes ..... MAME ... NEVER ... she was as ridiculous as Mame ... as was the film adaptation of the divine secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. Both just missed the point completely. Roslind Russell was, is and will always be the first and only mame. Maybe Ball, as a young starlet, could have played such a role where her innate beauty and youth could have gone through her ... but this seemed to be a desperate attempt by an old star to show that she was still viable in the field. The reason why there are so many supporters of Russell's version (apart from the fact that you can not improve the original) is that Russell had presence, she absorbs every scene, while Lucille Ball in Mame just as well a pattern on the Wallpaper could be all the attention she has in the role.
