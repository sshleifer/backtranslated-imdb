So many people took pictures on Platoon and Born on the fourth of July, including as "left propaganda film". Now it's up to me to do a political film. For me, this film is very impressive in terms of certain religious beliefs and political views. <br /> <br /> The acting and the writing were a bit too clichéd for my taste. Mel Gibson seems to love playing in those unnecessary violent movies, and proves it again by teaming up with his partner Randall Wallace for another. Throughout the film, there was this prototype rubbish: "Tell my family I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before the hoe goes to bed." It was so overloaded with these refurbishment lines that I felt I had to vomit. How about this scene in which Gibson's wife does her laundry and this "no color" applies to what is going to be put into the washing machine. It was in the mid-sixties when she was under a rock and did not notice the racism around her. Another scene is where Gibson's daughter asks him what is war, and the scene is filmed in such a trivial matter. <br /> <br /> The director showed it all perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and his family or the soldiers who pray. I can show that once or twice, but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to put something in my head. How many scenes with the American flag at their finest hour were recorded with the melodramatic music. The director also gives the impression that we have won a victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won. Cinematography was the worst thing. The slowed-down scenes showed the American flag in the distant scenes, which were spreading everywhere. I love America, but movies like these seem to glorify everything we do. <br /> <br /> This may sound like a scream and it may, but I can not stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they agree with everything what her country sees poorly. This film is narrow-minded for me and in many ways limited. It is said to me that if you are not Christian, you are wrong. Would God or Jesus want people to kill, I do not think so. For me, this movie was offensive. At first this movie was funny with countless clichés and overreacted scenes, but when I looked at what the movie wanted to say or not, it was really frustrating to look at it. I think it's my fault I saw this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively, because I do not criticize religion or patriotism, but some of the narrow-minded people who both love and restrict all others. <br /> <br /> If you want a real representation of the Vietnam War Clock Platoon, born on the fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even the Full Metal Jacket, which I absolutely hated, was a better portrayal. I've read a quote that says that a true patriot does not go with everything that the government or the country does, but questions it when it's wrong. A true patriot loves his country too much to see that it does bad things.
