When I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, Ali G is immeasurably better. It's not a masterpiece, but it's at least a movie. Borat is completely garbage and I do not understand how it was rated better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can not put my finger on it, there's something wrong with the Ali G script: Half of the jokes are as written by a 15-year-old, not an adult writer. And a series of jokes, including Mr. Cohen's lower body, are pretty tasteless. <br /> <br /> But the movie actually comes together as comedy and there are also some valid jokes that are funny: So Ali G becomes a member of the government because he has done something scandalous and stupid in public (alas) in today's Western society: people get careers for stupid things in public), including Ali's advice on immigration policy and some others. <br /> <br /> Ali G remains a sympathetic character overall, even though he is mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's okay to see it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But never look Borat, it's terrible and makes every intelligent musculoskeletal system sick.
