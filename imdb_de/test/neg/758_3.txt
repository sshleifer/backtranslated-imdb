The movie is not only lame. It's more than that. This movie is just not necessary. Do we still need a Western? How about a western with African Americans in the title roles? Dumb, implausible and a lame attempt to modernize the genre? It is. Incredibly lame and simply minded. It's like the lame Baz Luhrman movie "Romeo and Juliet," in which he set it up in modern times to attract young people and create a hype by revising a classic story. Well, Baz Luhrman failed miserably and this mess too. The story is actually not bad, but the idea of ​​removing racism from a racist genre by occupying an African-American cast is racist in itself. It's also pueril and easy-minded (like Baz Luhrman-Mann, he's a bad director). Hey, I heard that was done by Mario Van Peebles! He is in the movie too! How can it be racist? It is not. I said the idea was to throw all African American instead of Caucasians was. The film is not racist, but pointless, stupid and very boring.
