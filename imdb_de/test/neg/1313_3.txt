"Flood" is an excellent example of how throwing good actors and cgi on a movie does little to compensate for a garbage thing. The basic requirement is good: what if an unusual storm threatened to send the sea directly across the Thames flood barriers and devour London so quickly that most of its inhabitants would probably never come out in time? It's basically the New York segment of The Day After Tomorrow, but that should not be a movie. The script does not exist. It's just functional, flat and lacking in depth. Great British talents like Robert Carlysle and David Suchet, to name just a few, are best at what they have, but their characters are two-dimensional ciphers, like those from an old Marvel comic book. and honestly, it would be easier to turn back the tide. Not that every actor was torn off the hook - Tom Courtenay seemed to have only one emotion throughout the movie, but then he was not challenged. <br /> <br /> I welcome every opportunity to see something unfortunate-Hollywood catastrophe movements for a change, and I do not expect billions of dollars to be spent on rendering ultra-realistic graphics. However, there is no excuse for writing Shonky, especially from a country that produced the best science-fiction movies that had virtually no budget. This is the kind of half-hearted B-fluff the sci-fi channel produces, and that's hardly a goal. If, like me, you're a fan of disaster movies, you're still tempted to do yourself a favor and look at it with a few friends. Even better; do not bother
