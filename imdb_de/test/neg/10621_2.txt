Well, the name in the summary should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY - the modern king of low-budget flicks, be it for television or straight to the video (I doubt he's even producing for the screen anymore - with the death of walk-in B-movie double features and all). <Br /> <br /> The creator of such cult (?) Classics as Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island .... <br /> <br /> I like this guy-stuff. It's mostly entertaining (cheesy and, above all, cheap in a very specific way), and if it's one thing, it's a pro - something you can not say for all the guys in the movie business. <br /> <br /> But this film here is among the weaker in his work. Dumb drama, an uninspired screenplay, and lame jokes conspire to make your brain numb in a few minutes. If you are looking for genuine F.O.R. Goodness (or rather badness), pay attention to the above and generally to his things from the 70s and 80s (I think he has lost some of his advantage lately).
