In general, you must eventually research this little gem. When I describe that I am describing my sex or Glen Or Glenda, as it is better known, I have to reiterate the thoughts of Andrew Smith, who hit the nail on the head when he wrote, "If you have not had any other films from This is a completely confusing experience, and if you've seen Ed Wood films, it's still completely confusing. "The film is both funny and tragic, but it moves with a strange rhythm that leaves no doubt that the author knows every word and means what he says during his run. God bless him and had some of the highest ambitions as a director who wanted to promote peace, understanding and even acceptance in the fifties of all time. When Tim Burton re-enacted a tour of Glen Or Glenda for his biopics by studio executives, he showed the executives how they laughed and told each other that this must be a put-on. More than fifty years later, there are still people fighting, just to get the respect that the "normal" takes for granted. I say it is certainly not the case. <br /> <br /> No, the real comedy In Glen Or Glenda, Wood is the sheer inability to write his message. Directors often use film material if they find suitable material for their purposes and can adapt it to their own footage. Ed Wood indiscriminately used footage and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood, as Johnny Depp played, insisted that he turn film footage into a complete film. Unfortunately, the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he has ever been. The IMDb states that twenty percent of this approximately sixty-year film is film, and it's never hard to guess which material it is. Footage of busy highways, flying planes, bad lightning effects, soldiers do their thing, they are all randomly used, sometimes repeated, and often have only a loose connection to the story Wood is trying to tell. If Wood had been able to sit back and think about what he's been trying to do for a while, he can not say what he could have reached. Wood himself appears in the film as Titular Character, a confused transvestite posing as a woman named Glenda. Aside from the courageous way he tries to assert himself, Wood makes a vile woman. I found myself on the edge of a society that says I'm "disabled" and would have to be "healed" myself. I honestly hoped to get the best result for Wood's character. To say this, Wood weaves in short stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the extreme step of undergoing a sex change to become a woman, the other is so disenfranchised that he fears being arrested again for committing suicide. The scary thing about this movie is that if you cut out transvestism and replace such deprivations as my position on the autistic spectrum or things like schizophrenia, very little of the film needs to be changed. So little has society learned since Ed Wood was a boy. <br /> <br /> The other major figure in Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, whom Wood created in the film. Speculation depends on Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood Lugosis wanted to revive his career and do everything possible to achieve it. With the exception of taking the time to carefully construct a good movie. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood Lugosi is best described as "bizarre" in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood. Lugosi plays a character who is billed as The Scientist, but rather comes out as an all-powerful puppeteer. People who have not seen Ed Wood films before the movie will think Tim Burton invented the "Beware of the Big Green Dragon Sitting on Your Doorstep". If anything, Burton was forced to say what bizarre speech should be used to represent the Woodman dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's amusing chatter during Plan 9 from outer space. Watchers will note the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the time. Again, Burton dramatizes her reaction to seeing the script for the first time, while the film portrays her as acceptable and forward-looking. I can not help but feel that Burton's portrayal is more accurate as Fuller's role is extremely uncomfortable. She only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical and so lifeless that she somehow manages to be less talented than her peers if that's possible. Whether Wood's direction was better focused than usual in this case is hard to determine, but if the ability of the cast to leave the stars in the dust (with the obvious exception of Bela) is some guide, then this should be considered a surprise that Fuller would only appear in a very small role in another Wood movie. The fact that she has written a series of hit songs shows that she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood appeared again in front of the camera, it was never more than a cameo, a walk-on or a small part. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen Or Glenda one out of ten points. I generally rate this rating only for movies that are so bad that they make it entertaining. Glen Or Glenda is so brave and well-intentioned that he fits this description to a T.
