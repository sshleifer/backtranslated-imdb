Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You get a bunch of kung fu fights and a lack of magoo-like madness. <br /> <br /> The limited plot has put Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) in an international action where he steals a world-renowned gem. Of course he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea he had the jewel. Within thirty minutes, you might be bored looking at it. There are some very funny moments when he cooks the chicken. You'll wish you were as shortsighted as Magoo. It's a funny movie, but it's a disaster! You must love Leslie Nielson because he made some very funny movies. That's not his best, but he does Magoo well. I thought it was a funny movie, and it should be recommended to young children, as they probably think it is very funny.
