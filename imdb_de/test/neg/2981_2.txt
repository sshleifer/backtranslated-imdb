I saw that this movie came out and could not wait to see it. I have to say that I was very disappointed. That would have been better as a mini-series. The whole show seemed to be very rushed. They did not explain things very clearly. In the end, they showed John Paul II Alive and the next scene in which he was dead. Never an explanation of what happened. (We all know what happened in real life.) I think ABC threw the ball on something that could have been great. All in all, I think this movie was a blur. It seemed like a drunken monkey was jumping from one point in John Paul's life to another without explaining how or why things happened. For example, when his older brother left, he was never told that his brother was a doctor and therefore left the house. When his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the ground, and that's it. I was very disappointed in the movie.
