I do not understand what's wrong with this movie! I do not understand why high school kids should see this! I do not understand why that should have made me think about anything in the least! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> If the unrecognized girl is on her way to suicide Was I the only person who cheered her on? The stereotypical classical music, long tracking shots, and the melancholy emotion of the movie at that point had turned me into what was intended. I would only have been happy if she entered the room and the whole cast was in the hand with her scissors cutting her wrists. <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Because I went to high school ... and frankly, I'm mortally ill to see movie by movie in Australia, with teenagers based solely on terrible stereotypes. I have been waiting for ages for a younger person to write a movie that I can contact, and this stereotypical piece of emo garbage is what I got instead. It was like a dark version of Heartbreak High that needed a predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Why are all teenagers depressed in Australian dramas or do they have really weird problems that just are not made plausible? <br /> <br /> On the positive side, this was funnier than "blurred". And I needed a good laugh.
