I know Full Moon or any other movie studio could never capture the fun and cheesy sci-fi feel that was the original "Trancers". And when the last two entries of the series in the Middle Ages instead of the futuristic Los Angeles had Jack Deth, it became clear that there was little hope to revive the Trancers series. Bringing a new life to a movie is one thing, but taking our main character out of his element and bringing him back to the past, well, it did not work! Now Full Moon has breathed so much new life with Trancers 6 in the series that we're not going to deal with Jack Deth anymore. We are now dealing with his daughter Jo. Jack is in her body and has to go back in time to fight the Trancers again In this movie you only have to see the first two minutes of the movie when the original Jack Deth appears on the screen. But it's not really Tim Thomerson. There are excerpts of him and sound bytes strung together (believe me, you can say they are strung together) to give the viewer the last true Jack Deth humor. And from that point on, it's just downhill. To have this girl, Jo Deth, as our main character, while Jack Deth is supposed to be in her body, is the worst idea in the world. That this sweet young woman is a tough and tough man is not the right track at all! It does not work and it is really stupid. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the aspects of special effects and make-up, as most people who read this know what has become of the full moon: A really, really, low budget company. I do not know what to say about this movie except, I really wish Full Moon could be like the days of Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. Back then, the special effects were not great storytelling. They made serious B-movies for serious B-movies and horror fans, and that's just not happening at the new Full Moon studios today. I long for the good old days and really hope that Full Moon can pull out of this terrible burglary in which they are currently. <br /> <br /> Trancers 6 gets 2 out of 10 points.
