I can not say enough how bad this movie was. Especially a waste of some legendary stars, although they are quite old and convince pretty little. Fred Astaire, well, I think he must have done someone a big favor, since this was his last movie role. The script is a mess and the movie looks terribly boring. I imagine if I had seen that at the time it came out (1981), I might have thought it decent. But with so many good horror movies, this was one of the worst. The only really convincing thing in this mess was the very young and lovable nature of the weird Alice Krige. The young main character tried to play as well as possible, but was absolutely terrible. I was not sure how much of that came from his lack of skill or the lack of an understandable script. Do not watch, unless you want to see that some old men are a bit scared.
