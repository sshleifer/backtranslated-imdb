A stunningly beautiful Charlotte Lewis plays a woman terrorized by ghosts torturing her on the phone. Terrified, Charlotte must face this daunting secret to save her sanity and her life. I can not believe that Ruggero Deodato, the director behind "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the edge of the park", has directed this absurd piece of garbage. Granted, the music of goblin frontman Claudio Simonetti is pretty good, but the story is painfully stupid. The screenplay by Franco Ferrini is ridiculous and makes no sense, the acting is bad and there is absolutely no reason. The scene in which a potential rapist of Charlotte Lewis is killed by coins ejected from a subway phone is more than laughable. Do not waste your time with this crap. There are much better Italian horror movies out there!
