Nowadays, Ridley Scott is one of the top directors and producers and can pay huge sums for film films - especially since he has his rights to films like ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER. From this part list of his credits is obvious that he is an amazing talent. However, if you look at that very early effort he made in film school, you may find it hard to say that he was meant to be tall. The movie is hopelessly boring and unpretentious. However, considering that it was not intended for the general release and it was just a practice site, I am inclined to look at it non profit - hence the score of 4 The film is part of the CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. There are 16 shorts on this DVD. Most are not great, but with THE MAN WITHOUT HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP included, this is an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and worth buying.
