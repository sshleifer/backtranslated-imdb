Well, I saw this movie at the last San Sebastian Film Festival. The reaction was ... let's say weird how the movie is unintentional. Sometimes they showed a copy with terribly wrong Spanish subtitles. They seemed to be a translation from Chinese into English and then into Spanish. It was all confusing, the sexes changed (girls appeared as boys and boys as girls), and my friends and I remember great lines ... but because they were so absurd. All in all, not a good movie, but if they are ever shown on TV and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the movie), then go ahead: "Visible secret" is your movie.
