I would like to know who made the producers of this film pay for their production. This persion is a kind of genius. This movie somehow caught my attention for about two-thirds until I realized he was nowhere fast. I think the music has made it seem like something is going to happen, but nothing really happened. It was not scary. The dialogue was poorly written. The first 90 minutes should be done in about 15 minutes. This would have been a moderately acceptable episode in the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> At this point, I'm just angry that I wasted all the time. These are a few hours that I never get back. <br /> <br /> I hope these comments save someone not to waste the evening. Take a nap or go to the gym instead. If you want to be afraid, activate a cable news channel.
