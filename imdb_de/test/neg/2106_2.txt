Really, really awful. I do not know where to start. This is a perfect example of a movie that does not know what to do with itself. I'm not sure if I could assign a category myself except that I'm pretty sure it's a slap in the face of everyone. Even the unborn child. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought I was watching a parody or a kind of farce. Sometimes only a bad B-movie. But I kept looking for the porn out who, I'm afraid, almost (but not completely) does not exist. <br /> <br /> Someone has advised to jump to the end. I would definitely reject that emotion. The last five minutes are intense and certainly include some of the best movies you'll ever see. Ed Wood would be proud of him.
