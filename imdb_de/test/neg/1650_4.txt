In this city boy becomes the insane, a bit mean, infantile humor of would-be peasant stories. It's not outrageous enough to address the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to take the length of the feature. Most of what I praise "son-in-law" would be to say that it largely avoids toilet humor. The main problem is that all characters lack warmth, and Pauly Shore is so aggressive that he is a highly unlikely hero. There are a few amusing pieces that affect livestock, and that's about it. The story of what is there is so simple and predictable that "Jury Duty" appears like Gone with the Wind. - MERK
