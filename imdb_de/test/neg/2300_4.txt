The murder of Red Comyn at Grayfriars Abbey was a long way from any of the most terrible things ever happened in the Scottish War of Independence. Fights (and murder) in churches were not uncommon at all. Not long after, Robert Bruce's wife, daughter and two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church where people were killed. And it is ridiculous to compare it to the Berwick massacre, in which the English slaughtered at least 8,000 non-combatants (some, yes, in churches). <br /> <br /> That means it's not a well-made movie. It is a light antidote to the absolutely RIDICULOUS sniffing depiction of Robert Bruce in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce was, it was not a jerk. <br /> <br /> It's a pity they did not do that better because someone was supposed to be making a really good movie about a war so amazing that it sounds like it's somebody who's completely defeated in a war The Battle of Methven until a secret return from hiding to a long guerrilla war came to Bannockburn. But it's not. Badly made and largely poorly written and traded. Pity!
