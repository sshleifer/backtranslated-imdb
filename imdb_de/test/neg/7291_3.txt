What is the tone of the last years with Disney? Are not there any good ideas left? Where is the magic? Where are the good entertainers, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good ones ... Okay, I know, Walt himself and the famous "Nine Old Man" can not go back. But is that a reason to challenge countless of these cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroy the ideals of Walt Disney? I never borrowed or bought a Disney episode of which movie. Because I had read a lot about his (missing) quality. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return" was televised today in Germany and I'm watching it. It confirmed my doubts about sequels. It was absolutely boring. Error animation, primitive color rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful attempts to simulate the famous multiplane camera with CGI, mediocre music and a patchwork of different, simple stories. It absolutely does not look like Disney! Not like Disney I know! It looks like one of the countless, cheap and simple animated series, such as "DragonballZ", "Beyblade", etc. that aired on television every day for kids. <br /> <br /> My first reaction after showing this crap was loading "Bambi" into my DVD player, seeing Disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again, seeing Disney at its peak, the breathtaking See art of handmade animation again. "Bambi" was the first (and still the only) movie I forgive 10 out of 10 stars. But "Atlantis: Milo's return"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no mind ... It only deserves 3 out of 10!
