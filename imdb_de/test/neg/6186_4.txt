Coltrane and Idle are members of a bank robbery group who twice cross their leader in a robbery. They hide in a nun's school and dress up appropriately to avoid discovery by the mob and the police. Lots of Catholic humor and slapstick, but the script is a bit thin as the laugh. Although there is a GOOD shower scene ... on a scale of one to ten..4
