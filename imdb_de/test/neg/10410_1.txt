Are you kidding me? The music was SO LOUD on this show, I often could not even hear the dialogue. And the music was nothing special. Does anyone know what Jake's mother said when he walked in the door ??? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to having so little immediate devastation. Everyone is researching the effects of nuclear failures before writing them. I felt like some sitcom actors were sent to the scene and did not know what to do with dramatic dialogue. And what does a teenager from Kansas know about shopping in Soho ... could not we have had a better line here? Bored to tears and only kept awake when the loud noise of the overmixed kind sounded like loud music.
