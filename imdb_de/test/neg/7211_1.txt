"Direct-to-Video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer, unless it's a direct-to-video sequence of something that went straight to the video first and foremost. Nevertheless, the studios have insisted on releasing numerous direct-to-video sequels for cult hits over the years. I do not think it even needs to be mentioned that these sequels are among the worst titles of all time, including THE HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2, and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It is fitting that ROAD HOUSE 2 was directed by Scott Ziehl was also the man who ruined the Cruel Intentions series. Like his entry into the Cruel Intentions trilogy, Ziehl takes elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a great guy, and hides them without success. This is not a sequel, this is a remake. Different lines of the original are repeated, plot points are cut out and inserted, and scenes are almost reproduced from shot one by one. The only thing that could not be copied was the amazing battle scenes that made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here we get clumsy fighting sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned and shot within an hour. Compare that with his predecessor's fight scenes, which look like they've taken months and months to prepare. Ziehl is able to direct actions as he did in the 2001 remake of EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, but none of the talents shown here come to the fore in this mess. It's not entirely his fault, because the script is very, very poorly written and clumsy. I do not care if something goes directly to the video, but a good script is still required. Someone should keep this mind while bringing these low budget movies straight to DVD. Skip it completely. 1.10
