Reading the other two comments, I had to wonder if I had seen the same movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe life in Australia is drastically different, but, let's call it sci-fi or fantasy, but people just do not do anything behave like that. <br /> <br /> I could not comment on this review without commenting on myself. It gets better after the first half hour, but I doubt most of them could do so far.
