I saw this on the shelves of the rental station and I rented everything else, so I did not say why. Why not, because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It looks like it was taken with a camcorder at home. I think that's all the budget allows. There were fewer breasts than I thought. Some people made it to soft porn with a few murders. The funniest part of the whole movie is the extra for me. There is a place with deleted scenes. Well, there is only one, but it is the stupidest, and I think it may have overthrown the rest of the movie. The girls get into a hot tub and find chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yes, everything ends up over her. Great stuff !!! This movie is very, very bad. Do not bother.
