At first I thought, "nasaan ka man" could be one of those progressive new Filipino films. As mentioned, the movie does not look bad. It's clear that the directors have used more expensive shooting cameras, better viewing angles, better sound equipment, good-looking actors and nicer locations. <br /> <br /> However, the improvements are purely superficial. If not all Polish and expensive filters were available, "nasaan ka man" would feel like a typical, second-rate local movie. Moments, tears, screams, and characters that might interest you less, hugged each other's throats. <br /> <br /> a few things annoyed me about this movie. above all, since when is it okay to have sex with adopted families? This non-blood related argument makes no difference. Second, would a woman really tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped just because the father told her to keep it a secret? and where the hell were the lights in this movie? I know that the director was trying to make things look extremely dramatic, but I was simply forced to turn on the brightness feature on my TV.
