My Take: A routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. <br /> <br /> A seldom seen political thriller that led to a very bad box office response, I was able to watch THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV right now and while I was glad I satisfied my curiosity to see this rarity movie, I do not really feel like this movie is special. SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not as bad as critics and the public reacted to it, but it's still not good, and everything from script to direction is pretty predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential assistant, who meets with killers and car chases (many of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy lurking among the White House staff. After a professor is murdered, Sheen helps ex-flame reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) to expose the traitor and reveal the title's conspiracy. <br /> <br /> However, this script, written by Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs, is pedestrian-like, barely different from other White House conspirators, such as ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600. Some notable talents (Donald Sutherland), Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) try their best at a routine script, but rarely save it from the predictability of the script. Not to mention a ridiculous scene involving a toy helicopter that seems far too stupid and exaggerated in this "serious" political thriller. I'm sure that THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY has some moments, some of which are underestimated (Director George Pan Cosmatos serves some handsome chases), but not this routine thriller that does not bring much profit and surprises raises. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from 5.
