But whatever? I picked it up in my 99 percent store for 99 cents (plus taxes). I remember watching that on a video as a teenager and thought it was a cool movie. Too bad that the movie and my memories do not match. Anyway, it's not too awful to blow a few hours, and it's nice to see some old Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... Blah .... Blah .... man, oh man, I can not say anything else about this movie ... that is pathetic, how bad is this movie, the best I have in Could have related to him were five lines of text? So, ten lines of text, right? Hmmm, ten lines are hard to come by, if you can not remember a busy movie you just saw.
