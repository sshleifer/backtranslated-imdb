Have looked at this piece ONDEMAND, because the description was somehow failed. This film stinks of cocaine, but the opening scene must have cost at least five spots to film. This is a racist, homophobic piece of rubbish that drifts for a good hour and 22 minutes without any direction. I'm a bit confused about how this gives good reviews. I will not explain the plot line to you, because as far as I can tell, there is no plot. I'm pretty sure everyone came to the set every day to show huge lines, Loretta Switt dressed in low-profile necklines to show as much flap-back as possible, screaming action; Have the cast improvise in a cocaine rush. Similar to real beer, this movie has nearly lost half of my liver. Save your money and see "Strange Brew" instead.
