There is a good story that is well hidden and never really used! <br /> <br /> The film is short and too dependent on action and thematic photography. somehow the development of character and history was forgotten. What's left is messy and superficial. <br /> <br /> Turn off your brain and watch? You'll probably find that time is fast enough. You will not get any real satisfaction from this movie. <br /> <br /> Just watch if you have nothing better to do, and then only if someone else is paying for the video store.
