This movie is a clumsy mish-mash of various ghost story and suspense thriller conventions, none of which has been fully realized and are all quite irritating. The script was superficial. The spectacle, ditto. The creepy FX were mostly ridiculous, except for an exquisite moment of the squat that startled me, though I saw that it came a mile from it. Now tell me why you need ghosts and black magic and mysterious ritual objects, and count Crapula CG Boogeymen and psychic investigators and family curses and Irish superstitions. AND obsessed dollies, all in the same movie? With all this, one would expect more than a good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.
