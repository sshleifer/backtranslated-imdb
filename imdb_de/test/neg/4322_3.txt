SPOILER FORWARD! The mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is in a student town in New England looking for a student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved Princess Ananka. Boring, slow (even after 65 minutes - it moves slower than the mummy!), Acted indifferently, but the end is worth waiting for. The mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and she ages fast, as the two slowly sink into a swamp. This is (I think) the only time in a Universal Monster movie that the monster got the girl! Besides, this is strictly amateur night. Probably the worst continuation of the mummy - and that says something!
