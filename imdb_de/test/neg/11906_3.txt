There is a certain irony in a parody of the gothic genre, which filmmakers turn into a jumble of clich√©s that either had no idea what the purpose of the story was, or simply did not care. All the typical features of your average family movie are presented younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who does not want to move, unsympathetic parents who can not see the apparition, and of course a romantic subplot. The film has very little to do with Wild's original story, most of which was written to ridicule the melodramatic Gothic novels that were the latest craze. If Wilde had seen this version, he would probably laugh - and then of course write a parody. One can only hope that the children, watching this mild, mass-produced dad, finally discovered the wit and splendor of the original version.
