Short marital infidelity returns to follow the loving wife Grace Needham (who is portrayed by the ever-sexy Nastassja Kinski). She had left the city and her depressing husband to embark on a journey to sunny Miami where she was staying, followed and ultimately seduced by Julian Grant, a decidedly evil and manipulative businessman who is well represented by William Baldwin (Why do all the Baldwin brothers play so damned good people?) Seduction of Grace took place when the two were drinking champagne on a deserted beach, which they reached privately with a sailboat. Grace admitted that she had drunk too much and revealed the many problems in her marriage. Julian won her trust by claiming he would never tolerate such problems if he had a relationship with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued when he described a "Lost at Sea" fantasy that included the now unrestrained Grace, who sat nearby, listening to every word and becoming more and more engaged in his romantic dream. <br /> <br /> His manipulation paid off When some subtle nudges led to Grace's soft kissing, she paused for a moment as she withdrew, as if suddenly thinking to herself, "What am I doing? I am a woman. I am mother I have a real life. Real responsibilities. Sure, we both talked about being lost at sea, but that's just a fantasy. Look, what we do here. The consequences are real. We are really alone on a secluded beach. Should I really allow this fantasy? "<br /> <br /> She succumbs to the dream as her kisses become more passionate. The once sheltered Grace, responding to the men's suggestions with the words "I'm married," enjoyed watching Julian unbutton her shirt, which led to more kissing, physical exhortation, and her climbing on Julian's lap! She smiles, kisses, groans, laughs and often looks into the sun, which unfortunately was a short love scene in which everyone seemed to have the most clothes on. <br /> <br /> While I enjoyed it very much Grace's face looked like an unauthorized passion when the once devoted woman was very satisfied with sex with a man who obviously likes to manipulate others. I'll say that the scene overall did not deserve the rating "R" of the movie /> <br /> Julian returned home to see that her husband has rejuvenated by securing a high paying job, and she is excited to be able to return to a normal life where she can again be a loving wife and a caring mother. <br /> <br /> But the evil Julian Grant resumes the picture and does not want to give up Grace so easily. Grace has a plan to free her life from Julian, but will it work? <br /> <br /> Of course I do not want to ruin the remaining action for you. However, I will say that I always like movies that involve a woman's sexual pretense (especially if she shows unrestrained attraction and behavior that is normally reserved for her husband), but that she is actually seeking revenge against the opponent , This movie would have been much, much better if the movie had included more of it in the storyline. My feelings are, if the movie poses it, then the movie should end it. And this movie definitely brought it up. Unfortunately, certain limitations in the story have prevented this from happening significantly. There are many other films that succeed with this point, and I will include their titles in the Recommendations section of this section. I'm also open to emailing suggestions for other films that contain a good story with a sexual presumption of a seemingly devoted woman. <br /> <br /> Overall, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good. The movie does not work.
