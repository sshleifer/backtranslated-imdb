This film did not do it for me, an avid SNL fan for 14 years. Jamie Gertz's performance was fine, but the movie itself was a bit disgusting. The facts presented in the film are completely distorted. But Merv Griffin produced it, that would explain a lot. He was never at SNL and had nothing to do with it. The points in her life when she was at SNL are backward. When we saw her for the first time at SNL, when she walked through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is about 1988-1989, not 1975. And let's talk about the cast - who are these people? I have never heard of one. Really unsatisfactory. This movie shows why TV movies are just that, TV movies.
