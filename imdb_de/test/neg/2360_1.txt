completely useless ... since I've been working on the subject, I have to say that this does not capture the club atmosphere. Maybe the characters were not just mouthpieces for unbelievably terrible, unrealistic chatter. So many damn worthy scenes that would shame The Office (no compliment to this movie). Maybe it helped to have something of a story, a point, a message, a comment, anything. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to say on this subject than this movie (term in this case very casual). For such films minus numbers should be reserved. -10 (extra turd)
