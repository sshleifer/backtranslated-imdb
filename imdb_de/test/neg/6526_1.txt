OK, first of all there may be a SPOILER here, because I do not know what it means to spend too much information. My subject line says it all, but surely people want to know WHY it's so stupid. First, this film follows a series of yuppies as they go to a sports game in Chicago, but the end is taken wrong exit and end in the ghetto. Scary, right? Well, first of all, Emilio drives all the people in the most overgrown motorhome / Winnebago of the world with satellite dishes and such a crap on it. So these guys are going to a sports game (I forget that, though the Bulls or the White Sox are likely to be near the oh-so ghoulish ghetto), but they can not make it without the highway onboard display command center, which would be ashamed of ESPN. They are smart enough to earn a living that would pay for the stuff, but they are sports fans who do not even know which way to go to their favorite game. <br /> <br Within half an hour, I gave up the movie, but the reasons were plentiful. They land in the GHETTO, but their main danger is in DENIS LEARY. A white guy. I'm not a racist, but come on. In all that the reality remembered - and this movie was going to be an urban nightmare - Denis Leary would not try to kill Emilio Estevez, he would ride a tramp to get the Dodge himself out of the Dodge !!! /> <br /> This is undoubtedly one of the stupidest movies ever made, though I do not know much about the rest of the cinema in the world. If MST3K was still on, they would surely have dedicated an episode to this episode.
