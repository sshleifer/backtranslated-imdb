South of Hell Mountain, an absolutely astounding Western with flash forward sequences in a lunatic asylum, was one of the first films produced by the Schlockmeisters at Cannon Film. William Sachs, who later delivered fan favorites like The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxina, tells the boring story of a trio of gold robbers stumbling across a cabin occupied by two women who hide some secrets are not worth discovering become. The cast (most of whom have never made another film) is playful, but is adversely affected by the script, which generally makes no sense. The asylum scenes are unedited and are interrupted by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. Finally, there is much talk and little else.
