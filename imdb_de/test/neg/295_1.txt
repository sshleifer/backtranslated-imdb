OK, imagine, every state in the US, yes, every country has exactly the same trees that grow and have the foliage. Also imagine that the camp of a monkey catcher has a beautifully paved road that goes straight ahead so far off the beaten path that you had to drive the first half of the river. Imagine a world in which you need to wear a full biological suit to collect a floppy disk. Then just put them in a zippered bag and put them in your pocket without any precautions as soon as you get back to the office. A world where two nine-year-old girls like to give blood without complaining. This is the world in which this film plays. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is one of the most cliched excrement I have seen in many years as a witness. <br /> <br /> I liked it. :)
