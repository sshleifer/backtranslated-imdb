This movie is awful. It creates characters that are not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including a disgusting little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish-speaking elves. The book was a simple story about faith, and this movie is a dark, ugly and unnecessarily scary film about nothing. <br /> <br /> The animation is outstanding, but the story was ruined by Hollywood. <Br /> <br /> The good news is that this movie is being bathed at the box office and maybe the producers will learn to avoid a story that needs no improvement. Hanks was over the top and I do not see why there could not be the voices of other actors.
