This picture is a bad and blown up episode of the Michael Pohl short film EXTINCT from 1995. While Michael Pohl's idea was original and perfect for a short film scenario, the plot of A SOUND OF THUNDER was poorly adapted to Pohl's story and not suitable for one Full movie that you would expect from a big hollywod studio. The tragic tsunami that ruined the scenes in Prague was in this case just a bad link in a long, rusty film production chain. For a studio to release such a product ... it's a shame. Especially for Warner Brothers, a studio that built 5 new effects fields in 1993 with shows like BABYLON. On TELEVISION. Visual effects for television broadcasts that pioneered CGI on episodic television in the mid-1990s were far more demanding than what is shown on screen in this image. In such cases, sad as it may be, the movie can.
