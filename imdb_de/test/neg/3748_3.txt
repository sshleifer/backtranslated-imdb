First of all, if you want to make a good movie, do not stuff all your exhibits into the last 10 minutes. The viewer is expected to be confused for almost two hours, except that Margo's dad Alex explains everything very late in the movie. To make matters worse, the script writer decided it was not enough to solve the basic riddle, but adds a completely unnecessary murder that we did not know about (with Alex's dad!). <br /> <br /> There are some serious motivation issues with characters too. The decisions of Margo's father seem to make no sense once the movie is over. Why did not he just kill Philip's father and handle it? Instead, a complicated conspiracy to conceal the truth is put together, but it ensures that everyone is physically endangered for years (including the completely innocent photographer murdered by the thugs of Philip's father). Although Alex is a doctor (thought to be relatively intelligent), he decides to flee from the police, endangering not only his own life, but those he finds himself in an awkward hustle and bustle on the highway plugged. Why was Margo's girlfriend so eager to keep her promise to Margo as soon as the crap for Alex hits the fan? And should we think that Margo's father would rather kill himself than go to jail? What about his wife? Has he considered her wishes? These are some of the main problems. <br /> <br /> Then there are some nasty details, like: why was her dad there on the night of her fake death? How did he find the junkie's body so quickly and get it back quickly to bury him with the other two? Alex's friend Bruno seems too eager to be part of the mess in which he and his friends have to kill for Alex, despite the debt he owes Alex for saving his son's life. What good are the photos of Margo? They do not imply Philippe at all. And why should Margo have the locker key for her future kidnappers this night? Did I miss other things? Probably. One of my minor irritations is that Alex is a doctor, but smokes like a fiend. That makes his marathon to the police even more impressive. When he drives with his lawyer in the convertible, none of them wears a seatbelt. How bright could they be?
