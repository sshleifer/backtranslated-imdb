This movie is a total waste of time. I can not understand anyone sitting by this garbage. Oh, I loved it when I was seven years old. I think a seven-year-old may have written and directed it. <br /> <br /> There is no script, no acting, just garbage. The best spectacle is that of the fighting roosters. I think I could whip these ninjas and I'm not someone you think is tough. Totally unconvincing and did not arouse the slightest interest. At the end of the first ten minutes of the movie, I yawned and laughed. This is one that would distract people from martial arts films. Great comedy, bad action movie.
