People may say I'm tough, but I can not help it. The movie is so bad that I was absolutely stunned. The first movie was bad enough if you ask me. It was exaggerated and stupid, but this scene has a seriously stupid story despite the scary scenes. In fact, they examined Kayako's past and found that she had a mother (who miraculously speaks English) who was an exorcist and "fed" her daughter with evil spirits. Stupid? Yeap OK, it started with Kayako, an ordinary housewife who had an affair with a guy and killed himself. This part is still ok. With this moment of anger, she became a vengeful spirit killing anyone who enters her house. Acceotable Now her killings began to stretch, where she actually had the opportunity to travel through Tokyo to kill her victims. (Her victims were on the way, was not it?) That hit me hard. Well, if a ghost could actually do something like traveling through a country without paying the public transport tariffs, I would not mind. Ask someone to kill me, then * snort *. And to top it all off, the ghost once portrayed as very vindictive (In Ju-on: The Grudge, which was much better than this garbage) is now portrayed as a ghost who is genuinely happy and feels that it is their mission to end people. Things got worse (for me, the viewer), as the mind came in the form of large strands of hair. I mean, ??? If a spirit has such power, I can not imagine being one. I never really liked movies that depict ghosts as MONSTERS. The overall result is just bad. Like The Grudge 2. With a better story and less exaggeration, this show would have been better
