I have nothing against adult humor, but this feature was just dirty. The first 10 minutes were when Pryor cursed a guy taking pictures, followed by more swear words. I do not know what happened in the last 5 minutes because I went out. After seeing that, I never looked at Richard Pryor like that again. And to think that he actually did a children's show. <br /> <br /> If obscenity and tasteless, listless, dirty jokes make you laugh, you'll probably enjoy it. But if you're an "old-fashioned" type, do not worry about it.
