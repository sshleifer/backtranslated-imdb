Telly Savalas performed a decent (but not better) feat than Pancho Villa, the notorious Mexican bandit / revolutionary in this review of Villa's Razzia in the city of Columbus, New Mexico in 1916. Villa is not a truly historical personality that I'm overly I'm not going to say much about the historical details of the movie. As a movie, this is not great, though it's a bit of action and humor here and there. The performance of Chuck Connors as Colonel Wilcox, the commander of the US Army near Columbus, seemed a bit over the top, and Clint Walker as Villa's gringo buddy Scotty did not really do me much. The film is obviously a relatively small budget of limited technical quality. For a movie that has a running time of just over an hour and a half, I have to say that this film was pulled in places, especially in the last 20 minutes or so. The raid in the United States was an interesting (though generally not very important) historical sidebar, which probably deserved better treatment. 4.10
