I've heard the raver stories in the movie and that's great, but that's only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this film is the cheese dairy. I never really got the plot or why the guy stole girls. That does not make sense, but hey ... why they happened to be in a club was also curious. Many parts of this movie do not make sense, but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels ... maybe I'm just not enough for this movie, but judging from the B-end scene, they're out of money. Its low budget and seems like that. I like the fact that they used small special effects that were bad but no quality qualities. I would say that this film is the quintessence of a bad script, with a good production. It's definitely not as random as many of the movies I've seen, but the pieces of the puzzle just do not make sense. As for the effects, I would give an exception to the last battle, when all the effects in the 50s went on my ass. Sparks from models and the like. Take a look at it, if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie. Mystery Science Theater has a candidate.
