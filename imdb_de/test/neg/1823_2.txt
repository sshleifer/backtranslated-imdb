Simply lousy Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza vehicle. Pinza had a beautiful voice, but he rarely uses it in a movie that reminded me of "The Student Prince" with grown-ups. Pinza is not a leader either. He looks like an elderly man ready to receive social security and fishing. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely thin and the side cast of Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds has little to do. Sir Cedric Hardwicke comes in at the end announcing that our King Ezio should return to his people better. The faster I am, the better. Does Lana Turner really sing with Pinza? Not bad, if it is her. The picture also reminds me in some ways of the movie "The Prince and the Showgirl" of 1960 with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.
