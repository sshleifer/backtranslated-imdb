You know that you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is being played completely on a single cheap programmable synthesizer with no melody or rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see how someone can record the film seriously, even if it rates it badly. This movie is far below "bad". <br /> <br /> The continuity of this movie is slaughtered outrageously. In a combat scene we turn, the hero (in blue jeans and undershirt), with two revolvers in hand a corner; he doubles back, but now he has two semi-automatic machines in his hand; He turns a corner and now has an automatic rifle in his hand; He chases down a hallway and comes out with a shotgun (suddenly dressed in a standard fatigue jacket). He then leaves the building with another automatic rifle. Or here's one for the books - a bus rams into a car at high speed; the car flies, thrown by a gigantic explosion - getting on the bus, which is completely unharmed by the same explosion? The narrative continuity suffers from an equally numbing sense of unreality; The bad guys really want to kill the hero - obviously - but every time they knock him down or otherwise put him in a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide that they "want to live him to see that!" Huh One of the funniest moments of the movie is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer visited him; then the villain decides that he will not hit them; and despite the fact that the villain, the hero, and his lawyer all know what's going on, the hero writes a note to the lawyer, and next we see that the note is passed on to the lawyer by another prisoner, although we never do this See how the hero gives it to him. (This lawyer, BTW, has full access to the ATF offices in California, including the confidential computer files.) Huh? Well, but it's a pointless action movie - so what do the action scenes look like? Not bad, surprising; Unfortunately, they were stolen from a dozen Hong Kong films shot five or ten years earlier. The opening scene, a shoot-out in a Junker garage, actually has recordings whose composition is stolen directly from "Hard Boiled" - so clear that it's a miracle John Woo did not sue for plagiarism. <br /> <Other Hong Kong films that have been stolen include "Prison on Fire", "Island on Fire", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II and III (also called "Supercop"). I thought I also recognized some Sammo Hung clips here. In other words, the action scenes are exciting only insofar as they are successful duplication of action scenes from other films. <br /> <br /> There's nothing you can do with this movie if you do not smack and just need a lot of visual stimuli that do not make sense. <br /> <br /> Very funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.
