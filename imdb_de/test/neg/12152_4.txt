Mother tongue native speakers lacked emotion and emphasis on the film. Used too many non-native speakers, especially Jamukha. Too many distractions from current history. Terrible terrible subtitle !!! I wonder where and who made this subtitle. It was in both English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle was in Thai if the English subtitle was sooooo bad! Describe the life of the greatest leader very uninteresting. There are better films by Mongolian directors with very low budget from the 1980s. Honestly, I wonder if the movie critics of the Academy Award are so mild or what? Luckily, some good CGI in some combat scenes were just modest ... not outstanding CGI
