Okay, there's a nice blink and you miss it joke (when the dead rise from their graves, the names of the "horror" directors of the old days like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are mentioned in the gravestones) and the smashing of moral bankrupt repu / con / right-wing villains is a target: harlotry, preaching morality, etc. But why are these soldiers anti-republicans? Because they went to war, most should be Republicans, right? Why do not they kill the enemies who killed them or something? Why do you want to vote ALL against the Republicans? Why did this story turn out to be a movie? Questions were never answered ...
