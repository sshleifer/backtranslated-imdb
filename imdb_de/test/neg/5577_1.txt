I have carefully checked if there is another movie called this, and there is none! But I do not think we all saw the same movie! There is no possibility ! How can you choose more than "1" for this movie ?! The idea of ​​this movie is to say it is acceptable. Oh, and the acting by Dan Gordon (Chris) is pretty good. However, these are the only two acceptable things in this project. The others are ... terrible? It's a very sensitive word to describe the drama of the other actors, the direction, the (so-called) "special effects", even the way the crew filmed! I do not even like the way the camera operators moved to record the scenes! This could be the most wretched movie I have ever seen. I really can not remember a movie that is lower than this ... Maybe there is one, but ... I do not think so ... Ehh, what's done, it's done ... That's the movie and it's too late for someone to change anything. I chose "1", but my realistic vote starts with a "-" (minus sign) in front ...
