Start with the premise that you do everything possible to replace your lost love with a similar look. Throw away your scientific knowledge of a deforming disease (is not that stuff that Leo G. Carroll has pulled together with the spider venom in "Tarantula"). Add to the fact that instead of finding a way to attract the young woman, the main character pursues hard-fought stalking until he becomes fully aware and breaks that crazy conspiracy: if he can make the girl's father sick then help him to recover, she will marry him. The problem is that most events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with half a brain would have seen through things. There is a third party, a woman whom the doctor, played by J. Carroll Naish, has treated with great insensitivity. They know that they will be a factor. There is also a caged gorilla occasionally used for celestial knowledge. Well. There is so little sense to this thing that it plays itself out and people only get their desserts.
