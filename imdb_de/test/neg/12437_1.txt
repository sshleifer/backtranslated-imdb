I recently had to look at this for a project in a sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I ever had to go through. It was like a bad Cinemax movie where all "good parts" were taken out. Bad drama, the fake documentary, the nonsensical conspiracy, and the rudderless direction all make up a terrible, horrible movie. The female characters are basically just there to be sex objects. Consider this exchange: "He is hot." "He has a girlfriend." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "No." * Girl takes boy's hand and leads him behind some bushes. Boy comes out and sits next to other boys, girl strolls out * "Did you hit that?" "No, I did not want to take off my pants." "You are stupid." Another girl appears as the boys drive to Beverly Hills, sit in the trunk with one of the guys, and when they're dragged to the beach by a police officer, they see the car bounce up and down. <br /> <br /> A homosexual pervert, triggerless Clint Eastwood is similar, and what seems like a Luchador mask adds insanity. One of the boys is caught by a policeman, nobody cares. One of the boys is shot, nobody cares. Someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised and that shows. Just awful. I would never recommend this movie.
