If you are in the mood to laugh at a really bad movie (as bad as Ken Russell can be), you have to try it. You manage to feel like you've just landed in a .25 porn room, and you can just smell the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner struts around with a blond wig and has tricked her into pretending to be a "two-bit hooker" (she really does a good job in the garment industry and has been so badly injured by men that this is the only way as it is) and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who may want to kill her (another movie ending with Tony Perkins on the train). Annie Potts appears and must not betray the usual joke, which is reason enough to hate this movie. The kinky ones will love the sex scenes, so rent the UNrated version in the RED box so you can see Turner giving a cop a foretaste of his buddy (I had to stop the VCR until we stopped laughing).
