Sorry, that was a sorry excuse for a movie. One action that was so ridged was like a block of Swiss cheese and a bunch of characters who seemed to me to be completely free from interpersonal relationships. Unless, of course, Carlyle and Lee-Miller, whom I could have sworn, should be in love. Unlike the unification of Tyler and Miller, most, like the rest of the film, were utterly unconvincing .. though the end product was unsightly and amusing. All the wrong reasons, the production values ​​were high and deserve recognition. But unfortunately the end result was garbage. What did everyone think ...? You should definitely have packed up early.
