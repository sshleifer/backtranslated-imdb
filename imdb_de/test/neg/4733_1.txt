Where do you start? I think only three more movies got me to post a review on IMDb and everyone was positive. As for that ...? Insane, abominable, tragic, embarrassing, catastrophic, stupid, irritating, totally and completely beyond the terrible, it does not matter to have given a theatrical release. I think I'm literally shocked. <br /> <br /> I'm not a snob. I did not expect beautiful filmmaking or intense character depth, but that's a joke. We MUST just ask for more of the movies we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like the black death.
