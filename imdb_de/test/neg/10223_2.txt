Walt especially loved the quality. So how come that the producers at Disney are such a terribly worked, grossly traded (even for the family)! THE BIG GREEN had a good concept. And since it's Disney, you know how the movie will be obvious. But THE BIG GREEN is terrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, who is still alive, adds another terrific performance to his CV. <br /> <br /> Children who have too much time in the small town of Elma can get their new teacher to play football. The children do not know anything. And, graciously, we see Steve Guttenburg trying to attack the teacher from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The acceleration of the camera work does not work. THE BIG GREEN accelerates the pace of the characters to push the movie. Children are not idiots. They will prevail if you give them enough notice without showing all this trash. Guttenburg should have once in his life refused an offer to join this film. Even the pretty Olivia d'Abo should have canceled this time. THE GREAT GREEN can be described as "The Big Bomb".
