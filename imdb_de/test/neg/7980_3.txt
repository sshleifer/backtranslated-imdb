Produced by International Playhouse Pictures, it seems like being filmed in a dollhouse. Everyone is a liar, everything is fantastic, like a toy without good reason. I'm not saying that in all the movies everything should be absolutely realistic, but such incredible fantasy things and situations in a movie are far too much. How did you bring these fine actors, especially actors, to this movie? It's nice to see Mia again. If we understand why her husband wants to kill her, Mia does it well. Not funny, not moving, just wrong. Stephen Dorff appears shortly at the end, perhaps for a play, less for a movie, but this is not a yardstick against which to measure things. Awful.
