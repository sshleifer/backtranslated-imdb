Watchable but pretty awful. How shocking that this was the last directorial credit of the great Gregory La Cava! Even in his better known roles Gene Kelly does not interest me. He seems complacent, hostile and self-centered. Here, along with a little actress like Marie Wilson, he seems to show these characteristics in spades. <br /> <br /> Marie Wilson plays an heir who falls in love with a military man and is exceptionally hard and disagreeable. The actors seem to work hard to overcome the hard, unpleasant core of the image, and they're OK. <br/> <br /> The know-it-all is said to be funny, but it seems like an extended reef on the prissy bits that Franklin Pangborn was famous for (and in which he was generally funny despite their stereotyping - unlike this one Guy.) Phyllis Thaxter is as always very sexy in a rather underdeveloped secondary action.
