Coronado is notorious for being brought to you "by the Digital Effects team behind Independence Day." This is even more of a spectacular failure just because he was faced with ID4. This ridiculous confusion of a movie starts with a brainless premise and goes down completely from there. A wealthy, soon married couple in Beverly Hills is the subject of this idiotic story. Claire's fiancee has gone on a business trip for Christmas, so she spontaneously flies to Switzerland to spend the holidays together. I especially love that her first reason was because he had left some documents at home that she thought might be needed. She grabbed her and shouted after him as he drove off, concluding that it was best to fly to the other side of the planet instead of calling his cell phone. I refuse to believe that a couple who lived in such a mansion full of caves had no knowledge of the existence of mobile phones. <br /> <br /> Up to this point, though, the movie is unbelievably bad, but look THIS starts getting bad! She comes to Switzerland and when she can not find her husband, she gets cake and calls her friend to complain how unfair it is. This woman is not an action hero and she is definitely not a German Indiana Jones because she screams out loud. She's an overgrown cheerleader, a spoiled female student whose outdoor experience is likely to dig her spikes out of the ground when she gets drunk enough to walk on the cliff during a wine and cheese party. " She gets a hint that her fianc√© is in South America, so she totally flies to get it. Once there, that idiot thinks she'll go alone into the jungle, scouting the enemy base and saving her poor helpless friend. She laughs at a comment about the danger of getting in there, and later flips out because she finds out there are battles. "They never said anything about the fight!" <br /> <br /> There is a point where Claire and another journalist drive this huge truck over a bridge several hundred meters high, suspended by two to four. Literally. There are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied with strings, and these idiots decide to drive over them. Not only does it collapse under the weight of the truck, but Claire can fall down, fall hundreds of feet and land on her back in the shallow river below. Later, she remembers the event and laughs at it like, oh maybe it was only a hundred. At least she was not twirling gum on her fingers. <br /> <br /> What's really sad about this catastrophically bad movie is that they even managed to get a terrible performance out of the hugely talented John Rhys-Davies REAL Indiana Jones veteran. There's a lot of nonsense about an uprising at the end of the film, where we meet an extremist rebel leader who, when we met him for the first time, has such a tight accent that he rolls his R's like a Ruffles commercial. Later he talks like a guy they pulled off the streets of Venice Beach. Incredible. <br /> <br /> The special effects are negligible. The team that brought you the Independence Day because they were just involved in ID4 just went through the motions and threw together some matted and bluescreen shots, I have to believe because they just had nothing better to do. The story is surprisingly bad, and Kristin Dattilo, who sees many other IMDb users as the sole reason for the film, does not put the slightest effort into their performance. Maybe she thought the Digital Effects team behind Independence Day could give chaos some meaning. <br /> <br /> And considering how far they fell, they might have thought that they could. <br /> <br /> You could at least have tried.
