Without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. Lazy and without structure, tension or history, the film runs on the thin premise of "putting together a show". Conflicts are resolved within two to three seconds of their beginning, and the dialogue is random and random. Everything is put together in a slapdash order, and Stepping Out often feels more like a deleted scene roll than a real movie. The film only seems to exist as a showcase for loud and completely random Liza music numbers. Shelly Winters is featured in the far superior octo epic "Tentacles," and the REAL Liza can be found in the Showtime release of "Queer Duck: The Movie."
