A Hard Sale: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into a loud, roaring film about World War II's Shakespeare Theater troupe, saddled at the end of its leash with an aged, stormy, brilliant, but unreliable star. The actor's brisk assistant works diligently to make his master dress and dress up for a production of "King Lear" (during an air raid!), But both men lose track of their riddling situation. Based on the dying years of actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this highly praised production seems to be a welcome haven for scenery fans. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this time in his career not in the elderly) seems too robust and too quick to play the actor. Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) can not modulate Sir's moods and coherence seizures in a way that makes sense to us, so he stops one move with the commanding echo of his voice in one scene, and the next one curiously falls apart With such a wreckage of a man in the midst of health and fitness mistakes one would expect a dedicated assistant to make a great effort to protect his boss (and his future), though the servant Tom Courtenay would prefer Finney's spines and badger and incentive relax. Courtenay, who played that role on stage (and was nominated for Best Actor Oscar alongside Finney), is much more attuned to his role, and eventually his Blues commands and confusion become the only real emotion in the film. Luckily, they are not pecking at each other, and scenario-maker Harwood takes care not to get into a pattern of hate-love (which may be perceived in the first act of the movie). But without a juxtaposition of servants and celebrities, there is nothing to see in this portrait except the worsening of narcissism, the hint of what once was. * 1/2 of ****
