It must be remembered that the Gammera films, like many of the Gozilla films of the first series, were actually aimed at children. Little Kenny and his cohorts live out the daydreams of the children in the audience: they walk around and play with top secret stuff while the adults stand there and allow it; They frolic with monsters, and even when the bad guys come in, they're never in real danger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first Gammera movie is a divergence because the child is being punished and put in danger, but the rest of the series is a pure wish fulfillment. <br /> <br /> As a critic said, these are not failed adult films, but successful children's films.
