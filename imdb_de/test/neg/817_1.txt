I say that. If you want to see art, visit an art gallery. If you want to watch a movie, go to a theater. The attempt to intertwine art and film proves catastrophic consequences in "Where the Heart Is". An interesting cast is completely wasted in this embarrassment. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". They like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby". You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill". Especially if you like Christopher Plummer, see "The Silent Partner" because his character here is a terrible embarrassment. In fact, this entire production is embarrassing. Sure, the human artwork is fascinating for a few minutes. So make a brief outline, but do not subject the audience to nonsensical nonsense and masquerade as a filmed conversation. - MERK
