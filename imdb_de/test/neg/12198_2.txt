I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and I really liked it. I do not know what happened to the movie because it was awful. Maybe a dialogue that works on stage sounds simply incoherent on screen. At least I could not wait for this movie to be over. Action is universally exaggerated. Only Kevin Spacey has it together, and he seems to know that he's in a bad movie and can not wait to get out.
