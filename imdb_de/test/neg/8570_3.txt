The headline describes it exactly. This dribbling of a movie was nothing more than the typical group of teenagers who accidentally killed someone, now that someone has hunted / killed them 20 years later. The only twist is, instead of an angry former classmate or likeable psycho / loser, it was a nun. Now nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls, blah blah blah, girl accidentally / deliberately drown the nun, blah blah blah, nun chases the girls, people die, movie ends. The only thing that made this watch work were the death scenes, which were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door that tears off the fat lady's arms), but even they could not make this a great movie. Brian Yuzna should hang his head because he sticks to this garbage. I am sure glad that I rented it and did not buy it, otherwise I would be incredibly angry. If you want a nonstop strip to delight the senses, look at Demonia or something. Stay away from this garbage.
