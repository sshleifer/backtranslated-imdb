No Holds Barred is a movie that should never be taken seriously. It's shit for a serious movie. Look at it more in the way you should plan 9 from space. They are one because they are both so bad that they are funny. The funny moments in No Holds Barred are usually the ones that should not be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan, since only he can play her) grabs the limo driver from the front after his first meeting with Brell (Kurt Fuller), it comes to a part of the movie everyone should see. It could be the funniest scene ever, I swear. Anyway, as someone thought, this movie would make money, I'll never know, and that person should probably be beaten into submission. I hope they were at least fired. This movie deserves a 1 out of 5 rating on my scale and this one is just for the unwanted funny parts.
