I can overcome the political parody. Even if it was a "Masters of Horror" jewelry. <br /> <br /> But I can not get over the fact that our war heroes (and their victim) are used as pawns. The political message of the horror maker. <br /> <br /> It was insulting for me to profane Arlington and our heroes. I have a family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even portray the mutilated Arlington graves makes me puke. <br /> <br /> I'm done with Dante and finished with MOH.
