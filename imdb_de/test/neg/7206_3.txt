OK, I gave three A three! It only deserves a star for which no questions have been asked. <br /> <br /> If you look at the movie seriously and consider it a real B horror movie, it will get a star. But I think it's obvious in the first few minutes of the movie that we're a crap. <br /> <br /> With this movie, I and the buddy I watched could turn off the movie. I've done a little more "Hollywood," but instead we've decided to rip this whole movie from start to finish , We laughed so often that I almost saw a comedy. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful ..... The effects and death sequences are so bad ... The story is a shit ... ... <br /> <br /> But the fact that they are trying to make a serious horror movie ... unimaginable! <br /> <br /> The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters go in a supposedly "dark cellar" that is clearly lit and they pretend to be unable to see bones kicking hanging from the ceiling bahahahaha, just terrible ..... <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh how crappy this movie is, along with the fact that it was made in 2004, to watch this movie. .. <br /> <br /> Wait, why am I writing so much? Nobody knows anything about this movie ... I doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.
