The previous comments are too generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I had a lot of fun showing it to friends, seeing it and calling it "unbelievable" before. "No words can express how I think about it" "This film will move you" As expected, the friends accepted these inconspicuous comments as enthusiastic confirmation. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I wanted to impose on people was worth the $ 5 I paid for the film. On the other hand, a friend says I owe him back 90 minutes of his life. Above all, I enjoyed the "angle view" of parts of the film. Really great in its absurdity.
