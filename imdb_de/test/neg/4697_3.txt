I just came back when I saw "Comedian". It was ok. It made me look at the screen. It's just not the kind of thing I'd like to pay $ 7 for. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong now, it would be a great HBO feature. If this was something that I saw on TV, I would be thrilled right away. It gives an amazing look at what comics go through before and after the performance. Anyone who likes comics will be interested. <br /> <br /> But when I go to the cinema, I like to chat. I am not here to be educated. Now I know what Jerry Seinfeld is like before he goes on stage ... great. But to be honest, I prefer to laugh about his jokes rather than anything. <br /> <br /> One more thing: With the bad attitude that Onry Adams has; I would expect him to accept my order from Burger King before I see his HBO special. He was not funny. He's the kind of person you like to hate.
