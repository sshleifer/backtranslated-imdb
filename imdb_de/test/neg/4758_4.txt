This frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved as a teenager, but now I find it rather uncomfortable. Undoubtedly, in the May-to-September appendices, what the older party has in mind is either pleasure or the inability to face the reality of aging, or both. And the younger most likely is looking for the kind parents she (or he) missed as a child. These underlying agendas now seem to me more pathetic than romantic; There is also something pretty robbery about them. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell looked a bit embarrassed - which he should do - as he played the older lover in this stupid story. At the age of fifty, he tried to play the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man who was toying with a teenage boy. But the young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout - pretty and cheeky and full of vinegar - when the seventeen-year-old, who gave himself to the morally upright and honest scriptwriter as a kind of "gift", as a subject to study. Her spirited performance has given me a better rating than this movie would otherwise have deserved. Anne Francis was cast as Powell's beautiful but fragile fiancee, managing her tiny role. <br /> <br /> Some of the dialogues were also quite amusing, so it's not total leaching. <br /> <br /> 5/10
