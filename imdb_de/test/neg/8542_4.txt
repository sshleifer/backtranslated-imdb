Jess Franco is making commercials and he has made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history, and God bless him for that. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a really horrible movie that does not meet its usual standards. <br /> <br /> Evaluation films should be judged by history, sex and gore. What else is there? This movie fails on most of these benchmarks. The plot is paper thin and places a young girl in the jungle between cannibals. We really do not get any information about why she and her dad were even there. As expected, her father is the "Big White Chief" and she becomes the goddess who sits naked in trees. Add luck-hunters and gems, and you've saved the girl for greedy intentions. The characters are fed up and do not add credibility to the process. <br /> <br /> Gore? No or at least very little. This film is often mentioned in the same way as the classic Italian cannibal films. Those who seek this kind of blood must go the other way. Apart from a cheap headline, this film contains surprisingly little blood and courage. <br /> <br /> As I can say best, this movie is only available because Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto could walk around naked Actually, "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) does the full frontal Heavy-lifting, while the two jungle ladies are naked. Yes, there are love scenes ... probably the most sterile Franco has ever watched. The women are beautiful, but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic. <br /> <br /> This film only smells like cheap pudding. The sets are ridiculous. The acting is awful and the editing is confusing. There is no real story to hold this together and not enough budget (or effort) to shock or waver. I think Franco fans now expect more from the master of exploitation.
