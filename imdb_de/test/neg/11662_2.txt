Now I remember what the 'indie' filmmakers had demolished before Pulp Fiction. It was David Lynch, right? I hunted this thing to see Kyle Secor. What a waste of a perfectly good Bayliss. It was so painful to watch him, as if someone you love is terribly ill and you can not do anything. Almost every clich√© in the book: the desert, the psycho, the quirky mob boss, the biker Tracy Walker (who luckily was in just one scene, but I kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and deep: "If a man wants to know where he is going, he has to see where he was ") or something like garbage) I have a theory why so many indies are scarce in the desert. I think it's because they can save money on lighting. <br /> <br /> If you want to be in pain, look for this movie and let it be seen. If you're a fan of Kyle Secor, check out Homicide's Court TV reruns. If you're looking for a good, whimsical street thriller, check out Wild At Heart. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why no one has heard of Delusion! My God, what a waste of a good title.
