Is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is Japanese and that your arrogant star racer is German, does it seem a bit over the top? Maybe that's the way it is on the international racetrack, but if all the Americans had expelled them, like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who had learned how to trade), I would choose another country. Formal movies can be good, but the characters must be sympathetic and no one meets those criteria in this movie. To put it briefly - a very bad movie.
