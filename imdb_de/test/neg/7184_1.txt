I'm still not sure what this movie is about. I think the boy was afraid to go blind and started to imagine all sorts of strange things. that does not explain why he wanted to kill his new little brother or the relentless boredom that was found in this movie. If you watch this movie, you wish you were blind, so you did not have to see this experiment in a meaningless state. Skip this steamy pile and opt for everything else in the video library .... everything else.
