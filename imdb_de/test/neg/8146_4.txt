Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang are trying to improve this with a surprise party. Not knowing that all the decorations and preparations are for him, Froggy sabotages everything, just to find out too late that the party is for him. The bits work, but I do not think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going, and since much of the humor needs a surprise to make it work, the whole thing fails. I find in a funny way that the movie just missed somehow. It was the kind of thing that they had actually thought that this was more than just a dropout. Worth a try if you lower your expectations
