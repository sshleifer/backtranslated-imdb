When the naive young Eddie Hatch, a window dressing in the Savory's Department Store, falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus steps off her pedestal and gives Eddie more than he expected. This shrill example of what Hollywood can do with a Broadway musical underscores the inhumane story and eliminates most top-notch songs. The goal was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment, while Ava Gardner's rise became a superstar. Robert Walker as Eddie loses himself in an ungrateful role. Eddie is not only naive, but trembling and unhappy. Gardner is beautiful, but the only things in the movie's life are Olga San Juan as Eddie's loving, but jealous girlfriend, Tom Conway as the polite owner of Savory's and Eve Arden as Savory's seasoned, clever secretary. It's a role that Arden could play in his sleep, and she's good at it. <br /> <br /> The musical opened on Broadway in 1943 and made Mary Martin a big star. The only purpose of a musical, however, is to have music. Since One Touch of Venus should be a kind of social satire, Kurt Weill, who composed the lyrics, and Ogden Nash wrote the lyrics, a series of stylish, witty songs and a masterpiece. Without the satire or the clever songs or Martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the movie becomes a weak comedy fantasy, where a lot of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is processed to death. <br /> <br /> The producers of the movie not only kicked out most of the Weill / Nash songs, but also brought the film's director Ann Ronell to write new lyrics for one of the surviving songs, keen observation into a love story. Romance. Ronell was not a hack; She wrote Willow Weep for me. I wonder what she was thinking while replacing or improving Ogden Nash's clever work. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film is the masterpiece by Weill / Nash. "Speak Low" is as much a love song as anyone who has ever written. Eileen Wilson, who simultaneously syncs Gardner, receives one of these extremely professional and lifeless treatments. Dick Haymes contributes a choir. <br /> <br /> As for Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a major music director, composer and lyricist. Sincerely, Your Song: The women at Tin Pan Alley are a fascinating documentary of a few women who have made it into the industry, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields, and Dana Suess. And for those who would like to hear what was only part of the Weill / Nash score from the original Broadway cast, you may be able to locate the One Touch Of Venus (1943 - Original Cast) / Lautensang (1946 - Original Cast) CD do ). The music is paired with Lute Song, another Broadway show with Martin.
