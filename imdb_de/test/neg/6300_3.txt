The costumes are outrageous and the Australian outback scenery is fun, but there's an advantage to this story - a common advantage - about drag queens. I especially noticed that in Terrence Stamp's character "Ralph Bernadette Bassenger". Maybe that was appropriate, because there is nothing "good" about Ralph-Bernadette and his group of "queens". <br /> <br /> Once again we get the strong liberal bias that says it all works. If you are not "with" - or pro-gay in this case - then you are a homophobe. (Gasp!) <br /> <br /> What is really disturbing is the end when a little boy takes off with his "alternative lifestyle" father and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because he fits the story, but because he does to the agenda fits the people who wrote the script. Pathetic.
