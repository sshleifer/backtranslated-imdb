Another direct video from Disney that is essentially perfect for kids. The problem with Kronk's New Groove is that anything that made the first movie a great ride is replaced by a sadder and gloomy movie. In this film Kronk learns many lessons at the expense of others. It takes a lot of time to spend on creating a more entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns, and a Mrs. Birdwell hopes to defeat Kronk's camp counseling championship. All this leads to Kronk confronting his father and his disapproval of his son's way of life. <br /> <br /> From the Lord of the Rings to the thriller of Michael Jackson: The New Groove of Kronk recycles every time he can entertain his viewers. If you loved the original or are looking forward to the upcoming TV series about Kuzco, I recommend Kronk to his loyal fans.
