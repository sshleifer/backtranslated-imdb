This is the kind of film that could have ruined multiple careers if trash could ruin movie careers today. Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in the days before the operation, she should really do it. I'm dressed. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone on to much better things, since this ... this ... this ... well, hell, a piece Rubbish. <br /> <br /> Strangely, all the key players have achieved bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted, but deserves a grudging admiration. I mean, anything that is not worth it is not worth doing well. But he did it well anyway. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there was a bright, shiny aspect: Ray Liotta, who is in the bottom of the credit list, stole everything. Liotta was great hypnotizing! Hypnotic! Fascinating. <br /> <br /> I saw this dump when it was relatively new, in a friend's private theater. For some strange reason, my friend loved it. I somehow think that Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and honestly she should not have), although he tried to argue that there were other, more artistic reasons. Anyway, I thought after his first scene that Ray Liotta would become a star or at least a highly respected actor. Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta almost made it worth seeing. It is worthwhile to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, his name is now usually listed above or up. <br /> <br /> Even in a garbage heap, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. <br /> <br /> Only when you see this garbage, be ready to hold your nose. Every protagonist is either amoral or immoral. Terrible movie. Terrible movie idea. <br /> <br /> Added comment: Too many people answered "Was this comment helpful?" with a "no" because they disagree with the opinion expressed. Maybe IMDb should instead ask this question: "Do you agree with these opinions?"
