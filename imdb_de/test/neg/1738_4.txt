This movie started out as a pretty decent-looking movie that never really got going, but became predictable and even a bit stupid. Some scenes were pretty well done, the photography and the cuts in combination with sounds and the like made the viewing a bit more interesting, but since the story was pretty slow, it was not able to keep the interest in life. And more importantly, it's not scary at all! It was meant to be a horror movie, but there was not a single scene that was scary or exciting. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the actors were not that great either, no colorful characters you'll remember for the rest of your days. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie that can not be viewed, and when you're done watching, it will not take long for it to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The reason I looked at him was that I had read some reviews in which he achieved the best results, but I disagree and instead would rank 4 out of 10. If you still want a Japanese horror, I would suggest watching Ju-On instead! <br /> <br />
