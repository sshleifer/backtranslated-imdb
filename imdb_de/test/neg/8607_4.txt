Sex Lives of the Potato Men is about the sex life of several men involved in the delivery of potatoes. So there are no surprises. It's indeed what you'd expect from the title: it's a quirky comedy that includes sex and potato people. Sometimes the movie works. It's a nervous, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather insignificant and more average men who have problems with women. Where the film obviously does not work and why it failed at the box office is that the quirky, uncomfortable parts may just be a bit too bizarre and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing while a man is hung from a cellar ceiling masturbating over another man while he loves his wife, I just moan most of us awkwardly and wonder what Andy Humphries was thinking. Well, maybe we'll be shown what he thought too clearly.
