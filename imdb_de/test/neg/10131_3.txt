THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 70s, in which the former married couple Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood appear as hesitant lovers. She has polio and retired as a pop songwriter. He is an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely passionate about her. Her affair, as it is, is doomed from the start, and she knows it, but she goes along anyway. Two things to watch out for when you are trapped in this situation: Woods Jane Fonda hairstyle, which is never slapped, no matter what, and a tune that she sings early in this terrible movie. She sings it for four, five, or six minutes, so you know it's classic padding between commercials. It's also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who played Wood's voice should have been shot out of her misery. Also pay attention to all farmhouse tops and dresses. In comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with short-cut hair and a range of classic suits.
