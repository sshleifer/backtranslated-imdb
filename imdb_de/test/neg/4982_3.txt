Good things out of the way, first: <br /> <br /> Underdog's voice was FINE. But Jason Lee is great himself, that's really no surprise. <br /> <br /> Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) did a good job as well, because the garbage was given to him. He did the part shockingly well. And also Patrick Warburton, the feeble-minded assistant. Well, it was an idiotic character, but it did so well that I actually liked the character better than the protagonist. The lines given to him were childish, but funny. <br /> <br /> Alex Neuberger did a terrible job and hopes he will never act again. His "scream" was so disgustingly fake. Silence. Silence. "Aaahhhhhhh". In the scene where he hears the dog talking, a "Oh no, impossible!" Instead of the pathetic, fake screaming it would have been enough. And then there was the girl and her dog chasing Patrick's character Cad on the roof. That makes sense at first, she is a "reporter". A school reporter, but still a questioning mind. But why, why has HELL carried her dog with her? It was worthless and the damn dog did not even say anything other than a heartless "oh, underdog!" Her presence was extremely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall, the script was pathetic. The only reason why I gave this movie a 3 is Barsinister, his support and the voice of an underdog.
