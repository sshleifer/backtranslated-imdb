I was also disappointed with this movie. For starters, the things that happen to him do not seem too terrible to me (Sorry male chauvinist PoV). As one of the Lady kidnappers said concretely: "Most men would _pay_ be in your position." What he answers "But that's not a _my_ choice". OK, OK, honestly, how bad was it really? Please inform us. But now the kicker: He lets _oneone_ know only after the end of the film (unseen). Not his girlfriend, not mentor, not the police, nobody. Instead, he comes with a brilliant plan to find every girl he knows so he can recognize the tattoo (or something) of one of his kidnappers. I thought he had had enough unpleasant sex in the 12 days of his captivity? Is not it time to take a break from all this? For me, his, to say the least, ill-advised actions broke the "suspension of disbelief" of the film. I took out a book and watched the last half hour out of the corner of my eye.
