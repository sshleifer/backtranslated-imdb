I usually do not like commenting on acting in a movie because it's the only thing that keeps people from going after a movie. In this movie I will make an exception. The acting in this film is below average. I mean halfway into the movie, I wonder how the hell the producer and / or the director got around to make such an ensemble of people who can not act. Although the production value was good, the poorly written story was only compounded by the poor performance of the actors, and there are even half-hearted attempts to turn the film's end, which is quite confusing. Are all Spanish horror films so disappointing?
