At the beginning I am slightly satisfied. I'm by no means a real critic, and films that find terrible critics, friends, family members, and newspapers can even be fun to watch. <br /> <br /> not this one here. > <br /> I got it because it was the latest Wesley Snipes movie in my DVD store. I like Snipes, but that was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> bad story, bad actor, continuity, grumpy sound, oppressive places, pseudo-snipes the movie. <br /> <br /> They even left some markings in the shots where a car should stop. <br /> <br /> and I'm not talking bad of "small production company / young director / low budget" where you can ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathy. <br /> <br /> A popular action-action movie that has long been disappointing like no other.
