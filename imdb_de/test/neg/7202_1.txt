That's about the BAD piece of garbage I've ever had when I felt unwell. The story was embarrassingly amateurish, the graphics were awful and the acting ... I've never seen worse acting in my life. A kindergarten class could develop a creepier, better written and entertaining concept. I feel sorry for anyone who wastes their time on this film, as well as the actors who have agreed to the work. It was obvious that they were given no suitable direction. The authors must have spent their time at the film school in the "back room" to play Peaknuckle. Many professors wereted a lot of time on these two. I would be really embarrassed to admit that I knew her.
