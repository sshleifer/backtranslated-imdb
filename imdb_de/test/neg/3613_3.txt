I will not judge this movie as terrible, mainly because I kind of like it, I was one of the summer days when I was so lame to do anything, and decided to rent a movie in the stupid part of the video store. Besides, I did not sleep last night and the movie woke me up ... let's start with the autopsy, OK, the movie has a strange plot, firstly isolation, there's an expedition, they're isolated on an island there is no gas on the boat, so there is no convincing performance on the actor (so far), the main problem begins after the idea of ​​isolation, the pov of a snake, then another, ... then another, then snakes that change , then false spooks, many, and if we believe that the film is a good way to sustain the tension, the tension fails, because after ten or eleven spooks, we are not born. The only scene that makes everything unmistakable is the one Scene in which we experience a drunken lesbian show, which is seen by snakes that seemingly dance. After that, she is no longer a horror adventure, but a comedy movie. The adventure part is also discarded.> For me, the problem in a movie is the third act, it's the one section that's driving the movie for an already-presumed graduation, or if we succeed, we do not have it noticed, like a ninja smoke in our eyes, well ... Snake Island has a bad ending, everything comes to a "by the book" With a confrontation, pursuit and escape sequence it ended in the moment in I had rented the dam copy. The other real problem is the concept. The concept is very important. That's why you believe that dinosaurs come to life or a body full of stings that just wants to live. The main concept of serpents wanting to avenge man after decades of torturing civilization, well ... hmmm, just do not stick to the wall. One thing you'll enjoy (if you look at it with an open mind) are the more bez sequences, naked lesbian girls, a couple of amateur camera angles, the Braindead Tribute with the Grass Cutter, the black guy dying first and that's not everything ... if you want to see snakes, black guys and comedy and prefer bigger budgets, go to "Snakes in the Airplane". <br /> <br /> Hasta moviegoers
