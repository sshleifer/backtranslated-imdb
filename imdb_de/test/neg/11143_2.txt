Quite liked Flesh and was looking forward to Heat, but could not help feeling that Morrissey had brutally exploited most of the "performers" featured here. Tripping naked in narcotic anesthesia, Dallesandro seems to dominate in this function - a formidable and heartbreaking contrast to Flesh. His half-erection in some scenes is the only indication that he may be acting. Most of the time it looks like he's buying drugs. Woodlawn is alright a revelation - she's the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But she is a one-woman show - she rarely gets involved with the other artists, though it must be said that her beer-bottle sex scene definitely overshadows Halle Berry when it comes to cinematic stagings of raw passion. If she crashes on a young, potential lover, this is the wildness of a vampire. Two of the female actresses, Andrea and Jane, have so annoying voices that you have to mute the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that several of these performers committed suicide a few years later or were murdered contributes only to exploitation. But they probably wanted to stand in front of Morrissey's camera anyway. There is probably no worse way to spend a Saturday night, but it brings at least a certain amount of time and a lively place to life.
