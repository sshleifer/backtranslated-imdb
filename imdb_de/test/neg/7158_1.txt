The drama and the drama of the film are fantastic, but the facts and the research are anything but solid. When he was Dr. Bovon cites, in which the documentary tries to make a connection with Mary Magdalene from Mariamene. Bovon later realized that he should be used for literary purposes (eg fables of that time) and not for historical persons. In fact, he believes he does NOT believe that the Mariamene Ossuary in Talpiot is Maria Magdalena. He further commented on his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary, but rather for information on the Acts of Philip (a literary work in the 4th century). <br /> <br /> So what? We've got a director here who took a clip for a fantasy from Philip Philip's Acts of the 4th century and used it specifically to support the inscription of a 1st century ossuary. A very sad stretch and dr. Bovon describes the connection between Jesus and Mary Magdalene as "science fiction" - as this documentary should be properly labeled.
