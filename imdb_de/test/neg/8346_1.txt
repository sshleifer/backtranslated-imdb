Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Obviously this is not intended. It takes about half of the movie until the main characters realize that the big, hilly thing in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half has steered the distraction process through the city with fire engines (right). It certainly made me laugh. Acting makes Arnie look like a RSC member. It's amazing that films like this are commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone approaching an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about Â£ 20. ($ 40) I can see a guy presenting the film to a movie company "Well, there's this big VOLCANO and he breaks out in a CITY ... pretty radical hey" If you can find him in the dollar bins, it's worth the Maybe buy after Most of the other films would look good.
