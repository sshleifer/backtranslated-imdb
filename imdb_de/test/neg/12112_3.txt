This movie is bad. I have seen the evaluated and the unweighted versions. They are terrible !! Well, I know that this is a cheap, low budget spiderman budget, but Spiderbabe is just not good at being bad. It is not funny! Not funny at all !! I wanted to laugh I tried to laugh. But this movie has failed me. At least the unrated version has a lot of nudity to look forward to. And is it because Mundae is not a great-looking woman. From the waist down she is fine, but on the way up much remains to be desired. She looks good in this schoolgirl outfit. If you need to look at this Spiderbabe, rent it first. Rated or not rated, actually makes no difference, they are both bad for me !!
