George Zucco was a good actor who often played roguish-eyed villains with a lustful intensity. But he could not save this boring and flat B-strip. Zucco plays the usual crazy scientist Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that Wolf's blood injected into humans can create an invincible army of wolf men who can win World War II (go figure!) Experimenting with Pedro the Craftsman (Glenn Strange) Zucco creates a werewolf that one Dave Allen has played in his comedy sketches! Pedro is obviously based on Lennie of mice and men, and you almost always expect him to say "Duh, okay, George." There is a startling moment when the werewolf kills a child by reaching through the window and grasping it. Most of the time it is a routine and a pedestrian - very pedestrian - who goes 77 minutes through all the old clich√©s that are made much better in others movies. We also get the motive of vengeance revenge from Son An Frankenstein Bond is located! Zucco is wasted, and you only have to see him in films like Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, The Mummy's Hand, and Dr. Renault's Secret, to see how wasted. A few atmospheric marsh scenes really offer everything. And the scene in which Zucco shows his doubters his wolfman technique (again in the shadow of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) is unintentionally funny. <br /> <br /> Not one of the better 40s B movies.
