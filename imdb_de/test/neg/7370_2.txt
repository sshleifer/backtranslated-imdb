It's really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what is just a waste of talent. The plot is a clich√©. The director is too confident and the characters are almost cartoons. One of the most disappointing aspects of this film is the performance of Gerard Depardieu in English (this film was simultaneously shot in French and English). Although he is one of the best actors in the film, he gives the worst performance of all. But I have to say that Bianca Gervais came very close ... <br /> <br /> On the positive side, newcomer Juliette Gosselin performs amazingly well in both versions. Unfortunately that's the only good thing I remember about this movie ... <br /> <br /> By the way, I have to apologize for my not very good English ...
