This was my very first "Bollywood" movie and I found it in the same way as many other viewers - through "Ghost World". After reading a bit about the Bollywood film industry this week, I understand a bit why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror movie. However, "Something for Everyone" is not always a coherent product. <br /> <br /> The ultra-groovy musical dance number "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" fascinated the world in a way it probably could not have done in 1965. Now everything is online, and many people are looking for a good English Translation. Laxmi Chhaya does a great job of dancing, so that everything looks fresh, new and funny, even if every normal person was exhausted! It governs! <br /> <br /> On the beach with Miss Kitty is a fun and a nice melody in contrast to the horror plot. Nevertheless, I sing it a week later in Hindi. I have found a rough translation: <br /> <br /> if you want to live in this life, listen to what I say, leave your worries behind and attend the party, take my advice <br /> <br /> Those who want to live with laughter and singing, let down their hair and relax the people of this world. What do you know? Come to me and I'll explain, whoever's there, who's going to see me, stop worrying in this world where fish swim free, here and there. <br /> <br /> My second favorite in the movie is Butler's dream, where Mehmood is thrilled with Miss Kitty's dance. The electric Tiki-like idols are as wonderfully sticky as the entire set of that number. Online, I had seen it described what would happen if "Liberace" would puke !! Have fun. <br /> <br /> Gumnaam is not a good movie as a whole. That's why I rated it with 3. It's actually a real stinker of a movie with funny, cheesy music numbers that have nothing to do with the murder story.
