That's a stupid movie. Like many of these karate films, it is poorly written, uncomfortable and sometimes just stupid. The action is really not everything and the movie leaves something to be desired. Everyone here talks in a good mood, does bad karate and does very bad acting. <br /> <br /> Pay close attention to Scatman Crothers, he's too good for this movie as a whole. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is really bad. Everybody is, there are so many parts in this movie that make absolutely no sense. The supposedly loving / elusive scene with Hendry and Kelly, what the hell was that? You destroyed this man's guitar for no reason! <br /> <br /> And then there were the obligatory girls on trampolines !!! What was that now? They were five seconds in the movie, then you never heard from them again !!! Then there's the whole racially charged element of the movie that's all cool, but in this movie, there's absolutely nowhere to go. That said, that's good for a laugh, but do not look at it again.
