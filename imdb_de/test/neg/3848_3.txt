Just to save you the $ 3, or whatever it costs to rent movies in your local video store, and the painful hour - and how long this movie is - this is a simple plan. Go to a friend, persuade him to rent the plague for you, look at the first 30 seconds and apologize to leave. The opening sequence is really funny and definitely worth seeing. Unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is terrible. Without the shower scene at the beginning, this is one of the worst movies ever.
