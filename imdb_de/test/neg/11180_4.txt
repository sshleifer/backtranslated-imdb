There are so few films where only the title contains everything you need to know about the movie. One such movie is I was a communist for the FBI. Another example would be "I married a monster from outer space". <br /> <br /> The really interesting thing about this movie is, how in heaven this name was nominated for an Oscar in the documentary category? It's not a documentary in the truest sense of the word, it's not in this hybrid category of Docudrama either. It's just a rather exploitative film about the work of a covert FBI agent named Matt Cvetic who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and tried to take over the Steelworkers' Union for the Communists and report back to his FBI handlers. <br /> <br /> A documentation of this work may have been interesting, but we got a movie for those paranoid times. I found it intriguing that Cvetic, when he finally broke his cover, was more in charge of the House Un-American Activities Committee than the trial of the leaders of the Communist Party in New York. There was a moment in the film in which Communist Chief Inspector James Millican ordered his supporters to spread the word that the House Un American Activities Committee was made up of a series of right-wing Yahoo's looking for their names in front of the camera. Well, what could this idea have given him? Just connect the dots and undoubtedly the word of J. Edgar Hoover, who tries to give some credibility to HUAC by putting an effective undercover process on the market, rather than in an actual process. Small thing there called cross-examination. Warner Brothers, who produced I Was A Communist For The FBI, later produced Big Jim McLain, in which John Wayne played about a HUAC investigator in Hawaii. HUAC has uplifted the work of the Honolulu PD in the dissolution of a communist spy ring among the dockers. But at least in John Wayne's film nobody claimed that it was a documentary. Frank Lovejoy is in the title role as Cvetic and his FBI dealers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a Pittsburgh teacher who says there are about 30 in this school system, indoctrinating the boys, including Ron Hagerthy, the son of Lovejoy. She has a change of hearts with respect to the Communists, and Lovejoy must rescue her from a killing fate planned by his superiors. Ironically, Hart left the movies and went to work for all places, the United Nations, which is often accused of being a communist nest in the United States. Over half a century later we have really done very few objective works in film or print about the US Communist Party. They were indeed a very active group in the labor movement. The real heroes who stopped them were workers' organizers like Walter Reuther in the UAW or David Dubinsky in the ILGWU. But since they were left-wing people, they just do not have the right propaganda material on the right. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was a communist. The FBI is an exploitative work based on a real life character and a testament to these paranoid times.
