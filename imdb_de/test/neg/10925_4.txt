I mean, really, very, very high and this movie has a dash of entertainment. I do not mean regular high, I mean the high, where reading the phonebook would sting you. Otherwise, save the time out of your life and do something more constructive, like hitting your head on a wall and insulting your own intelligence. In some cases a complete waste of talent (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny, and the master of Shams Shatner) and the kind of crap they deserve (the countless rappers who insist on movies). Not without it laughs (again, chemical help is crucial) and certainly not without insulting the politically hypersensitive (which I always advocate), but it's not worth the time of your life.
