The mission to see the movie "The Cave" was a friend's dream, after seeing the most dramatic trailer seen by lightning from a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers and not much else was. It's too bad that the movie has not changed much more than the trailer. <br /> <br /> The immediate attraction of such a movie is the creature. What will he look like? Why does he live in a cave? How should this differ from the other creatures we have seen in films like Alien and Predator and the relic? The Cave "demons" see alien: Resurrection not far from the skeletal creature and even have Predator in view. Too bad, this is a total rip-off ... Well, let's look at the plot: very confusing and jumping to more and more unlikely turns as a team of cave divers search for a cave and its inhabitants in the Carpathians. The casting was very clear, we want young, hip, hard chicks, chiseled boys and the girls who have a brain must be hot too. We also need to have a racial background if the public feels that the filmmakers have a particular point of view. Totally done, and I'm really tired. <br /> <br /> The other major problem was the end, as if I were saying that there could be a sequel. Please shoot me if there is one. The end marked at the end made me angry. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points he got were more or less appreciative of the creature builders because they spend a high-quality job on the costumes and design of the monsters that dwell in them, even if they looked completely naughty. And on the DVD there is an interesting (still busy) documentation about diving under water. Just look at it when you love new creations of monsters and creatures, but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before, and it was better the first time.
