Most of the people I know, who have seen this movie, and the reviews I've read, is an extremely entertaining thriller that needs to be seen by more people. I did not expect this movie to blow me away, but I certainly did not expect this movie to be mediocre at best, which it is. <br /> <br /> I am no stranger to French films, both of which are French and, after studying as a student, I am aware of clich√©s and idiotic conspiracies that can go unnoticed by the English / American audience. There are some great French films that should be distributed internationally, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> At first, the plot is far-fetched, too complicated and too smart to be entertaining, so you really feel every minute of the 2-hour and 5-minute run, and when all is finally known, you are completely uninteresting. The main character himself lacks real charisma or even acting talent, to focus his attention especially on him and his journey at any time near the crap-end. So, if you've considered swallowing the main twists and turns of the storyline, you're starting to dawn on wasting your time! Actually, I remember switching off before the credits really started after the film's climatic reunion - that was the point where I was sure I was wasting my time almost completely. <br /> <br /> The film is not the case The worst thing I've ever seen seems to be totally overrated. For example, I've read somewhere that it surpasses all Bourne identity films in terms of suspense or even wall-to-wall suspense. I can safely say that some people are picking up this honestly boring movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10 is a generous courtesy rating for this movie I feel, and since I've seen some complete and total stinkers, I'll do it so save the 1s, 2s, and 3s for them ,
