This short topic is a remake of the movie "What Matador?" The 1942 Three Stooges on boys' journey to Mexico and their bullfighting adventures. Although the original short film was made in the heyday of the Stooges, it's not so memorable, and I think he's one of the more mediocre films with Curly Howard. <br /> Like all other shorts with Joe Besser, "<br /> Sappy Bullfighters" is simply pathetic, Moe and Larry should never have quit Besser because his vain, almost female character was totally wrong for the Stooges' violent comedy and Larry tagged nadir for the team, and these shorts are embarrassing to see, this short film was released in 1959 and was the team's swan song with Columbia, maybe Besser was a nice guy, but he was wrong as the third henchman. > <br /> I'm not going to review any other better shorts because I'm just always going to give the same negative feedback, Do yourself a favor and do not look at it, try "In the Sweet Pie and Pie" instead "or" Hoi Polloi "to catch.
