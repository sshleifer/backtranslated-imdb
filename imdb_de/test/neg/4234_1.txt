Although European films are slower and less plott controlled than American films, that goes way too far. It also shows a whole series of incomplete drawn figures doing inexplicable things. It's not fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just awkward and bad. <br /> <br /> What's the message here? That people in France are thoughtful and enter much? That they like to watch other people having sex? You are screaming spontaneously or touching a stranger on his neck? Do not wear a watch when watching this movie because you'll be amazed how little is explained or learned over long stretches of time. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a "police chief" who is deeply disturbed by the brutal murder of a little girl, even though he seems to be really worried. Not only is he upset about his own personal tragedies, he is apparently mentally slow and behaves much like a learning-disabled six-year-old child. He stares blankly, walks stiffly like a small child, speaks softly and delicately, sounds and behaves strangely in all his interactions (though no one seems to notice or interest that, even if it involves police business). He is not a disturbed policeman, rather ambulatory. Imagine Andy Kaufman's Latka character on a taxi, but without humor. Not only is he not credible as a police officer, he is not credible as an adult. That he has won a prize for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing - unless he played the role exactly as it was written, and the mistake lies with the madmen who wrote this thing. The plot is clearly secondary. Do not expect that in the distance you will see something the police would do if a little girl were found murdered. This is not so important, although the implausibility of their behavior is a kind of insult. The problem is that the rest of the movie does not make sense either. That leaves the long close-ups of fields, vegetable gardens, people's faces, and so on. The end seemed particularly ridiculous to me - completely unimpressed by the events that led to it - unless you think, "What could be the worst movie?" The End? "<br /> <br /> There is a lot of sex and nudity, which means something, you want vaginas, you will see vaginas, do not worry, it's art, it has a deep meaning, which I'm not sure about The protagonist, despite his innocent craziness, seems to have some sort of homoerotic throat or cheek fetish. <br /> <br /> Finally, the subtitles are kept in white and often appear on a white background - very hard to read from them - on the other side There are not many dialogues, so this is not a big problem, there is very little sound - not even ambient noise you would expect - in the movie, which adds to the emptiness of the whole experience - old Woody Allen would have had a field day, the This work is parodying. <br /> <br /> That this is an award winning movie is sad, I would hate to see the losing movies. <br /> <br /> Have fun.
