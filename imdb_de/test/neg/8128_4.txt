Sebastian Cabot is a wealthy jerk who wants to buy up all the land because there is oil - although none of the locals know the oil. With the help of a wicked black shooter, they kill and terrorize everyone. When the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to step down and faces those dark forces. Wow. When I saw TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, I felt that I had seen this movie many times and would probably see it again. That's because, in addition to some innovations (such as Sterling Hayden, which uses a harpoon for evil), there is too familiar a plot. Once again we have a rich man who tries to drive all the peasants out to gain control of the whole country. And he has brought rental weapons to force people to sell or kill them. I have been to many films. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in movies, but I just can not recommend it as something other than a bad passerby.
