Superhero Movie (2008) is the youngest in the long series of "spoof" movie films that I so despise. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know it's not terrible enough to put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> When Meet the Spartans is Considered the Bottom of the Bar When it comes to Hollywood movies, Superhero Movie is probably at the top. Unfortunately, Meet the Spartans was indeed far below the cask, and this movie barely makes it. <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebrities. There's Drake Bell (the kid of Disney's Drake and Josh), Leslie Nielson (plane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock) and a few others scattered all over the place. Although it has the star power to light a 40 watt light bulb, the movie does not use humor. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which follow the Spiderman plot, and not a joke is funny. I did not laugh, laugh or smile all the time. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. Do not even think about it. For the love of the cinema, just leave out and maybe they will not come out with another one. <br /> <br /> ... oh, who am I kidding? You will probably come out with another one in the fall.
