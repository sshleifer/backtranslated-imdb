Let's make one thing clear: I really like Snipes's work. In contrast to his other contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually act. However, this film does little to improve its reputation. It's not really unsurpassable - but I'm in no hurry to see it again. If I never saw it again, it would not bother me - there are just a lot of better movies I can waste my stuff on! It's a pity, because with a bit of imagination and a few subtle changes, this could have been a worthwhile movie. Instead, the director has decided to force his audience to submission with too much exaggerated violence and very few characteristics. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have is with Snipes' co-star Silvia Colloca. It's amazing that the producers of this movie have taken the trouble to hire a stunningly beautiful (for my money anyway) and talented actress like Miss Colloca and then give her such a pathetic one-dimensional character to play with. If she's hired to add a bit of "glamor" to the movie, she does not do that very well. There is no nudity in the film and no significant sex scene. Really strange. Given the amount of violence in this film, it is confusing why producers take such a conservative attitude toward sex and nudity. Are we living in 2007 or 1957? What the producers (and probably the actors) have forgotten is that movies should be fantasies. Like most inhabitants of this planet, my life is very boring. I would like to hunt down terrorists, be able to treat myself like Mr. Snipes, and meet with a beautiful young thing like Miss Colloca. This movie does not fulfill any of these fantasies very well. That's exactly why I rate it so bad!
