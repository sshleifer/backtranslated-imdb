This reworked and sloppy spy melodrama with two buffoon (an idealistic and a drug-addicted) California kid who lays secrets to the KGB never seems to have enough steam to sustain tension and tension before dying a very slow death two hours later. The finished product by John Schlesinger gives the impression that he slept most of the time on his director's chair as the film slackens and the actors go to sleep, except for the extremely annoying results of Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The children and friends of the child altar, Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn), are planning a plan to sell secrets to the KGB when Chris gets a job that gives him access to top secret government material allows. Disillusioned with what he as US interferes in foreign policy, the idealistic Chris and the drug-hungry Daulton make contact with the Russians and begin to provide them classified material. When Chris decides that he wants to get out, things start to unravel at an annoying pace. <br /> <br /> The eighties were not good with the respected director John Schlesinger. In the 60s and 70s he had a number of critically acclaimed films in both England and America, but then came Honky Tonk Freeway in 1981 and it was the beginning of the end. The hawk and the snowman put more or less a lid on it. Without the excitement of Marathon Man and the quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier) he had elicited from Leads in the past, Falcon is mostly in circles. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn chews the scenery from start to finish so repulsively that you encourage his torturers to do more for him. Tim Hutton is dominated by his limited actors, and most of his scenes require more rehearsal time. Lori Singer plays as Hutton's girlfriend most of the way with Schlesinger content to film their grim facial expressions. When you emote, you understand why. Only David Suchet as the KGB dealer with penetrating, introspective presence and restraint can hold his own.
