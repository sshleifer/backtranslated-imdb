With such a promising cast and a director of whom I have heard great things, I was absolutely disappointed in this film. It started with signs of a big epic gangster story and turned into a jumbled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes (and yes, I looked at the full length). I love Robert DeNiro and as always he did a good job, but in all his other gangster films, no matter how many people he killed, I always had respect for his character, but in this movie he was a drug addict lowlife, rapist with no concern for anyone frantic. Also James Woods, another good actor, had written some completely ridiculous scenes for him. I thought that the spots where Robert DeNiro had called him crazy and he was flying out of the field were completely out of the box, and in the end, the authors blamed this random commentary on how his father died in a nut house and so did James Woods not to be called like crazy. So much was not developed in this film. We also never know who the men are at the beginning, who try to kill noodles, and we never hear about Joe Pesci's character. It seems that the authors have thrown together five different stories and never fully explained one of them. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the story, when the characters were still young children. The story went smoothly in this part of the film and the kids did an excellent acting job. Overall, I was completely disappointed with this movie and I do not see how anyone can compare it to Godfathers 1 and 2, or even Goodfellas. I'm sad that I wasted four hours of my life watching this movie
