I can not remember the worst movie I saw. The total waste of actors and the time of the audience. If you prefer to sit by your TV and think about when this movie will end, this is the movie for you. People believe that Moscow has a mystical past. But I have to say, I did not expect anything else from Rade Serbedzija, but I expected more from Vincent Gallo. The film lacks plot, character, development, dissolution. The whole movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystical. To be fair, there are some camera effects, but even that is too bad. Over and over the same pictures can be seen. Total waste of time.
