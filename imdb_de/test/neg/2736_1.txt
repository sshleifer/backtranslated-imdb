This movie was so horrible that I do not even know where to start. The only positive thing I can say is that Luke Perry performed well. The entire movie was everywhere, there was no explanation for the cause (just theories) of the outbursts or rationals for their solutions or why it should work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and relationships between them were so cheesy that you just want to laugh !! There was simply no background for one of them. The "love affair" seemed to have been added to the script, it was so awkward. There is an army man. big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with the "AaarrrGH! I am the man!" Attitude, such a pathetic villain. The two sidekicks, who are supposed to be geniuses, behave like two 16-year-old boys. And then they decide to put a rock on someone's shoulder, and for the rest of the movie he coughs like he's dying of pneumonia or something ... and then plays a hero (cheesiest scene of all !!) Help the plan to do, who knows what ... that's never a good sign when you laugh out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene ... in a nutshell; Do not waste your time!
