With a name like "Ten Commandments," you would expect a movie to be representative of the Bible's account, especially for "Exodus." Not so here. This is a standard procedure for any film made by Biblical Hallmark. Do you remember "Noah"? That was absolute fiction and one of the worst movies ever made. At least this film had "something" truth about the original story. Menerith, who starred in this film - a half-brother of Moses - is not included in the original story. Other characters were missing, not to mention important events. What can you ask? Because this should be representative of the actual story; Otherwise, some might believe and believe that this was indeed the case. In this age, people get their religion from movies rather than church and reading the Bible. It is also a big mistake. See Revelation 22: 18-19. The script is already written. Why change it? Apart from the report in Exodus itself (which should be the main focus), you have the Cecil B. DeMille film for comparison, which clearly represents a much better presentation. My wife absolutely wanted to see it. I told her not to be hopeful because it was a Hallmark movie. She looked confused and said, "Why? Hallmark makes good movies." That may be so, but they are slaughtering the bible. I'm sorry to say that I was right. Not just the story, but also the acting. With today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful biblical film. I'm still waiting...
