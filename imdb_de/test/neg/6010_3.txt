For the producer David O. Selznick no director would do this. So, on "A Farewell to Arms" (1957) do we get two? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Although both men were quite well educated, none of this fateful remake of Hemmingway's Magnum Opus could make head or tail. Hemmingway has generally never translated well from book to screen. But under Selznick's zeal to turn it into his next "Gone with the Wind," the excursion is both punitive and exhausting. At this point in Selznick's career, he was no longer the Titan who could turn "box office poison" into Gone With The Wind. Tired, infirm, without his studio, and with the impending feeling that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones might have been a mistake, Selznick gave Fox Studios the creative rules of the film? But he kept enough of himself to become a damned nuisance on the set. Meanwhile, one is familiar with the bittersweet, tragic love story of a nurse, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones), or should know her and her soldier hero, Lt. Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). Their passion is meant to serve as a stabilizing force for what is essentially the story of a war correspondent, with romanticism thrown in for good reason. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is hard and boring. In the final role, the facial distortions of Jones during birth are so bad that I am surprised that none of the directors decided to exclude them from the general release. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight she's far too clever to play the optimistic Catharine with great conviction. Older actresses, however, have often managed to remind an audience of age differences. Not so with Jones. It is painfully aware that she does not fit as an actress or as a time invested on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly out of touch with an army soldier whose heart is broken but the head remains strong. The supporting actor is peppered with such lights as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but these are nonsense that by no means reflect the impressive talents of an actor and show elsewhere in their canons of film production. > <br /> The anamorphic picture element for "A Farewell to Arms" looks good, though in some scenes there is a bit too much film grain for this reviewer. Overall, the colors are subtle and subdued, although they are balanced according to the currently used DeLuxe color processing. A certain amount of fading is obvious. Flesh colors do not look very natural. The contrast levels are a bit weak. Blacks are generally solid. Whites are almost clean. There is not much to recommend this movie acoustically. It is essentially a word picture with firearms as a background. There are no extras.
