I'm warning you out there, that's just a waste of your time. To be honest, when I say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's just a step in the direction of Christian propaganda! Do not throw away your life, do not see it! <br /> <br /> I think they made the movie so more people believe in Jesus or something, but it works the other way round. The actors are all newbies, the story is just out of focus! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a work of the devil. <br /> <br /> This movie is just not worth seeing, so please take my advice and not!
