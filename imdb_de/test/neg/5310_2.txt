The film was a bit flawed, but quite entertaining. About half an hour after Be Cool, I started with Hollywood Homicide Flashbacks. But guess what? That's worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the cast in this movie, so I feel bad when I write a negative review, but I feel obligated. The Rock, Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. Nobody else seemed to decide in which movie genre they played. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty for this movie. He was absolutely consistent in the role, but this movie is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a thumb. I wanted to give this movie 4/10 because I like the actors so much, but there is a conversation in the movie about a particular song. If you want to go to the cinema this weekend, there should still be a few Oscar candidates. That would be a much better way to spend your time.
