Before director Jonathan Demme was internationally acclaimed with The Silence of the Lambs, he cut his teeth and made weird comedies. This was one of them and like many other Oscar-winning American comedies I could mention, she has a good concept, is a good pace, has great performances, a complicated romance. but it's just not funny. Pfeiffer is a mob widow who moves to the backwaters of the city following the assassination of her husband Baldwin. The criminal who killed him (Stockwell) has a preference for Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is angry and to complicate matters, Pfeiffer also falls on the policeman who persecutes her. All of this should have been a laugh for a minute. Pfeiffer, who wears a strong wig, is outstanding as a widow, as well as the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine as a nice cop. But the script simply does not contain the one-liners, jokes, humor, or punchlines of the verbal or physical type that this movie demands. The result is that at most it makes you smile instead of laughing. It exudes charm, but is boring on humor.
