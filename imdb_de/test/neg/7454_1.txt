This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen in the movie. My uncle's home movies have more talent than this crap. <br /> <br /> The storyline states that these double kickboxers play a sickly survival game with a man and his private army on an island. The man has a very cheap paper mache hand. <br /> <br /> The acting is cruel in this movie. There are scene changes at first sight. For example, for at least 30 seconds, we see a guy humming a song, adding to the movie NOTHING. This has the worst dialogue I have ever heard in my life. I do not think this movie could get any worse than it already is. I would describe it as a wish that Norris action movie goes wrong. And I hate Norris.
