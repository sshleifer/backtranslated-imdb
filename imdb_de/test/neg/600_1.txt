This film is basically a poor version of the old urban legend of the babysitter, who asks for crooked calls to check the children, she calls the police who are tracking the phone calls and leaving the house. When a killer calls, he has a story a small child could have written. not much exciting, it becomes clear who the killer is in the middle of the film. In the beginning, when the first victim is killed, it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. what about it? The film is so typical Slasher fare with an action that is as original as a Beatles concert. even for low-budget slasher standards, it's cheesy. Do not waste your time with it. Nuff said
