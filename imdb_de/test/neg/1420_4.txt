An interesting and short TV movie describes some of the machinations of Jay Leno's replacement Carson as the presenter of the Tonight Show. The film is currently very current as the public drama around Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno goes around. <br /> <br /> The film is a good job to arouse the interest of the audience in the events and to show some concerns of the participants. especially the NBC executives. The portrayal of Ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting, I thought. <br /> <br /> Even so, many characters were very brief or touched, and some of the acting seemed superficial. Nevertheless, an interesting story.
