I'm not picky about movies, oh, I saw so much crap that I could watch everything. Maybe that's why I saw this movie to the end. I'm also a big fan of RPG games, but this movie is a shame for any RPGer who's up to something. The surveillance camera footage of a game would make the whole thing more realistic than in this movie. The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it was shot on a photo, if !!!!! (Spoiler) ahead! !!!! Would you continue your work if you had ninjas in your area? oh and the jokes about pirates, that's the worst thing that has ever been in movies !!!! (End of the spoiler) !!!!! At least, at first you felt like a documentary, now it looks like a home video experiment. Youtube has better movies. Top line: Do not waste your time and your money, it's as bad as it gets.
