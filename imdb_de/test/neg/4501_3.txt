"Destroy All Planets" ends with "Destroy All Tokyo" at the end of the movie, when a space monster resembling a giant octopus falls into the Gamera reptile furnace. In fact, Gamera rescues the Earth from the start, knocking out Varian spacecraft # 1 before the first film roll. The scene changes into a Japanese Boy Scout camp where we meet two young, intrusive heroes, Jim and Masao, who take part in Gamera's successes after being abducted by the aliens and beamed aboard an electrified blister shield. It's pretty startling See how the boys convince a scientist to run a newly invented submarine that may be broken. Earlier, the young genius Masao wired the device so that it could run in reverse, but Dr. Dobie did not think to consider this as a possibility. At least the boys were prepared to disrupt the controls of the alien spaceship by playing Switcheroo with a series of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When Boss alien Viras says 'Activate the Videotron', you sit on the seats to wash up shots from previous Gamera films in which he fights with Barugon and Gyaos. These require a lot of time on the screen, but are not suitable for the fast-forward button if you want to continue fast-forwarding. Viras turned the longest to an invisible crew, and when they finally appeared, they were Orientals who could fly. Imagine that! <br /> <br /> Since these films were made for a young audience, it is surprising to see how cruel some scenes are. Gamera draws blood, and what if two members of the space crew were beheaded? When octopus tentacles emerged from the headless bodies, I made a connection to the "Alien" movies. It was a decent way to put the single units together into a giant viras. <br/> <br/> I think the appeal for young kids might be to identify with the two young heroes who make friends with a huge monster and move around nicely on an alien spaceship with the help of the aliens Telepathic technology, whatever you want. Since the movie was probably made by adults, this could have been a simple case of wish fulfillment.
