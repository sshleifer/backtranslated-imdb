I just saw this movie because of Sarah and forgave these 4 stars just for her, on the other side. This movie was by far one of the worst films I have ever seen. The topic was terrible. The script was not inspired. This film contradicted itself again and again. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. It's not like I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. That did not even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is, the more I think about the whole plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we find. Really a shame, because I'm pretty sure there was a good idea somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I may be a bit hard to give the movie a 4/10, but the actors get involved and again Obviously SARA obvious writing talent, this film should have really delivered a lot more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just crap, I can not say otherwise. From the beginning you know that it will be crap. <br /> <br /> The story, the dialogue, the drama, the special effects, the make-up and just about everything is shit. I like vampire movies and I know that they will never be Oscar-winning films, but this is not even worth seeing, I can not believe how anyone made this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... Does not exist, everything looks like a big joke. Maybe they tried, but I seriously doubt it. I wish I knew what they were trying to do, but it just left me behind. It's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing compared to that). Prefer and pay no attention. <br /> <br /> PS It's also full of stereotypes! P.S. 2 Bad Script, Bad Direction, Bad Cinematography. P.S. 3 I took the trouble to comment on this as a favor for all.
