Of the four main actors here - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the only one I'd ever heard of back then was the one who totally annoyed me and ruined the film. Well, she must have done a decent job to get me to dump her and the VHS in the bin. I refer to Kelly in the role of teenage brat "Tia Russell". Ironically, six years later she played an impressive and extremely likeable role in the person of "Rowena Morgan" in "Mr. Hollands Opus." Candy, as usual, is fun as "Buck Russell," or the title character, "Uncle Buck." Few actors have been better at playing a lovable, hapless slob than Candy, I've enjoyed his character here a lot, but I can See the spoiled teenage girl only once In the first few minutes of the movie, the little boy "Miles" (Cauklin) says "G-damn." How bad is that when a six-year-old boy says the name of the Lord in vain? "These Hollywood people are sick like that, so it's no wonder that many of their children's actors turn out to be mentally screwed up." Caulkin is a typical example.
