Directly above the box that I enter now, I had to select a number between 1 and 10 and rate this movie. Unfortunately, there is no option for a number less than zero, and I have to type something. If I had my choice, I would simply say nothing, not a number, because there are no numbers that express the worthlessness of this film. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie even after reading all these terrible things reviews, make sure that there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area. This helps prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this movie was released It should be closed to the public 24 hours a day somewhere in Fort Knox. I'm angry that this movie was even available to me. I feel betrayed by humanity, I had no idea that humans could be so cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler did not get anything from Cowell's shower bag. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover of the movie. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is an honest-looking scarecrow at the front. 2) None of the characters on the back of the case is even in the stinking movie! 3) The marker says something about "new moon, more victims", there were no frightened victims, where nobody died. We do not know if the policeman died, and I'm assuming the killer did not die because it sounds like he's been hit over the head with a damn Whiffle Ball bat. <br /> <br /> Do it yourself and stay away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours of my life. That's right four, it took me an hour to see it (I quickly moved through the 4-minute zoom scenes that reveal nothing in the plot). I stared at the TV for about an hour after it was over, thinking about my life and the Internet for direction when I saw that crap, and then I started crying for the next two hours because I know that someone out there will see this movie, and there's nothing I can do about it.
