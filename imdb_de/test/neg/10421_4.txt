What about the French? First, they seem to like Jerry Lewis (apparently) much more than the US. Secondly, they seem (apparently) to like Edgar Allan Poe's work more than anyone else. It has to be the "Beaudelaire effect". <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong ... I'm a Poe fan myself. But this trilogy manages to put three of Poe's under-average stories in ... well, I'm not sure what they're made of. "Toby Dammit" is a good Fellini movie, but it has nothing to do with Poe's story, at least in terms of the subject. When you look at it for the first time, it's fun. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. However, it has nothing to do with Poe or ghosts of the dead. "Metzergenstein" is a big mess. How were Vadim's films produced? It's just awful ... not even at the level of the amateur film school. Depending on the DVD menu, try to skip it and save time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the segment most faithful to Poe's work. It does not have much style, though it does involve the strangest snowball fight I believe I've ever seen in the movie. (It looks like the boys throw cloths or maybe handkerchiefs that have been rolled up into balls.) My advice is to skip "Metzergenstein", to see "William Wilson" and then, if you're a Fellini fan (I'm not), stop "Toby Dammit" while you're having dinner or snacking.
