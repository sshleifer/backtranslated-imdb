I do not understand the humor in this movie. I also found it insulting how Koreans were portrayed in this film, even though it's actually just a cartoon of Koreans in those areas. First, the actors are Japanese, and in this film they make the most rude expression of the Koreans. It scandalizes me how these people are expressed. I felt anger to see only this one scene and how they were so badly made in the movie. The humor takes only a single laugh, and then you do not understand why he's even funny. It's raw humor with the most disgusting representation of society there. All in all, I found it an offensive film ... Maybe it was just that I've never lived in the "hood" or seen any "bonnet" movies, but I do not intend to.
