After seeing this movie, I could not help but notice the parallels to another movie called America 3000. Both were a catastrophe on celluloid in the mid-1980s after the Apocalypse. Obviously, fake sets, wooden actors and stupid monsters are found in both films. The only difference between the two is that the lead villainess (played by Angelika Jager) has a very strong accent. Avoid this if you do not view the MST3K version. Joel and the bots hardly save this turkey.
