A friend warned me that this is the worst movie he's ever seen. I was curious because it had turned into a cult status. I like a lot of weird indie cult movies, so I tried it. I have to agree with my friend. It's a steaming pile of crap. I'm sorry for the people who love this movie, but I can recommend much better stuff if you want to watch a twisted indie cult movie. Try Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (aka Braindead), Cemetery Man (aka Dellamorte Dellamore) or modern vampires.
