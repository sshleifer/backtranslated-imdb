I saw this movie the other day at Telly and I did not know what a Cringe party it would be ... I knew it would be stupid, but not so bad! This film illustrates everything that is terrible in the Australian comedy. Apart from the most boring, uninspired scenarios and characters I've ever encountered (aside from those dubious American tax-glitch comedies produced in France!), Most situations were boring, unbelievable, stereotypical, and SO not funny, just ... dreadful! <br /> <br /> One such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds in the bus scene. From a scriptwriting point of view, the authors used the least interesting scenario - not to think that these three are stranded without their luggage ... They are on vacation and risking everything (including $ 300) of bail, luggage and room) to dance in the bus? I mean, they are about half an hour away from their destination! At least they could have dropped the bus driver, but no, they go voluntarily because they can not stand it anymore and ruin their vacation ... Anyway, I can not believe that the authors did not do that terrible scenario. I think a ten-year-old could come up with 5 setups that are smarter, funnier and more believable. <br /> <br /> I can go on with many others - the truly unimaginative, stereotypical psychopath who has ruined the whole relationship with the Mad Girlfriend and Day Along Virgo, the 'Wow Man! Out there, a girl inhaled stuff on the train - EVERYTHING HAPPENED! I can not imagine a single redeeming feature of this movie unless the third wheel nerd was kind of cute. Corrupted his career by appearing in this garbage!
