I can not believe some of the comments here in the reviews. Of course, the movie is outdated, and from our comfortable perspective in the age of CGG, many of the special effects are now deeply unconvincing. But even with that in mind, Helen of Troy is so bad it's almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The scripting is terrible, just terrible, with no characterization. The performances suffer from it, you can see Hardwicke and Andrews squirming in agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous flat Trite Codswallop lines. The authors seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a terrible didactic script that allows the viewer to decide nothing at all for themselves. The beginning of the film describes the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient Greece. I know they had an American audience to consider, but the patronizing way we all experience it twice to make sure we understand that the action is really horrible is movie as a big epic movie. Despite the comparatively primitive cinematography and relative sophistication of today's audience, this film really stinks.
