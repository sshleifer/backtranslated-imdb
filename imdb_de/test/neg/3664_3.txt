I have to start with the actors doing a good job. The problem with Dark Reality is that you had a poor director who was so keen to be innovative and evocative that he finally ruined the movie. From start to finish, you can see that the quality of the film spool itself is low, but the bad flash and shaky camera only hurt the movie by obscuring the action. The sound is muted and often not understandable. I am sure Huston (the director) would argue that this would cause a panic in the audience, but he had more than enough material to do so. Leading the camera and lighting as he did was a sign of excessive syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. A basic sadistic woman hijacker story that avoids stereotypes by keeping the girl in despair all the time for good reasons. Silence of the Lambs Billy Bob treated his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem of the story is that dead people are constantly bothering the main character in their heads, and the second time they appeared, I made a fast-forward attempting to destroy the only decent part of the movie. <br /> <In the end, the way the director put it together, random blurry things, and constant, barely visible scenes (not horror, lighting, angles, and camera) ultimately destroyed this movie. Huston obviously tried too hard, and if anything, it resembled a bad movie school project. If you want to see a decent story this is fine, but be warned, the movie quality will be enough for most to turn it off.
