After seeing the Steven Spielberg version of War Of The Worlds in theaters, I was busy with the topic. I could think back to my favorite parts in the movie, the people were evaporated, the people panicked, there were fires, explosions, everything was so great ... and I see David Michael Latt's version of War Of The Worlds on the shelf. "It could not have been on DVD so fast, could it?" I said to myself. I read the back of the case and instead saw C. Thomas Howell. "Oh, I remember him from The Outsiders!" So I thought it might have been an attempt. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, completely wrong. As soon as I saw the opening credits and saw that they lasted forever, I knew something was wrong. Something would disappoint me in this movie, and it did. The whole film stank like a cheese sauce, which was in the fridge for 10 years. By acting, the special effects (stupid-looking tripod things when people are vaporized, they turn into orange skeletons), and most of all, it was not nearly as interesting as the Spielberg version, actually the plot was boring and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! What the hell? In the end I was so bored that I had to move through the film until I found something that looked interesting even from a distance. And nothing was really. <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not touch this movie, stay 100 feet away from it. The Spielberg version will be released later this month. Buy these! But please, please, please! Keep away from this crap, before he suffocates us all!
