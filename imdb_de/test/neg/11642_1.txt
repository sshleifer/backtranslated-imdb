If you want to watch bad movies, bad movies, bad acting, bad production, etc., you will love the quality of the Pacific Inferno. Jim Brown will forever be remembered as one of the best footballers to ever play ... As an actor, he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest football players in the world ... I'm not sure who Rolf was Bayer ... but I hope he was 15 or 16 years old when he directed it. Maybe he was the next Spielberg who was at it ... if he was a grown man directing ... a 15 or 16 year old could have done better ... The plot or plot for the movie was likely some historical value and maybe even a true accuracy ... but the actual movie might be one of the worst movies in American film history ... I was waiting for Lee Marvin, William Holden or Charles Bronson to show up somehow the "face" save that left of this movie. I would have loved to be on the red carpet with the black tie for the opening in Hollywood when this movie was previewed ... as this movie had so many spectators laughing and tingling ... it's on the dime DVD Racks now .... looking for entertainment value ... this movie is so bad that it's too good to give up ...
