Tarzan, the leader of environmental awareness, faces four trappers who hijack animals in an unusual way to bring them to zoos. Tarzan has a mild but sexy woman with a flawless hairstyle and a child. No one should reproach Tarzan for being distressed by the hunters' evil actions. <br /> <br /> This Gordon Scott Tarzan movie is one of the dumbest, totally and unnecessarily stupid; For some reason, the team found nothing appealing to sustain the movie, and it's just a stupid garbage. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of malicious trappers because Tarzan's environmental awareness has brought him into open conflict with the evildoers. The child and the chimpanzee, both belonging to Tarzan, are kidnapped by the malicious trappers. so Tarzan conjures the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the child and the chimpanzee, with Tarzan leading the attack. Tarzan and the trappers are stupid, unsightly and rather uninteresting. Maybe I would have liked it as a child? Now you have to be mean, as vicious as those pathetic trappers who are punished by Tarzan to ask for a Tarzan movie, not to be stupid; I admit that. But you also have the right to ask these Tarzan flicks, stupid as they are, to show some enthusiasm, a bit of fun, even a little fun. Some kick, some excitement, something fun. Now, the failure of Gordon Scott Tarzan is too stupid, in the sense that he has no taste at all and no excitement. (Yes, I liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake.) What a beast? Look at the movie, Kiddos, now I've just given you an excuse for that.) For some reason, the bad guys look a bit miserable out of mercy instead of virtuous anger. <br /> <br /> The books give the impression that Tarzan looked quite bright in his own way; and if a decent bodybuilder or other athlete looks smart enough for the role, this could be a demanding, almost impossible task if Gordon Scott were too far from that ideal anyway. <br /> <br /> The woman scolds Tarzan for uninteresting books. <br /> <br /> The script suggests that Tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate, and detrimental to learning; but the book says otherwise, and we know that Tarzan himself learned a lot by using the books of his deceased family before he even got together with white people. <br /> <br /> And I did not like that scream. <br /> <br /> (It is supposed, dear children, a real wild call, not a missing yodel.)
