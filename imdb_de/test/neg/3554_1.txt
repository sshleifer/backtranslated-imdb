One of the most boring movies I've ever eaten is completely formulaic. Just a cookie-cutout of a movie. You can only predict each scene in the movie by knowing the genre, as this movie does not add anything new. Dialogue is never funny, interesting or intelligent. Acting is weak and the soundtrack annoying - basically everything seems to have been done by an amateur filmmaker. Nothing fresh, unforgettable or entertaining in this film, combined with the fact that it is long, gives it a slight thumbs down. Sorry, fans. <br /> <br /> Overall grade: F
