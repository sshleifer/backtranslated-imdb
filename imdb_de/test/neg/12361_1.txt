Somehow I really thought that I would enjoy this movie because I love pictures with mountaineering and a big mystery in the plot. I have to say that the photography was fantastic and there were some weird scenes that caught my attention. I thought Nicole Eggert, (Diana Pennington), "Thank you, good night", '01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets with some characters who let her guide the mountain up. Marc Singer, "Angel Blade", '02, played a very unconventional guy and starred in many scenes with a bad temper that looked weird. This movie was a big disappointed movie and it's not worth looking at it unless there's nothing on the TV to enjoy it!
