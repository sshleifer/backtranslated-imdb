I saw this movie on VHS some time ago (January 27, 2003) just for the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I really liked his performance in "The Object of My Affection" and I expected really good work. I found this movie completely confused. The story has a very confused script and the characters are not well developed. In addition, the low-budget special effects do not help much. I do not know the Gen Y-Cops generation, but the next generation is not good. I can not quite remember why I gave that note (and I do not intend to see this movie again), but my voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Gen-Y Cops A Nova Geração '(` Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation')
