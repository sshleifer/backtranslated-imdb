This is a terrible reissue of the French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can think of anyone (Sinise?! Bates ?! Butler?! What do you think? !!!) agreeing with this is that MacLaine sees the original, is really impressed and a friend (with no written credits - or talent! - by his name) to translate the topics for the American audience - and both agreed that they are stupid, stupid and stupid. Then she asked other friends to sign up, and they did so as friends - least of all in the merits of this pathetic fictitious script that was all but the kitchen. <br /> <br /> I'm not an insane fan of French film, but Ma Vie en Rose is a subtle, thought-provoking and thought-provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I'd like to see it become more widely known among English-speaking audiences - and if that means a revival by the Americans, then so be it. But pooh-leeze! A little respect for the topics AND the intelligence of the audience - and a better direction for the actors who do not seem to decide whether they work for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
