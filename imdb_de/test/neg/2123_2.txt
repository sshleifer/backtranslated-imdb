A perennial favorite in the IMDb Bottom 100, if you look at it, it's not hard to understand why, because it turns out to be in almost every bloody department that's totally unhappy! calling this choppy would be overly complementary! If the makers of this evening had once sliced ​​them with scissors and children's glue and sliced ​​and rolled the rolls of film, the mess could hardly have been worse than what we actually have here. In addition, the inhuman story mercilessly draws for a seemingly infinite infinity, before we finally reach the very lackluster climax. <br /> <br /> Apart from the eternal play of Michael Sopkiw, poor performance of the rest of the cast is not of concern, and the actual beast, which causes all problems, is less convincing, say it mild. Yeah, really, all in all, this is a whole bunch of crap if I've ever seen one. <br /> <br /> Deary, sweetheart ... and to believe that Lamberto Bava has prompted .... does indeed do. <br /> <br /> Note: This was released in the UK under the alternate title "Devouring Waves," though it's deprived of most of his Gore scenes, which, ironically, are the only reason this was worth a look ,
