This movie was awful. The spectacle was terrible. The script was awful. What was worse, were the camera shots and the sound. Half the time, the voices did not match the actor's lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different shades. The worst part was when one of the actors stood crosswise in a huge building at the top. The building must have been 50 stories high and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was in another shot, they had "simulated" the top of the building. The width of the building had been reduced to about eight feet. How could a building that is several hundred meters high be eight feet wide? I know the movie had a low budget, but it's inexcusable. The film itself has only driven the idea of ​​a "rapture" and then actually had an action or a point. This reduced the script to garbage, the characters seemed more likely to sell ideas in their ranks than to convey emotions and move the film in one direction. It was a waste of time to watch. The film gives Christians a bad name when it comes to one of the best Christian films currently.
