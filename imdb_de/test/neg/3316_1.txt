This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only is it a comedy, which is not funny, but it's also done very badly with an upside down direction filled with unnecessary split screens and other effects. The two "heroes" with their fantasy language are just annoying and it pretty confused me that they were constantly touching the genitals of others. But the worst part of this nonsense is the cheap attempt to give this movie an incentive by referring to German history and showing sensitive aspects of the "heroes" culminating in how Erkan and Stefan heal a mentally ill woman her "happy" lifestyle (!). With director Michael "Bully" Herbig, who has also made two not funny TV shows, a not funny western movie and an almost not funny SF comedy movie, I had not expected anything better. But Erkan and Stefan were a bit better in some of their stand-up programs. For me, the only good thing about the film is Alexandra Neldel, which is very beautiful for me.
