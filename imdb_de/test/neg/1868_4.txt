Some things just do not stay dead. You just have to come back again and again, whether we like it or not. I think some people like to beat a dead horse. The first "Ghoulies" were a surprise hit and their first sequel was an even better movie. The third movie was a little bit weirder, and at that point, the little guys started to exceed their greetings. I think someone in Hollywood thought it would be a good idea to revive the franchise, but the result is likely to disappoint fans from the previous entries. <br /> <br /> Pros: Acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this one. A silly but funny score. Moving at a good pace. Some cheese for those who love it. Some pretty good action-packed sequences. Has a bit more conspiracy than the others and, unlike II and III, at least tries to connect with the original. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not as fun as its predecessors. Although it has more action than before, it is a pretty ridiculous one. Bad Impact The original Ghoulies appear only in Flashbacks and here they are replaced by two trolls, which have no other purpose than comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all attempts of humor are lame. Is a direct continuation of the first movie, but there are so many loose ends. For example, I thought Jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original? Not that it was spectacular with the others, but the direction of this movie is especially boring. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: The first three "Ghoulies" movies are the dream of a bad movie lover. This fourth and so far last episode (Let's hope) is a bit disappointing. Sure, it's a bit of fun, but it's just not the same. The others also have a low budget, but those involved invested much more in them. Find out if you are a completeist or want to see beautiful women in tight outfits. Otherwise just stay with the other three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
