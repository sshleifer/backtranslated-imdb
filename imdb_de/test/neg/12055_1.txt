But I can not say how I really feel about this bunch of steaming dung. Where should I start? The film quality does not exist. I have seen clearer pictures on the FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS of America! The action is inferior, the Gore effects are fine. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story repeats itself. The same over and over again. At least on a Friday, the 13th or HALLOWEEN we stay for the most part with a main character. There are no main characters, only victims. Man, now we come to the worst part of all. The last survivor kills the clown and realizes that it was one of her friends. When the police finally arrive, they do not believe her and she is locked up in a rubber chamber. What the end are you calling that, shit, that's what. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie that was just sloppy writing. The excuse: "It has to end badly, it's a horror movie." or "We have to end it badly to leave it open for a sequel" are stupid excuses and that's all. I have to give the CAMP BLOOD the THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
