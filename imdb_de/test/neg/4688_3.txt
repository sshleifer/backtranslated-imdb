For the uninitiated, almost every film by Andy Milligan is a shock, but despite the fact that I have seen many of his films, this film is still the purest joke. <br /> <br /> This, of course, is Milligan's approach to the Sweeney Todd story, which was done with period costumes (in some cases, but not necessarily with periodic hairstyles) and the usual headache-inducing camera work and grainy quality , Well, the version I saw might have been cut, as there is not much for a movie with a "bloodthirsty" title. The best indication for subversive filming here is a meat pie that consists only of a tit of a poor victim. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll still appreciate this piece, uh, work, in my video shelf, which is a bit disappointing in terms of content. Recommended only for foolhardy and morbid curious. 3 out of 10.
