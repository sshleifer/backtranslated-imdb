I thought I could only get a few laughs from this lengthy movie, but unfortunately was disappointed. This movie is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get the best score without having to open a book or achieve anything. The film also portrayed teachers and the headmistress, Mary Tyler Moore ("Ms. Stark)," Labor Pains "(2000), as complete idiots. I know that was probably a comedy, but I was never made to laugh, and I thought The whole movie would be a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! However, all the actors have done a great job and have had a hard time making this film into a fun and entertaining movie. Just learning easy and getting good grades for college is the only way to GO!
