I have to say that this movie was really pretty awful. The drama was average, the tempo of the movie was terrible, as well as the soundtrack and cinematography. I found that I was bored in most parts of the movie and the clich√© lines did nothing for me. The two guys who played the lead roles sometimes looked awful and did not trigger the emotions needed in the movie. The little girl was at times scary and looked like a doll that was scary. The end was unsatisfactory, though the movie had no feel for the characters before the end. This movie was boring and did not do anything for me, I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
