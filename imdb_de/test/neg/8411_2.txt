Sam O'Steen, the film editor of 1968's superlative film "Rosemary's Baby," directs a television-built successor, Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, for Mia Farrow) early in the morning - and inexplicably - probably to work out the more gruesome aspects of this limp story about Satan's son on Earth. Most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland cast as her husband Roman), but she has little to do - and feels terribly uncomfortable anyway. These scripts are all low-priced items embarrassed by the original author Ira Levin (who wrote his own sequel). Pretty weak and pale, with bad photography and no tension or fear.
