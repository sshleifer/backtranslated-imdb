It would be pretty easy to make this film sound: a call girl is shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy, but survives. The bullet anchored in her brain demands knowledge and sex. Unknowingly, George W. Bush clutches her purse away from the shootout, a key unlocking the power to use nuclear weapons. Just call it a commotion, and at least a few people will come to the theater. I'm not sure how many saw this four-year-old movie when it opened in April in New York, but I sincerely hope not many. It sounds like a light and playful Pinku streak, but has art-house claims and is really unbelievably boring. Many Pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic endeavors, but the aspirations of this film only make the time that passes between the sex scenes tantalizing. And then the sex scenes are not even good! I've seen pretty rude things in the filthy Japanese movies. I have never seen this country so boring. The Spice Channel is more resourceful. The only thing that is worthwhile is the corpse of the leading actress Emi Kuroda. Otherwise it's pure torture.
