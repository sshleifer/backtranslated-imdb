The last entry in the On The Buses trilogy provides the usual spendthrift in Wales. I'm sure the franchise could have been continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the scripts made him look bad in comparison and therefore no more were made. <br /> <br /> It takes less than two minutes for us to get sex for the first time - a woman running to the bus finds out that her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason at all. Still, Stan (Reg Varney) laughs - but what does not? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend the entire movie laughing with little or no provocation. They get the impression that they would get wet if they saw the paint dry. <br /> <br /> Still the only funny element is the really amusing Stephen Lewis, weird like Blakey. He's on his own, with a cheesy, dated screenplay that wastes even top-notch talents like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. However, it seems that only Lewis understands how to control the shaky material in time, even laughing at the weakest lines. Stan's mother complains how her daughter fell into a river: "I hope it's not dirty." "Now it will be," jokes Blakey. <br /> <br /> The plot - if there is one - sees Stan as he desires a young girl, but is constantly thwarted by her domineering mother. I'm sure you agree. Whether on a storm-lashed boat or in the swimming pools, the achievements of Stan and Mavis always produce the same result ... cruel boredom. Later conquests include Maria, an Italian stereotype and a co-worker. Even Stan's mom gets a one-night stand, and Stan reminds her thoughtfully "to set up her tin drawers." <br /> <br /> When one of the weird "highlights" is Arthur Mullard hearing Olive trying to find a light Turn in the dark ("I can not find it") and think she's talking about sex , then you can see why this work reaches the highest levels of literary sophistication. Why it did not get into the top 100 films of the BFI is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Olive (Anna Karen) breaks glasses on other ribs that tickle their tickling. I do not know, which is more surprising, the lame predictability of the setup or the underdeveloped payout. The shortsighted olive follows a man in a kilt to the gentlemen and believes he is a woman in a skirt. At the next shot, she marches off Blakey and is directed to the ladies. And that's it. Next she lands in another man's bed and is ordered by his wife. And ... no, that's all in this scene too. <br /> <br /> The last time Holiday on the Buses aired on British television, there was a glitch in the transmission. It was indeed a blessed relief.
