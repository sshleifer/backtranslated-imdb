It was only a matter of time before a parody of sports movies was made! And there are many movies to watch that are fun. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it sticks to recognizing movies. The director and the authors of "The Comebacks" somehow forget to get creative. While I have to admit that I've laughed in certain scenes, "The Comebacks" could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to take their lines seriously and have a clear face throughout the movie. A parody requires that and that's the main reason silly jokes work in movies like this. Because of the failure of the cast, the jokes never failed at their destination. Some scenes take forever and usually in parodies that do not have to be a problem. Take for example "Naked Gun". Something is always happening on the screen. In "The Comebacks" they have not even bothered to let things pass in the background. Only a few factors make this movie worth seeing! It's still fun to see which movies are fun. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. as a radio was hilarious! He seemed to be the only one in the cast who got the idea of ​​a parody. Not bad at all!
