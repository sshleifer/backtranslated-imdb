Most films are crappy with high production values, this is crappy without high production values. What sets it apart from the big pool of awesome movies. As bad as this movie was, I have to pay due respect to Kathryn Aselton, who could probably do a pretty good job if I gave the right script. She plays Emily, the girlfriend of the eternal fool Josh, who is often referred to as a "dude" or "man" in a non-ironic tone. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, Emily is a half believable character meaning Rhett has to be added to the cast soon to counter this almost believable character with a man even more absurd than Josh. When we meet Rhett for the first time, we learn that he is "deep" because he's filming a lizard that proves he sees the world "unique." Rhett then shows Emily the tape and in one of Emily's few incredible moments she is impressed by this amateur band of a lizard. WOW, I think she reacts again with an irony of sarcasm, even if it's only hinted at. <br /> <br /> The opening scene warns you that the camera work will be crappy. We open a shaky close-up of Josh as he tries to get viewers for GOOFY. oh how careful is this lead actor that he will act GOOFY! Haha. This movie could be almost a case study about how BAD movies can be (and also how FAR-bad movies can appear on the festival circuit, I mean, compared to most circuit things this movie probably seemed pretty impressive). <br /> I think SXSW has given this film a small award (oh southwest, why encourage it, it's just cruel). But here's a compliment to this movie, it's the best of the mumblecore movement. All the other mumblecore movies were amazing and looked like scary nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting, but still it's good to be the best of something. <br /> <br /> I have not seen Baghead yet, but it looks like maybe they have taken a few steps forward, the preview made at least a bearable impression, while even the preview of the Puffy Chair made the fact that she sucked, could not really hide. Anyway, Rhett is unlikely to be portrayed by a professional actor at all, as Josh is unlikely to be a real actor, but rather the director (or the director's brother, there are mixed messages). I think Rhett was a buddy of someone, and they said, why do not you play this guy called Rhett in the movie? The fact that Rhett is the name of the actor and the character probably means that the actor and the character are the same, unless I am wrong, which I am not. <br /> <br /> If Rhett shaved the raccoon off his face, you would probably say he was attractive. So, Rhett, Emily and Josh teamed up to bring the Puffy Chair to Rhett and Josh's dad. Something happens along the way, more bad behavior, bad supporting cast, shitty camerawork, an attempt of significance. This movie would not have been bad if it had not been so shamelessly seeking a deep self-importance. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is amateurish, if you can watch this movie without paying for it, like on TV or on TV for rent in the library, then consider if you like this super cheap movie style. I like what the duplicates do to make a movie with no concept, but I wish they would make a movie someone would like to see.
