Computing. Can it be a bit boring? Tap all day in front of a computer and tap the buttons all day, tap. That's a lot of the problem with this movie, the heroine sits in front of a computer VDU and taps on the keys. No matter how much excitement she gives or how exciting notes the composer strikes or how many extreme close-ups the director uses. Not much excitement due to the fact that there are few things less exciting than looking at someone on a computer. <br /> <br /> There are a few other problems that are too much of them, too many factual errors regarding how computers work. Is it possible to hack into a computer that is both powered off and not connected to the Internet? I think when THE NET was made 10 years ago, few people would understand how computers work. The scriptwriters would have had the opportunity to get in-depth information, but since we live in a global village where almost every household in the Western world has its own computer, viewers are certainly looking forward to the factual flaws of this film. And, of course, there are too many cases where someone is stupid or uncharacteristic at crucial moments to push the plot, making THE NET a very mediocre film
