I was only fourteen when I saw the alien movies for the first time and I liked it right away. Original, frightening and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and deserves a statuette for her act. In 1979, something eternal was born as the immortal series with a no less legendary film than the first. Alien3 was a different view, but I think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, this was my favorite. Unfortunately, the last one was a failure in many ways. It was tense, illogical and full of meaningless massacres. I did not like it at all, but I never thought that a worse part would be done in the future. As it turned out in 2004, I was wrong. Alien Vs. Predator was a bad break and should have been directed by a more talented director or never had been done. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Requiem, I was totally shocked and devastated. When I sat down and decided to look at it doubtfully, I had never thought such a bad movie could be made. Without a script, without a director and without an actor, I do not understand how a film can be made. Because this movie misses those three terms. What you get is a beautiful massacre show with no story, but with many annoying and boring dialogues. Waste of money and a waste of time. This film is rather unwise, as an honor for the fans of both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
