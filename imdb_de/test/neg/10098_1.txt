2001 was perhaps not the best year for Eric Roberts. Both Raptor and this came out. I saw Raptor some time ago and really thought it was a shit and Erics worse. But that had a common moment of fun and D-standard. This one has nothing. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of probably the worst actor of these days. The story lacks the punch and the whole thing feels even slower than when a snail breaks in curves. <br /> <br /> The two most important things are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. They might argue about whether their efforts are good or what they are good, but compared to the rest they are above all criticism.
