"Glen or Glenda" was Edward D. Wood Jr.'s first attempt at making a feature film. He chose an issue that was close to his heart and dear to him ... Transvestism, the "art" of a man who wants to dress in women's clothes. In his opinion, Wood tried to deal with topics that were largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately Wood had neither the budget nor the know-how to make the film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a prologue by Bela Lugosi makes little sense and then passes to the discovery of a dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davis aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) tried with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) to understand why a man wants to live (and die) in this way. Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores) Fuller) and hesitates to tell her about his obsession. And that's it. We see endless stock footage of everything, from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with felling like Glen or Glenda along the same street, dressed like women's clothes in a shop window. Poor old Bela, who had missed his fortune and made friends with Wood, has appeared again and again throughout history. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Bela's scenes were added after he graduated for the movie's name recognition. <br /> <br /> To reinforce the confusion of the story of Lugosi, Farrell is also Dr. Alton offers off-screen comments. Lugosi keeps saying: Caution, Caution ... Beware, be careful, a bit of hustle and bustle around snakes and slugs and puppy tails. The story is also about a transvestite who has a successful sex reassignment operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and Woods character (s). The dream sequences are ridiculous. An example of this is a wedding sequence in which someone appears disguised as a devil. Wood also gives us an obvious rape scene in which the actors (?) Are fully clothed but have little imagination for what to expect in 1953. <br /> <br /> This film was so bad along with Wood's other "classics" that they have been adopted by the public as cult classics over the years. That is why they have survived to this day.
