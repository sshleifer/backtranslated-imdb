Abysmal Pulp Adventure exploitation in the jungle women's genre. Lousy Audio gratefully eclipses the dumb dialogue. And it's a terrible conversation about a movie about people who do not speak English. There is no adventure here. It's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and a wildlife attack running in a flashback. Three pale dope walk through the African wilderness and meet warlike, hungry tribes of the Amazon. These wild women have come so far from the Stone Age to invent make-up, shoes and underarm hair removal technology. Despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd", the ladies insist that they fight the men and burn the weaker ones. <br /> <br /> The only thing that interests as if there is a question is the assortment of young women dressed in animal skins designed like the swimsuits of 1951. Much wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripperless stripper movements of the 1950s. No nudity or significant violence. On the other hand, you can hum the catchy native song for days on end.
