Armored <br /> <br /> The best thing about driving an armored vehicle is that when you ask for money in a red light, you can kick it in the face. <br /> <br /> And while the throne's armored guards do not use their protective power to cleanse the drifter population, they use their position to flee their employer. <br /> <br /> When newcomer Ty (Columbus Short) gets a job with an armored tank suitcase company, he feels he has found a lot in life. But when he discovers that his colleagues (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) plan to take over the $ 42 million charge, does Ty have to strengthen himself? and the money? in the armored truck. <br /> <br /> Armored is a boring caper with a plotted plot and phone calls. A completely forgotten movie. <br /> <br /> Besides, if you really want to make millions of dollars It's much easier to disguise yourself simply as an ATM. (Red light)
