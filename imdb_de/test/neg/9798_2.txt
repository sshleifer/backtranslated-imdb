*** GREAT SPOILERS! *** "Flesh Feast" from 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the career of the great Veronica Lake. It has the reputation of being a horrible stinker, and I have to say so. As a big fan of low-budget horror / exploitation, especially from the 70's, I decided to see it anyway, mainly because of the cool camp-looking image on this page, but after seeing it, I had to realize That the picture is actually nothing to do with the movie. The image on this site is the cover of a DVD collection titled "Flesh Feast," which features four films, including Sergio Martino's Mount of the Cannibal God and Dal Tenny's I Eat Your Skin. What the collection does not include is this boring turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not only stock and ridiculous, but mostly rather boring, which is even more worrying as the movie is only 70 minutes long. Do not be fooled by the title, the movie is not bloody at all. Nevertheless, it is only because of its waste and especially the extremely stupid, but therefore something entertaining end to watch. The film follows a ridiculous conspiracy on Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), an ingenious scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of carnivorous maggots (do not ask how). A bunch of criminals (or terrorists or whatever) being paid by a radical political group instruct the doctor to restore the youth of a "mysterious" commander. After an endless hour of nonsense gossip, it turns out that the mysterious commander is indeed Hitler. It was obvious before, but I still had to burst out laughing because the finale of the movie was so incredibly stupid and unintentionally funny ... This is a movie that is very inadequate as the last movie by a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronika Lake. Apart from Lake, even in a zero-budget production like this, the benefits are ridiculously bad. However, I can easily forgive bad performances in films like this one. What I can not forgive is extreme boredom. The last five minutes make it hard for hardcore fans of camp footage, but I would still recommend leaving it out.
