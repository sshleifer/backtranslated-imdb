I am looking forward to seeing "Wirey Spindell" since I experienced Schaffers "case". Unfortunately, I found that "WS" is a wandering, uncomplicated, boring bunch of gossip associated with Schaeffer's signature, a mixture of story, narrative and poetry. The film tells the sexual and other experiences of a man from Manhattan married by self-told flashbacks. Like pearls on a string, Schaffer seems to have stringed together every little experience in sex life while neglecting the beauty of the necklace. The result is an incoherent, tumbling story about a growing boy who does not create empathy and leaves the viewer unconnected, dissatisfied and with a bad aftertaste that affects the mechanical well-being. A mediocre indie and a step back for Schaeffer.
