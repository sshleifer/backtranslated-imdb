I love Lucy, but this movie is so miserable that I've been embarrassed for the first ten minutes. , , and from then on it got worse. Lucille Ball's "singing" is downright painful and the attempts to make her appear more youthful through the use of soft-focus had grabbed my reading glasses. Bombs like these give bombs a bad name.
