Feeling Minnesota is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the most disgusting movies ever made. It has to do with a woman being forced to marry a disgusting mob man. At the wedding she meets his brother Jjaks. They have sex in the house after eating the cake and decide to run away together. Of course, the other brother comes after him and he kills his wife. Jjaks wakes up to find her body in the bath and buries her. Then he seems to make friends with Jjaks and they try to get money together because someone blackmailed them because he saw them and the body. This is repeated and several characters die or come back to life, but it never comes together with what might be called good action. The performances are terrible for just about everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Akroyed. The direction, the dialogue and the visual effects are simply terrible. A disgusting and horrible movie.
