Not only because of this topic in the movie. Which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I looked at it and knew that I would not like it. I hate numerology. Whenever someone starts talking about patterns with numbers, I feel the urge to beat them. My own brain begins to suffer from empathy. And I'm aware that this is just a movie. I could not resist the urge to look at him and maybe get a good laugh. But it was not funny. Just the stupid way "Is not that totally scary and yet incredibly cool? I can turn any crap into 23!" Dialogue that I was afraid of. As soon as the son started to ring, I knew that this movie is a shit, no matter what. But I never stop watching a movie I started. I sat through it. I enjoy the pain. <br /> <br /> The film pretends to mock the numerology under the guise of showing how obsession can end badly. But it rides this wave as much as it should destroy it. I do not see this message. I see only characters who rave about a stupid number and have little need for action. <br /> <br /> Bring it away with the usual "surprises" - trying to take another turn to distract you makes no sense, and you almost believe that the tale is so good by that time - and you get a hollow piece of film. That happens to be focused on the topic that I despise. If it was not serious and more like a fun movie with actors, I do not care. But I started liking Carrey ... even though it's not his fault, he tries. It's not even good to watch with a few friends and get mst3k to hell. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough that someone could stumble upon them, but this movie has managed to become one of the worst I've ever seen
