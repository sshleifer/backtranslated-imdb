"Music and lyrics by Charlie Daniels," Nuff said. Just do not expect anything in the direction of "Devil Went Down To Georgia", the old Charles Charles Charles Sansa sings across Whiskey Mountain (duh) during a song and that's it for the lyrics. Fans of arty rape scenes, however, will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my used copy is classified as a FAMILY movie), and who does not love endless scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wims? The Boxing Art made the movie look a lot stranger than it was, promising, "You can lose your life or your mind!" But mostly it's two couples wandering through the sticks and "acting" is natural. I love this hermit.
