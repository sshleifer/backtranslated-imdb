In fact, this happened: The royal mother-in-law and father-in-law had lunch the day after the wedding with the couple and gave her the money in public. This worried young Elisabeth so much that she never forgot the subject. We must remember that she was only 16 years old. She was so embarrassed that she was afraid of sex all her life. Maybe this seemed like a trauma. Also the constant meddling of her aunt and mother-in-law. As you say, she has kept all her children away from her, criticizing her teeth and behavior (which she considers inappropriate for an Empress), and when Sissi finally went to Venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter and mother died The law blamed her for this unfortunate and untimely death. She never recovered.
