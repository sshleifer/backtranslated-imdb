Such pain! Pain in the form that he had promised in his central idea, but he has never really recognized it and blows a lot of sand in the face. I would not say that this horror movie from South Africa, Canada and the UK is horrible, it's awful, but it's just too boring and predictable. It is a guarantee that you will forget it, not too long after you have seen it. I tried to look at it last night but ended it in the morning as I could not keep my eyes open. Even then, I could not remember where I was. The only thing that hit a chord was the sharp camera of Andreas Poulsson from the huge, harsh and uncanny desert locations. A beautiful shiny chic creates a striking visual feel that can not save the movie from this empty feeling. Everything else is below average and almost comes off the grid. Like the head scratching revelation of the beast. Huh. The computer-generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable, and there are a few gruesome flashes of stripped flesh and bone. But there is not enough, since the fact that the clich√© script wants to think about the generic character conflict in order to build up tension and uncertainty is not a hindrance. That would be fine if the withered script was more than a flat, flaky reason because it never created strong, sustained tension, but it does not seem to be interesting. The main characters are superficial and the token support falls into the basket. It's your stereotypical bunch. The appearances of Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier are colorless and the beautiful Rachel Shelley tries it, but looks rather tired.
