This movie is so daring that it does not try to hide its similarities with The Shining. It lacks originality to do this. And when, in the end, he tries to cover up his story of "Father goes psycho under the influence of a sketchy haunted house in a strange place", he turns to many other already established conventions and ideas. In other words, it is reduced to mere clich√©. But hell, even I enjoy a good predictable horror or thriller, as long as there's an interesting story filled with violence and blood, somewhere before the movie makes the terrible turn toward the predictable and weird. Well, this movie has no good story and I was really disappointed. What is 'Darkness' is a remarkable direction and cinematography. It's a movie that's well-filmed and carefully engineered, full of fun, scary angles and shots. What "Darkness" does not offer is just about everything else. To start with a small problem - editing in this movie is disgusting. It jumps from one scene to the next, sometimes meaningless. For example, the old man in the movie (who carries the backstory later filled in by another character) is underlined by a hamster running in circles. I mean, it looks cool at first, but why would you continue to use the same image? I think you would have to see it for yourself to understand what I mean. Another problem with this film is the character of Anna Paquin, who moans, cries, and cares about everything throughout the movie - she is the film's failed attempt on a character-driven horror movie. The film has scenes of exaggerated sentimentalism, and the family drama it depicts is simply not believable. In the end, "Darkness" is a jumbled melodrama with a non-inclusive mystery endowed with too simple an ending. And it's hardly scary.
