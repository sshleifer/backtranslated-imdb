This film is about the intricate friendship, romance, and delusion between two men and two women during World War II. <br /> <br /> Much effort has been put into making "The Edge of Love" at the right time. However, I find this effort too exaggerated, especially in terms of color. Most of the first half of the film is processed to produce a strong bluish tone. It's hard to tell who's who in that tone. <br /> <br /> Another disadvantage is the unusual use of image gap lenses. There are many scenes that show three or four pictures of it, such as a smiling face of three Keira Knightley or four hugging arms. It just makes the movie confusing and difficult to follow instead of being artistic. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it's just boring. The way history unfolds is not captivating at all. Sienna Miller's unstable character is annoying. In fact, all the main characters are annoying and unlikely. The accent of Keira Knightley is impossible to understand, which hinders him in addition to understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend avoiding "The Edge of Love" unless you are watching a movie just to appreciate great costumes and beautiful sets and lighting.
