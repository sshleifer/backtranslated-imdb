Of all the children's films I've seen over the years, this was probably the worst. I took four children from 7 to 11 years old, and none of them liked it. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be based on a Willy Wonka story, but it simply had nothing to offer. <Br /> <br /> If you consider that this movie does not waste your time, it is bad. <br /> <br /> You're doing a sequel, so maybe it's worth it to see if they can even get worse, but I do not think it's possible.
