This movie shows a pretty decent FX sequence of an 1936 earthquake. The reason you did not see it is because the audience was thrilled with the "Jeanette MacDonald image" in the 1930s. in which the eponymous star waddled through countless songs, while the conspiracies came to a complete halt. The FX Cross time very good. MacDonald's songs are not, and the clumsy pasting of these songs to show their only typical talent is not good. <br /> <br /> The device of two friends who grow up to be priests and a Hoodlum is once again driven through the machinery (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). At the 30-minute mark, you have already heard the song "San Francisco" three times. Entertainment in the thirties is generally a collection of irritations. Only Grand Hotel of the decade renounces the level of annoyance shown in San Francisco, Dinner at 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, on the Western Front everything quiet, Les Miserables etc ..
