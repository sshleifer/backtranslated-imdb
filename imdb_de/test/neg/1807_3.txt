Heart of Darkness Movie Review Could a book known for its eloquent formulations and intricate concepts ever be made into a movie that is good enough to portray the deep meaning of the book? This goal has not been achieved so far. The Heart of Darkness was attempted to be turned into a movie in 1993, but was a failure compared to the book. <br /> <br /> It's hard enough turning every book into a movie. There is always concern that it is not so descriptive or has the same meaning. So why a movie is made from the novel The Heart of Darkness, I'm unaware. There are so many descriptions and hidden meanings throughout the book. If I just read the words, I think that a person would find it rather boring and would not get the symbolism. I think that's what happened in the movie; The film skimmed the story on the surface. <br /> <br /> The movie did not even follow the entire plot of the book. Substantial changes were made that I thought would make the movie worse. For example, the manager was not with Marlow and the rest of the crew on the boat, the spy did so. I think that caused some big conspiracies and eliminated the manager's big bet on Kurtz. Kurtz was not on the steamer when he died, which made the whole trip even more senseless, which became annoying after some time. And when Marlow told Kurtz's fiancee of his last moments and words, it was not nearly as descriptive or important that the fiancée did not even get upset about the actor did a very good job, except for the actor who played Mfumu. In my opinion, Kurtz was not very angry, and that was an important thing in the book. Other characters like Marlow, the manager, and the fiancé do not do justice to the characters they deserve from the book. Her acting was not at all very exciting or memorable. Overall, I do not think that this book should have been made into a movie at all. I think it's okay to use some themes in another storyline like Apocalypse Now. But if you follow exactly the same story of the book, it's just too bad.
