If she had not been married to the producer, Jennifer Jones would not have been the obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic story between an American soldier and an English nurse who stood against the backdrop of the First World War. Her British accent is not perfect, and in the 1950s it was unusual for a great romantic track to turn into a late-thirties actress who was even as attractive as Miss Jones, especially when she was several years older than her lead man , At that time there were a number of beautiful young British actresses in Hollywood, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins, each of whom could have been more convincing in the role, but Miss Jones had all one important feature missing namely a marriage certificate with the name of David O. Selznick. In that case, it turned out that the movie was such a turkey that they were no doubt grateful not to have it on their CV. <br /> <br /> The film tells in detail the story of the romance between Frederick, an American volunteer serving as an ambulance driver for the Italian army, and Catherine, a nurse at the British Red Cross. After the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, Friedrich is wrongly accused of being a German spy and being sentenced to death. (The film paints a very sharp picture of Italian military jurisdiction: it seems that Italian courts have condemned or sentenced the death penalty for a thirty-second trial without hearing the evidence and without the legal representation of the defendant). Frederick manages to escape to neutral Switzerland, accompanied by the pregnant Katharina. <br /> <br /> Hemingway's novels were not always a great success in filming. Howard Hawks managed to make a good version of "To Have and Have Not," a film that is significantly better than the book on which he nominally based, but he largely ignored Hemingway's plot and made the film a remake "Casablanca", more in Martinique than in the French Morocco. Like the 1943 version of "For whom the bellhounds", "A Farewell to Arms" is too long and deadly slow. It's also Miscast. Jennifer Jones never lets Catherine come to life. As for Rock Hudson, his assumed Christian name could unfortunately be appropriate. He could be as solid as a rock, but as passionate as one, and in this film his Friedrich seems to be an imitation of the Great Stone Face. Despite the passion and emotion inherent in Hemingway's plot, the emotional temperature is always too cool. The picture has little to offer, apart from some attractive postcard views of the Italian and Swiss countryside. Not surprisingly, this was not a success and Selznick's career as a producer ended. 4/10 <br /> <br /> A stupid. An Italian officer indicates shortly before the Battle of Caporetto that Russia has already made a separate peace with Germany. This battle began in October 1917 at a time when Kerensky's Russia was still fighting alongside the Allies. The Russian Revolution did not take place until November; It was only the "October Revolution" according to the old Julian calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed a ceasefire with Germany in December 1917, but until the treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 no separate peace was signed
