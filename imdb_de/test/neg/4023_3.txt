The original story had all the ingredients to make a sweeping movie. But in this version, it failed miserably, since even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what she was to become - so much so that I suspected that she had to turn out to be an accomplice until the very end. Sherlock Holmes was turned into a warrior proposed by Sir Arthur Conn Doyle. In fact, it was Doctor Watson who showed how little common sense was going on. The black boot on the Andoman Islands looked like he could not fight his way out of a paper bag, and what the villain drank on Baker Street was something the old Scotland Yard could not have dreamed of. Please send this TV movie to the Black Museum.
