This movie has bad writing and bad editing. It's hard to keep track of what's happening, because nothing makes sense from the characters. Every 30 seconds a serious accident occurs. As a result, none of the action sequences is interesting at all. For two hours, the movie is "disposable" scenes that are only connected by having common actors. This movie does not even have enough humor to be a good "bad" movie.
