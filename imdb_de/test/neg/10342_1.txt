Far from combining the best parts of Pontypool, they managed to ignore them in 28 days. While they are shamelessly copied. (If that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and getting sharper, it just stinks. The radio DJ "we have to stay on the air" gives virtually no time on air. He sits on his butt and watches news on TV. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there a person in the US or in the world who does not know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word "zombie"? Well, in the 50th minute, this bunch of outsiders still call the zombies "infected" or "rabies". The word "zombie" could come later to a guest appearance, it could interest me less Where you have to pay to use certain words? As the Bluetooth earphone is called "ear thing", I'm not joking! In the end no action + no action = no one cares rip off.
