I only saw this movie because I got the impression that I was getting a kitschy horror movie. I mean, look at the cue line: "It's men turned inside out, and worse ... they're still alive!" Does not that scream a cheesy horror movie? And then there is the title itself - "Screamers". What a perfect title for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately, I did not know that the actual title was translated correctly as "The Island of the Fishmen". <br /> <br /> After about an hour, I realized that this was not a kitschy horror movie Anyway - it was a cheesy "adventure" story about slimy fishmen from Atlantis. "Men turned upside down"? No, there was nothing like that. I was grossly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Damn, misleading slogans! I want those 81 minutes of my life back!
