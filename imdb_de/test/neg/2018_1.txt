Dracula 3000 is the epitome of a painfully cheesy cinema. From the beginning, I assumed that I was up to something pretty bad. What could you expect in a cast-line-up with Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio and Tiny Lister? Well, let's just say that expectations have been dashed ... <br /> <br /> When I really get started, I feel like this review will take forever, so we'll keep it simple. The vampire is not even called Dracula. The space crew carries coffins from the Carpathian sector of Transylvania. In his big scene, Coolio speaks of the most terrible things ever spoken in film history. In the year 3000, everyone wears bad clothes by today's standards, he has nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair and is decorated with neon lights that appear stolen on a runway. <br /> <br /> Top of the page ... the end. Sweet merciful God. It did not deserve to be ruined. You have to believe that you have to believe it. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie a "1" and I wish I could give it a zero ... but I feel compelled to make you look at it. What kind of madness is this?
