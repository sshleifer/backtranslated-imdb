It seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appears in really bad movies. Joe spends most of his time dressed in black and looks pretty moody. He accepts orders from a swollen Angel of Death, whom you may recognize as the evil villain of Tango & Cash and the bulky cyborg of Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and it's about taking a few souls away from kids in a big car driven by a stupid gallop that challenges Led Zeppelin. The car crashes and the chase runs. The happy kids who could escape Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They are hunted in the city, break things off and Tonya is stared at by her mother while she takes off for a bath. The action ends in a hospital where we learn that the sky is a ride on the elevator. At the end some green lights flash, Joe screams and Puffy disappears without a trace. I wish I could say the same for this movie. Watch it for the relative safety of MST.
