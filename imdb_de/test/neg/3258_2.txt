Caddyshack II is one of those pictures asking why? As in; 'Why was it funded?': 'Why was it done?' and "Why was it published in public?". <br /> <br /> At least it's a bad movie. It does little to underscore how superior his prequel was by stringing together an almost identical group of characters in a similar plot as a "new money" land developer tries to buy up the resort's golf course reserve. <br /> <br /> The follow-up is bizarre just eight months after the original. I mean, if you stand up for a very successful picture like the first one, then you have a window of a few years to do that. However, staying for eight years means that the formula is barely fresh enough to follow-up or mimic, so you're bound to reward fans of the original by at least giving them a hint whether they actually contain contributions from the actors who made the first one so memorable. But there is not much of that. Instead, we get cheap imitations. Okay, the death of Ted Knight in the transitional years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable judge Smails, but Robert Stack's inclusion as 'Chandler Young' (an elitist WASP elitist akin to the Smails character) is unimaginative and in the Kind of anarchic frustration that made Knight's turn so observant. Jackie Mason's "Jack Hartounian" is a feeble attempt to restore it through the Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) character of the first stunted non-stop Wisecrack. While Dangerfield's role was endlessly quotable, Mason's is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray's ridiculously ridiculous landowner "Carl Spackler" and his war of attrition with the annoying local Gofer replace the role of his Ghostbusters co-star Dan Ackroyd as a militant "Capt." Tom Everett's high voice splits your pages frustrated as opposed to the intended laughter. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, brilliant as cousin Ed in the series National Lampoon Vacation, is the opposite of Hartounian's unstable lawyer. The actor's disbelieving look at Quaid's character is said to be unpleasant acts of inappropriate force and echo those of the audience. They do not laugh. They just ask, "What the hell is he doing?" <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase appears, only occasionally and wisely, rather fleetingly, considering the cataclysm that is taking place around him as a club pro 'Tye Webb'. The films are only a direct reference to Original that does not withstand the golf course itself. With his deep tanned skin and loud Hawaiian shirts, Chase looks like he's just returned from a long summer vacation and needs a paycheck. He distanced himself from the events in the real picture so far that he takes little of the guilt and leaves some of it, all but little, the credibility is still intact. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy as Mason's daughter "Kate" takes on the role of the original of "Danny Noonan" as a teenager, fighting against class columns. Sounds ridiculous, right? At least in the first Danny (an Irish Catholic from a working-class family) and his ridiculous attempts to enter the white-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant world of the golf club, some memorable standards such as those played by the resident Lutheran bishop were mocked and mocked by the offspring of the local yacht club. Lundy's embarrassment about her father's inability to adapt is due to his Jewish roots. Besides, it may have something to do with being a classless idiot, but those intricacies are being pushed aside, though I stopped long before they were solved. At the end of the day, Noonan tried to get on in life. Miss Hartounian's biggest problem is getting the local golf club's hobbies to like her multi-millionaire father so she can meet up with the club's lost white kid. At least I gathered. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all in all it's badly written, badly written with lame set pieces and wasted a lot of talent. A big compliment if you could push it through to the end. It is really a penance. However, there is this question mark why so many of the original actors did not return instead of being replaced by artists at least equivalent on paper. Maybe they just were not asked. Or maybe I suspect that they actually read the script. Stick to the original !!!
