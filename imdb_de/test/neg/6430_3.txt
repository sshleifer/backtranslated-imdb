First of all, this film is so confused that it's almost impossible to summarize it because I did not even understand this terrible story. Also, the unknown cast, led by an actress named Laura Mennell, is just awful. The expressions and cries of the character Sara Tobias are ridiculous and ridiculous, confusing grimaces with acting. Finally, there are many cheap reviews on this movie in IMDb: <br /> <br /> - First Class - Can not wait to see more of the directors? The author only has a review in the IMDb on September 24, 2004; <br /> <br /> - Incredibly shot, amazingly intense? The author has on August 12, 2004 only a review in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> - Not the typical blood and blood, actually better. 7/10 ?? The author only has a review in the IMDb on February 13, 2005; <br /> <br /> - As intense as the Asian horror !! - The author has on 14 November 2004 only one rating in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> coincidence? Or is it the parents, relatives, friends or people who are hired by the production to promote this crap? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 ?? A Nova Profecia" ("11.11 ?? The New Prophecy")
