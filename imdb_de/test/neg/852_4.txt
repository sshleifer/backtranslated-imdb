This was a mish-mash from a movie that started going nowhere, getting lost on the way and then suddenly finding action in the last 5 minutes when the title character was FINALLY introduced. In this movie, there were so many ugly, mutton-clad people, I lost track of who the owner and the overseers were. I have a theory about casting; All the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and an ugly actress), and all the good guys / victims were played by beautiful actors. In fact, the actors who played the ultimate victims, the slaves, as well as the daughter of the innocent priest, while the plantation owner, his minipulative mistress, and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes. Intentionally? You make the call. <br /> <br /> I kept it up to the end and a few others could do it. If you just want to see the bare breasts, there are plenty of them and if you have a slave / master fetish you will love this movie. Otherwise, take a look at it, vomit, take a shower, and do not talk to anyone about it.
