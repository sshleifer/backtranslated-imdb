There are none - no salvation qualities for this movie. You have not checked a single fact - NO WORK about ... anything. I'm sorry for Larry Miller, and more so for his agent, that he's no more able to find a more suitable place for him. The effects are cheesy and without sense of reality. The music is honestly cheesy. The story is incredible. I want you to see something good with your family, see something different. Take some time and look for mold in your attic. My ten-year-old mocks this movie while we see it. Unfortunately, he learns that not every movie is worth a look.
