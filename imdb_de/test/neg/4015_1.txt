I saw the episode about life with the minimum wage. It went on until Oprah Winfrey's appearance for the episode. It's bad enough that people are struggling to get by week by week. Then this hypocrite should exploit the problem. I consistently did not appreciate the constant complaint from him or his partner. Queston is how all people have the power to pay their medical bills from the emergency room? Certainly he shows that the bill is high, but he paid the remaining balance (from his own pocket) after his discovery from his "harrowing" experience. How many poor people have this privilege after 30 days to repay their bills. Instead, they starve and "rob Peter to pay Paul." Complaining about yourself throughout the episode is not a humiliating thing for him. The movie and restaurant scene is horrible. He has another privilege that poor people do not.
