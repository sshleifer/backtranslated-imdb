This is unique in Hitchcock's films I've seen since I did not really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought that was pretty predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newlywed couple. He's a kind of "lovable villain figure" you've seen in many movies without ever being adorable to me! <br /> <br /> In fact, it was a hard-to-believe relationship, and sometimes it seemed particularly wrong and implausible. <br /> <br /> He can not keep a job and tries to live an opulent lifestyle. He is made to borrow money that he can not repay. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced he's trying to kill her to get the money she's insured for. and probably the value of her deceased father. <br /> <br /> Average and actually rather uninteresting, but as usual you can see the influence on films that came at a later date.
