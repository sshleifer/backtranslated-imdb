Geologist realizes that a big earthquake is coming, but nobody will listen. What's worse, his father-in-law had predicted the Tokyo disaster of 1923, and he was deemed unworthy of being his successor. Of course, the big comes and Tokyo is flat. <br /> <br /> A poorly dubbed Japanese film that is a pure soap opera for the first half. The second half - after the earthquake - destroys a model city as a flight drama. There are some nice moments, but the film either wastes them by undercutting the action with too many poor miniatures or by doing unrealistic things. Hokey and not very good, it has an end that you will not believe ...
