I totally agree. This is "Pitch Black Underground" and a worn property. The best scenes I thought of were the divers who explored the caves and went through impossible underground tunnels, some of which hit the heart. The landscape was great. Had they completely renounced the "alien" tooth CGI badboys, the movie would have been much better. All they have to do is never show monsters, but let everyone ask and follow Jack's descent into madness. This could be a top class Hitchcock thriller, maybe material. Acting is not bad. But these rubber truncheons simply reduce it to the standard price.
