It's no wonder that this was free with the Mail on Sunday (your film production costs) by posting on a British Sunday newspaper, at least so you get a captive audience and some expenses. <br /> <br /> I have not given this movie 1 out of 10 points Due to the effort to pull some old actors out of their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, this is not a blow up) but Vinnie Jones as lead, and I think he was better in Gone in 60 seconds when he did not speak. <br /> <br /> This movie sinks every day in the ratings. I think this will find its true note at 3-4 out of 10 in the near future
