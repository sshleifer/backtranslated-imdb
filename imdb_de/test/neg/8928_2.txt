STAR EVALUATION: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal - not as bad actor as Kevin.) but Costner ....... aaaaahhhh, can you get it) is a modern Robin Hood (listening nearby, you can hear Brian Adams playing music in the background ... no, not really), the kind of guy , who steals bad money from drug dealers and uses it to keep run-down orphanages open. But now he's been approached to drive an escape car in a Las Vegas raid in one of those last things before retirement. But of course everything goes awry and he makes the big guy at the top and in jail. Here he meets a man named (though you would not know it if you watch the movie) Ice Cool (Treach), with whom he makes a friendship and eventually breaks out of jail. Once he is free, he wants to prove his innocence, find the missing money and, of course, accept those who have framed him. <br /> <br /> Of all the Seagal films that are among Seagal's latest video films, Today You Die looks like it's all about being in a movie theater, even with a rap star as a co-star Star as in his previous feature films Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds. Yes, it does not seem that if he does not make films that respect the environment, pretend to be black, and star in the role of rapper. But TYD is not a movie, and that's a luxury that The Great One will never again enjoy until Under Siege 3 (if anything!) Materializes attention, but from there it goes downhill quickly. Once Seagal is imprisoned, the conspiracy quickly loses its cohesion. In fact, Treach's character just seems to be able to emerge from nowhere without him as a buddy and you quickly lose interest in it. <br /> <br /> That's it. I know, I've said it before, but I think I mean it this time. I do not think I'll do this anytime directly in video Seagal movies. I honestly have no enthusiasm to even see Shadow Man. In fact, I can honestly say that I have NOT really enjoyed any of his STV movies so far, and Today You Die is certainly no exception, an apathetic, boring effort that is best avoided by all. *
