"My blue sky" is boring. The plot is bland; the characterizations and the dialogue stink; The musical numbers are sometimes staged in an interesting way, but not only too often absurd, but also lyrically banal, painfully bright and emotionally hollow. The leads, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive pros. However, despite their talented effort to lift the drab and outrageous material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, although they prove their talents in other projects, are here more or less ciphers. <br /> <br /> There is really only one reason to look at "My Blue Heaven". One reason ... one star: Mitzi Gaynor making her film debut. Your total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but what the hell? Their shitty and promising movie personality, their feline beauty and their extraordinary charisma shine gloriously, making those minutes the most observable, memorable and exciting moments in the entire movie. If you would like the opportunity to see a tremendous young talent, then take a look at Miss Mitzi Gaynor in "My Blue Heaven". By the way, I despise (and urge you to avoid Drew) Casper's manic, compulsive DVD commentary on this movie. Wordy, degressive, unreasonably demanding, often poorly attuned to what's on screen, and with an excess of nervous energy galloping, his comments are absolutely indigestible.
