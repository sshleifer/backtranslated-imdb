The movie Blood and Chocolate is NOTHING like the book. The plot has changed completely and who has chosen the cast must read the book. First, the girl is not an introvert Aden. Vivian was the one who had hunted Aden. Her mother should have survived and be after Gabriel. Astrid was the one who committed all the murders along with Ralf, an ex Vivian. Gabriel is not old. He looks old. And Aden did NOT get Vivian in the end, Gabriel did. The title came from Vivian and compared kisses of Aden (sweet as chocolate) and Gabriel (delicious as blood). She plucked blood because it promised more and he understood her better. It reminds me that Gabriel is not like people in the movie. He only avoids intimacy with them because they have hurt him in the past. The book is really sooooo much better than the movie. But if you want to run, get a dating montage and jump a lot. Then this movie can be seen.
