All in all, you do not expect much and you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that will bring you back to the year 1983, this will definitely be safe. The only reason I gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for two reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Caine. <br /> <br /> # 2. People, The sights, culture and music of Brazil The film is almost entirely carried by Caine, as he does the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and half-believable story. Also missing Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is as always pure class. Caine is not only a talented classical and comic actor, but also offers a blend of introspection, rogue and sensitivity for every movie he makes. The focus of his charm lies in his role in Alfie ... and the reason he won the film Academy Award for Hannah and her sisters 2 years later. In this farce, he is tenderly beguiling ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholy and sentimental ... and the only reason, besides the jewel of Rio de Janeiro, to seek no better form of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> Well ... maybe a look at the two pretty young actresses Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. Michelle's all you can do (though her gaze looks rather old-fashioned) ... there could not be a more painful movie experience than "trying" to act (most of her dialogue seems exaggerated). Demi's acting and looks are 100 times better and you could easily transplant them into any movie today (she does not really look different, to be honest). Ms. Moore is certainly not used much, especially considering that she was the bigger star of the 2. Apart from the fact that this is a stupid farce, in the end I like the maturity with which everyone is together. These people deal with this scandalous situation ... that friendships and marriages are not ended and that a matter, even with the underage daughter of your best friend, can be forgiven and everyone can go on. The injured show anger and disappointment about what happened, but everything works for the best ... certainly a bit unrealistic, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope is always.
