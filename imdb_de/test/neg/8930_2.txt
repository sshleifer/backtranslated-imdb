Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third movie, which was released this year. As a one-time fanatic who is increasingly angry, I can say that it's no surprise that this is pretty lame. First, the film made headlines because of obvious production problems by Seagal. He appeared late on the set, changed the script, crew, etc., and generally caused problems for the director, Don E. Faun Leroy (his lack of talent enough for him!). This also happens in their second collaboration, the upcoming Mercenary, which is just as bad as this garbage. This also represents a major turning point in Seagal's career as this film is the first film that has truly dug up the stock footage. There was a bit in Ticker, but this movie takes the biscuit. They borrow pieces, The Order (A Van Damme film, Seagal's biggest competitor in DTV films!), No Code Of Conduct, Undisputed and also a complete action sequence of the little-known Peter Weller with the vehicle Top Of The World , Interestingly enough, the chase from Weller's epic, made almost 10 years ago, and ironically, probably cheaper than this junk, is actually by far the best action scene in the film. I was shocked enough when Dolph Lundgren spent a short amount of time in the stock-action world that he thankfully escaped. However, Seagal is currently the leader in the DTV action market, with Van Damme and Snipes as its main competitors. Seagal still manages to sell movies and I do not know how to live. Surely the fans have to be bored with this awfulness and long for a return to people like Above The Law. The story here is totally lame. In fact, the movie has so many storylines he does not have to think about. For example, at the end of a movie, there is a little girl who apparently knows Seagal in an orphanage to which he gives a necklace. Why I do not know, but we never see them in the rest of the movie or hear them mentioned. Seagal has a girlfriend in this film who works with a clairvoyant at the beginning of the film and is followed by visions that are never explained at the end of the film and mean nothing. The film is so ridiculously stuck together by a series of meaningless papers that it causes headaches. This is by far Seagal's stupidest movie! Seagal himself is as wooden as ever, but to his credit, as far as I can tell, he is not titled in this album. However, Seagal feels the need to talk as if he's a gangsta rapper, which makes me long for the days he would put his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent in his classic early films. He also has a painfully uncomplicated double act with Treach, which I assume is a rapper. It's funny how the producers seem to think that the combination of Seagal and hip-hop star seems to work, because his team with DMX in Exit Wounds was his most successful movie since Under Siege. However, if no one has heard of the rapper, he will not work. However, this is an action movie, so the action itself must be judged. Unfortunately, the action that does not come from the NU image catalog is a routine. There are a few small battle scenes with classic Seagal aikido, but when 90% of his stunt double is done, which does a really hard job in this movie, that does not really impress. There are also some standard shootings that really just have a few violent and bloody squibbages coming up. All in all, this is a painfully boring experience and I have the same verdict again: Seagal has lost it! I keep asking myself the old question: "Why are people still watching his films?" This is all very well and good as a question, but the sad bastard that I am continues to watch his films in the deluded hope that he might do something good again. Chances are slim, unlike Seagal's ever-growing waistline. * 1/2
