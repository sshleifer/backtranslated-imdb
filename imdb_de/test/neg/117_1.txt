This movie is a waste of time. I expect more than 2 explosions and a few shots from an action movie. Van Damme's acting is terrible. He was never a great actor, but here it is worse. He was definitely better in his earlier films. His screenplay for the entire movie was probably nothing more than a page of dumb nonsense. The entire dialogue of the film is a catastrophe, just like the plot. Why did not they just call it "border patrol"? The fight scenes could have been better, but either they could not afford it or the fight choreographer suffered from lack of ideas. This is a cheap action movie theater.
