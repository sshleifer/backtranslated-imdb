Surprisingly enough, Kieslowski's film disillusioned the sometimes strange and sometimes clichéd script that sometimes seems to be a bad observation. There is an isolated boy. He lives with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and observes every night a woman who lives in her building. It seems! that he wants her He is one of the young people who can not communicate well with the opposite sex. He likes this woman, but when Tomek comes home with a man, Tomek gets in pain. Then we understand that Kieslowski tells a story about an isolated boy who needs a woman to flirt or falls in love with a mature woman. He does not do anything else because he may know that it is his salvation. One day he suddenly stops this woman, he seems to be a shy boy, but proves that he is not, and explains almost everything to her. She gives lectures and rejects him. Everything is as realistic as the other Kieslowski films, no problem. The problems begin when Tomek visits them, the story of a lonely boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but an unrequited love), turns into the story of a lonely boy who falls in love with a mature woman. Woman refuses, but After a short while she begins to change her mind. First of all, this U-turn makes the movie a cliché. The personality of Tomek is funny? or a result of bad observation? I am disappointed with this character, that is my opinion and I will try to explain why. When he goes to her house, Magda treats him very friendly. She asks, what do you want from me? Kiss Me To Love Me Out With Me At this point, I remember the people who say she is a femme fatale. See? Back to the scene Tomek rejects all suggestions. Why? Because he is shy? I do not think so, but his communication is dull, OK. After the legging scene at home, some events make the movie miss its target. I think the goal of the film is (according to history) to show us that there are some people who suffer from a lack of tenderness, and to save from this situation is not easy because there is a lack of communication and especially for Distanced Men. I mean, at this point, what does the movie say? It is blurry and disappointing. It turns out that he is not hungry for love or a woman or sex. Then what? And the suicide attempt scene supports this weakness. He wants to kill himself so that he touches her legs! By the way, as I mentioned earlier, some say that Magda is a femme fatale. Not at all. She strives to make Tomek happy. Does she avoid contact with him? Is she insulting him? Did she amuse him? And is she cheating on him? No. She has some problems with her (ex) lover, so she is not OK. She does not take revenge on Tomek. She is not an angel, but she is not a femme fatale.
