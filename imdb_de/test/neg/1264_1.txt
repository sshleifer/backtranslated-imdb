The Czech moviegoers may have appreciated and rated this film because it was Czech, but I found it banal, boring, feeble-minded, boring and bland. I suspect again "ramps" to increase the sale of this dog of a movie. Amazon describes this film as a pair of scholarship holders who refuse to grow up, but I go one step further. I think it's about two fellows who are in a state of dementia and are doing things that make no sense to anyone. I was told that one of the actors in the movie committed suicide after the movie, and I would believe it. When he saw his achievement, he probably realized what a terrible job he had done, and realized that the only way to avoid the embarrassment of the terminal was to make the "big exit," which was mine The opinion was much more dramatic and a much better performance had been done in "Autumn Spring". Do not waste your time and money on this pathetic achievement. It is nothing but a dog in a crib.
