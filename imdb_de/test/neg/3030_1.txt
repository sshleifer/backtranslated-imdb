I suggest watching this movie not 'TV' if it is not mature enough. The film creates a fairly realistic simulation of how they can prevent terrorism when such a wood event occurs. Wars are still going on, wasting only the time and money for learning and living, every time they go around P Square walking around, feeling that it is obvious, uncomfortable, actually I do not want to vote, the result means nothing, only 4 'blank' <br /> <br /> Only juicy and positive thinking cities encourage a better economy and investors to continue to invest time, energy and money
