Stop me if you have hit him hard before. Some cheerleaders, their trainer, and a few boys are trapped in a cabin in the woods when an invisible killer kills them one after another. It's a pity about me, after writing off Jim Wynorski after the terrible "Busty Cops" (it was a long time since his last really good movie was "Hard to Die" in 1990), that I still awoke my hope for some reason an alleged sequel to "Slumber Party Massacre". Unfortunately, my mediocre expectations were not met. This trip is not nearly as much fun as the three previous movies in the franchise (and yes, I include SPM 2, that should tell you something). How can you have a slasher movie with this little throat ??? I mean, come now! <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ricky Ray becomes topless; April Flowers and Charity Rahmer show breasts and buns in a shower scene (April will be naked later on), and Tamie Sheffield gets topless and bares bun
