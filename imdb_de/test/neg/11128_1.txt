When I went home after work, I bought some movies for my four-year-old twins. I had bought this movie that my kids would enjoy. I saw that with my children. My 10 and 17 year olds wanted to vomit. In this movie, the dad behaves like a Tard. My little ones would see it every day. One day they threw away all our films. I sold the Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My grade: F +++++++++++++++++ I tend to be seen on the worst clothes list. <br /> <br /> My kids now hate this stupid movie. When the idea arises that germs can talk to each other. I wonder how the stupid movie sounds in Japanese. I broke the CD in half when I was tempted to see her over and over again. No offense, but Brandy & Elena's acting was the best
