I was ready to love "Where's Poppa", it shows the affiliation of performers from the "Normal Lear" comedy who, as I grew up, felt like extended members of my broken nuclear family with giant rosette size. How funny it would be to see Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and a SNL Garret-Morris censored. <br /> <br /> But "Where is Poppa?" It is claustrophobic and trots and breaks the cardinal rules of farce, the ease of mood and a fast pace. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to free himself from his overbearing Jewish mother. who lives in his gigantic apartment in New York. On the way we face ridiculous characters and situations: a comedic group of Muggers repeatedly attacking the main character's brother, the rape of a policeman wearing a gorilla suit and a subsequent gay love, Ruth Gorden, the Segal in his pants Donkey pulls and bites as he serves her dinner. Why does not this work? Part of the explanation is the sense of destiny created by the narrow, dark interior and antique decorations. I definitely ate New York's cinematography in that era, but watching the movie felt like I was leafing through the police in a dark bus station. <br /> <br /> But the main reason is the slow pace. Modern, fast cuts in the MTV style have changed what viewers find convenient for speeding. Even taking this into account, camera shots are held for too long. The development of the plot is also very slow. There is a situation in which this works: A strange love song, George Segal, sings Trish Van Devere quietly, very close to her face and for an unbearable long time. It reminded me of those boring, expansive shots in the British version of "The Office," in which you mentally ask the camera to cut away, and at the same time, you can not stop looking. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the movie is more "hurry up" than "can not look away". So I wondered if it's possible to have a black comedy, which is also a farce. The dilemma is that the subject's gravitas in a black comedy tends to complain the ease of the farce. Films like Robert Altman's "M * A * S * H" and Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" prove that this is possible. They do this not only through speed, but also through entertaining negotiations, something "Where's Poppa" neglected. <br /> <br /> Although the film contains several stereotypical funny characters, almost all are directly involved in the central drama of dealing with the recalcitrant mother. The scenes of Garret Morris and the Central Park's Muggers are as close as the viewer has a mental break. The Muggers looked almost like Shakespeare's and followed the tradition of the comic ne'er-d0-wells. If the rest of "Where's Poppa" had come from the stage tradition, it would have been a better movie. Edgier is not always better. It's as if all these talented actors and director Carl Reiner were close to the creative whirlpool of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Random Notes: After streaming the clothes of Ron Liebman, the Muggers mention Cornel Wilde's "The Naked" Prey "(1966), a great action film that is a stylistic predecessor to the" Planet of the Apes "As politically incorrect as he was, it's disturbing to hear about the death of an action hero as impressively as Charleton Heston." Linda Harrison, the "Nova," Taylor's mute buddy , played, said James Fransicus appeared sweet and tiny in the sequel compared to Heston.
