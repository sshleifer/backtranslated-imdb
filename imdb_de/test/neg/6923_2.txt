Author and director Brian Burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies, and he seems to think he has discovered the formula for success: numerous film locations in New York (preferably in winter), allusions to old Hollywood films (especially musicals), more enjoyable musical soundtrack. Unfortunately, all this is just a compensation for Burn's talent as a writer. (The big secret of many directors who shoot independent films is not why they can not get along with big studios, but how they even find support for their films.) <br /> <br /> Usually our interest in romantic Comedy is motivated by the main characters, but the couple in this film simply has no appeal. This is neither David Krumholtz nor Milla Jovavich guilty. Your characters are written poorly. What we are talking about in classics like "When Harry Met Sally" or "Annie Hall" or older films like "His Girl Friday" are quirks and mistakes of the personalities of the main characters. Since Burns is unable to create individuals, Burns gives us a special program inspired by Men Are From Mars and Women of Venus. I have not once laughed during this movie, and the script is full of echo chamber dialogue ("I want to paint the city red." "You want to paint the city red?"), What is the most legendary sign of someone who is not has business writing. In one of the early scenes, we see Krumholzer's girlfriend film a mindless TV sitcom. It's the only moment in the entire movie where the dialogue feels right. Maybe this shows what Burns' talents really are.
