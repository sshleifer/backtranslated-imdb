Is not it curious how crap films are always a bit better when you're sucking them with an attitude like, "Boy, this is going to suck harder than a few things before sucking"? It's pretty much impossible to rent this movie at a high price. or even remotely positive expectations, as "House of the Dead 2" is a sequel to what is widely regarded as one of the worst genre catastrophes ever released. The terrible reputation of the original proved to be a great advantage for director Michael Hurst, as he could easily surpass the quality level of his predecessor. And how embarrassing must that be for Uwe Boll, right? Admit that a direct video sequel without starpower or advertising campaigns is much better than its own sophisticated video game interpretation? If anyone still has doubts: NO, "House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" is not a good horror movie, but YES: It's definitely better than the first and it's even worth it to hire if you're looking for a modest claim seek splatter movie with a lot of bloody battles, sleaze and stupid humor. There is no real connection to the events in the first movie (another benefit), and this second part opens like a typical rancid sex comedy on a college campus. The male brotherhood club is planning to attack a sisterhood that is inhabited exclusively by blond students with huge breasts. However, the party is interrupted when a crazy professor (Sid Haig!) Drives his car over a girl and takes her to his lab to turn her into a zombie. This is the beginning of a rapidly spreading and deadly epidemic, but do not worry as the government is ready to send their best scientists and soldiers to campus to search for survivors and return blood samples for an antidote. The hunt for zombies seems to be the most common thing in the world for this squadron, they were even called Hyper Sapiens, but their ever-growing numbers endanger the lives of the most hardened soldiers. Director Hurst found his inspiration grateful for the class's outstanding classics, such as James Cameron's "Aliens" and ?? Of course - George A. Romero's dead trilogy, especially "Day of the Dead". Fortunately, he did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who filmed footage from the current video game (why?!?) And was * exaggerating * with CGI techniques. HotD 2 contains violent images of violence, such as Hacked female corpses and detailed amputations, but it never gets really bad or shocking. Of course there is not the slightest tension, and every horrible horror clich√© can be found here as well. The film is very gratifying as long as the writer Mark Altman does not try to explain the origin of the zombie epidemics. They're going out with dead bodies, and we really do not need to know what caused their death. Especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sister bitch who clearly has no idea what all medical terms mean. Avoid being bitten, sweetheart.
