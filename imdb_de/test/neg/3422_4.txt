The play Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between 1604 and 1606. Since then, many other versions of the piece have been produced, including remakes that were completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even performed a Japanese version of Macbeth in 1957 titled "Kumonosu j√¥." The play begins with King Duncan, in a recent battle with the Irish and the Norwegians, hearing of the success of two of his generals, Macbeth and Banquo. After a brief promotion from Duncan, Macbeth instantly gets an eerie sense of lust, lust, and power, and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown, even if it involves murder. Geoffrey Wright Tried It In 2006, he created his own version of the famous play by placing it in the modern underworld of Melbourne. Just imagine a low Macbeth killing hundreds of soldiers with an AK-47 while touching his own low-powered rendering. Just a joke about the latter, but one thing he does is to pronounce the traditional Shakespeare. And he keeps it going throughout the movie. Right! Shakespeare meets Ghetto. It's all you could hope for! Not?? The latest Macbeth is rude and violent enough to match any other modern action movie, but lacks proper acting, language, and camera technology. <br /> <br /> The revamped film opens with Macbeth (Sam Worthington), who works as a hitman / drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug lord from Melbourne, Australia. After being promoted to Thane of Glamis by Duncan (as the three witches had predicted), Macbeth took over the effort as he looked on the throne. After promoting Macbeth, Duncan invites to a night of drugs and alcohol at Macbeth's house. Before the festivities begin, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) persuades Macbeth to kill Duncan to take over the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and all are asleep, Macbeth sneaks into Duncan's room and stabbed him to death. After his murder, Macbeth takes everything Duncan owns, including a hidden title and crown. Once he thinks he has what he wants, he finds out that it takes more than bribery and flight to solve his problems. <br /> <br /> A major flaw of the movie was acting. A once seemingly extravagant and powerful Macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy. And he looks like a sad puppy throughout the movie. I'm not sure if that was Worthington's or Wright's fault, but one way or another, either one of them would have realized that Macbeth was a king and not a knot on a log that took whatever his wife literally had to say. As I said earlier, Macbeth should have been rude, arrogant, and hateful. However, if his character changes into a drug lord, he probably changes his personality as well. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to nip in the bud when it comes to recognizing and personifying her character. She did not look as nasty as she did in the play or version of 1971, but she reminds Macbeth that anything else he could do would not go well with murder. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I found unpleasant was nudity. This coincidence had Wright's fault. The witches did not do a bit of acting, unless you call in your birthday costume as acting. At one point in the film, I began to wonder if I have Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong when I say that the Shakespeare dialogue is out of place. It is spoken perfectly, but when it comes to an Australian gangster, it's really funny. When Macbeth starts killing people, he lets them know first by speaking English with them in Ye Olde. Macbeth contains plenty of action, blood, blood, and nudity to give anyone a lifetime. You forget all the positive facts when you start thinking, "Okay, what the hell did he just say in that last sentence?" At some points in the movie, I do not even believe the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new era of the film could easily have been deducted, it was not "Thou's" and "Thee's". <br /> <br /> The camera work was just fair for me. One thing I could not stand was the constant back and forth between the characters. The camera technique used gave Blair Witch a kind of vibe and made me puke a bit in my mouth. Matt Reeves has tried to try the same concept of the camera in Clover, but it just does not work. That's why I want to get up from my chair and look for the small sacks that have been set up comfortably in each space in the aircraft. <br /> <br /> If you look back at everything, Gangsta Macbeth has a positive result: a lot of action. Apart from that, the film contains nothing but uninspired acting, correct use of the English language and groundbreaking camera work. The soundtrack contains one or two of the same songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for each scene. It never uses a variety of interesting or captivating media. From now on, directors Al Pacino and Robert Deniro should leave the dangerous drug underworld. Future renderings of Macbeth should be made as Shakespeare intended 400 years ago. I would recommend using medieval clothing, Ye Olde English, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enya. But the modern Macbeth makes you want good old folk music, a campfire and a bustier.
