John Sayles, what did you do? <br /> <br /> "Silver City" had moments when I could see the shimmering hope of a good story, well drawn characters that make the dialogue thought-provoking. And then those moments would quickly be masked by layers of bad spelling, awkward alignment and abysmal action. I almost love John Sayles work, but "Silver City" is awful. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sayles was working on the beginnings of a good story involving illegal work and industry corruption plots, but then he was rushed and pinpointed the secondary plot line that the Bush administration brought to satirize it. The two stories do not really connect, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the movie, so I lose patience with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The other major mistake is Danny Huston's drama. His dialogue in every scene comes with a yawning grin, regardless of whether it suits the mood. I hated this man at the end of the film because every high school song I've ever seen reminded me of every bad actor. I had never seen Huston before. I do not know if I should accuse him or if he makes Sayles more aware of him. Anyway, he's the unfortunate center of a very unfortunate movie. Until the last Sledgehammer subtle final scene I was disappointed by "Silver City". Sayles at his best, or even Sayles of mediocre, can be so much better than this movie. Instead, see any of his other works. This is not even worth a rent.
