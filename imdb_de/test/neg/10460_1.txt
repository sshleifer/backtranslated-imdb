In an attempt to build a large mall, complex, or something similar, a wealthy landowner ignores the native-land artefacts buried in the countryside and unleashes the bone-eater ... a creature that goes about killing something in search of its fallen friends or humans , <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie had to be an original of the sci-fi channel. If not, the director should never rule again. The effects in the movie are ridiculous at best, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing more than a CGI animation that will later be inserted into the images. The actors do not even look so scared when they see the thing (probably because they really do not and they are just terrible actors). It's a great comedy though, even if it's pure horror.
