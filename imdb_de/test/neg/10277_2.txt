It's hard to make a negative statement here, after all the raving about how great the poll is, how great the actors were, and so on and so forth. I did not like the movie It's shitty! <br /> <br /> There are orgies, they have taboos (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother sister sex, brother brother sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, Sex, sex, sex seems to dominate their world, I think the director desperately needs a job.) The story is just dirty and shameful. I wonder why these people got up with this story. and above all, who cares? <br /> <br /> the technical stuff did not satisfy me either. The sound is bad, so the editing is missing and the "direction" is missing. The actors are fine, but guess what! It is her job! Your job is to act! You do not have to jump off your seats when an actor has done decent work. Applause when a bus driver brings you home safely? Forgiveness? <br /> <br /> I gave him 2/10 because the thing after all that had something that I can not put into words. b movie charm? Stocking fun nudity? I dont know.
