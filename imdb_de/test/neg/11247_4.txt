The first movie was pretty hip and had amusing moments, this movie does not exactly have the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to keep his hair salon running, but this is not just against stylist Gina (Queen Latifah) with a beauty parlor next door, but soon a large hair salon chain called Nappy Cutz opens across the street. Calvin and her colleagues and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eve) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity) are doing everything to reach regular customers and ultimately their customers. Business is running against the competition. With Michael Ealy as Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka, Harry Lennix as Quentin Leroux, Robert Wisdom as Alderman Brown, Jazsmin Lewis as Jennifer, Kenan Thompson as Kenard and Bad Companys Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Loretta. I did not like this movie as much as the first one because of Eddie's unnecessary flashbacks, and he's not that funny, I just get bored. OK!
