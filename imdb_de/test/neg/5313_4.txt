John Travolta repeats his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns to the music business. With his "negotiating skills" he tries to lead an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and to try to bring his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record. > Before I saw this sequel, I had heard that it was a horrible movie. However, Be Cool is still a funny comedy, even if it is not as good as the original. The film focuses this time on the music industry and not on the film industry. The music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a series of lame stereotypes. I can not say whether that was the intention or not, as Get Shorty made the film industry well. The same can not be said for the sequel and the attempts are just lazy. <br /> <br /> An impressive cast saves the movie from destruction. The best performer is The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance, although he got annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman shows an average performance and I expected more from her. John Travolta returns as chili and does a good job. His performance, however, is pretty boring. Christina Milian does a terrible job and she's not as good as a singer either. Cedric the Entertainer performs well, although he is not in the movie for long. There are also a number of cameos, including Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray is directing and doing a bad job. He just does not handle the movie well and the movie is kinda messed up. There was also a lot of product placement and it got annoying after a while. Even at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are many slow spots. The film had to be edited badly and obviously it was not. Fortunately for the movie, the actors can rise above the weak direction and the script and deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes the movie was too hard, other times it was pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel is not good. Be Cool, however, is a fairly harmless and unforgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rent and that's about it. Rating 6/10
