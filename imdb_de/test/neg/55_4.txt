I thought maybe ... maybe that could be good. An early appearance of the re-animator (Jeffery Combs); many tributes to old horror films; the troma label on the front? This movie could be a gem! I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> Frightmare is a boring, exaggerated, half-assed tribute to the fear movies of yesteryear. The story is old, young people break into a house, get drunk, love each other and manipulate things that should not be manipulated. Which often ?? Here, recycled Slasher film formula is used, this time with the idea of ​​being the dead actor Conrad Radzoff. In fact, the performance of the Radzoff actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. He does the crappy Dracula character very well. But as far as the kids are concerned, it's not so good, because Combs has only a minimal share. <br /> <br /> The movie has no entertainment value and just a cool character and one or two scenes that can grab your attention. I do not recommend this movie if you do not really want to see something, and this is the only movie left over at Blockbuster.
