It's obvious that director, writer, and everyone else does not know about their own religion or the people who practice it. This movie is endlessly flawed and overall a total shock. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene in which the rabbi enters the woman's ritual bath while a naked woman bathes, puts his hand on a woman's head and blesses her. This is a complete ridicule of the laws. This scene alone contains some of the broken laws: Modesty, a rabbi would never enter a ritual bathhouse while a woman is in it. <br /> <br /> Improper contact, a rabbi I would never put my hand on a woman's head, not to mention that it is not the way a blessing is given. <br /> <br /> The woman from the ritual bath plunges a naked woman by pushing her head underwater The ritual bathing laws require the whole body to have direct contact with the bathwater. This means that no one should come in contact with the person bathing, not to suppress them! <br /> <br /> There was more in this scene only, like dipping 13 times (where does the concept come from?) not the rest of the movie was a total mistake. It's scary, what ignorance can educate!
