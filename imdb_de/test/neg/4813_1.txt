Lets "Invasion USA" look like "Apocalypse Now". This can only be recommended to US skinheads, John Birch supporters or militia members. The message is very simple: let's all shoot - Gooks, Commies, Latinos, anything that is not American. <br /> <br /> It's also badly played, poorly written, poorly interpreted, incredibly stupid, but no fun at all. This movie could be used as a touring instrument by CIA torturers. Sorry, there can not be US torturers because they are GOOD
