Dresden had great expectations due to its spectacular theme and its high budget. I was looking forward to it and wanted it to be good ... but it is not. The only good thing is the special effects that were done very well, but like in a really bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> It's badly written, the script tries to fulfill the genre rules with normal suspense / love story elements, but there is no depth or originality. It is way below average. Next: It is also badly addressed. It has this uninteresting TV directorial style with lots of close-ups and will-be-awesome action through fast editing, where there really is no action or tension. The actors are not bad, but there is no performance that touches in any way. <br /> <br /> I do not know ... they obviously try to make a typical TV movie and not a movie for the cinema, where it is always good to have some edges and a clear visual style. But why are you trying to fulfill the typical Hollywood commercial rules? It really feels like the screenwriter had done a weekend course with an American script guru and then delivered that mess. Is not there a producer responsible for the project, who has an interest in dramaturgy / visual style, or simply in those magical cinematic moments that make some TV movies great?!? Do you think that a television audience is stupid and does not need a high quality movie experience? The downfall was a very good example of a good TV movie, but there was probably an executive or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie, rent "sinking" instead ...
