Tu pa tam is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But on the other hand, it is better than most films from Slovenia that are filled with depressing characters and stories without clever ideas. Tu pa tam is bright, optimistic and without artistic moments. In many interviews, director Mitja Okorn tried to say that his film was of the highest quality just because it did not cost much money. But to think like that is wrong. Tu pa tam is a very bad movie for me. The dialogues are really poorly written (90% of the script is cursing), the characters are stereotypical idiots, the story and its turns are very predictable and the action sequences (this movie is supposed to be an action comedy) are filmed very badly and without style. Okorn just thinks he's even taller than Quentin Tarantino. So he copies his style every 90 minutes. The humor in the film is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably considers the constant cursing funny). In my opinion, Tu Pa tam is a very cheap (not just budget) movie with a stupid story and very bad acting.
