Not a horrible movie ... But there are monster scenes where you'll laugh and roll on the floor - not good for action / thriller. Acting is generally pretty decent for a sci-fi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US Senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips returns us with a decent military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal character. The special effects are good, "special" - for example, the external train shots are obviously a model train. <br /> <br /> Goofs: A meteor strikes a stagnant car in the opening scene. The car goes up in flames, but does not jerk an inch. After the impact, the meteor is housed in the hood - impossible from the low angle, in which the meteor has come. <br /> <br /> spoiler ... <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie events is predictable, from the helicopter crash ("pull up, pull up!"), over the fact that the annoying people end up getting it, to the classic bridge over a 1000-foot-long gorge awaiting the train to the end of the sequel. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the aliens are attacked are hilarious. They are vicious cute dolls and move at lightning speed - remember the Monty Python hare? Spoiler Goof: In a scene, four people filming one movie at a time can not hit a creature as they move with lightning speed. Later in the film, Todd Bridges sets up a mini-flame thrower, which he uses to shoot a number of creatures up close. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillip's creatures can easily grasp creatures with their bare hands.
