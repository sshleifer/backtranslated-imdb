As if the world had not received enough cheap Jaws imitations, writer Boaz Davidson decided to make the continuation of his yearning, but somewhat enjoyable, creature-trait Octopus, a complete rip-off from Spielberg's classic, to a worried cop, no one believes, and a mayor cares more about his July 4th celebrations than about people's lives. <br /> <br /> Even in the hands of a highly experienced director, it is unlikely that this dumped garbage could have been anything but hokey B-movie garbage, but with Yossi Wein (yes, THE Yossi Wein!), the The shots behind the camera are calling, a man with a fraction of Mr.Spielberg's talent (I estimate about 1/10000), is Octopus 2 guaranteed. Be as bad as you could imagine! <br /> <br /> The predictable and extremely stereotypical conspiracy can not be described in great detail (replace Jaws' Amity Island with New York and Bruce the Shark with a giant rubber.) Octopus and you get the point), though some It's definitely worth mentioning, just because they're so funny: In all octopus attacks, the actors fight to make them look really unreal-looking giant tentacles, which is fun to see. The Bulgarian capital Sofia is not convincing for New York, and the overuse of the stock footage makes the illusion even less convincing. And best of all, a silly dream sequence in which the Rubber Octopus attacks our hero on the Statue of Liberty is not only indescribably stupid, but also has some really terrible special effects. Davidson's script also does not do this. I do not know when to stop: There are several points in this movie that he could have ended (and probably should have ended), but the action goes on and on, with the octopus having several It survives explosions and collapses a tunnel (including the love interest of the movie and a bunch of kids) before finally being blown into hell by the hero. <br /> <br /> Sometimes very stupid, technically always terrible, but never really scary, this STV stinker can find fans among those who actively seek cinematic garbage. However, most normal people are advised to steer clear.
