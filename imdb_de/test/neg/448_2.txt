Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete suck hole, in every possible way. He laughs at all the jokes of his guests, asks the dullest questions and would never dare to contradict them. He meets me as the kind of person who wants to be liked by everyone. Friendly, boring, age-predictable Harry. He probably owes his success as a dream interviewer to celebrities because they are not bombarded with what we humans want to know and have the right to know. Let's put it this way: he interviews like in a red country. 02/10, 2 For the guests who appear on the show, it seems pointless when Larry starts asking questions, such as "What is it like being a mother?" followed by the usual answer to the motto "Being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me: it's wonderful but tiring".
