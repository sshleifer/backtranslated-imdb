This movie was bad. I think Elton (or Mike) played Wong in it. Anyway, it was the Wong who did not grin so stupidly and looked mean. He plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers a brain damage. He recovers and gets revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one in this movie worth seeing, but he can not do much. But the little he does seems to make the others pale in comparison. The film also has a cheesy Gummifalk controlled by the Wong guy. This movie is not worth renting or buying.
