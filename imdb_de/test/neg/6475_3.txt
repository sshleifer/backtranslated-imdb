Chris Ricci meanders through most of it, but then quickly picks up a sense of boredom and contempt - just as I did at the sight. Without them, this would be nothing more than a cheap children's movie, but at least it adds a touch of quality. There are few, if any, more visually distinctive and charismatic young actresses in the business. <br /> <br /> There is not much wrong with it, as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap Disney make-up for very modest children. I could watch Ricci all day, so I'm probably not aware of many of the shortcomings of the movie, but even if you're not a Ricci fan, a cat lover, or a very small child, I doubt you'll find that entertaining.
