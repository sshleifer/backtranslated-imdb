Junior and his father start a new life in a new city. It's the same life because Junior has not changed a bit. He is still the same lazy brat as before, only he has gotten bigger. This time he has a friend called Trixie and she's just a little bit worse off. Junior does not like his father and messes up every opportunity he has. Then the grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. I thought the two made it a good movie, but they ended up becoming friends. This is a movie for most immature people. It has diapers, fart, doggy do and toilet humor. Only someone under the age of twelve would find that very funny. I hope that when I have a son, he is just like Junior.
