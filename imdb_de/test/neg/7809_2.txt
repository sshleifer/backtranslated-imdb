The dreamy young Ashton Kutcher (as Tom Stansfield) wants a date with the sexy blonde Tara Reid (as Lisa Taylor). Ms. Reid believes that Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's dad, an anal-enduring Terence Stamp (as Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees to build "houses" for the boss, assuming that he will bring Reid closer. Mr. Stamp has a pet owl called "O.J." which turns into a toilet head. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to prepare your "G-rated" pre-teens for raunchier "R-Rated" fares. It helps if they have not yet seen the conspiracy and, above all, like idiotic, mischievous humor. Remember that people are being paid for it. <br /> <br /> ** My Chef's Daughter (2003) David Zucker - Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Stamp
