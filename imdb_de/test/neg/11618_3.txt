Oh oh! I just said that this "classic" movie has an action that is STINKS! Well, it's true ... so overcome it! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy, in which his lover starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. Today there is only one fragmentary copy - one that was withdrawn a few years ago. But even if the film had been in perfect condition, it STILL stunk for many reasons. And without further ado, here are some of my reasons: First, Gloria Swanson, 31, plays a girl in a convent school - maybe 16 or 18 years old! Come on - she looks old enough to be the mother of many children. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film depends on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". While some people believe that, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw away EVERYTHING to a woman he did not even know! What a hooey! <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is histrionic and the plot is crazy! After leaving school, Kelly goes to East Africa and becomes the "Queen of the Whores". Later, after the evil queen dies in Europe (that's convenient), the prince can actually leave prison Kelly marries her and she becomes queen of a truly honest country! Take a break - that's RIDICULOUS, even in the days of the silent movie, this conspiracy was a groan! <br /> <br /> So, in summary, this is a bad movie with big production values ​​(mistresses have to look good) that's a classic! There are so many BETTER silent films - see them first and avoid this joke.
