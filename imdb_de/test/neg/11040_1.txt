When one of my friends recommended this to me, he raves about how well he was filmed, the underlying themes and the overall size of the movie, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining movie. The two hours I spent looking at it turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of time. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie is supposed to be surreal, but even in surreal movies there is something that anchors it. even if it is only in the least. This movie, on the other hand, felt compelled and fake. Many recordings were superfluous and watching made me think that the director was trying to be artistic. <br /> <br /> The acting was bad and the relationships between the characters were far from well developed. Maybe I just miss something that others could see, but I did not realize that there was an attraction between Dae su and Migo before they started coming across the movie half way through the film like rabbits. On the other hand, the movie was maybe just bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not against film violence, but almost everything was unnecessary in this movie. In all the fight scenes, I felt the painful clich√©. It was all. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The word ridiculous occurs to me. It would amuse me if I had not wasted two hours of my life after that ill-considered and ridiculous plan. Despite all the shortcomings of the film, I expected something interesting at the end to complete it. I will not talk about the end because I do not want to "spoil" the movie for those who have not seen it. Only the metaphor "Be it a stone or a grain of sand, in the water they sink immediately." can not be used as an explanation for everything. <br /> <br /> The entire movie was made just for the shock and the shock. I just hope that sooner or later people will stop being so presumptuous and recognize a bad movie for what it is. I have seen many other great Korean films, and I am saddened that the people celebrated Oldboy as the best.
