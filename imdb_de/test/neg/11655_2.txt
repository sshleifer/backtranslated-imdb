I'm not surprised that this film did well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It's a flat movie that would appeal well to flat people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship fighting and looking for a lost dog. The film allegedly explores the dynamics of the relationship, but the relationship is far too low to deserve such an investigation. This couple has a dimension: they fight, they tease, then they love each other and fight on. A brief moment of tenderness reveals no possible reason that these two were involved because of their poisonous and volatile relationship. Beautifully shot, excellent score, but without any merit in the script or in the characters, this short form is just that.
