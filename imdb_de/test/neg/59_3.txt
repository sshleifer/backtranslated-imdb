Not that I had expected much, but at least I hoped for a fun, stupid movie with a big budget. That's not even that. This article is in the bottom half of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen many of them). Bad action, zero characterization, little to no thought, almost nonexistent action (and there you can pull trucks through the holes). Sure, it has action and is loud and has more action and more noise and blood and action ... These things alone do not make a good (or even halfway decent) movie. Amazes me, as some people say, that this is the best vampire movie ever made. I can only assume that they have not seen many. I suggest seeing Near Dark.
