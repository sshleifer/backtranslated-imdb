11:11 a.k.a. Hell's Gate (2004) is another evil horror movie that tries too hard to be something it is not. A young girl has an imaginary playmate. One day, while they were playing in the fields with their friends, a few escapees visit their parents and beat them for no apparent reason. The young girl runs away and hides from the evil men. Years later, the girl grows up to a woman with problems. Losers in her school (who look like repressed homosexuals) show her masculinity in front of her as she rejects one of them. The girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. A secret from her past returns to visit her. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate them? What is the problem of her guardian with her? To find out, you need to see Hell's Gate. <br /> <br /> The new title makes absolutely no sense. I do not know why people are getting money to make bad movies. This movie is not even good enough to make fun of. It is a headache that creates chaos that confuses anyone who tries to make sense of it. It's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
