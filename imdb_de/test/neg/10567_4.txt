From barely extraterrestrial lasers to a primary school shuttle crash, "Nightbeast" is better classified as a mix of false blood and bare chest. The almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of coherent or effective history. However, the drama is not nearly so disgusting, many of the young, aspiring actors admirably show a hidden talent. Especially Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel, who brought a ray of hope to this otherwise terrible movie. Nightbeast would never have appeared on the set if he had known the terrible talent for filmmaking in this little town in Maryland.
