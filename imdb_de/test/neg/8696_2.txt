For a really wonderful movie you can also see the film about St. Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. The best thing I liked about this movie was the landscape in Mexico, and the movie was brought to 2. I was surprised that these actors did not have a terrible sunburn. And it is said that Moses has a linguistic obstacle, but certainly not here. Even the "miracle scenes" were conceivable and not credible. And what is the point if you can believe something in a television story? I thought this Hallmark-produced movie is pathetic and I can see why others hate Hollywood. I do not do it, just a few of these corporate graves. You do not have to be religious to benefit from "Jesus of Nazareth," but for this waste of celluloid you have to be bored without doing anything dejected and religious. For a real movie experience, we recommend "Short Cut to Nirvana," a highly rated film.
