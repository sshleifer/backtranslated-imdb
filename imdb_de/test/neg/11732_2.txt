No no no. That's my advice to you if you want to watch this movie. Anthony Perkins is the only and ONLY Norman Bates, as well as Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This just seems to be a tinted version of Psycho, with a few slightly different accents for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is as ill as Norman, and Sam Loomis by Viggo Mortenson seems to be too much for the cowboy compared to the original. Please, people, do some justice. Do not worry about it. One can only wonder what Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins would think right now ....... <br /> <br /> * out of ****
