My, my, my: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance have desperately been looking for work to make this turkey their talents available. Land Of The Minotaur (aka The Devil's Men) is a horribly jumbled up tale of Satanism in Greece today. It is a failure at more or less every level you can imagine. It has valuable fears (always a small mistake for a "horror movie", do not you think?); weak performances; countless scenes in which characters foolishly walk alone or refuse the opportunity to stay in the safety of a group; and some pretty irritating editing techniques that add nothing to the process. I was prematurely excited about the prospect of Cushing and Pleasance working together 17 years after The Flesh And The Fiends - but this movie is not worth being disturbed from afar; It's a big disappointment and more of an embarrassment to his much more valuable clues. <br /> <br /> In a remote region of Greece, outsiders such as tourists and archaeologists and local priest Father Roche (Donald Pleasance) are always missing. suspects that something sinister is imminent. He writes to his friend, the New York private eye Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras), and asks him to fly to Greece to help him solve the mystery. In the meantime, three more visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), all personal friends of Father Roche - are missing as they snoop around the Greek ruins. Milo finally arrives in Greece, but is initially doubtful if Father Roche believes the missing persons were abducted for Satanic victims. Milo and Father Roche are also accompanied by Laurie (Luan Peters), the girlfriend of the missing man Tom. Together they discover the activities of a Minoan devil cult, led by the spooky Carpathian exile Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing). These crazy cultists have eagerly sacrificed their victims to a Minotaur statue. In addition, they apparently can not be killed by normal means, so Father Roche has to use various religious artifacts in his fight against them. <br/> <br/> Land of the Minotaur should have been much better than it actually is. The plot is so crazy and unlikely that it has all the hallmarks of a pleasurable cult / camp favorite. But the handling is just awful. Director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how the narrative can be connected in a coherent way, making the whole thing look like it's done in everyday life. He also has no idea how to convince his performers to either embarrass themselves in terribly pounding (Pleasance, Cushing) or frighteningly amateurish (Skouras, Peters) performances. Worse is that the narrative makes no sense. Why should Father Roche ask for help from a private eye, whose beliefs are extremely shy? How does Roche know that the victims only occur during a full moon? How can the Minotaur statue speak? Why is a victim sacrifice instructed during a vision to stab Father Roche just to have himself stabbed a few scenes later, before he has a chance to do it? And, most confusing of all, why is Father Roche dragging Milo halfway across the world to help him, if he just needs a crucifix and some holy water to get rid of the bad guys? These questions - and more - will come to your mind during Land Of The Minotaur ... but unfortunately there are no answers. Frustrating, stupid and disappointing!
