This is the worst movie in the world. The only reason I gave him a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny. "Is that for real?" It was so cheesy and the budget ... they should not have bothered. There was nudity and violence to have nudity and violence, and the effects were so bad that you would not believe it (think of ketchup as blood and cabbage for severed heads). do not rent that !!
