Can they possibly get worse? Probably. But Steven Seagal can do what he does. Something like that; this time, instead of mortally wounding the bad guys, he only wounds them. Seagal is hired as a bad agent to deliver a special package from France to America. But it is no easy task when so many people try to intercept and disrupt the mission. The bouts just do not have enough bite and the big bangs are just big and that's all. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only actor who does not seem to be made of wood. The cast also includes: Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Do not blame Seagal for this clunker.
