Some movies you watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in a growing way. <br /> <br /> Some that you will look at because you want to experience adventures or shocks outside of your experience. They do not feed directly, but they help you position yourself in a larger world than you would otherwise. And finally, the hard parts of life are in what you do not want to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are films that do not do any of these things that you observe without obligation or because you have a need for a historical context. These are pretty worthless experiences in building a life. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that you often do not know which of the three films a movie will be in, people you trust, but because life in the film is so personal, you know it really not until you go to the blind date. <br /> <br /> It was pretty worthless to me. Yes, yes, I know for many Bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and the rich. And you should know (if you do not) that among my biggest movie experiences are very strange movies, very strange. <br /> <br /> It's not that this is not filmic or symbolically deep. or unpolitical / politically friendly to my way of thinking. It's how it gets there, which deviates from the base. It is the deviation from the real deviation that annoys me. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is that it's a successful alternative art, which means it's a successful commercial art. Which in turn means that it can be easily explained and the explanation is not only generally acceptable, but simply coded in shorthand. It's all true. <br /> <br /> When the term "surreal" is used, it is usually misused to refer to any film image or world that deviates from reality or appears foreign. However, if used correctly, the consensus theory implies that it is always Bunuel, especially this film and the movie he has done with Dali. Since they invented surreal cinema, they define and control the term. That alone shocks me and I have my own alternative definition that does not stem from their philosophy. <br /> <br /> It's because the philosophy is completely opposite. It is not a philosophy at all, but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. His packaged anarchy carefully selects the things they use and the things they resist without clearly distinguishing them. <br /> <br /> Okay: against linearity, against narration, against history, against religion (a light one), against willful love. But for an illinear linear narrative to establish its own story (celebrated by countless film school professors, what else can they do?); for a kind of transcendent "accidental" love. <br /> <br /> It's your own enemy. If today a Bunuel lived when he sold his image, he would first attack the church or the surreal. My regular readers know that I am in almost all film themes to the Spanish and avoid the French. But in terms of the surreal, I want you to look at the opposite: get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not from Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Teds Rating - 2 out of 3: Has some interesting items.
