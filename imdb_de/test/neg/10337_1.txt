I look all over the crap to see if there are any solvable qualities that justify putting it into my customers' video libraries. Do not even look at it unless someone has a gun in their heads. Like me, you'll moan and moan at least 500 times and pray that one of the one-dimensional characters, all played by really bad actors, would turn you over and shoot you. <br /> <br /> Even if you're the biggest Sandra Bullock fan in the world, it's not even worth looking at the two or three short scenes in which she appears. <br /> <br /> I want the sloppy marketing people who support Sandra, the big asses on the face of this DVD box and have them jailed for robbing me or something. I really wish I had the opportunity to read a review of this movie before I bought it. <br /> <br /> Please call me and I'll pay you $ 10 to remove this movie instantly from my inventory stinks all over the place! (just a joke - please do not call)
