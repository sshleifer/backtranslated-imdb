I think I should be fair and point out that I do not believe in ghosts. That means I'm very interested in the subject and enjoy a scary story just like the next guy. I'm a fan of Ghost Hunters because they at least try to present their research from a scientific point of view. Even the first episodes of Most Haunted had a camp entertainment factor. The paranormal state has none of these characteristics. The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so much "reality TV" these days, it suffers from overproduction, bad behavior and stupid scripts. The creators of the show freely admit that writers "guide" the stories. I hear that they even want shoes in a romantic subplot to appeal to the young female population. The show also has many other shortcomings. As others have said, the narrative quickly becomes nails on a blackboard. Outstanding visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating. I'm ready to put up a bit of disbelief for entertainment, but this whole "demon with a vendetta" story is just ridiculous. Given that the show's producers are also responsible for brain dead feeds such as MTV's Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor, I do not think that's a surprise. If you're an avid fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a big "reality" show junkie, you'll probably find much to like in Paranormal State. For the rest of us ... I recommend avoiding you.
