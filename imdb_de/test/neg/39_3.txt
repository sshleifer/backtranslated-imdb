This is a hard to evaluate movie. While it really deserves its 3 (or maybe even 2), it's extraordinary for an Al Adamson movie - and virtually the best of Adamson. Because unlike many Adamson films NURSE SHERRI looks almost competent. But as an Adamson movie you need to know that sooner or later this frustration will have to raise its ugly head! <br /> <br /> The film opens with a bizarre cult leader of a large community (six) trying to revive a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese. However, the cult guy has a heart attack and was hospitalized. He apparently dies, but it also seems that many of these hospital scenes are missing and some of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the movie, it seems he may have recovered - only to hear later that he died. Because the guy of b.f.f. but Satan's evil soul can not die and he comes back to persecute one of his followers as well as possess Nurse Sherri. Now Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady - demonic possession or not. Sometimes she behaves like a zombie and in others she is violent. So I ask ... "Why did not your friend (a doctor) believe that this was possibly problematic ?!" In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he does not get an exorcist nor does he commit to a booby hatch !!! Oh, and when it comes to boobies ... This movie is NOT about the boobs that drive the title, and the posters would point that out. Although here and there are a few naked breasts, they are irrelevant to the plot and only in a scene very short (1/2 second or so) to see. So, if you're a pervert, this movie is not for you - though some parts of the movie (like the nurse taking off for a patient) make it look like the movie MIGHT was once designed as a movie pornographic movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a bad movie fan, there's plenty to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence include the inability of many actors to deliver lines that are not zombie-like - and I do not even speak of Sherri. One of the last scenes is particularly striking - I have never seen and heard anything in my life stilt-play and dialogue - and this includes Ed Wood's films! There are also a few cheaper items, like the bad animation of the "green material". The doctor finds a murdered nurse who continues to do research in a house with walls covered in blood (I would find a policeman ... Better still, an army of cops, so why do I think it works well for them despite these problems? Well, the story is not all bad and he was able to build up very good tensions.Many false positives made my heart race a bit.Although the car accident was irrelevant, it did quite well and came in handy for Adamson big budget. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not a good movie, and most people would be bored watching, but fans of Adamson or inappropriate films will like it - it's cheesy in its entertainment, which will bring a few laughs.
