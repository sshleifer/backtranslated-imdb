Lucille Ball's version of "Mame" is in my opinion one of the worst performances ever recorded in the movie. Having seen Lucy more than astronomically in her various sitcoms, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, but this film is a fiasco of unbelievably bad casting, music and dance. Robert Preston is the only saving grace with a part tiny enough to miss when you blink. I do not know what she was thinking, and I can not imagine her being advised by the studio or the director, but I actually rocked when I watched this embarrassing performance. I could be really cruel, and I think it would be laughable, but it's even too pathetic to qualify. Do not waste your money or your time.
