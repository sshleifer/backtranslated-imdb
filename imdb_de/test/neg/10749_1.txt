I do not agree 100% with the reviewer who does not 100% agree with the reviewer who rated this short with "F". Strong revenue from political propaganda makes Joe Dante's ability to pull another howl out of his bag of tricks unclear. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrific stories, apart from this episode. Despite the recognition of those who want to promote their political orientation, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MOH season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's contribution is a parody of the genre and misses both horror and humor in his embarrassingly fake submission of a fraudulent political point. Dante really can only be blamed for pulling that stinker off the shelf as it was not his creation. The zombie subgenre is very popular in this decade, and among the predictable George Romero honors and empty fantasies, there are a number of works intended to promote political or (ir) religious messages. Such works are not written or intended for real horror fans. Maybe Dante is not a master of horror either. What has he done since The Howling? <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a lame zombie anti-war zombie movie with some pop culture credentials that are passed over as humor, Homecoming may be just your thing. If you're a horror fanatic looking for something masterful, take most of the other episodes in the series. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "Jenifer", which is loosely based on a classic cartoon short by Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson - really scary.
