It seems like a mainstream movie company wants to make films for teenagers, so it focuses only on one thing: sex. Do not get me wrong, I'm not honest, but the fact that these people seem to mean taking down my stones is all that interests me, very offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so much on you to find the main characters attractive because it believes it can do without an action and / or script not written by a six-year-old. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys. And yes, that's it. It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually littered us with filthy films, hated it. It's really amazingly bad, as far as it can be funny. I would have laughed if it had not been for the fact that some other female moviegoers had obviously enjoyed it. They were accompanied by several shady-looking guys who curled up positively and died when the (really stereotyped) boy passed on boy kiss towards the end. It was really the highlight of the movie to wind her up. I do not think the Hollywood movie will ever release good movies for teenagers (or anyone else), so I'll give up. If you're not a teenager who likes The Pussycat Dolls, Paris Hilton thinks it's "hot" and looks at MTV as if it were some kind of wasteland. Life is tough when you're fifteen and you like Kunsthaus. :( P.S. Someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls would be boy band members "totally HAWT LOL !!! 111 !!"
