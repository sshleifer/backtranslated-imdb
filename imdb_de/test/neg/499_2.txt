You have to recognize Cimino's contribution to the cinema. He has given us both the most overrated movie in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst movie in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you even begin with the 'It's bad, but not the worst' ever, let me explain that. <br /> <br /> For more than 20 years, I have listened to the critics and avoided "Heaven's Gate". Actually, that was not hard because you are barely bombarded with ways to watch this movie. Then, a few days after seeing the documentary "Final Cut: Making and Undoing the Sky Path", I stumbled over a used $ 9.99 long-length DVD. My advice after 229 minutes is to go to the most negative review ever written about this film (you'll find a wide selection) and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she's doing everything to get one make a positive impression on the film of her dear son. Then you have an idea of ​​how big a mess Cimino has made. <br /> <br /> Although this film is all pretty wrong, which ultimately scales to make it worse (and a classic less) than Zero's example, is its shameless distortion of the story. Although the Cattlemen's Association sent a group of supervisors / gunmen to Johnson County with a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892 Nick Ray and Nate Champion were killed by a force of about 50 men and finally killed. Texas rented rifles that had come to Johnson County to clean "Rostler." The citizens of the district then besieged the regulators, who were eventually arrested (or rescued) by the army. Women did not actively participate in the bouts and apart from Ray and Champion, there were only minimal losses. After all, there were no sieges-and there were no wagons of immigrants around the camp (in the early West, these were more of a film production device than real Indian tactics). And weeks before the arrival of regulators, several residents of Johnson County were hanged without trial, including Jim Averell, the keeper of a modest road farm, and his wife Ella Watson (who revived Cimino as his two leaders and even shows Averell as he lives up to a mature age). <br /> <br /> There is no cinematic sin greater than the fictionalizing story. If you want to play with historical facts quickly and easily, change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience that the audience may not be watching a movie that believed what was actually seen. Luckily, so few people have seen this movie that the damage was minimal. Maybe it's hard to blame Cimino for distorting the story. He could probably escape the guilt with a madness defense - the film offers a lot of support. If Cimino were insane during the production of Heaven's Gate, that would explain a lot. But I vote for "lack of directing talent" instead of madness. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where part of the huge budget was spent. expensive sets - beautiful epic camera shots - artful dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a weird casting choice that actually worked) offers a pleasant and likeable performance, though most of her scenes are extremely boring (this happens when the director forgets to give the audience a reason to look at the characters) To take care of). The dialogue is usually solid, if rather ordinary. <br /> <br /> But do not fall for the crap that this movie is experimenting with in storytelling, mixing carefully crafted moments of interaction with characters with structured, pageant-like explosions of communal action. This implies that there was a method for the madness of Cimino. "Experiments" is another word for a filmmaker who is so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence that Cimino stages a scene or attempts to control or organize it. It looks like he just let go of his DP to take action and get an endless selection of colorful shots - 1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to integrate everything into post-production. <br /> <br /> The last fight scene is really funny because the babushka, which carries citizens (perhaps borrowed from a "Fiddler On The Roof" tour company), throws countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately, every explosive falls just in front of the target and explodes harmlessly. After seeing it 50-60 times, you can refer to the woman (the one who looks like 'The Grapes of Wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Ciminos mother did after writing this review. <br /> <br /> So believe what you've heard about this movie since 1980. It's a sloppy, disconnected, badly moved and historically distorted mess. Just as an example to film historians, how not to make a film, and as a source of entertainment for those who are familiar with the actual history of the American West.
