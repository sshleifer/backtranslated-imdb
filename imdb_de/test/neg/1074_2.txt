I caught 2:37 at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. It's a very good first shot (though the DV format is in outdoor scenes) and I'm sure he has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of high school - in other words, all sides the High School . But the filmmaker does not have the talent to write or respond to the promise of the premise. There are several characters, but none of them is more than what the plot requires. These cartoons are beyond the machinations of "I'm worried X, I have a problem." The roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally annoying. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the men. They have the Stoner child who is gay, the Jock who is also gay, the boy who raped his sister, and Mr. Peepants. As the cliché requires, all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent towards women and themselves. Of course (or unnaturally, as the cliché foretells), the two gay male men beat the women, peepants, and themselves together. With these characterizations, I would be perfectly fine if the stereotypes were turned upside down or if the characters somehow transgressed them. However, none happened, and that's all part of the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Next the ladies. A young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant rapist of the rapist's brother, and there is the girl who kills herself (I'll come to that later). I also do not think there is political correctness for filmmakers (I would not have a job that would), but I think it is only justified if this character or story has more. If this archetype were used to reveal something other than "I'm a teenager and life is shit," I'd be happy like a shell. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is undermined or changed or sublimated. <br /> <br /> Finally the girl who kills herself. This is dull and very sloppy storytelling. We're supposed to sit for 5 minutes while a girl violently killed who we might have seen 30 seconds through the movie? We've been following all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character who is not part of the story. It's cheap, exploitative and sloppy. Despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before, you have to earn that. You can not just buy it on credit. So, this suicide happens, we get wrap-ups of characters who go nowhere else but down, and the movie ends. What have I learned? I knew the high school was crappy - been there, done that. I already knew that people have stereotypical views of gay men and women. I already knew that children with disabilities are ridiculed. <br /> <br /> What else is there? Smoke, mirrors and some really nice views of the leaves. Oh, and the meanest Deus ex machina I've seen in a long time.
