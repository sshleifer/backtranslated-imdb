I found this movie in a XXX shop for $ 1 on VHS. The interesting thing is that Camp Video bought the rights to him and knocked on a copy date from 1986 in the credits. Enough of strange facts. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary at all. To even call this horror or "thriller" is ridiculous. There was no more than five minutes in this 80-minute film, which would be called horror, and that was acting, because it was awful! Aside from all the puns, writing for this film was also absolute trash, just as the special effects and make-up were ridiculous. No wonder this is such an obscure movie. The director has probably spent the last 35 years scouring the land for any existing copies and burning them on a large pile so no one else could be affected.
