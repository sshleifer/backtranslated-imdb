This movie was really funny, although it was not intended! The acting was stupid and the voices too. It was almost anything that was a guy walking around in a corn maze for an hour and a half. They threw in this stupid, very natural thing that made it even more stupid. It was not even like a normal movie, this weird scary music played almost all the way through the movie. What about corn maze horror movies? Maize kids were really scary, I thought, and I thought that was similar, but really, it was just stupid. The main character's type just wandered around aimlessly, yelling for these two little girls. And in the end, he likes to kill someone or something. It's worth seeing when you're with your friends, because it's really funny how bad it is. However, if you are looking for a horror movie, you should not waste time
