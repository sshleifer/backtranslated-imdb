This movie fails on many levels. The script is the first failure, and if I understand it, nothing can fix it if the script stinks. The plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes I look at the counter on the DVD and say to myself: "How much longer?" The cinematography is pretty awful. I'm not sure how bad the transfer to DVD was, but it looked like a VHS copy. The sound was bad too. I realize this will not be remixed for 5.1, but it does not even sound like it was in Dolby Stereo, which was almost a decade ago when they cut that movie. <br /> <br /> Slipstream was far too similar to Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Due to the lack of decent special effects and high-quality dialogue, it is extremely disappointing. If I remember, the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes. Normally it should take place in the first 20 minutes. Most people will be completely confused, which is the case until the last 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The music of the film was partly excellent and in other cases completely inappropriate. Elmer Bernstien has done the scoring, but it sounds like someone else played the role of "other" stuff, since it does not fit the good orchestra visit (with some synth music). <br /> <br /> There were great performers, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley and Bill Paxton. And they did a great job of breathe life into their little-available lives. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole movie was focused on him.) I'm not sure if a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character wearing the movie.) Another fatal flaw in the script. <Luckily, I looked at it from a DVD mailing service and not from the theater. Overall, a big disappointment for sci-fi fans or fans of Paxton or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life you will never come back.
