I was so offended by this movie that I had to write something about it, so please humor me. His only redeeming virtue, apart from good acting, is that he does not go beyond 107 minutes. Even this length is about 30 minutes too long. <br /> <br /> Comparisons were made with the darkest "The Grifters", but I can not see them. These are two different films. "The Sting" comes in 1973 from the movie "The Sting" the next. The "Swindled" is most likely to be used. He (sorry, STEALS) generously borrowed this great George Roy Hill "Entertainment", which is exactly what was. I enjoyed it because it's not like it's different. <br /> <br /> There are so many red herrings in 'Swindled' that I thought I was in a fish tank. It's very confusing, but that's just one of many problems. The most important thing is this: if you make a movie in which everyone lies to everyone else and all of them come in contact with each other, we have no "anchor" to ground us. The inevitable result is a mish-mash of sloppy seconds from other capers. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is insulting and offensive. Surely, a basic movie 101 class would tell us that the audience has to "take care" of someone. We can not look after anyone here, they are ALL pigs. It may have worked as a rakish comedy, but plays it from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM, DO NOT READ MORE. GREAT "SPOILER" COME. SORRY, BUT I MUST DO IT. <br /> <br /> There is so much wrong blood and so many false killings that it does not burden credibility - it destroys it. The end is absolutely ridiculous - a "murder" in a crowded airport that is not a "murder" at all? And the "murdered" guy, soaked in blood, just gets up, wipes off and goes away with fake blood and the loot? While the police and hordes of people watch and nobody intervenes? The director has to have many cojones if he thinks we can afford it. Noirish B-movies from the 1940s have done better. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of European films, but that confirms that Schlock does not always come from Hollywood. As far as 'Swindled' is concerned, my verdict lies with a famous line of the often misunderstood producer Samuel Goldwyn, who knew Schlock: 'Include me out'.
