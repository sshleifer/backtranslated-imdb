** Spoiler * There is the very irrelevant end ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film, there was a short intro by the master of Gore films, H. G. Lewis, into the world of Gore. He talked about the loss of this film and found it years after the death of the director again. He also talked about how Gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood. Blood Feast was a 2-gallon, 10,000 maniacs were a 5-gallon. But then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was a 15-gallon. I want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. When I saw the movie, I saw very little near 15 gallons. Granted, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but close to 15 gallons. Some of the parching scenes were definitely pretty bloody and realistic, meat strands and everything, but I would not say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "END !!! ENNNNNNNNDDDDDD !!!" Does this sound familiar to you? You should have said that in the last half of this movie. After the Igor character was thrown into the acid bath, the movie slowed to a painful crawl. There was no coherent ending, as 90 minutes before it did not fit in anything. She drove with a complete stranger, BIG DEAL, in a van! That's what happens when an individual (I do not say a person because she does not qualify as a person) is very innocent in the world around her. The doctor teaches the girl that a man must be loved, so that every man she meets loves her. <br /> <br /> Although HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the film that we might not like acting, directing, or even gips ... I'll go with choices A and B. Both were terrible! It was enough to give me bad dreams of cutting and people with restless eyes when talking to a person. But I made it through the movie and got stronger. Too bad that I could not say the same thing after finishing ROBO C.H.I.C. <br /> <br /> This was a bad movie. I can usually take my vinegar cans with a good footing, but now and then you get a movie that bites back. I think this movie took an arm or a leg off (haha ... * sigh *) Granted, I enjoyed the stark scenes in which the good doctor stared at his future victims and REALLY opened his eyes wide and just stared. It was very similar to Fuad Ramsey's in Blood Feast when he stared at this lady in his catering shop and then lost his power. I think this film starts where Fuad's forces left off. <br /> <br /> * Final Judgment * The movie should have been lost. Good day <br /> <br /> Scott
