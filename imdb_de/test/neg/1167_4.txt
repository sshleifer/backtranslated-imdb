Since playing an idiot in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor / stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His movie "Hatchet" became known last year, but he also produces a few more movies every year. He should have skipped this. <br /> <br /> Hodder seems to be the king of the Slashers. He played Jason Voorhees from 1988 on Friday, the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). He is working on a new movie that seems to be a Halloween remake. He is very much what I would call a serial killer with his methodical, expressionless thirst for blood. <br /> <br /> There was not much blood in this movie, and little happened in front of the camera. It felt like I saw an episode of a real prosecution on A & E. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Hodder for doing so, as the rest of the actors did not do much. <br /> Michael Berryman (The hills have the eyes, the devil's refusals) went with the Mouth, until Gein silenced him. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and Beautiful") was sweet. The experienced actress ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes, did a credible job. I'm sure there are other horror favorites, but they all seemed to be running their roles.
