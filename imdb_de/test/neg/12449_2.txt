Return to Sender, condemned, is almost imperfect. The only good thing about this movie was that I never got bored. That being said, the reviews that call this movie a low budget hit may not have seen the same movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> Instead of writing a review and telling you what's going on and what's working and what's not working, I'll just comment that nothing works. There are plotting holes in this movie that you can go through. Acting in the film is not very good, though this may be due to a poorly worded script that may have been ghostly written by George Lucas. No extraordinary sets or costumes were needed for this film, and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention that there were some action holes? At the end of the film, you wonder how a blind guy can shoot a shotgun so well, why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn, why she would fall asleep the night before her client's death, like Aidan Quinn 400 kilometers in such a short time Time to drive a car that keeps failing in the rest of the movie, which is why Aidan Quinn did not have a fifth instead of a bunch of nips, and so on. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, this is certainly a B-movie and one too terrible. Unfortunately, it's just not bad enough to be good. If you value your time, please let them serve as a public message to stay away from this time.
