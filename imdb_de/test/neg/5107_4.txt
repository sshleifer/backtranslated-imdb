When I first heard that the Nintendo 64 game The World is Enough was not enough, I was so excited. When it finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days and came through the whole game !!! The game was too easy and gave too many hints. A Majour disappointing sequel to GoldenEye. Take my advice and DO NOT RENT THIS GAME. <br /> <br /> Sure, the guns and gadgets are cool, but you get tired of a watchmaker who looks like he's been taken directly from GoldenEye, with the exception of a red color instead of a blue color, a bad one Sorry for a dart pistol, a terrible stunner and a stupid claw hook that can only attach to things that are yellow and black. <br /> <br /> I think RARE should be done This game instead of EA, which should stick to the games there, like sports games, and should stay away from first-person shooters and leave the work to the masters.
