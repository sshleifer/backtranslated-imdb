I hate commenting on anything that I did not finish, but if I spared a person I sat for almost an hour before disgusting her, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I decided to keep this open because I knew it was under the last 100. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. Usually I love rough humor or at least I can tolerate it. I love so-called "black" comedies. I'm not easily offended. <br /> <br /> It started well and went downhill quickly. I laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the airplane toilet), but that was it and did not compensate for the strong disgust I felt when the dog was sucked into an engine. Usually I can not see the humor when animals die (except in Animal House). I did not laugh much about the malice. I turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato, of which I do not want to repeat the details, only that the wave of nausea has still not passed over me. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it was full of dirt and just not funny with hardly any action. This is one of the cases in which, if you have nothing nice to say, you should spread the word. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn you.
