I really enjoyed Tycus, though not much more than to mock production values. Dennis Hopper was fine, although I wonder if he would have signed up for the project if he had seen the special effects used. And besides, what about the scene with the ninja ?? That was just out of time. Maybe someone came up with the brilliant idea during the shoot. Well, this movie is great when you're drunk and need a good laugh. Cheers.
