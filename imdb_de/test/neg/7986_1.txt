Thomas Edison has made many great inventions, but WTF is that !!!! I'm sorry, but this movie is just awful. The plot says that this elephant goes to a certain point and is electrocuted. Okay, the picture quality looked like someone was using it for toilet paper. I thought the early Charlie Chaplin movies were awful. Okay, maybe Thomas Edison was an inventor, but why did he make this movie he could've filmed? People might say I'm tough on time, but would you enjoy something of what I said? Well, I could sound like a complete A-hole, but on youtube see, then you will see this abomination. I still can not believe that this movie is absolutely terrible. All in all the worst short film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
