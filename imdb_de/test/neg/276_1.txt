Man I loved Ocean's 11th. <br /> <br /> Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the robbery, as each had their own special skills needed to reach the grand finale. <br /> <br /> What on Earth was Ocean 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I suppose it should be Zeta-Jones, but she was not really part of the 11 when she tried to overthrow her and work against her throughout the movie. It was rather the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones's characters, who had boring relationships with some parts of the original movie, just to have a few bums on seats to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The gang was always one step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They could always outsmart him. What happened here? He catches her for a hint and suddenly they are all confused? The entire film is such that they can raise the money they stole, along with the interest, to repay Benedict for the robbery they had against him three years earlier. So, in the next movie, they'll regain their courage and wit and bring him back so he can pay him back for the first raid. Puh-lease ... <br /> <br /> This film could have been achieved with Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes from Matt Damon for the Switcheroo scene. <br /> <br /> Slow movie, not the energy of the first one. I've tried to like it, and I'm usually very easy to please, but I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The shoot - the whole movie did not have to be made, since the true robbery was made especially of what you have seen in the last 2 hours. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER. <br /> <br /> Wait until it appears on TV or if you are a fan of the 2001 original. Please do not look at this.
