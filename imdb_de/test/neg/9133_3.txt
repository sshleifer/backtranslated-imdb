The peace and beauty of Koyaanisqatsi was a strong affirmation of the natural world. In Naqoyqatsi we are attacked by images of the synthetic, the competitive, the violent and the digital - the destructive constructs of our culture. <br /> <br /> Some freedoms are made with the pictures, with a posterization, with a load and a lot of slow motion. The connections between the sequences are inscrutable, if any. Naqoyqatsi is defined at the end of the film, a missed opportunity to put the images in context. <br /> <br /> The film is hard to see, the quality of the archive material is uneven, and it is the most lucrative theme of Philip Glass' hypnotic score.
