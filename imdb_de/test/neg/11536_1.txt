I know if you buy a used (oops, sorry, previously viewed) DVD for $ 5.99, you should not have very high expectations, but even that was a steep price for this bad cassette. <br /> <br /> I give the producers recognition for a complex challenge for the viewer. , , to find out what's worst, the drama, the scripting, the camerawork, the special effects. , , They are all pretty much the same. Oh, it has the absolutely MOST IMPORTANT fake car accident ever used in a movie. <br /> <br /> Now all this is pretty serious ridicule for a movie fan who proudly sells "Police Academy", "Naked Gun", "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon" and a host of other Campy discs in his collection. But at least these people know that their tongue should be planted firmly in the cheek, the plaster cast of PW unfortunately uses their tongues to try to go crazy and although it is almost beyond my conviction, the movie characters seem to think that they are actually do something valuable. A pornographer in the back room would be ashamed to let go of this mess. Oh. Luckily, I bought the worst video ever made at the same time ... "Fraternity Demon" ... maybe the name should have given me a hint.
