This movie was really terrible. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth seeing as it shows the world's most unnecessarily extensive sex scene. I mean, the thing took about 7 - 8 minutes (repeated the same "moves" over and over again), that's almost 10% of the whole movie! I did not laugh as hard as I laughed about it for a long time. <br /> <br /> There were some serious, weird and senseless things in this movie, but the ones I found funniest was the reason a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits in the air Complex come in the end. 2 minutes later, they run out again. What was that for ?? The tiny white forklift that magically turned into a giant yellow excavator was pretty classic. I'm convinced that this is because they used footage from the "Carnosaurian" trilogy to mend this absolute donkey. I have to see them now! <br /> <br /> The movie is worth a laugh or two, but if you do not like bad movies, stay away!
