It was once in the 40s of the last century that an actress named Veronica Lake lived. A beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many large format Hollywood pictures. Fast Forward until the late 1960s, age, alcoholism and bad luck have tarnished the favorite actress of all people. Miss Lake decides it's time to follow in the footsteps of her peers (?), Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and fall back on the good old horror. But a meat festival? "Really?" She could not have been so flushed. To put it simply, Flesh Feast is a lifeless pile of trash, possibly one of the five worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Lake plays a scientist working with Nazis to bring Hitler back to life with recovery attempts from adolescents involved in maggots, right, maggots. Unless you're a big fan of Heather Hughes, run away and never look back !! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this person in Veronica Lake, as well as the 40s films, but to think that such a successful career actually became so gloomy is actually quite sad. Meat festival is almost impossible to get through, and I mean absolutely. The film was directed by Brad Grinter, director of Nudist Camp Pictures, and the man who happened to bring us the biggest B-movie of all time, Blood Freak, just a few years later. One has to wonder if Blood Freak would have been like that if Grinter had not co-directed with Steve Hawkes. If so, then bless God Steve Hawkes. You would not believe that a religious bloodthirst, turkey monster, THAT could be much better than experiments with Maden and Hitler, but it really, really. So forget that you've ever heard of it and look for Blood Freak, it's just waiting to entertain you. Fast Forward a few years later, Veronica Lake dies of hepititas, is broken and forgotten. The end. I hate you, meat festival. 1.10
