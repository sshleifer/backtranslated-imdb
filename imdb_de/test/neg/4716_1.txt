I swear I've never seen such a bad movie as Half Caste. Not only because it just does not make sense is a huge piece of egoism and self-confidence that makes me suck. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocada (in Spanish, Apocada has a similar pronunciation as "Apocado"), which means "out" means life and happiness ") makes here a one-man army movie that thinks he is Sam Raimi or the guys who ran the Blair Witch project, this is the Blair Kittie project with an expensive, low budget. <br /> <br /> The story, a couple of American filmmakers going to Africa, Making a documentary about the Half Caste is simply pointless - the way you film, inserting high-speed footage with slow-motion shots, turns your stomach more than the stupid lines (what's the dialogue about bestiality?) or the lame ones By the way, I do not think that cast (or caste?) Is American, they all look European to me. <br /> <br /> To end this, just say the filmmakers took a smart step in the direction Selling movie. They made a fake price tag (as most of the original films) and a nice cover (in Spain, the cover was the image of the half-caste negative), so that I now feel unhappy, because I can not reclaim my 14 euros.
