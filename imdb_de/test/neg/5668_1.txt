First and foremost I would like to say that this show could have worked well, much better than now. What set it down was certainly acting. Miranda Cosgrove, who acts as Carly's main character, looked as if she was worthy of her own show when she was on Drake and Josh. Unfortunately iCarly was a big disappointment. Not only can Miranda not be convincing enough, she is incredibly stiff when she moves. She looks like she's not sure how the character "carly" would move or stand. In the very first episode at the end, when she throws her hat up, her arm never leaves her side from elbow up. even when she danced, she looked like a stick in the breeze. And the singing? The title song was great just because Drake had been there, the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice sounded wrong. I have to admit, the plot and settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, that's Nick. They are known for stupid lines and characters. But wow, ICarly is the worst of them all.
