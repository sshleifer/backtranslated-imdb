Given the incredible reviews of this film, I expected something truly extraordinary. It certainly starts with a witty and sharp dialogue and a good cast. A series of interwoven stories in the style of Robert Altman captivates the viewer with some captivating scenes. I found it exciting to the second half of the movie when it sadly collapses like a card game. A series of ridiculous coincidences and right-wing messages stack up until I'm deeply disappointed and wonder what the turmoil is all about. Paul Haggis has dealt with the issue of race in LA, and that alone seems to bring this film to a new interest. Since most Academy voters live in LA and have experienced some racism, this film will certainly have an impact on them. This means that the Oscar for the best picture goes into the racing film or the gay movie. Let's hope it's the latter, because the Brokeback Mountain is a true masterpiece that deserves recognition.
