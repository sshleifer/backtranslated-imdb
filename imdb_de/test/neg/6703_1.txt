Hi guys, this is my first review and I would have to pick the worst movie to rate. Since I only looked at it for 5 minutes, but could trust me, you could see that this movie was nowhere to go. The acting was unfortunate, the camera work and the lighting looked like they were being filmed and operated by a 10-year-old pack. No offense for 10-year-olds. I just could not bear it anymore, I got off the couch, took the DVD of The House of Adam from the DVD player and threw it in the trash. If you're a fan of Colin Farrell, this movie might be of interest to you as the character in the movie, Anthony, resembles a Colin Farrell look. But as far as possible, he'll certainly never have Col's acting skills. I only gave this movie a rating of 1 (terrible) just because the drop-down list applause had no downsides.
