Typical story of a bad kid who is chasing people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear on "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli did not want to emphasize this garbage in their CV (in fact, Schiavelli has left this life with a mostly good CV). Sometimes I wish the killers in these movies only go after the idiots who need a new one of these movies every other month (Note: this comment is not to be taken seriously, I just think that Slashers lost their contact. <br/> Anyway, this is a movie you should avoid, it's ninety minutes to two hours that I'll never come back.
