I saw it because of cold / statham, but honestly, chaos is terrible. This movie has absolutely nothing to offer - it should not have been done. <br /> <br /> Do not read this review if you do not want to read any spoilers, as I will talk a lot about this plotting holes here. <br /> <br /> First of all, the opening scene. It's the big big event that has upset the two main characters (Statham and Snipes). But it is boring and banal. Only at the end can we see what really happened and until you do not care. Also, this whole event of killing a villain and his hostage is barely enough to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as mentioned in the movie. Then the bank job - it does not. t off the ground for a second. The bank robber makes some unneeded references to the chaos theory (which has nothing to do with the whole story). The way Statham is called is very "The Hard With a Vengeance", but more boring. Then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless. -What about the safe. There seems to be an action unfolding, but not then. -Why are you bothering to attack two people if it does not work? It is a lot of preparation and is not needed for anything! -Why does the SWAT leader not listen to the officer in charge when he tells him to resign? <br /> <br /> And these are only the first 10 minutes. It's getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> -The whole love story (with 'he was not just a better cop, he was a better man' to finish it) is painful to look at. It's just useless. Why would Statham's character show the change in the camera position in the material reviewed by the bank? This essentially results in finding the "virus" that brings all the money to him. - Why are you bothering to sign some guys and kill them, but then you will NOT kill the guy who can identify you ... futile. The whole script is a mess. The "smart" references to chaos theory are really ridiculous and rather pathetic. The twists of action are seen from a distance and the main characters seem to be constantly making mistakes. It's really painful to watch a movie like this, where audiences are seen as stupid popcorn audiences whom the director hopes will not see all the plot holes and the ridiculous script. The "explanatory scene" at the end contributes only to the insult. It really is not a good movie. In no way. <br /> <br /> People who come to an action movie do not get what they want. People who watch a cop buddy movie do not understand it. People who see a smart thriller do not understand that. Basically all get the same - a big disappointment and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
