I like the show by Ali G. I think the guy has a comedic instinct but has not (yet) developed it into a talent. <br /> <br /> The movie is a little worse than I expected. I do not find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Jokes for 5-year-old, some good, some awful. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that is "offensive" but actually funny, please read Tom Green's "Freddy Got Fingered" /> <br /> 2/10
