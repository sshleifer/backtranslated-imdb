Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It makes me sad to see these films that make Korea look obsessed with blood and sex. It makes me even sadder to see animal killings and Americans say that Korea is like that. We do not eat live animals !! So stop apologizing for the crime by saying that this is culture! There are scenes in which the man eats live animals, and non-Koreans believe that this is normal. No, that's disgusting for us too. The director is an inappropriate, sick person who has been obsessed with murder and sex with family members. I wish America and France would stop glorifying this evil man, who is laughable in his own country. Please take a look at ANY OTHER Korean films that give you ideas on how artistic we really are. This movie is garbage.
