What could have come from some scary stuff is an incomprehensible, crazy movie that even the filmmakers themselves probably did not understand. If they had shown more of the satanic ritual or whatever, it might be weirder, but as it now looks, it's a waste of time and brain cells. Is anyone else fed up that the "little kid draws scary pictures with crayons"? Could there possibly be a bigger horror stereotype? Probably not. I know, I know, it's from a different country and it's far too sophisticated and too refined for me to understand, so I should not expect the "conspiracy" to be fed with spoons, blah, blah, blah , What ever. I still say that the movie is blowing.
