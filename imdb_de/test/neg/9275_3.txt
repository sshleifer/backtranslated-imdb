I rented this TV movie version of 'Troilus and Cressida' from my library last Thursday and just could not believe my eyes. Where should I start? No effort was made to make the play look like it was the Trojan War. All actors wore Elizabethan clothing. In addition, most of the actors were too old and terribly miscast - Aeneas (with his white beard) looked older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was played bad anyway and Thersites was a transvestite. <br /> Also, the action is bad, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateur, the camera angle is more focused on Nestor's face, so we can only see what's going on in the background, which is frustrating in itself , Also, the "fight" in the end is not due respect. We see neither Troilus and Diomedes fighting, nor anyone else. Paris and Menelaus seem to be wrestling just outside Thersites. Even Patroclus's death was left out. All this was a big disappointment, considering that I've been wading through two and a half hours of BBC costume drama to get to that point. I thought the Incredible Orlando as Thersites and John Shrapnel as Hector were well played, even if they did not look right. I would say the same about Kenneth Haigh as Achilles, since he did not have the striking face and was a bit dry at times. SPOILER: The climax in the end - the death of Hector - was perhaps the best part of the movie. Achilles dialogue here is excellent and summarizes the attitude of a cold, experienced murderer. However, the cruelty of the scene (when Achilles stomps on Hector's head) still stands out. Charles Gray as Pandarus was adorable as a sloppy old pervert, and I thought the actress playing Cressida did this OK, job. The warring Troilus, however, was annoying, and I think the play might have been better if it had been murdered by Achilles instead of a peacenik like Hector. Conclusion? OK, but it could have been better if it had a younger cast and costumes that at least tried to find the ancient Greeks, not to mention the lack of action. 5.10
