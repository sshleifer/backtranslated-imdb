This movie is shitty across the board. It's unbelievable - a very bad rip-off of Jaws and other (better) shark movies. Really bad - everything is really pathetic. The story is pure crap, actors are bad, effects are very cheap, no creativity. It looks like some really weakened kids took the Jaws script and arranged it randomly. Then the parents took their 8mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. The music is really inappropriate, just a bit of "lift" music, bland and overly optimistic, if nothing happens, then a little less optimistic when sharks are around or when kids are depressed (listening again to very loud elevator music). Carlo Maria (the author) should be so ashamed that he asks that his name be deleted from the titles !! The film serves as a perfect demonstration of how fucking music destroys *** ANY *** scene that is supposed to be exciting. However, there is a big difference to Jaws: at the beginning of Jaws there are comments about stupid people trying to kill sharks with dynamite. Well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. If that does not work, the boys take a *** load of dynamite and spend like 1/4 of the film by putting explosives in a sunken ship. This is a really original way to catch the fish that I have to admit! They use as much dynamite as they would try to kill a battleship (I would call the Bismarck class) or dig another Panama Canal. That's just amazing. I'm glad they did not try a napalm flamethrower or a tactical nuclear attack to eliminate that bad, about two-meter-long shark. Well, mystical Indians (who look like German pensioners) disappear into this mess. This is not a movie, this is a warning example of how bad the movies can be! As a warning, it is useful. But the public should be protected from this crap. Most Italian films are bad, but that really is extraordinary in the truest sense of the word.
