The idea for the film was not bad: a horror movie that was filmed on Halloween in a corn maze. The bad part was the sloppy camera work, the ten million puddles and corn and the one-and-a-half-hour walk this guy took in the maze. Oh, I'm sorry, the "corn". I picked up on this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near me, and I thought it would be a cool idea for a movie. However, considering everything, it seems that your average Joe could embrace the same idea and go much further. Bill Cowell's acting was not that bad, I would say it was pretty good. But the talent of his fellow stars did not help him. Here is to hope that his next movie is easier to swallow.
