I was pretty impressed with this movie as a kid of eight or nine years. The gangsters seemed to me to be very real and threatening, and I could see why people were scared of someone like Dillinger. As an adult, it looked almost weird to drive the cars that looked like they were from the fifties because of the exaggerated narrative and the shocking details of the gangster of the thirties. The way the criminals are portrayed has a certain, gritty, unglamorous reality, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and unintentionally funny piece that stays with me is the scene in which Ma Barker and her sons shoot it down with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "maybe Ma Barker became a real mother for the only time in her life". This is supposed to be a moment of great tragedy and great pathos when Ma finally realizes how she has destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead causes a laugh. A very strange movie that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie fans may like it, but rather as curiosity than a real movie.
