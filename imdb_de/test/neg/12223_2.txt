The Ten Steps basically has a pretty good condition for a frightening short, but the execution is just horrible. The dialogue is horrible and acting is a style that is regularly observed in Irish short films. Really really bad. The girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse. She calls her father, who entertains his boss over dinner. The mother, an "actress" with very questionable acting skills, picks up the phone and loudly says she should not ring because Dad "tries to impress his boss." The actress, who plays the wife of the boss, very successfully imitates the mother's bad acting when she tells them that her home is being pursued. The rest of the movie is that the father leads his daughter down the stairs on the phone. The Ten Steps uses the common techniques in camera movement, lighting and music that you would expect in a below-average horror movie. Poor.
