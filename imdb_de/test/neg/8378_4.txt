A bad Quentin Tarantino is a rip-off, at least I hope they wanted that because I could at least respect the director for admiring Tarantino. A scene, a "singing" scene with Rose McGowan, is far too good and ingenious for this film and could only have been passed over by this director by mistake. In addition to his Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene, this movie was crappy. Some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard, I bet that McGowan does not talk much because he was so bad. Trying to be funny is never trying to be dark and not stylish and just plain bland. Who spits the money to make films like this, I hope they were all directors, so no money was wasted by others. If not for McGowan the whole cast is terrible and if McGowan is your best hmmm, I have to ask myself.
