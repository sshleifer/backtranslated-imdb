Savage Guns (video title) is a dirt-cheap bottom of barrel spaghetti western, in which the survivor of a massacre chases the bandits who have killed his brother and considered him dead. <br /> <br /> Despite many acts of violence, he manages to be both boring and colorless with poor characterizations and almost no imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> Leading actor Robert Woods lives up to his name Woody and uncharismatic performance that generates no warmth or sympathy. In other words, the viewer is never really rooted in him, even though he is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance scene, in which a woman sings heavy and terrible unsexy German accent. It was the worst scene in Blazing Saddles and the worst here!
