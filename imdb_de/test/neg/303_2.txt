This movie was made before. It is basically an unoriginal combination of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives". There are some fun things, but otherwise it's a clich√© hole. It's a good first attempt at filming and the director (who also plays in the film and wrote the film) shows promise. But the writing was somehow choppy and the story was not very original. I swear, I've heard a few lines in other films. The acting, however, was very good and the film was shot in interesting ways. It's also refreshing to see that gay movies are not plagued with political correctness and tired stories full of fear. The main character seemed to be pretty well adapted for a gay teenager in rural Texas, so no saccharine coming out of drama!
