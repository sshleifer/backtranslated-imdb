Oh my god, that's so idiotic. Completely meaningless, offensive and repulsive. Why do the authors have such a problem with bringing Zoey and Chase together, we all want to! In normal shows, there's actually MORE THAN a plot conflict on the show, wow, what a concept. Also, you can not even distinguish the Zoey 101 episodes because the same thing happens every time. Quinn uses Dustin for a strange thing, Nicole is funny and stupid, Zoey is just kind of there, Chase is drooling all the time, but amazingly she does not realize and Logan is an idiot. to repeat.

It's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the film, again omg. so pointless is NOTHING. It's as if they were specifically designed to allow the movie to fit in between any two episodes in the series, leaving the show completely unaltered after the movie's presentation.
