I only gave this movie a chance because it had very good reviews. After watching the trailer, I thought - what a listless film full of clich√©s. But I decided to give it a try because trailers often do not do the movie very well. What a waste of time ... The movie is worse than the trailer and after watching it for two hours, I could not remember a single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but that's pretty bad too. I could not identify with any of the characters or hope they were together because I found them completely stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or mentally feeling that way.
