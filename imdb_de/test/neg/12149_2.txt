Well, Folks, this is another stereotypical portrayal of homosexual life, but the added drawback is bad drama, horrible script, no budget, terrible sound, and we must not forget the impossible plot. <br /> <br /> It's Christmas in New York City and our story immediately "focuses" on two male persons who seem to be lovers for some time. One of them did not let his parents (the right religious zealots) know that he was gay (for the presumption of history, because this guy is as efeminant as gay guys are today) and his parents come to Viusit. They will stay in his New York apartment, where he and his lover have just decorated themselves for Christmas. The story continues to evolve around the arrival of the parents, who will not like anyone anyway and come - as translucent and predictable ways - to learn that the son is gay. The tears have been shed, as well as my interest in this movie. <br /> <br /> The cast of the characters seemed like an intro acting class in the local community theater. The lovers in this film do not agree and there seems to be no cohesion for their union. The landlady is shallow and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation is under-frozen and certainly has not helped the family move plot further. <br /> <br /> The drag queen friend who comes to help one of the lovers in his "Time of Need" is stereotypical and gives the unique art of drawing a bad name. <br /> <br /> Although some boys find that one of the lovers has a beautiful body at night (again stereotypical images), this story does not help. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, especially if you are thinking about making a purchase. They shoot themselves if they do!
