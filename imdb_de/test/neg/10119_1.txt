At first, I really can not understand how some people "enjoyed" this movie. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Even the actors seem to be bored ... and I think that says it all! <br /> <br /> However, I have to applaud the creators of the opening credits - the team seems to have a really good future. That's why I recommend the big studios to ONLY watch the opening credits, and one or two special effect sequences (if they are seen outside this movie, it almost looks like a good movie). <br /> <br /> Good luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this "thing"!
