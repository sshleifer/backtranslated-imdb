All but the youngest Americans probably know the legendary reputation of "Laaaaaa-she!" from the little Timmy, or whatever the name of the child was, his little tow-head wailed for his friend of the Border Collie. These same Americans may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie made the leap from TV to movies (or vice versa, I'm clearly too lazy to investigate here), and The Painted Hills is one of them. It is irresistible to "make a movie that has gone to the dogs!" Pun, so I will not (although I have seen it technically). But in a way it has. Lassie (Shep, man's best friend) receives the highest billing. THE DOG RECEIVES TOP BILLING. Well, I do not know how actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but that's how it goes in my head: <br /> <br /> MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, Lassie, it's going to be in the credits. "and with Lassie as Shep!" LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOVIE MOGUL: Ha, ha, boy, calm down, calm down! LASSIE: Rrroo Rrrrooo Roooo. MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, I think I understand. Co-lead billing? LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrff Rawrf! Movie Mogul: Oh god! Let go of my arm! Top billing! Top billing for you, now let go of my arm !!! <br /> <br /> So the dog gets a top billing, and with the rest of this shell shock cast I suppose it's understandable. We get lovely old Grumpus Jonathan, the Prospector, his young, vain and apparently orphaned friend Tommy, sketchy loser Lin Taylor, and lovable old religious Grumpus pilot Pete. The meat of the plot here could be summarized in a few sentences, so I save you the actual pain to watch the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep, and his partner dies while claiming his claim. He gets a new partner named Lin, who is obsessed with the gold, and Jonathan gives Shep the weeping Tommy for some reason. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees it and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy whines, it's getting cold and Shep makes an elaborate plan to avenge Lin on what he (or she?) Is doing. The end. <br /> <br /> If you do not necessarily have a deep, disturbing need to see a Lassie movie (even then there has to be a better Lassie movie than this), just avoid The Painted Hills. If it does not drift, marvel at Lassie's limited ability to "act" (similar in style to perhaps Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, only the body moves) using the obvious by spending a few minutes filming or insulting Native Americans everywhere with the white actor-in-facepaint "Ugh! How! Me Running Bear!" Stereotypes, The Painted Hills is only for Lassie fetishists or people who are looking for some kind of connection with exploring their days as a gray, old prospector poisoning that gilded vein!
