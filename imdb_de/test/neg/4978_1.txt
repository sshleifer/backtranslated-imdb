When I heard that Disney had the rights to "Underdog", at least I thought it would be a cool Pixar partnership affair, and we would get a great movie for adults & kids like "The Incredibles". Unfortunately ... I've forgotten how Disney has to steal classic material for today's stultified youth. What did they think? "Underdog" was a product of the 60s. Her prime fanbase is in her 40s and 50s. Why should you focus on 5-year-olds? It should have been al "Roger Rabbit", half animated, half real. Instead, we get characters like Riff Raff (a WOLF !!) dipped in another dog. "Underdog" can not have an "energy pill" because we are so "cleared up" now that it's obviously a steroid or drug reference. The only good casting was Patrick Warburton as "Cad" because he actually resembles the cartoon version. Otherwise, old-school "underdog" fans should avoid this like the plague. What next? A live-action version of "The Go-Go Gophers" disguised as a revisionist history lesson? (My advanced apologies if Disney jumps on it!)
