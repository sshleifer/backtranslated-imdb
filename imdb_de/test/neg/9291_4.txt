Barricade finds Alice Faye without songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without a passport. It's gotten into trouble, I'm not going to say exactly what's exactly, and even American extraterritoriality will not help it. The American mission in this story, which was located deep inside China, was this particular institution where American citizens, the Crimes committed by American courts negotiated by our consulates. However, we were not the only country that did that. Anyway, the story starts with a train to Shanghai trying to use a sharp Russian accent. The accent fascinates Warner Baxter, who is pretty plastered. However, bandits are interrupting the journey and the two are seeking refuge at the American Consulate, chaired by Charles Winninger. He's the best in the movie and I just wish a better story was given because I liked his character. He is a widower and a proud member of the consular service, appointed in 1900 by William McKinley. Ten years later, he applied for a transfer and that was the last time he was heard. As Foreign Minister Jonathan Hale aptly stated, he is the truly forgotten man. <br /> <br /> Baxter does it all in a role someone like Clark Gable would have done while sleeping at MGM. The exploits would have become more natural for Gable than for Baxter, since the mission was barricaded and defended against the bandits. Alice Faye had a number to sing. Why Alice's song was cut out, God and Zanuck only know. I'm still trying to figure out when the mission residents finally retire to the basement with a trapdoor, only who was left upstairs to pull the rug over the cellar door? <br /> <br /> Barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. Due to the sloppy editing and the lost confidence in the project, however, the release of 20th Century Fox was unfulfilled. Barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal.
