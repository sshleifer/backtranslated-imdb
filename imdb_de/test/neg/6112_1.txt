A good friend of mine said, "A monkey is always and everywhere funny." There is one exception: GOING BANANAS. It's just the worst movie I've ever seen. It's worse than PLAN 9, worse than THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS. It is terrible. The talking monkey gag turns old after about three minutes, and believe me, that's all there is. Make sure you have some people who will revive you after visiting TOXIC SHOCK from GOING BANANAS, the worst movie ever.
