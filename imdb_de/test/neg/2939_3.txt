I am quite surprised that someone has touched or moved this film. <br /> <br /> The basic requirement of the film sounded like an excellent if provocative idea for a film about a rare relationship, but one (if I can judge from the real examples I knew) is extreme deep and loving. <br /> <br /> However, the film is written cheap - badly written - and although it has a number of very pretty-looking footage, I did not find it particularly. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem is that it's way too short and too weak to give your audience time to invest. Emotionally in relation to the characters: We do not really care about one of them, and so the stress and the obstacles do not really touch us. <br /> <br /> I think a REMAKE - from the script to-- With some character development by some really good writers - it could be much improved. It's revealing to compare this movie with Brokeback Mountain, which the screenwriters took to a much higher level than the writer - scriptwriters who were clearly aware of writing a classic tragedy and performed their task with care, planning, and superb craftsmanship! However, people only seem to make new films that they do not need! You really miss nothing if you skip this: I was really very disappointing, and it is only saved from obtaining a 1-star, thanks to the courage and courage to make a movie about this sensitive subject.
