Almost certainly a montage of women was performed, the lines (very short) read and show (not very short) naked in front of an anonymous (and not in the credits) jury - almost certainly with the producer Charles Band. Random scenes from Surrender Cinema's many films (mainly lesbian scenes) are thrown in. Most women like "riding horses" (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting, even though she went to an audition; a secret; Camera filming actresses undressing behind the screen ... <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Lovell (to make-up, but still beautiful) introduces some of her own movie scenes and talks in a "sexy" way Camera (If you like lesbian scenes, join Lovell and Vanesa Taylor from Femalian, and they're probably the best looking lesbian 'couple'.) Strange excuse for a movie and, apart from the obvious attraction of naked women, an honestly boring and boring experience ,
