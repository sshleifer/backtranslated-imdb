I am appalled that so many people have given positive reviews for this "movie". This movie has no redeeming factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I can not understand how anyone can enjoy this movie, much less sing his "praise". The idea is awful, certain scenes that are related to the plot (like the continuation of the love story, even though the male romantic interest is a SHRUNK HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to inflict bodily injury while watching them. The fact that there is a scene where a shrunken head flies under a girl's shirt so he can "feel it" AND like it is reason enough for anyone connected to this movie. The connection to West Side Story can only be ridiculed, as such a great movie can be taken in such a horrible way to destroy all copies of this movie. In short, this movie is terrible in every way. And if it was up to me, anyone who likes it should go straight to hell ...
