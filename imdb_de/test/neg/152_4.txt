Frankie Muniz plays Jason, a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is based on small or big lies that usually get him in trouble. However, he can not detach himself from his teacher and ends his homework shortly before the deadline. While driving fast to hand over his homework to the teacher, he breaks into a car. When he explains the situation to the grumpy man (Giamatti) in the car, he takes him to his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his homework in the car. The other way to say that Marty Wolf (Giamatti) steals it. <br /> <br /> After a few months, Jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that lasts for a moment. Because the story of the movie is based on his homework. He says that to his parents, but of course they do not believe him. Especially his father uses words that insult him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf declines, Jason grabs something and ruins his life. <br /> <br /> This is the short story of Big Fat Liar. Well, as a children's film, it could be a carefree, but there are some mistakes that could even ask if this is possible. For example, having so little money and going to LA with a friend to solve the problem, having access to the highly protected house and office of this movie producer and setting up a telecommunications system overnight. Does it seem believable? It does not. Well, this is a children's movie, but kids are not so gullible. <br /> <br /> The big fat liar offers some joy to his target group. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fat liar when I say that this is a good movie. ** out *****
