I was really excited to see "Cold Mountain". Like most movies I'm really excited, it was a flop! Without this miraculous invention called DVD, I would have stuck my head through the monitor, I was so bored! <br /> <br /> I have watched Kidman and Law closely when they meet because their characters are supposedly "destined" for each other. But Law's face was anything but a silent love, while Kidman seemed to count the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (as we would not understand, she is marked by Cornball-Banjos), so I could not laugh about it! Ironically, their performance underscores how rigid the leads are. Ada almost starved because she freed her slaves; we never know why. Even more confusing is why none of them stayed, as Ada and her father were unusually benevolent. As shown in one scene, this was a very dangerous time for Negroes (as they are politely called here). Why did not the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or raise a crop? Why did not she just sell the farm and go home? And, given Ruby's practicality of sending Ada's "bad" cock, that kind of kibosh puts her on her if she has more chickens! <br /> <br /> When her lover finally comes back, Ada does not need him or anyone else - which is the big joke! Although she may be physically intimate, but her true intimacy is Ruby, who has turned Ada into an overbabe version of herself. Did anyone notice how they went down the hill, happy as two peas in a pod, when they left Inman behind? <br /> <br /> I doubt that Minghella realized this because he was too busy, a Bush movie Inman says he is "like any fool who is fought with a flag and a lie," and Adas Father says, "I imagine God is tired of being called down on both sides of a dispute." These "observations" are historically inaccurate and offensive. While slavery was the foundation of the South economy, the reasons for the war were more complex. It was incomprehensible to a soldier to believe that the cause was "a lie" (in fact, most in the rankings were indifferent). For filmmakers to shape their views on a time when such views were alien to those who lived in that time is not repugnant. Structurally, the film is choppy and episodic. Law and Kidman are wrong and have zero chemistry! The script is little more than half a dialogue and a set of clich√©s and banalities. "Small moments like a bag of diamonds?" Pooh!
