The commercial for this film suggests he is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some weird sights in opera houses, so the Duke of Mantua, who urinated during his recapitulation of La Donna Ã¨ Mobile, is not shocked, nor is it sensational to see Gilda Caro Nome sing in the bath. It's just blatant and boring. What distinguishes this film is the lack of imagination. The director Corina Van Eijk places the duke's palace in a shabby swimming pool. In fact, he's not the Duke, he's just a character named Duka, so it's hard to see why he has many followers and his own jester Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a council apartment decorated with the orange sofa and decorated with spotted wallpaper, which is among the avant-garde directors de rigueur. The Duke, sorry Duka, is driving around with scooters (Yawn). <br /> <br /> Concepts imposed on such an opera can lead to unexpected and unintentional humor. What do we think about Gilda having a maid even though she lives in a council flat? When the call comes that Monterone is being jailed, we see him marched out of the pool by two escorts in pink shorts. One could imagine that he will urinate in a public swimming pool. <br /> <br /> It was common for opera films to be lip-sync 20 years ago, but today there is no excuse for that. A synchronized opera is like a soft porn. They do not believe in what happens because the performers do not strive too hard. The actress in Gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her lips when she's supposed to sing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bathroom, she lies back with her legs slightly set. It's hard to tell from which opening the sound should come out. The Duke later limits this by engaging with Maddalena in cunnilingus and adding a new meaning to the sentence that yodels in the canyon. <br /> <br /> The ambiance of the sound never seems to be right when the orchestra sometimes sounds like it is being played on a transistor radio. Pretty slow, rumpity-tumpity-tempi are preferred, so the overall effect of karaoke is in your local pub. <br /> <br /> This is a film of a production by Opera Spanga. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They usually occur in a tent on a field. If I had seen this idea in a tent in a field in Friesland, I would have been quite forgiving. By filming this production and a worldwide audience, the villagers also hold up for worldwide ridicule.
