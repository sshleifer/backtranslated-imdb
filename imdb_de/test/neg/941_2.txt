Inane, terrible farce, basically a young man who refuses to adapt or better use nonconformity to achieve his goals, and makes his parents believe he is attending college. The truth is that this jolt was rejected by any school he applied to. After you have looked at this garbage, you will see why. What a ridiculous name - South Hampton Institute of Technology. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to find out the initials of this school of nonsense. The problem with these types of films is that the non-conformist eventually becomes the accepted mode. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the world of reality and call this movie what it really is - excessive manipulative garbage!
