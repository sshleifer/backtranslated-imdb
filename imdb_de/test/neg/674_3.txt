Tyra and the rest of the modeling world need to know that real women like me and my daughter do not want to see all the ridiculous models to sell. Strange places, too much make-up and too much skin are not required. Sex does not always sell when you sell to women. The same goes for the catwalk of the horses, which looks unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and they have to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36-inch inseam, is tall and slim, and has a size 5. At size 12 I am rather average I will not buy magazines anymore because they are one-sided. We would be very happy if women of all sizes would perform. Thank you.
