A group of friends hear from a buddy who has found gold in an old train of thought near an abandoned old town west of Suttersville. Despite warnings from the local sheriff, Murphy (John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard (Richard Lynch) a confused Hick cheating tourists with supposedly collectible wool posters, and nasty superstitious Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) turns out to be a notorious legend (. That an evil miner who has sold his soul to the devil and murdered the daughter of a priest (Jeff Conaway) will return from the dead to kill those who take the gold out of his stock), these people only see that Green, not the blood red that could possibly escape their bodies. When they found the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they line up their bags and suitcases and prepare for the future that is supposed to lie ahead of them. But if you ignore the warnings of those who regard you as a backwoodsman, the obvious result will be a cruel death. Jeremiah Stone is, as we can see, only near an age when adjacent skulls illuminate adjacent skulls, just a skeleton. The pickaxe among them awaits their master, and dust particles bring him to a grotesque corpse with a demonic clay exhibit, his eyes sparkling with rage. This unfortunate group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold that gives them a warm perspective for the upcoming life, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickaxe. Another victim will encounter the evil end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing the way straight down her throat. In another failed retreat attempt, Stone caused a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree. His body is in flames because he can not flee without damage. Another, a girl from the area, looking for new friends to take care of her well-being, gets the pickaxe buried in her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those who are still alive about the forty-niner and the curse of those plundering their eternal hiding place ... and pays the price for obtaining such information. Will someone survive? Or is the entire group doomed to die by the hands of the zombie miner? <br /> <br /> John Carl Buechler, make-up effects artist and monster creator, directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or narrative. Instead, he allows his zombie miner to to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be on his way. He just delivers enough background story, and that's weak at best, for the killer to explain the special guest star Karen Black (oh how her career is lost in the abyss) to the viewer about him. According to the story before us, the miner holds a priest's daughter in hostage and threatens to execute her, as the authorities of Suttersville warn of such an action. Stunned enough: Stone plants the pickaxe directly in her back, and the opposition discharges her weapons with little effect because he has sold his soul to Satan. Stone retreats to his domain, the mine shaft, and warns him about anyone who tries to take what belongs to him, the loot. Typically for most slashers in general, these heaps of twenty years are your prey in the garden variety. Apart from a banter and the exchange of words, there is little development until the undead maniac comes on stage to kill them. They are the usual group from the city, invading foreign territories and reviving an evil that was about to slumber. Like many of the slashers of the late '80s, much of the violence is off screen. What appears on the screen, the minimal gusset, is rendered quite annoying and happens pretty quickly. The killer's Ghoul make-up is only shown occasionally, for the most part it is wrapped in darkness, the horrified faces of the victims when caught or pursued after believing them more than the method of destruction. One thing is certain: stunt men have been set on fire several times. At least three times a character is burned alive by either a lantern or a burning vehicle. Martin Cove has a small cameo appearance as Black's former husband Caleb now lives with a much younger and denser honey. Vernon Wells (The Road Warrior and Commando Fame) has the background story of Jeremiah Stone as a human being and is still conquering the same kind of threat he's specialized in. John Phillip Law seems to be a rather polite and hospitable amusement sheriff, who welcomes the outsiders at his edge of the forest. Buechler has a rather attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight trousers and small shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as an easy-to-lay Roxann who's always ready to wear her gowns for the greedy idiot Hayden (Rick Majeske) undress. Stephen Wastell (The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather awkward slide used as the butt of many jokes, including his "dump" and current unemployment.
