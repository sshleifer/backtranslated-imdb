Mickey Rourke is experiencing a renaissance ... and a fair game for him. I liked his image and his acting skills in Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you'll get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this movie gives you much more - and you do not want most of it. <br /> <br /> First and foremost - it just does not make sense. Rourke is a hard-hitting IRA killer who flees from Ireland to London after killing a busload of schoolchildren. He is on the run from the cops and his own comrades. He also swore never to kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids has finally done it. <br /> <br /> However, when he comes to London, he is tracked down by a local gangster (Bates - he looks like his eyebrows and hair are coming directly from a bus.) Burton's dummy) to his main rival for Â£ 50,000 and a boat trip to the US to kill. Rourke agrees to do so but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime in the confessional to hold the priest's mouth. He thinks it's better to kill him. <br /> <br /> Here are a lot of things that just do not go together: <br /> <br /> 1. Why choose Rourke to sell your competition? As a scene shows, where a clerk is glued to a wall by some heavy people with a kind of awl, these Londoners are tough enough to kill themselves anyway. <br /> <br /> 2. Not only that, the mobster gets a man to follow Rourke and see the murder with his own eyes. Why did not this guy just kill the competitor and save himself all the trouble with Rourke? <br /> <br /> 3.Hoskins sees the murder and the police let him go - without protection, may I add - to make a confession? Under no circumstance. <br /> <br /> 4. Rourke hangs around in the church (right next to where he did the murder) just after the crime has taken place to go to confession. Why do not the cops check out the place? <br /> <br /> 5. Rourke is hanged for days in the church, and especially Hoskin's blind niece, without anyone bothering him. What? He is on the run and stays where he committed another murder? Stupid. <br /> <br /> 6. The police actually meet Rourke in the church, who "fixes" the organ and has no idea who he is. Do not you know that he is on the run from the bomb attack on the school bus? You do not even look after him? <br /> <br /> 7. Why should he have Rourke killed for you and tell him to wait a few days to get on the boat? You would think you would want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /> <br /> 8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of waiting? Could not he hold back a few days? At least until Rourke has safely gone to the States? Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 9. After all the years he has been killed, Rourke suddenly has inner unrest and immediately wins the blind niece - even after she knows he is a murderer, she always loves him still? Again totally ridiculous. And besides - she falls in love with him in record time - a few days !!!! <br /> <br /> 10. The whole thing about the bomb in the end is just stupid from Bates point of view. <br /> <br /> 11. Part of this film is about things that just do not make sense or are just there to accompany the plot (and I say that jokingly). Bates' houses rurke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail, and Rourke suddenly presents a moral climax to respect the whore in the house - and yet a blind girl will be in bed. <br /> <br /> 12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman hits almost all of his boss's moves in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy told Rourke far more than he had even asked. <br /> <br /> 13. Hoskins Priest is a former guy and we see him beating up three followers behind a pub. Completely unannounced and another horrible scene. <br /> <br /> I'll stop at Pitch 13 without mentioning Rourkes hair (so fake red that it's ridiculous), its accent (which is fair.) Sometimes it's not so bad, but worsens to a barely heard muttering at other times), his clothes go, look to the sky, etc. I will not even mention the music and the choppy style of editing. <br /> <br / Oooppps - I just mentioned her. All in all - a catastrophe of a movie with some obvious religious imagery (Rourke on the Cross preaching from a pulpit) embarrassing a first year film student bothering with a top would be star and director. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
