This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Acting was just sooooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a pretty good actor, but in this movie he sounded like he was reading his text from a sheet of paper. Especially his voice was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was a complete exaggeration as Fratschkind Fraser, though this was probably more related to the lousy dialogue. "Ik ook van jou" is an adaptation of a book, and it seems that the makers of the film have forgotten that the film dialogue follows rules other than literary dialogue. It all sounded like books. <br /> <br /> Some situations were visualized very poorly. Example: Somewhere in the beginning of the movie, there is a scene where a canoe passes at a tempo. This piece is just too incredible to be true. You see an obviously quite flat river with many rocks just below the surface (hence the fast one). We hear exciting music to warn us of the danger. A canoe with a girl walks over at this rather flat pace. Our hero then dives a few feet below the surface to rescue one of the girls. The girl falls into his arms and says the words "You saved me ..." Vomiting! <br /> <br /> It was really so bad that it was funny. This is sad because it was really not intended. At break, I heard a guy behind me say, "Oh god, there's another part!" My feelings exactly. What scares me is that the credits of "Ik ook van jou" were in English. Does that mean that it will be published abroad? Just when the Netherlands got a good reputation after films like 'Antonia' (Antonia's line) and 'Karakter' (character) ...
