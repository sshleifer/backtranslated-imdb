This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two ladies go to a property to work in the garden, and each week they somehow stumble over a murder. Anyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? But even if they stumbled upon murder by chance, would not it be wise to tell the police? You know, the people who can actually do something about it ... But every week these two fools go around polluting evidence, committing their own crimes, and in some cases causing more murders. Once they miraculously resolve the murders, the killer can never be convicted. All evidence has been sabotaged. And you think people who cover up murders would think of not hiring them, right? Yay! We solved the murder! Now, like every other week, let us confront the killer ourselves and tell them without any support that we know about it. There is no way to endanger us, right? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst shows on TV and certainly the most ridiculous.
