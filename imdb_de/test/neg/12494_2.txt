This film was obviously filmed on a very small budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? It looked as though they were not trying to look the "future" in the slightest futurism. For example, the first scene takes place in an 80s office building and all the cars that are blown up are from the late 70s (I assume they did not want to blow up cars that cost more than $ 500). Besides, it's pretty obvious that Don "the Dragon" drives his personal car during the movie (after all, he partially funded the movie). Finally, at the beginning of the film, they point out that all kinds of drugs are legal in this new "cyberpunk" society. Not only does this never matter in the movie, but also when Don needs to be operated on without anesthesia. Why does not he just go out and get legal heroin or morphine? The whole movie is so sloppy and absolutely anticlimactic, as Don easily blows an "unstoppable" Cybertracker after about 25 minutes. However, if you find this movie cheap or free, I would almost see it, the last scene is almost worth recording this whole movie.
