And you know why? Because they thought (or at least made horror fans think) that a bunch of vile, smelly, screeching teenagers, stupid demons (where do they come from?) What's their goal? You have to make a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong It also requires a script, some logic, some rules and some ingenuity.This film has a scene that lives up to its reputation (of course the lipstick scene), and a few fun moments (the description of its mother's biscuits by the little brother, Linnea Quigley's scene "Do not look me") It also has more profanity than any movie I've seen since I last saw "Reservoir Dogs." Literally, every fourth or fifth word is a "f ***" or a "b ****." If a movie starts with four false horrors in the first 5 minutes, you know you're expecting nothing akin to good filmmaking. (* 1/2)
