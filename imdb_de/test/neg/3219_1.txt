I'm a jerk for Mob / Gangland movies, so I rented this movie. This movie is a complete train accident. With all the great actors in this movie, I can not believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I laughed hysterically towards the end of the movie. The actor, better known as Zues, or the big guy from the Ice Cube movie "Friday," has an incredible over-the-top job throughout the movie. The first thing I told Blockbuster when I came back was the movie to remove this garbage from the shelves. Do not rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life. When they come out with a sequel, I wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first one. I will be more careful when renting Mob / Gangland movies.
