I work my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the films in the set. <br /> <br /> I'm sure George Zucco was a good actor; But this was just the second movie I saw him in, the first one was DEAD MEN WALK, in which he played two roles. Even good acting could not save THE MAD MONSTER. Zucco plays a crazy scientist, dr. Cameron (banished from academia for his unethical and inhumane experiments). He believes that he can control evolution by bringing one animal's traits into another. <br /> <br /> In this case, like many others, it is a transfusion of wolf blood (I suppose) people. His goal is to create an invincible army that he can control with the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his rented hand, a retarded gardener whose dialogue slows down this classic with a snail almost to the stop. <br /> <br /> In addition to his experiments, dr. Cameron also took revenge on those who discredited him with his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his subject, who begins to transform without transfusion - yikes! <br /> <br /> The werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action / make-up effects. Undoubtedly, these were groundbreaking techniques of the time; In today's digital age, however, it is hard to imagine that the public is afraid.
