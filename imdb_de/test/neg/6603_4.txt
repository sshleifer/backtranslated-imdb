I chose La Bandara because it reunited Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier, whose Pepe le Moko is a noir masterpiece. I give a few points because Gabin is there, but the crude plot, the cheap sets, and the ridiculous Annabella, who does like an Arabian princess, put the film on my shelf for sale. If you see it, you'll wonder why the idiots did not build the fortress around the fountain instead of just a few yards away. And why tin roofs in the middle of the desert? But until then, the mere perversity of urgency that makes up the script should stun any further consideration.
