I am angry! It has been a while since the last zombie movie I saw, so I was really looking forward to watching a good old zombie movie. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. A sensible story, but horrible drama, film, dialogue, and disgusting clich√©s and punchlines. I have not even seen the first one who is supposed to be worse than this ... now I'm curious how bad that could have been! The movie is full of mistakes and puzzles. Who on earth analyzes DNA with a blood sample!? Why do these "special forces" who were "to hell and back" fight like spoiled 6-year-old girls? We see wild zombies taking a bite on every occasion, then hundreds of them wave their arms to our two "heroes", knock them down and let them go without a scratch. I could go on and on, but life is too short and I've already spent a couple of hours watching this pathetic film that is an insult to the movie industry.
