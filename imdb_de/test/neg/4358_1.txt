I really hope the creators of these "movies" read these reviews so they know people just do not want their movies. They are just junk and embarrassment to the genre of killer clowns. Whether this was better or not does not matter, because both are just terrible. I'm surprised they did not learn their lesson from the first movie. Stop it now!! Warning of horror movies, NOT WATCH, RENT OR LOOK AT THE BOXES OF "URBAN" HORROR FILMS AND OVER ALL, DO NOT BUY !!!!
