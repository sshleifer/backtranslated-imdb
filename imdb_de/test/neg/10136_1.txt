Oh damn it, where should I start? This show is just another stupid American comedy that looks weird and has a very bad sense of humor. The American style of laughter business makes things worse. How can I hear laughter, but nothing funny happens? Pretty stupid, eh? This show is only for those Americans who have never heard of much funnier, better, and funnier comedies - not just in the UK, but also in America (eg The Simpsons). I just can not understand what's so good about "Reba" that it took quite a while on TV. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (potential) viewers in many ways and is not funny at all. I could have lived with the fact that there are such bad shows as "Reba", but why the hell did they have to run it here in Finland. When I see a few seconds of this terrible show, the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word and believe me - this show sucks the ass even more than is the case with American "comedies". That's just awful. Do yourself a favor; never look at this peace. <br /> <br /> Well, I leave the comment to those who now speak this language better. Thank you for your (possible) interest.
