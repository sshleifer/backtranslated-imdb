One of the worst movies I have ever seen. When I tried to see this, I had flu and I was pretty open to any brainless conversation. Unfortunately that was too much. How can so many totally unbelievable actors be in a movie? This movie makes porn look like European art films. Performers simply express their lines without emotions; Special thanks to Charlie Snows (Baldwin), who will soon be ex-wife. She talks about her divorce, like the rest of us about the weather. Just awful (and funny). <br /> <br /> With a lot of alcohol and friends, this can serve as background entertainment and few laughs like Ed Wood movies. The plot is a joke and a soundtrack straight from a cheeky soap opera. I hope nobody paid to see this movie. <br /> <br />
