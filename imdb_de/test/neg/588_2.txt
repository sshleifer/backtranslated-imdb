I did not like this movie for many reasons - very boring! It was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this, but seriously I was very bored to see this. There was hardly anything to do. Although the classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visuals were very creative. If this movie is on TV, I want to switch channels immediately. Not because it's a bad movie just because I know what I'm looking at - totally and totally bored. It's a movie I saw when I was young, but I never got into the science fiction thing ... because it just was not real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic. I never understood the half movie anyway.
