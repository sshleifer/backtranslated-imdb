This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, it's not the worst - Manos the Hands of Fate holds that honor. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of problems. At the beginning, this whole movie is a cheap rip-off of Conan movies. There's the baby in a tight dress wearing a hubcap, the quiet Asian warrior, the villain of the cookie cutter, the almost pointless soldiers and so on. There are many continuity flaws in this movie. Some of the dumbest mistakes I've ever seen are in this movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, when I saw this movie, I saw the MST3K version. Joel and the 'Bots make the film visible, otherwise I would probably have switched it off after five minutes.
