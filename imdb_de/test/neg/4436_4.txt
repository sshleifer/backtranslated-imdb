The quintet is the only adventure of Paul Newman and director Robert Altman in the science fiction world. Newman was told he could not make a comedy, but he tried until he finally made a real hit in the genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this movie hit him hard and he never tried again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest downer movies I have ever seen. It's a futuristic glaciation triggered by who knows what, but it's probably a nuclear winter. Even in the Ice Age thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the earth still had an animal and human life, but apparently not here. The seals have survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside. <br /> <br /> But hunters need a bit of R & R, and Newman goes into a futuristic city where things are so boring that the natives play a kind of game six people and it's a kind of Russian roulette. To win, you have to kill five other players in your game. <br /> <br /> It is a sad turn to see what the man has just left. That's one of the reasons why I just could not go into this story. The atmosphere is bleak, the story is gloomy, the people are bleak, everything is so bleak. No wonder this thing at the box office was neglected. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that almost everyone believes he'll never be on the top ten list of Paul Newman films, including me. <br /> <br /> This is the man's future, what a crap.
