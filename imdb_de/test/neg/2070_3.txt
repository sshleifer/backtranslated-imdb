The plot for such a movie is a giveaway. How can you do something wrong with a gay act and all the colors and music of India - a story like this is written by yourself. I will mostly watch everything, but that was unsurpassable. The sad thing is that the whites are the most colorful in the movie. Vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor, and Jack was a feast for the eyes, but everyone else was so boring. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional at My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could, but the story was so boring. The saving grace was really the background music that made it possible to laugh at the movie instead of the movie or not at all. There are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just regular movies. I give passports to many low-budget movies, but that should not have been done or done by anyone else.
