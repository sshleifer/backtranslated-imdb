I am a totally broken movie fan with a house that needs to be set up. I'm a big fan of IKEA. My whole domicile is practically crammed with the cheap chipboard material. And you know how all those stylish household items at IKEA have those funny names - a bookshelf called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called "Grundtal". Well, it only adds to the overall Euro charm. <br /> <br /> Like these interesting (but dreadfully translated) shelves at IKEA, I would like to translate some of the reviews I read about the Kraftverk 3714 made in Sweden. <br /> <br /> Original comment: "It's pretty cool stuff for a low budget movie and it would be great to see what these guys could do with a Hollywood budget!" <br /> <br /> Translation: The stock of films is shitty, the lighting is pedestrian, the cinematography is uninteresting, the sound recording is hollow. <br /> <br /> Original commentary: "David Lynchesque's science-fiction drama in a strange forest town with equally strange characters characters!" <br /> <br /> Translation: These "actors" act for free, the plot is circular and exhausting, the ideas underlying the film are desperately trying to be existential but are simply banal and the settings (especially the interiors). are boring and filled with ugly wallpapers. <br /> <br /> Original comment: "Editing is well done, and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that compelling CGI effects do not have to come from a Hollywood studio!" <br /> <br /> Translation If you initially have a sketchy cinematography, hide the imperfections by digitizing everything on a Mac and mixing vigorously for three minutes. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> I took a chance on this DVD because I'm a fan of independent films, especially those trying to master the often expensive and impressive genre of science fiction. I mean, some of the best sci-fi movies of all time were realized with little or no budget, spfx and many actors. Take, for example, Peter Fonda's eco-warning time travel strip "Idaho Transfer"! A classic. <br /> <br /> But "Kraftverk 3714" does not fit into the category of "elaborate, reserved, ideological science fiction". It relentlessly focuses on characters who do not do much and do not say interesting things. It goes round and round in the circle. It's way too long (this comes from a big Tarkovsky fan). Worse still, his concept of "Aliens Changing Reality" is the feed of the Twilight Zone 40 years ago. It's just not a well-made movie - and I really wanted it, damn it! <br /> <br /> As an IKEA fan, however, I have made a groundbreaking observation. Everyone who buys from IKEA knows how his tricky shopping carts work - all four wheels are multidirectional. The cars can be rotated 360 degrees and it is a degree of familiarity to handle them like a pro, as any enthusiastic IKEA buyer knows. Well, I'm going to be damned, but one of the main actresses in "Kraftverk 3714" is going to a filthy grocery store in the middle of nowhere, and what is she pushing around? A multidirectional shopping cart! So this is not an IKEA invention, but another wonderful invention (let's call it "Tacklebee" to hell) from the land of hei-doo!
