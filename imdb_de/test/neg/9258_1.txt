Staten Island filmmaker Andy Milligan is known in the horror community for being an even worse director than Ed Wood. And with this as a weak example of his performance I can agree with them. In "The Ghastly Ones", we basically have three contentious couples traveling to their orphanage (on a remote, remote island) to collect a legacy. There they are killed one by one, and the events unfold in a murderous / mysterious way with a scarred retard-buckler-butler added to throw you in a loop. The film is in such bad shape that it looks as if someone has just rolled it through the dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialogue is beyond the world, there are some primitive mannequin gore (and some mutilations and mutations) and he is technically incompetent in every way it may be unable. But does it make a bad movie? Type of. It is agonizing to see, but strangely entertaining in a sort of train crash. Be careful. If you're not a fan of horrible movies, you'd better go deeper into this.
