** May contain spoilers. ** Dreadful. Just awful I loved Stephen King's novel, and that's just a terrible adaptation of it. They change the end. They change the plot. They changed the character of Alan Pangborne from a mourning husband to a happy fianc√©. If you're a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if you are not, stay away. <br /> <br /> The book was incredibly dark even for Steve King. An 11-year-old kills himself in the novel. A primary school head can be found with child pornography in the novel. This is far from being as good as the novel. <br /> <br /> This movie is my most unpopular movie ever. I hate this movie with a vengeance.
