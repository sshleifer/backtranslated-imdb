This film may have the worst title for a henchman ever conceived. Slightly appropriate considering the actual fifteen minute content. <br /> <br /> I can not rely on any of the "Shemp A.D." Stuff, but I admit to having some LOL moments from the two-man comedy that Moe and Larry are offering in the new movies (and a kudos to the guys who've tried to give it all, given the position into which they were forced to make even these dogs). <br /> <br /> Another bright spot on this and the last AD debacle "Commotion on the Ocean" is the decided lack of screen time for Joe Palma and the back of his head. No attempts to talk or hug him like a chicken (see "Hot Stuff") may be worth an extra rating. <br /> <br /> 2/10
