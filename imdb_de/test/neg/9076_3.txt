Other reviews spoke about how open this film is, especially with regard to male nudity. Those who have seen Grande Ecole with their often-naked actors and expect something similar will expect a great disappointment. Apart from a few seconds in the judo team's dressing room, the adjacent shower of the two leads takes a total of 15 seconds. The female lead has comparatively short forehead moments. Much of the marketing for this film is aimed at the gay, male audience, but those who even expect a touch of homoeroticism between the two male lead roles (best friends having a threesome with the girlfriend of one of them) become the most be disappointed. There is not even the hint that one is interested in another or is hardly aware that the other part of the menage is a trois. Douches Froides is strangely unshakable as a film; The viewer only gets a very slight sense of who these three young people are, how they feel, and why they behave the way they do. About an hour of the original cut was deleted. Maybe the finished film is therefore frustratingly undeveloped. Stay with Grande Ecole, a French film that more than lives up to its promises.
