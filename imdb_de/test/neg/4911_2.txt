weak direction, weak plot, inconspicuous music, I wonder why Udita Goswami is even in the movie world? She tried to show much of her talent (mostly Skin), but she did not impress. <br /> <br /> Music was not so impressive, just a song "Jhalak Dikhlajaa" was worth listening to ..... <br /> <br /> Aksar, the title? Well, in the end, they tried to justify the title of the movie, but it did not make sense. <br /> <br /> There were many unwanted twists in the story, which made it boring. However, if someone is a Dino Morea fan, have a look.
