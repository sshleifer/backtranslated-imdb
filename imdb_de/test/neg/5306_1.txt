I saw a show at 12:45 pm last night and walked out for 20 minutes. in, but there was nothing to go for! Obvious product placement, youthful screenplay, so much talent, gay, gay ... what did not they do? The movie is also awfully long (we came out at 3). As a person who rarely pays the full price in the cinema, imagine my annoyance that he spent $ 22 on this selfish, common nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). I woke up today, still depressed and unable to shake all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed to have lost himself in this thing like myself. As Cedric, the entertainer, is the high-water brand (a man so uninteresting that he needs to call himself an "entertainer" for you to understand.) Understanding what he thinks he does, you have a serious problem. Robert Pastorelli's appearance is also scary since he died nearly a year ago (March 10), which should give you some idea of ​​how long they've been cleaning this crap. "This film is meant to the bitter end Just stayed to make sure they did not give Robert "In Remembrance" what they did not do, save yourself Save your money Save your soul!
