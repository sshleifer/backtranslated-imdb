This movie is a waste of time. Although there are actors who have the potential to do something decent, the drama in the film is below average and has a clich√© point. "You never know what will happen tomorrow, so live to the fullest and do what makes you happy." This phrase saves you from wasting hours of your life on this film. People who like this movie are the same people who would like to sit for two hours before realizing that the entire movie was a dream sequence. If the most important part of the movie does not even happen, you should at least enjoy watching and captivating. There's a reason why this project did not do a theatrical release, and although Indy films can be very good, it does not even come close.
