Obviously, many people have really enjoyed this movie, and that's wonderful. It's certainly a very well-intentioned movie, and I appreciate that in a time of heartless or emotionally damaging movies. Unfortunately the movie has a lot of problems and it was not something that I liked to watch. <br /> <br /> The main problem is writing. It's just not funny. If something is trying to be snappy or funny and failing, that's far worse than if it had not tried a joke at all. The film is, to a large extent, a series of "snappy" but gentle returns between adult family members, none of which are imaginative or appropriate. There are also a few key premises in the film that seem too much of a coincidence or character motivation to be credible or really work. Some of the background stories seemed to be more intriguing and served to decorate the story on the edges quite well, but it could not compensate for the moment-to-moment flatness that permeated most of the entire movie Film also not good, although I do not know exactly how. Somehow, things always seemed to be a bit fake to me, and the actors mostly crowded in unnatural material. They tried, and I do not blame anyone here. There were too many small and unattractive roles outside the immediate family. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, not a good rental, although some people seem to have found it very charming (I'm 38; I suspect that people over 60 may enjoy this movie more?).
