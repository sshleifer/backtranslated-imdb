My best guess is that this song will be released on DVD sometime before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was awful. The timeline jumps everywhere. That would not be so bad if there would be some tension for the end. It was completely predictable. Sluts girls choose outcasts, Outcasts want to know why they hate them so much, Slut girls die a horrible death, Outcasts go home and look crazy. Outcast girl brought evil spirits, makes neighbors crazy and kills herself. Creepy kid understands what's going on. Oh, and the younger sister is not good enough for Mommie, the sick mother who sends a younger daughter to bring the golden kid home. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some great moments here and there. First Sarah Michelle Geller's character dies in the first minutes. Certain plus. I did not see that coming. I did not expect the woman to pour bacon fat on her husband's head either. If the movie had sustained that kind of thrill, I would have loved it. The beginning was promising. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I liked the first one. It got a lot of movement, I did not think much about what happened, and although I questioned some of the films, it was still a funny clock. I did not look at this sequel for a preview because I wanted to be surprised. But I was in the wrong direction.
