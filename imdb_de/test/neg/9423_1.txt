I was told about this movie by a friend who saw him late at night during the week. He told me it was so bad that I had to see him! So I went to an auction site and bought the movie. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It makes you laugh when it really should not. Terrible spectacle and terrible story. Besides, he does not look like Michael Jackson. I still recommend buying this movie as this is one of the funniest things you'll ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can not bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I have to say, although the special effects are really amazing ... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably even released when this movie came out, but if I wanted it, it would be a direct VHS release. Yeah guys, it's so bad!
