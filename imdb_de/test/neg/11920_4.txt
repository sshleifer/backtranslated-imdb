!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The premise looks like this: A shop is burned down and the father of the man who lit the fire is asked by the assistant Sergio to take the wrap that Sergio agrees with. <br /> So far, so good, but it's a decent failure of logic. Sergio agrees to do so for the sum of $ 25,000, but why? If you were a handsome white boy, would you run the risk of growing up in a hard jail (a very real possibility for arson) for 25? I know I would not do it, and since you have a criminal record, no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole, so it's $ 25,000 for a life in work and welfare? There is also something that seems to have gone off the premise without warning because Mr. Lumpke told Sergio that his son made the fire, he does not seem aware of the possibility that he may know too much. Would not alarm bells ring in your head if someone wanted to keep you quiet if he had told you something? <br /> <br /> I think we're not going to think about such details, because A PYROMANIAC'S LOVE STORY is not a smart thriller, it's probably the best way to have a lighthearted romantic comedy as a girls' night in. If you look at this commentary page It is obvious that the film has its defenders, but as a cynical man I was not overly impressed and William Baldwin surpassed the top
