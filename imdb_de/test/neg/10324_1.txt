I went to Blockbuster and wanted to see some good old-fashioned action movies. So I took a look around the action area until this movie got my attention because the cover had SANDRA BULLOCK in big bold. An action movie starring Sandra Bullock rated R? YAY! I admit, I prefer to favor them in a comedy, but if this is something like "speed," I was sold. Unfortunately, Sandra is not really in this movie, her role is insignificant: "Panicky kidnapped friendfriend" (She's in fifth place on the list of actors for Jeebus shakes!) Apparently this was her first movie role (and after watching this movie, I thought Sandra is the only living person in this movie, everyone else might as well be a zombie in a B-horror flick, this movie has deceived me that Sandra was the main character ... I was looking forward to it like Biff from 'Back to the Future ', as Marty "WHAT'S THAT ... !!!" God, I wish I had seen this instead. <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only bright side of this movie, every time she does in front of the camera, it's like she's shooting shock paddles and "CLEAR!" to get these movies working, but they're flat lines, no matter how hard she tries. More about Sandra later. <br /> < br /> The film is boring, very boring Think of the long most moment in your life and imagine that you have to go through this moment for 110 minutes (for me it is this movie). This movie makes even Gun Fights and Bullet Time effects boring, so boring that Elephant Tranquilizers are ashamed. Bullet Time's idea in this movie is a close-up of a slow motion AK that taunts you, while the caps that spit out of it represent every second of your life as it slowly chops off. And I knew that I saw a bad movie because I moved fast forward "THROUGH-THE-ACTION!" The plot? , , , was there a conspiracy? Music? , , , even at 80s dirt standards is bad, but at least it was the only thing that kept me awake. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good and. , , ummm. , , continue. Is it good, since it has rated R? No, unless R stands for Ridicules Snooze Fest. <br /> <br /> And it really is a clich√© of the 80s, when a movie with a view of a city (Rocking Guitar Licks or Power Ballet) starts and ends with a gun fighting in a gloomy factory with steel bars and different tubes. Both this film fulfills. At least that film determines what time it did not go, since Sandra's hair "1980s !!!!" And a movie gets really hard fisted as you watch an assassin stripper killing a nerd in the bathroom and stuffing his body into a crate to which you answer sadly, "This is probably the biggest action poor juice ever gets Has." Another Hammy moment is at the beginning when some secret agent dude covers a crowd and apparently this movie believes that people will jump in the air and fall to the ground when they die. All this scene needed was Mario Death Ditty or maybe Contra sound effects, but Nintendo could have complained. <br /> <br /> And it's sad when the main action hero of this movie rips other BETTER movie icons. Da Hero is standing in a boxing ring ("Rocky", someone?) In front of the big gun scene. He wears a leather fedora (not even "Indiana Jones") and an ominous headlight behind him (Terminator the 2nd before owning the T-1000)) What is really REALLY sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion Videos film in better quality (with a crappy webcam no less) than in this movie. I mean, most rant videos shot with a bad sound and a blurry image are more entertaining than this movie. I can not even call this movie because of its name, because its name brings with it cruel memories when I witness this cruel and unusual punishment (a damned violation of human rights!) Watch this movie. But oh Sandra. , , Why did you have to be in such a nightmare? The paycheck was worth it. The DVD also graces you with a little backstory about Sandra as an extra, seeing that she's the only one from this movie that ends up being a house name. Which explains why this movie uses its name as bait for unsuspecting movie freaks, Crafty little critter. <br /> <br /> I do not have much experience with bad movies, but I know badly when I see it. I could sit back with a good old Bruce Willis comedy from "Mazes and Monsters". But not even Bruce could cheer me up after this movie. I have not seen Ed Wood or Uwe Boll yet, but I think I'm here for them now. Because I can not even imagine a movie worse. , , "GAG". , , "Hangmen". , ,
