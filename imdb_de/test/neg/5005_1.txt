Pooh. Yes, it's just like McMartin or the horrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the film, the mother asks her little boy again and again aggressively until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear. The court investigators and "therapists" repeat the pattern. The interview itself is sexually scary, a relentlessly repeated attack on its own kind. The filmmakers are throwing in a doctor who talks about physical evidence of abuse, perhaps justifying the film's perspective: these two-to-two four-year-olds never make " such things". Well, they will, if any adult they know he asks. The way this piece advocates such discredited interrogation techniques makes it a frustrated exercise for anyone who knows what matters to achieve successful law enforcement in real life. <br /> <br /> (They also add a special arrest event towards the end to "prove" their case) - no parallel to this fictitious incident occurred in real life. I can not say any more here without making a case of it Spoiler, but you'll know if you see it.) Yes, children are abused, sometimes by paid carers. But to watch a movie that confirms the ridiculous, hysterical allegations against so many completely innocent people, seeing repetitions of the trials that have ruined the lives of countless children as well as the lives of the accused, I did not think would last until the end. It's just too sad, and even more so, with the apparent confirmation of the writing team of the abusive, paranoid, obsessional questioning techniques that have begun - how can we call it? The fire of reason? <br /> <br /> No one I know was ever charged with child abuse, thank Heaven, but my 12-time great-grandmother was charged with witchcraft and killed for it. Mobs with what they consider holy rage are as dangerous today as they were three hundred years ago. Sensational fool like this - "These accusations of satanic abuse are appearing all over the country, there has to be something!" "So tell the jury that!" - Just eggs. <br /> <br /> And who thought it would be a good idea to have children under ten, some under five, play these roles? It is traumatic to see how they deliver their lines. How much more traumatic was it to play these parts? The filmmakers' commitment to fighting child abuse does not seem to work for them. And what did the parents of the child actors think? "Melinda" (not in the credits, at least in the 2005 A & E Network version, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsall) were terrific. Working or not, but they were still too young to deal with this material, much less to be paid for it. Despite the reckless exploitation of these real-life children, "Do You Know The Muffin Man" received an Emmy nomination for directing - showing how crazy things were in 1989.
