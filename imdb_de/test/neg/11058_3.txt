In another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set titled "Women Who Kick Butt", but even in its original cover, Shannon Tweed seems to promise in an action role. In fact, during most of the film, Tweed plays the typical, whiny, and knowing female character that must be rescued by the male lead role, and even if she's trained in the jungle war, she still has to be dragged along by it! There is a rebel who is a stronger figure, but she is usually kept at the edge of the film. The male lead is Reb Brown, and he has some (unintentionally, I think) funny moments (like when he gets electrocuted). The action scenes are poorly directed and badly played: some of the stuntmen needed a few lessons to learn how to convince themselves. I think if you're in the right mood, you can laugh a few things in "Firing Line" (at some point we can hear Tweed speak, but her lips do not move!), But mostly I was just bored. (*)
