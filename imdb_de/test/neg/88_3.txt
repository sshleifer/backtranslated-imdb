Wow, what an overrated movie! It was to be "an extremely exciting story about a crazy killer holding a woman hostage and terrified in her house." Well, I doubt it terrorized the public in the early '50s, and I know it would make today's audience fall asleep. <br /> <br /> "Shake your back," shouts the New York Times. No, the only downer I get is that there is someone left on the planet who believes in everything the NY Times prints. <br /> <br /> Well, it was about a troubled man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact, this was one of the most beautiful roles Ryan ever played! Yes, "Wilton" was crazy, but he never did anything to the woman and just wanted to trust a friend. <br /> <br /> The movie got boring after a while and there was not much going on, except a lot of yakking. <br /> <br /> Careful, my reader ..... that's shit.
