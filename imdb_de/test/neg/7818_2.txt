For years I hesitated to watch this movie. Now I know why. It was worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher makes the worst film mistake of his career since "Dude, Where's My Car?" Tara Reid plays the lead role as the girl of Ashton's dreams, begging him to babysit her father's (and his boss's) favorite animals for the weekend. The rules: 1. No shoes in the house. 2. No people in the house. 3. The son of the boss stays outside the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> Well, at the end of the first twenty minutes, you can quite well imagine how the rest of the movie will turn out. <br /> <You know, there are movies like "Meet The Parents," where bad things happen to someone, but it's entertaining to see, and it's delivered in such a way that you can hardly wait to see what happens next. This is not one of these films. They know from the beginning that bad things are going to happen, and these are usually stupid things that would never really happen. It's an extremely frustrating movie, and I almost shut it off almost three times because it was so bad. But I paid the rent and thought I would have to see it now. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good and I would like to see her in other films. I'm not surprised if that would affect her career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending ... but of course with the nature of the movie, you would expect nothing short of it. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it. You will sincerely regret it!
