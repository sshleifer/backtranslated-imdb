Okay guys, I have to agree with almost all other reviews here. The characters. Are. Stupid. They are ALL stereotypical and still have nice clothes and are always thin. <br /> <br /> Do not even let me start with Jamie Lynn's role as ZOEY. Zoey is a handsome, beloved, brownish, blonde young teenager whom everyone simply LOVES! She has a "rebellious," great personality that everyone agrees with, no matter how stupid or extreme it is. Most annoying of all: Her voice is so damn bubbly and unpleasant. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> Take the first episode, for example. The moment she enters the huge PCA campus, everyone seems to love her. The boys want to challenge them, the girls want to be their girlfriend, and so on. If she considers herself to be anything, the episode with Zoey is always the focus of attention. She is the so-called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team, confident and has every sympathy for her when she is hit lightly in the face. Oh boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is by far the entire series, a girl who appears much later in the series, Lauren or something. It's the ONLY person Zoey ever introduced to the series. <br /> <br /> And sometimes Zoey does not seem to be very loyal to her friends. In one of the episodes, she even calls her friend a freak who NEVER apologizes, and regrets not the slightest bit. <br /> <br /> Zoey is ALWAYS the Best: <br /> <br /> -Desiging Professional T-shirts and Backpacks (which will be a great success) <br /> <br /> - YOU COME WITH VERY thoughtful designs by HERSELF to teach a single person a lesson. <br /> <br /> -Free touches <br /> <br /> - Blaming things that are not just about her, just so everyone else can be happy. <br /> <br /> - With a commercial that was so good that it was shown on TV. The list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Ugh. She has no acting talent. She is always the perfect person. She looks rotten and rebellious and neat and ... UGH! Can not stand her. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone on the show always has great clothes. EVEN THE NERD! Your wardrobe is better than mine and mine is pretty damn decent. <br /> <br /> Nobody cares if everyone at PCA loves you, Zoey, and would do anything for you, even if it means giving your right arm. <br /> <br /> BUT regardless of these cardboard figures, the representations are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and amusing. The humor is usually good-natured and fun, but the characters are so flat that it's hard to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> This show would be really good if Dan Schnieder thinks a bit more about the type of character he wanted because they are so typical, so boring that it is lame and stupid. <br /> <br /> Point: Nobody is the least overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, Zoey is the definition of Mary-sue. The storylines are well thought out and the humor is ridiculous. But I want to emphasize once again that the characters are spoiling the show. Watch the show if you have to, but do not say I did not warn you if your eyes started to bleed.
