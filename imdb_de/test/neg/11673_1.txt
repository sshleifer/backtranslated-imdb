This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max movie. After seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the great qualities of this movie, I was a little disappointed after seeing it. It supposedly began as a kind of kid in the wildlife movie and was merged with the Mad Max franchise (bad idea). The casting was not the best, I mean, Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this movie is that there are no good bad guys. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter! It does not actually happen if you plan to watch this sub-action movie (can you call it that?), Make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better, both. Another problem with this movie is that there are too many people, even the battle of Thunderdome is boring, Max kills anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in the good way) and after watching this movie, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.
