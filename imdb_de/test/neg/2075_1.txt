This film was advertised throughout Spain with a major advertising campaign. After seeing him, you realize someone stole your money. Paz Vega is terrible like Carmen, she is not at all natural and looks like she's going to cover everything for a fashion magazine ("the best" is when she's an Andalusian woman ... Basque and fluent) Â¡Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her as Jose, but the story is very slow, the plot does not work and the script is really very bad ... I think Penelope Cruz (the movie was written for her) would be a lot more believable and sexy Carmen. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money
