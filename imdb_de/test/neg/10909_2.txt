As a big fan of Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/), I expected to be amazed by another French beach romance with a lot of honesty, realism and humor. Same director, same actress - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline a la plange is a big disappointment. It is very slow and talkative, which would be good if the dialogue provided insights into the characters, would be meaningful or original. However, it does seem like a typical soap opera, alternating between irrelevant pillow talks and jealous accusations. The only thing that keeps this movie from a complete catastrophe is a small amount of character development or at least "character change" in Pauline's mind. The starting material is standard fare (sexual awakening during a beach vacation), but it could have been a decent movie if one of the characters was sufficiently interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Although there are other flaws in Rohm's seasonal cycle, most of his later films are definitely leagues above that.
