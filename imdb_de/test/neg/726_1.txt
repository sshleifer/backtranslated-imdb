I decided to watch this show and try, but I found it boring and boring ... boring. <br /> <br /> There is far too much sarcasm and the characters are all boring, there is too much talk and the character Lorelai ... just keeps talking on and on and on ... while a second look like a choking of the characters felt, the joke does not work and the whole love and romance ruins, which is a crap show ... I can not believe this show has survived the pilot ... This seems to be a show that the line "Listen to your parents" forces ... There is no real drama .... <br /> <br /> Should a pilot have stayed ... and a pilot alone ...
