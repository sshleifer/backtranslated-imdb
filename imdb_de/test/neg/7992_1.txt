This film is recommended for insomnia only: it will relieve her by putting her to sleep. Five year olds may also enjoy it. But for everyone else (including fans of the genre), what a boredom! The "ancient" plot is reminiscent of "Return Of The Dragon" and this movie is just as inappropriate, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is an even worse movie. So far, this is the second (the offensive "comedy" "Bachelor Party" was the first) movie I have given 1/10.
