Here in Australia, Nights is promoted in Rodanthe in the same class as the notebook. To be honest, what a lot of rottenness. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a recipe. On paper we have all the right ingredients ... Richard Gere normally perfect in this genre, Diane Lane, an old favorite of "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Unfaithful". At the session yesterday afternoon we had fallen asleep with a woman next to my wife and halfway the movie had gotten up and left! The main problem is that the relationship is not built or credible at all. And maybe there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like the stories that bring Gere and Lane's characters into the movie. There are hours of those who are balanced, with maybe 5 minutes, what we can see ... Romance! There is no warmth from Gere's character, Lane seems awful at the beginning of the movie and all are washed out. As a viewer, we can not really connect with the characters. <br /> <br /> Others here say that the book is great. Well, be it the script, the direction or the production that has really messed up someone here. It's like the scenes and the setup is a card game except they were arranged in the right order as if they had been thrown together everywhere. It goes to the video stores and even waits for a good deal when it comes to the weekly price.
