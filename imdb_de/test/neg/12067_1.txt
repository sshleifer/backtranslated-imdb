The cover and the premise that write there are so promising. As a Slasher maniac, I expect much of it. But what the hell is going on? The movie is awful. The direction, the plot, the tension and the plot of the cast are so amateurish. I even thought they were using a home video camera to shoot them. Luckily, I still manage to bring some good moments that need to make me like it. Thank you for the bad package of "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
