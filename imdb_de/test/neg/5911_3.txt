Just read the other comments here and found yourself a bit surprised when nobody said anything about the acting or the plot. Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy can both deliver an amazing stand-up comedy show. They are not great actors. Enough of it. <br /> <br /> As for the plot? Oh man. Every time the movie tries to "mislead" you into believing that the good guys are going to lose, you know these scenes: "What? Lose the good ones? Oh ... I see, it was just a trick "finished so terribly bad that you can see it a mile away. <br /> <br /> It had 2 or 3 fun moments, but not enough to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's a bit stupid that these comments must now be 10 lines. Many people fill it up with crap for it to be eligible. Being short is an art.
