The production values ​​in this video are so bad that it's not customizable. With more than thirty special effects per minute, the show took second place behind the overwhelming creative abductions of studio jokes. It is filmed by a cloud of smoke that lasts only one or two seconds, and often background lights shine directly into the camera. The lighting was terrible for the filming. There is a constant zooming in and out with a complete lack of visual continuity. For the live audience there may have been some good dances, but the audience will never know.
