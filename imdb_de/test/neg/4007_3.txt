Last but not least. Here's a movie that makes up as much for the men's call in Greece and Russia as Gigli for Mr Affleck and Mrs Lo. FROM THE EDGE OF THE CITY describes the sad and dirty life of some young Russian emigrants who live in and around Athens and spend their time abusing cars, lying down, pimping women emigrants and prostituting themselves ("But we are not gay because we are not You know ... And if it does, it's only once or twice, with the same guy. ") There's hardly anything you have not seen and better; Only the Athenian locale adds a little novelty - even then there are only one or two scenes that are scenic. Writer / director Constantine Giannaris ("3 Steps to Heaven") offers a relatively generic 95-minute period in which the outstanding moments are how stupid, sexist and (as it seems) most of these guys are irrevocable. (Interestingly, the guy appears the guy, the more redeemable he appears.) What really hurts is the treatment of women. Greek and Russian men seem to be fighting the Italians for this famous Madonna / Whore complex. Has life in Greece since Plato and Socrates much improved for women? You have to ask yourself. <br /> <br /> If I would like to equate Russians and Greeks in this review, I apologize, but even the non-emigrants pictured here (for example, the taxi drivers) are scary. According to another review on this site, the film (a hit on its native turf) was actually submitted by Greece for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film. What that says about the state of Greek film art, I hesitate to think.
