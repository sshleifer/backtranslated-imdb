As a half-film fan I had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago. I had heard that it was basically a $ 15 million film about the tyrannical rule of Roman Emperor Caligula, complete with hardcore pornography. What struck me was that it was a porno movie, but it did contain great followers like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren. A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula in the History Channel, and this movie came back to my mind and eventually my curiosity was the best of mine, I borrowed the DVD on loan and stupidly saw it. <br /> <br /> For the first 30 minutes, I saw sexual and, above all, violent events that would earn an NC-17 by today's standards. Was it really necessary to see a scene in which a man closed his urinary tract and then poured gallons of wine into him and then cut his belly with a sword (all in very graphic details). And a scene in which a guy cuts off his D *** and feeds him to dogs (again in very graphic details) .... and this only scratches the surface. The argument for this film by those who like it seems to be the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and its excesses. If this movie is really real then it is pure exploitation. From beginning to end, you see nothing but endless torture, beheading, and every kind of violence and coercion (sadomasochism, rape, necrophilia, never stopped). There is no insight into Caligula himself, which might have driven him mad, the terrible childhood he had made into a sadist as an adult. This is not a historical movie, it's a sleaze. Even the porn in this movie stinks, and by a lot of me I was just incredibly boring. When it was over, I was depressed, had no desire to eat and this movie does the impossible, it can really keep you from sex. <br /> <br /> What were these great actors when they thought? to find that very well. I read that the porno segments were shot after the shoot was over (which explains why none of the leading actor is in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so bad). And yet all these actors need to know what they are getting into. Right at the beginning of the performance is "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents". And the scenes in which the famous actors actually participate are completely repugnant in and of themselves. Apparently, director Tinto Brass, as well as the scriptwriter (Gore Vidal of all people), wanted to completely erase his name from the finished film. Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole asked people not to see this when it opened at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> For the price the producers spend on it, the quality of the movie is terrible. Everything is underexposed and bleak, as if the film had fallen into a swamp prior to development, and then you're lucky enough to see a scene that's actually in focus. The sound is poorly dubbed, much of the music is uncomfortable and the editing is awful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I got this movie on me. My advice ... do not look at me, do not look at this, do not look at me ...... I'll see something lighter tomorrow ... like DAWN OF THE DEAD!
