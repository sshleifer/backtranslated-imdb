The worst movie I have ever seen! 90 minutes of tormenting film production. All the ingredients to make this movie a real CRAP work. Bad acting, bad governance, bad storytelling, bad make-up, bad dialogues, bad effects and bad arguments behind certain characters' actions. It also threw a dreadful bare shot of a stupid blonde and a breast picture of a stupid Asian girl, and both attempts were just scary, since these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came from the '80s, but this could never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney has also committed one of the biggest sins of storytelling: he introduced characters at the end of the movie (an old man and an old woman). I would vote in favor of 1 in 10 votes, but the voting system does not seem to work that way. Right out of the title sequence, I knew it was shitty and I would return my DVD, but Best Buy does not refund DVDs or consumables, as they call them, or my receipt. I had "The Dunwich Horror" and that was truly awful, but I still feel that "Night of the Demons" (an obvious evil dead RIP-OFF) was far worse than "Dunwich Horror". This is just like "The Howling", how the hell could sequels be milked from this anorexic cow ??? Save your money and get the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (no sequel only) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead". "Night of the Demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. Every second was just crazy, agonizing pain for the audience, because the whole movie was terrible all around! Do yourself a favor, do not see it! They will save some brain cells.
