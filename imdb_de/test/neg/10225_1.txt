Take a clich√© story and insert Steve Guttenberg. I say even more, that's really as bad as you would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery are trying to turn a group of useless, awkward children into a winning football team. If one loses the originality and the direction of the offset, it is quite difficult to preserve any interest in this film. Despite my concerns about Guttenberg's acting ability, I can say with certainty that the behavior of the coach of the rival teams is actually worse than Guttenberg's. Especially unimaginable, I thought. This kind of story of underdogs who have fought to the very top has been done before and every time is better than this so-called "movie".
