I just wish I had the good sense to turn this movie off at the beginning, when I knew it was awful. <br /> <br /> Instead, I gave the doubt the benefit and waited for it to get better. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with an action. The acting consists of a man who wants to be John Cusack but can not make it. The lead role is a girl trying to be Claire Daines. Unfortunately she can not do that either. They are in love, though God only knows why. And in the end, I hoped they'd kill each other, just to believe that none of these kids would ever pollute the world again.
