This film tries to be artistic, but it seems as pueril as the first attempt of a film student. Next, it tries to be erotic, but looks as clumsy as the first attempt of a virgin. After all, it tries to be cruel and captivating, but apart from Kinski's performance - which is powerful but conspicuously misguided in amateur melodrama - it is about as poignant as your hand to a wet noodle (a suitable metaphor, considering how unholy she is this movie is). It shows a blowjob scene that is even more lame than ChloÃ« Sevigny's career in The Brown Bunny. Run away, as long as you have the chance. Instead, look for a lingerie catalog from Victoria's Secret - it's more artistic and erotic than this tripe.
