This is a sad Hollywood remake of a classic British movie. Anything that made the original "Italian Job" entertaining was bled out of the disgusting wounds of a movie that was "staged" by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly directed by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (the original film writer) has allowed his name to be used in the credits of this pig's ear. Martin has worked on some of the best film and television projects of the last 40 years. To be vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT a good thing. <br /> <br /> The humor is enforced, the drama is tedious, all characters are likable cookies (with the exception of Charlize Theron's implausible, beautiful) Safe Cracker / Rally driver) and the action is true only in the following points the original: <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (the modern versions made by BMW, but Minis anyway) <br /> <br /> (2) Using the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the Main characters <br /> <br /> (3) Interrupt the city's traffic control system to allow a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> (4) Uh, that's it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you'll get a bland and implausible American heritage movie, where a gang of funny pirate buddies finally defeats their evil colleague. Believe me, it feels like a terrible long time before they do it. The performers do their best at what they have given, but it seems they all accepted as a scratchy exercise after reading the script. None of the bizarre nature of the original film and its typically British taste has survived the feed into the Hollywood hamburger machine. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound. It's a miracle that Noel Coward did not make Aunt Nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked everyone who participated in this mild remake. <br /> <br /> Italian job? Rather like the Italian Jobbie.
