I've seen the worse movie. Like the other honest reviewers, this is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their pitchers. Do not be wrong, naked women are not a bad thing, but there is another genre for that. <br /> <br /> Friends are careful. I sold it to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang party (due to reviews) to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women indulging in the place. Beat in the chops for me. <br /> <br /> What makes me laugh the most is all the Dogey bike dives they went to in the movie, full of models with the work that looks cosmetic - which biker bars do they have? They are usually a little bit haggard with tattoos and loose-fitting jugs. Totally unrealistic. The spectacle is terrible, lots of pointless cursing and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Has anyone checked Vinnie Jones' attempt of an American accent? It's as embarrassing as his football skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. The only reason you would watch this movie is if you are a young guy who can not access p @ rn and stole it from his parents' movie collection for some perverted kicks!
