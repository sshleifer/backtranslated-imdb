I do not know which was first published in 1970. Cannon for Cordoba is a "European Western". It was made in Spain. This means that this is quite inferior to the so-called #Western Spaghetti by Sergio Leone and the Real American Masterpieces by John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hugues, John Sturges and Anthony Mann in my earnings order. This order can not be interpreted as all John Ford Westerns are better than all of Sam Peckipahns. I think IMDb's 100 sort them all pretty well. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this company is the casting. George Peppard is fit for a sergeant, Raff Valone for a "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Ralli for a "Puttana" on the "Piazza Vennezia" in the sixties in Rome.
