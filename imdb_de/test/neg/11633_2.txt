What a terrible sequel. The reason why I give this movie two stars instead of zero, because it's a movie that has violence and greed and sentient beings, but it's badly planned. And this terrible sequel was done by none other than BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The bonehead who brought you the remake of The Shining, which almost made Kubrick almost roll in his grave when he found out it was actually made. Garris is also the man who brought you the gritty sequel to THE FLY, THE FLY, a wonderful movie, but Garris's movie has almost ruined John Getz's career. Anyway, if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in the right order, do not do that. That's the mistake I made. Rent the first or the third or better yet. DO NOT HOLD AT THIS LEVEL! This movie is so bad that I can not believe it, please avoid this crap. Shame on you, Mick!
