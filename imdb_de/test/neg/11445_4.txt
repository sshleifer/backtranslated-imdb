A young woman, Jodie Foster, witnesses a murder of a mafia, reports the killing to the local police, and is targeted by mob activists. Dennis Hopper, a mafia-hired professional killer, chases her to prepare for the hit, but eventually he falls in love with her. As a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome, which defines a case in which a kidnapped hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster falls in love with her hijacker Denis Hopper, the actor, tries his hand at the creative To orient the ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing and can not keep up with the artistic level of an outstanding artist like Dennis Hopper. There is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is to a certain extent saved by the performance of Jodie Foster, who is not at her best but still shines with her talent, her beauty and her gift. Of historical interest is the brief performance by Vincent Price and a small action by Charlie Sawn, known for his great role in Wall Street. If you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the movie is not a complete loss; This movie offers light entertainment, but we would expect much more from the director of "Easy Rider" and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "The Accused".
