The worst movie I have ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the editing of the scenes was even worse and most of all it was not logic and it had no speed ... the track proving that poor Patrick was an innocent killer. "But this turned out to be even worse Typically, you get a super hint in this American movie or none at all.I want very small clues that will lead you to the killer.The audience is not involved.And now, if I get any hints at all, you may end up with a few searches And that's not all ... ah ... that's hopeless, we'll put an end to it ... <br /> <br /> In one word: disgusting .. <br /> <br />
