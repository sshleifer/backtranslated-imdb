I can not stress it enough, NOT get this movie for the kids. <br /> <br /> It's best to keep the adults away from this as well. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe I'll exaggerate a bit. This is not the worst kids movie ... no, let me put it another way. This is not the worst movie made by dissimulated adults for FORLUSTRATED adults and somehow marketed for children (that would be "Jack", which I would like to rate as a fish). <br /> <br /> Adults do not learn anything surprising (good, if necessary, fast forward to learn about an interesting cosmic phenomenon). In the end, we usually do not do as adults what we wanted to do as children, because reality gets in the way. Well, duh, I could have told you that (that's how four years art school at an art school can do, but I'm bad). <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the kids could get out of this movie. Most likely it will only upset her (we can see the moment when Russ was traumatized at the age of eight). There's a better movie, "Kiki's Delivery Service," which essentially contains the same message, but handles it easily instead of drilling it in the head. And the adults will like it too! By the way, there's a moment in the movie made with amstate MST3K players when they think of this OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it.
