I felt like screaming and trudging out of the theater, but I held back. Yes, the acting was great, no, that was not the typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue just would not end (or get interesting)! And despite all the chattering, you never really know or care about any of the characters. Definitely the most boring movie I've seen since Sphere, but I expected it to get boring. I had to go through it, but please, spare yourself
