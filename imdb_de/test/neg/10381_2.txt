Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a movie about an obsessed young girl. Do I have to describe more of the story? The exorcist and the exorcism of Emily Rose are two horrible, horrible films. Classic (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) does not exist. By far not. It's certainly not as horrible as a low budget exorbit could have been. It feels like a production "Made for Sci-Fi Channel" from start to finish. It's one of those movies that is likely to be faked and mocked at Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar show). <br /> <br /> The make-up and the effects were absolutely ridiculous. The acting was terribly bad. There was not a single performance where I did not roll my eyes or giggle. Oh, except maybe for Jeffery (re-animator) Combs as sheriff. The script was not terrible, but it was certainly nothing special. <br /> <br /> It seems most of the movie's focus is more on who sleeps with whom than the demon-possessed girl in the other room. Oh, there was something I learned from this movie. If your teenage daughter is obsessed with a demon, you only need to lock her in the room. Come on. And if your daughter is obsessed, do not worry too much, because if you have so much fun, talk to funny voices, eat rabbits, try to stare at them, and put foggy machines in their bed. Otherwise there is nothing to fear. Apparently she was obsessed with a cheap D-List demon. <br /> <br /> There were none of the cruel acts of A-list demons like crucifix traffic, painful body distortion or even projectile vomiting. > <br /> Totally ridiculous movie. Not even worth a discount. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points.
