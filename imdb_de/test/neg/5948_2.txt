In fact, anyone responsible for this filth should be whipped, pulled and hanged! If this is the great Eugene O'Niell drama, I would never want to fall victim again. There are so many things that are wrong with this feature, where do you start? Firstly, Elmer Bernstein's bombastic film music is present through the entire film even in the quiet scenes in which background music is subtracted from the motivations of the figure. Second, these characters are NOT sympathetic, and while some reviewers would like me personally to dislike any scene Ives refreshed in the scenery, his characters were written in the same way: Not liked. W / Loren it's never clear if she's good or bad? and all of her babbling about how she's going to change things the way they were before the baby came? Well, I saw what came straight. Perkins is miscast and then he plays the role of a warm-up for Norman Bates (whom he played two years later), who in the end even wanted to blame for the murder. Hokey! Third, this movie is a studio soundstage production and it suffers from it. The story would have benefited from filming locations to develop a sense of "place" in relation to the farm (which is the subject of all major groups). Since it is filmed, there is no value for the property, as the film has a studio-sound-stage feel that does not convince. This is a really horrible movie.
