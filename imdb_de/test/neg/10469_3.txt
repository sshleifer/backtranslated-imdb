Yes, I felt that after finishing this movie. The drama is below average and the special effects are terrible. In fact the worst I have ever seen. It is a very cheap movie. There's no way this movie can scare you, it has no scary or scary moments. Mr. Bone Eater was more of a funny creature to me. It could have been a lot better, but well, they did not have a big budget. The movie can not convince you to see a horror movie, lol. I would call this movie The Time Eater (spendthrift). I am sure you would have seen many better movies / etc. Still watch it if: 1. You have nothing else to see. 2. You can watch it for free. It is not worth renting at all.
