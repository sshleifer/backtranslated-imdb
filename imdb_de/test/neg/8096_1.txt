I expected a rather straightforward R-rated graphic, a sexual, rough teen comedy, as I sat down to see this. I do not know if director / writer Gregory Poirier is sick or sexually deep in the legs, but I doubt if a normal person could have made a movie like this. I probably could have taken it, if that was just it, if the only thing wrong was it was that it needed a hard belly ... but that's not it. The movie is also terribly mean and disturbing. Every single character seen on the screen for more than a second is extremely ... sexual, mental or physical. I do not know if this is just the humor of the director, but I just thought it was wrong. Simply wrong. Even in a comedy, there should be a certain seriousness. The plot is stupid. Acting is bad. The characters are inconsistent and poorly written ... all. There is not a single likeable character in the movie. The humor is disgusting and goes too far. The movie is just so badly made that I really do not think it's worth the time. If you like R-rated, rough comedies with lots of sexual allusions and graphic things, check out The Groomsmen, or better, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But do not look at that. I can not possibly describe how bad it is ... you would have to experience it yourself. However, this is one of the times when I say that it is better to wonder. That way, you can just imagine that this movie gets very close to the ground ... without knowing that it goes through the movie, and much deeper. Most of all, this movie looks like a bunch of horny teens get together, put together a movie crew, and every time one of them has an idea, he films them and later puts the whole thing together. There is a lack of structure, consistency and taste. I only recommend this for horny teenage boys who have all seen other R-rated teenage comedies and are not interested in quality. All others ... do the sensible thing; avoid the It is not worth even to see the prey. You can believe me. 1.10
