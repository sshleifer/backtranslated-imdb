After being pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance at Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot. Although Ms. Bullock is decent in courageous, self-deprecating roles, she leaves much to be desired in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days). Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused and sexually unadapted (the signing of Sandra's past acts as an unnecessary filler that does little to develop her already flat character). The two teenagers performed well, though their forensics expertise and their catch-me-if-can stance are disproved by silly mistakes that scream, "We did it!" Chris Penn as an all too obvious suspect is wasted here, as is Ben Chaplin's token partner / love-interest figure. *** Spoilers Ahead *** Being mediocre, the biggest shortcomings can occur Traced on a TV of the week where you never deal primarily with the murder motives and stupid mistakes (vomiting a rare food on the murder scene, an all too comfortable and framing picture) of the schoolmaster, the two boys hanging around together in public, a low interest in love to cause friction, etc.) make the sight of intrigue too boring and disappointment with the murderers. The end was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie. With the now Clichedian tactic of almost showing the climate scene at the beginning of the film, and then informing the audience how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes are not surprising and they lacked the so-called intelligence that the film alluded to at the end come. A somewhat promising concept, but poorly implemented and weak in almost every way. * out ****.
