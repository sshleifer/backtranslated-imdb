(Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Oh sure, it's based on Moby Dick. Totally obsessed and it destroys him. It is a total folly. The movie starts pretty well, but at the end of the movie everyone else is destroyed and the head of the main star is empty. <br /> <br /> The supposed half-sister never convinces. Some very bad lighting effects. Music is interesting. But little else. It took more than a month to finish the damn thing. If you like John Malkovich, you might like it. But since BJM was a great movie that I just did not want to watch anymore, Pola X is a movie that I just hate hellishly. The only possible excitement in the movie is the poisoned incest sex scene towards the end of the movie. (I hope you do not think about Catherine.) <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely boring, depressing and badly directed. Not very recommendable. If you like French films. (Watch Crimson Rivers instead) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Repeatable: 0/10
