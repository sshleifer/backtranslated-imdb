Seven pioneering children strive independently for many miles of Indian territory and inclement weather to Oregon. <br /> <br /> According to the story, young people who have traveled alone across much of the country - for example, with the 'Children's Crusade' - have been manipulated and exploited by being abused and sold into slavery, but These kids are pretty tough and try their best to achieve their goal of creating a home in the west. The movie is sometimes a bit too juicy, but fine for fans of 'The Waltons' and 'Little House on the Prairie'. <br /> <br /> Dean Smith gives a cool performance as 'Kit Carson'.
