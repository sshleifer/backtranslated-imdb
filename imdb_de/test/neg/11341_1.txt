Racing fanatic Fabian (as Tommy Callahan) smokes, drinks and suffers from blackouts while sharing the sentiments of seductive brunette Annette Funicello (as Francie Madsen) and blonde actress Diane McBain (as Annie Blaine). Complications include Ms. Funicello's playful racing car friend Warren Berlinger (as Eddie Sands) and her father Jan Murray (as Pete Madsen), who encourages the reckless drivers. Funicello's cow-eyed performance is sometimes fun; Her drunken driving scene, however, is disturbing. "Thunder Alley" offers slightly more NASCAR excitement than its predecessor "Fireball 500" (1966) *; be warned, it is not much. A wild party scene with a light strip-tease is the highlight of the movie.
