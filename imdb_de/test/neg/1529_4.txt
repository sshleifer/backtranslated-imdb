First, the first season is unbearably bad. The prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent, and the direction is terrible. It runs like a bad video of a high school at junior high school, the characters walk past the camera, utter highly timed and well-rehearsed lines and go on as a casual prison talk. Soon the show will be better, but not much. The return from the commercial break is always accompanied by a ridiculous monologue by the wheelchair user Augustus Hill, played by Harold Perrineau impressively. His character is only consistently poor during the poor performance monologues, most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what's going on in the show. Unfortunately, the bad ideas in Oz could fill an encyclopedia with several volumes. First, consider the whole situation. The detainees can be in the distance, getting drunk, taking drugs, and not only do they have CD players (CDs - they might as well drop steak knives), but all incoming messages are scrutinized by PRISONERS. Christ, the place is like a men's club with guards. Guards who do not do much. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of season two, a grandson of an elderly detainee is diagnosed with leukemia and all prisoners throw in big bundles of $ 20 and $ 50 to send to Disneyworld for his last wish fulfill. These must be the richest prisoners in the world. Every single prisoner in Oz suddenly became caring and loving, with the exception of Kenny Wangler, an irritating character, but one of the few who is consistently persuasive. Even Adibisi wanted to be nice. But that's fine, because there is no order and no sense in the show, so this is not a distraction. <br /> <br /> Later, shockingly, there is a boxing scene in which an inmate wears a "jersey". I love Cops' T-Shirt, im jail !! Can you imagine? I have a cousin who was imprisoned several years ago, I sent him an old photo of us with some friends in high school, and In the picture, one of my friends held an "I Love Cops" sticker and a "forest" (boys who were in jail) years and years ago) saw the picture, but just grabbed it and tore it to bits, my cousin had Lucky. <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler keeps yelling at the guards and even more high-ranking officers because they do not call him bricks, and one of them even tried to bribe him for an English lesson For example, the detainees, the detainees, or the guards, for example, several investigators go to the detention center and are killed to stop drug trafficking, and I would personally stop the inmates being inspected by incoming mail rather than the investigators ler kill. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Shillingers son is alone and no one thinks about the guard how he got the drugs. He only got them, I guess. And be careful, otherwise you will miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to afford cell carcinoma if they get bad gums. I did not know that guests in prisons were given such luxurious treatment options with maximum security. How about Robson going to Drs. Faraj's schedule asks, so he can ask what type of gum he got, Faraj is so scared that he goes to the guard and quits his job on the spot. Do not doctors and dentists have the right not to visit certain prisoners? After Poet and O'Reilly made the announcement in the entire prison, Robson asks Dr. Faraj is seen, and is brought to his office without knocking, and the guard promptly goes back without a word. You might as well give him a gun. <br /> <br /> I should not talk about stupid ideas on this show, but it's like a flood, I can not stop it. Who has thought of the Chinese refugees who do not speak Chinese and who disappear en masse when not in use? Who thought of the stupid religious wars and the venerable prisoners? But who of Robson's gum? What is the deal with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon, because he clearly does not belong in prison and Busmalis, because of the whole thing with his grandson. Macbeth, because it was nothing more than a ridiculous device, so to speak, for a purpose. <br /> <br /> But what are the worst ideas? Things that go nowhere, that are constant. An Irish man comes to jail and builds a bomb. He threatens to blow up the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be a fool, and the episode ends with him being taken away from the bomb squad after the evacuation of the entire prison. You'll never hear anything from him or from the whole situation again. It's like it never happened. In one episode, prisoners receive dogs for training. What the hell?? If that was not bad enough, a guard fired his weapon into the prison walls as a training exercise during a workout. No one seems to mind. <br /> <br /> I also like it when some kind of altercation breaks out, the guilty ones are pushed aside, they say nothing and the guards or the warden or sister Pete or whoever says, "I hope you do not believe that I will let go !! " And then they go away and let go. The audience will not remember. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was spoiled by Prison Break, but Oz is just a stupid jail drama that may be more appropriate as a play. A short. At least a low-budget movie. It's just not enough to sustain a multi-season TV show. Then I watched six seasons of it on DVD. Sometimes I do not understand myself ...
