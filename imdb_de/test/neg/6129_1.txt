Oh boy, oh boy. This movie is for lovers of "real" cineatique art. It makes no sense at all. It is totally boring, especially because of the "anti-climaxes". All humans are more than strange and unrealistic. Sometimes it feels like sitting in a theater, because in dialogues the actors tend to turn to the camera (and thus to the audience) instead of looking at each other. As I said, if you are interested in these artful films shown at Cannes, then come on in. If you are not, you prefer to leave this film alone, because you will be more than disappointed and end up knowing that you wereted your time - like me. Two thumbs down ...: - (((
