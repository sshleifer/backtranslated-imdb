I just caught The Rain People late at night on Turner Classic Movies. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight plays as Natalie, a housewife on Long Island, who leaves her husband and goes on a road trip without knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which makes things more complicated. Along the way, she brings a brain-damaged ex-footballer "Jimmy" (James Caan), who was thrown out of his college and hitchhikes. There are many twists on the way between these two, while Natalie takes care of looking after Jimmy, and she realizes that he is mentally limited and can not take care of himself. Of course, she goes through her own struggles and does not have to worry about him. Natalie sometimes seems to be a woman on the brink of a nervous breakdown; She calls her husband, who asks her to come home. Natalie tries several times to throw Jimmy away, only to bring him back to life through circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled policeman who befriends Natalie. You always have the feeling that this movie is going to end badly and he does. This film is certainly sometimes inconsistent and the script is missing something. Francis Ford Coppola led this, and of course he would become very famous in the next few years because he staged "The Godfather". The actors are of course good, because they have all the future in the film in front of them. Shirley Knight is the lesser known of the three, though she is underestimated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here and he seems to inhabit this character. This movie is no more than a curiosity, no doubt because it's an early movie by Coppola, and I confess I had never heard of it. So God Bless Turner Classic Movies for introducing them to a new audience.
