Ok, usually I'm pretty open to movies. I can usually see a good site for a movie that has been completely changed by others. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste too much energy and tell you what's going on, but think of the direction Bill and Ted are taking in the worst movie of the Police Academy of all, and you've won 'I am not far away. <br /> <br /> What really interested me in this movie was the stupid, purile racism that made itself felt throughout. The general theme of Latino / Black Guys = Cool, White Guys = Lame is a little amusing for the first few jokes, but if the same joke is repeated for the 500th time (no exaggeration), it becomes tiring and offensive <br /> < br /> I've been waiting months for Karma's laws to return to John Leguizamo for this film. I had almost given up hope when the "My VH1 Awards" were shown live in the UK. What followed was Mr. Leguizamo, who performed the rare performance of a comedy bombardment on stage. You would have to be an absolute sadist to laugh at him. Hm. Ha! Ha! Ha!
