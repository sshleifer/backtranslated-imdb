*** SPOILERS *** A hot and sexy Linda Blair as a witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset about her friend and rival Witch in the other city of Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia has her husband Hal, Edward Albert, promoted because of his deserving Larry Barnes and Larry Poindexter, who happens to be married to Erica because of his job at the law firm Giger & Greengrass, to lose control of his car and nearly kill himself , <br /> <br /> Larry finds out that Erica's attempt to save his best friend, his life, violently struggles with her, causing Erica to fall off the balcony. It's when Larry returns to his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things are really heating up, both emotionally and sexually. The evil Amelia tries to bring the dead spirit of Erica over Carol's body and in the end to assassinate Larry, who blames her for the injury to her husband Hal, who left him permanently in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Not much of a story, but lots of cheese and softcore action, with poor Larry being manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica, who is about to kill him when he first kills her wanted. Amelia is a bit exhausted because she does not know who she is and who does not threaten her. Amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks, to lose his family first in a bloody invasion of the inmates, then his mind by being accused by the police of being a murderer, and finally being killed by being blown up by them becomes Ameila himself As he runs into the Reynolds' house, under her control, as crazy as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled Hal. <br /> <br /> Larry Parks looked and seemed so weird that you felt he had accidentally stepped on the set of "Sorceress" and eventually played Stan as a cast member. Without the help or benefit of a script he improvised and slowly realized how horribly bad the movie really is. Stan, who was killed early in the movie, was a great asset to him, as he did not have to go through the whole mindless and mind-blowing movie like the ones we watched. <br /> <br /> It becomes obvious to you as well as to the creators of "Sorceress" that all these shenanigans have to come to a hopeful and successful conclusion on screen, and a trick ends to put an end to the movie , In the end, it's about the best, next to Miss Blair and the rest of the well-endowed women's cast you can say about the movie.
