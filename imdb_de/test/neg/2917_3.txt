This Harold-Lloyd sound-film hardly laughs, and one wonders if this Lloyd is the very same one who set off all those delightful and hilarious Silents. Lloyd's young sympathy grows fey and flabby When we hear him speak and a slow, restrained pace replaces the crazy antics of his silence. Lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who grows up in China and is then transplanted to today's New York City without knowing how life outside his Chinese village works. He finds himself as an unlikely winner in a mayoral election and quickly attracts the wrath of all government organizations, because he refuses to look in the face of rampant corruption in the other direction. When he tries to bring him down, he decides to play as dirty as anyone else, and stages a fake execution of any rogue in New York as a scare tactic. This dark satirical ending feels out of place with everything else in the movie, but it's the only part of the movie that comes to life from a distance. Everything else is boring. <br /> <br /> I do not have to admit that a movie by Harold Lloyd fails because I like it so much, but I have no choice in this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: D
