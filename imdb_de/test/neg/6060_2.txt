I thought this movie could have some value, and I went through it all. In summary, I can say that it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The movie started well, I think the initial characterization of Herc was true to the myths. Both as a child and as a young adult, he started quite strong, but not the brightest light bulb. Later, however, he transforms into a charismatic speaker who is loved by all. Huh <br /> <br /> Other problem: terrible CGI. The satyr looked good, but the rest of the animals just looked awful, especially the deer, the loudest-looking beast in the movie. And how did it happen that Leelee Sobieski's skin was sometimes golden and sometimes normal? The worst thing for me - and everyone should be scared - was the twelve works by Hercules. Because the producers obviously did not want to cover all of them; Maybe they thought we primitive screw heads watching this garbage could not count that high. Instead of Hercules' TWELVE work, we received the FIVE work from Hercules. Yes, the five works! WTF? He did not even finish the last one, so it really was the 4 1/2 troubles! Just terrible. Every day of the week I take Hercules: The Legendary Travel about this crap.
