I loved the Muppets. The Muppet movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were good family movies, well written and worth watching. I never thought I would see the day they jumped on the Hollywood Sleaze train, but here it is: scooters as rave dancers in the cage, Pepe makes indecent and suggestive comments every five minutes - that's not your dad's muppets. There are not any more Jim Henson's Muppets. <br /> <br /> This themed film "It's A Wonderful Life" has its moments, but not enough to save it. I jumped as I watched with my children. I still have hope for their next movie, but this was certainly a disappointment.
