*** may contain spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I had very high expectations for this movie based on the trailer. I knew something about the real Ed Gein, so I figured this was a Hollywood version of the real, medium-budget events. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the letter apparently came from an eighth grader who barely knew anything about Ed's story and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes. The film goes all the way through Ed's most interesting facets and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found in his house) and decides to focus primarily on the young MP who looks as if he had just walked on the set. Likewise, all male characters seem to intensify their dialogue throughout the movie. I'm not exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Do not even let me start with the historical stuff of this movie. Seriously, who in the hell did that lead? This film is scheduled to take place around 1957, but the cops carry modern batons, some of the things in the hardware store look like they're from Lowes, and when the cop comes to a pay phone, he dials 9-1. 1 (did not exist then). Besides, Ed was a little guy, weird like Anthony Perkins's character in Psycho (supposedly based on real Ed), not that stocky guy who ended up looking way too much like the nasty guy in Men In Black /> <br / > Another thing that really bothered me was that the creators of this movie shot the whole thing in an abandoned 3-building set. Because of the "clever" camera angles you never see a real city, and the interior of the sets looked like old, long-abandoned huts. Pop a cash register on a Sawhorse and Bam! - immediate hardware store. <br /> <br /> I usually forgive low-budget horror movies, but this only begs for it. All you had to do was incorporate (even beautify!) Most of the real events, pay five good actors instead of 15 shit, and for Pete's sake, take 5 minutes and occasionally think about the time , My tip: Google Ed Gein, you will be much more entertained.
