Wave after wave of directionless nausea - this movie wants and promises to be quirky and original at first, but it is obviously, solipsistic and peppered in a clich√©-led dialogue, which in the end leads to a record of awfulness and cheese. Throughout the movie, we're supposed to meet characters from the wall who are actually very boring and just out of work, stumbling through the terrible script like men in armor suits, driving jeeps through mansions, and bringing preparative existential blatant whining from Coldplay , The film occasionally has funny episodes, often no funnier than a dog playing with its genitals, which has happened twice (an index of slapstick, rudimentary humor of the film in general), but in the end the film falls into an "infinite abyss". of total detritus and the egocentric wanderings of the director, who wanted to make me tear my eyes out. Watch this movie at your own risk.
