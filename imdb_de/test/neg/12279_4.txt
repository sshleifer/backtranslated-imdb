This movie is very violent and yet exciting with original dialogues and cool characters. It has one of the most moving stories and is very much alive. The film begins with action star Leo Fong as a thoroughly exhausted police officer nearing the end of his career when he encounters a big case involving corruption, black mail and murder. This is where the murders begin. From start to finish Fong delivers Action Caper in this action. This movie also features Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie as a kid, but as I got older, I realized that this movie is rather cheesy and not very good. I would not recommend this movie and the action is very, very bad.
