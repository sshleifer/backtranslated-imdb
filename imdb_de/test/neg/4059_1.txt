This is undoubtedly the worst sequel I have ever seen, and I have seen many of them to draw this conclusion. The plot is just ridiculous. I can catch a ball and also run around a field. Why can not I play in Superbowl? Yes, I know that this movie was meant for kids, but there are only a few actions that even children can realize are completely stupid and unrealistic. The first Air Bud movie was pretty good, but this was a total crash. Disney loses it. If I control who won the Razzie Awards, I would give this a pair. Have a nice day! =)
