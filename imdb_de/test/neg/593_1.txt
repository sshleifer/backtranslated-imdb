I'm totally involved in this kind of plot, but when the movie got heated, I said honestly, "I've just rented a two-dollar budget from Christian POS." The only thing I could find in this movie was that it has a lineage, but it was terribly done. Terrible actors, terrible directing and production. <br /> <br /> The director and the producer have to look at the cube before he can pull off a movie in a single room. There was absolutely nothing that intrigued you so much that you did not notice that you were in the same room throughout the movie. Dreadful! The two main actresses were very eye-catching and you could say that the director was counting on keeping your attention. But these two and their bios can appeal that are terrible in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this. Unless you are blind, because it might go up a few stars if you only hear it.
