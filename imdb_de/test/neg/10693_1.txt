Odious Chuck Norris opted for a last nail in the coffin that contained his film career before he went into the safe world of CBS. Saturday night slaughter with this hysterically awful supernatural body /> <br /> actioner. <br /> <br /> For such a stupid movie, this thing is certainly plott. Norris is Chicago <br /> <br /> Policeman Frank Shatter. First of all, what surname is "Shatter"? <br /> <br /> Have you ever met a shatter? Genforum.com has no entry for <br /> <br /> the last name Shatter, which opens any reasonably smart viewer to replace <br /> the "a" in Shatter with an "i". He and his partner, Calvin Jackson, perform the same routine that you saw before: Make fun of the pimps and drive their captain nuts. <BR /> <br /> Jackson, who looks like the theoretical love child of Whoopi Goldberg <br /> <br /> and Rick James, quickly gets on his nerves with his constant <br /> <br /> complaints and Eddie Murphy's patented facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin are involved in one of Satan's emissaries, whom we meet in the too long opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Prosatano is a demon imprisoned in a crypt by King Richard the Lionheart. The scepter of the demon from which he derives his power is broken into nine pieces and hidden in nine different parts of the world by holy men. In 1951, some grave robbers accidentally released Prosatano and he begins to collect the nine pieces. He disguises himself as an antiquarian professor named Lockley and <br /> <br /> always gives a lecture in which a holy man is killed <br /> <br /> and a piece of the scepter is taken. <br /> <br /> Norris brings in his cohort "Walker: Texas Blunder" Sheree Wilson, who plays Lockley's assistant. She helps Norris with his <br /> investigation, they make each other wild eyes and our <br /> <br /> intrepid investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi was killed in <br /> <br / > Chicago. While in Israel Calvin is even more objectionable: <br /> <br />: the heat, the lack of restaurant accommodation, the lousy <br /> <br /> drivers and the fact that he misses the Chicago Bulls playoff games. Norris even manages to get a cute Israeli kid involved in this nightmare. Bezi steals Calvin's purse and hangs around the men. She leads her around Israel and does not raise reasonable suspicion. <br /> <br /> Lockley (Prosatano) gathers all scepter parts, but needs the blood of the levy to complete the ceremony and call the devil. Where can I find royal blood? Well, Sheree's father is a duke! It has an American accent, but is the most convenient method of scriptwriters to force this monstrosity to its inevitable conclusion. Sure, this servant of Satan may have killed countless hundreds of people over the years, but how will he go against a good, old-fashioned American butt? <Br /> <br /> After Prosatano was defeated and killed by his own scepter (I envied him, he did not have to watch Bezi steal Calvin's wallet. <br /> <br />). We get a terrible coda involving a bearded man. <br /> <br /> who watched Shutter, Shatter and Calvin search. Look, it was predicted ... somewhere ... that two <br /> warriors from the west would defeat Prosatano. The quiet <br /> <br /> bearded man who was taking care of the couple was none other than Jesus ... I'm not joking. He will be listed in the credits as "Prophet", <br /> <br />, but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christian reference that the filmmakers are trying to exhibit here. <br /> Like "I'm using a Walker: Texas Ranger," Norris gets older and can not get into his fight scenes too much. He walks a lot and people fly over furniture in slow motion and then Norris gives all his line readings in his monotone voice. Oh, what a real <br /> <br /> director could come out of it! His brother Aaron, who has also directed him in other films, has no sense of story or momentum. Scenes are thrown for the sake of the ego, not to entertain. The scenes in which the dynamic duo first meets Bezi Drag <br /> <br />, and then Bezi are not so important to the rest of the <br /> <br /> movie. <br /> <The film was filmed on location in Israel, meaning that Americans could personally insult the Israelis. There is no <br /> <br /> sympathetic Israeli character here. The Israeli police chief is a jerk. The cop driver does not speak English, and Calvin convinces him that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing is funnier than taunting these stupid foreigners on their home turf, especially if that racist humor stems from an American minority who would do so were more than offended when the tables were turned <br /> <br /> and the Israeli policeman mocked the African American police in Chicago. <br /> <br /> This film is poorly written, poorly handled and poorly directed. It does not work as an action, police drama or even as a horror. It just shows that the now deceased Cannon Studios were willing to put their money into anything, no matter how badly planned it was. "Hellbound" is <br /> <br /> certainly an appropriate title. I did not like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, gun violence, strong obscenity, some sexual cues and some adult situations. <Br /> <br />
