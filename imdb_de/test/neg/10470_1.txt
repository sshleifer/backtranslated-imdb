Bone Eater is located in a small desert town in Alabama, where real estate developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is financing the construction of a large resort. One night three of his workers Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae) are digging foundations in the desert looking for something that looks like a tomahawk ax, unfortunately an ancient Indian demon named for them Bone eater comes and kills her. Local sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) soon lets Krantz's neck breathe as the construction of his resort comes to a standstill. Sheriff Evans also has to deal with the bone-eating demon that kills everyone he encounters ... <br /> <br /> You know, I consider myself a big fan of the horror and sci-fi genre. I do not think my opinion is worth more than others (unlike many others on the IMDb ...), but please Believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the sci-fi's worst "creature feature" Channels that I have ever seen and that it runs against damn strong competition. As a horror and science fiction fan, there are two names that shudder when they're dealing with a movie, in anticipation of how bad it will be. These names are Jesus 'I have no talent' Franco, who had nothing to do with it Bone Eater & Jim Wynorski, who led the absolute disaster Bone Eater. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad that Wynorski is hidden under the pseudonym Bob Robertson, as a director as bad as Wynorski hides under a pseudonym, you know the movie must be bad. Where do I start? Bone Eater is simply the worst movie I've seen this year and is so bad that it's untrue. The story is awful, the script is sloppy (Sheriff Evans tells Kia to meet him at the hospital, but if they meet later, he says) Acts surprised and says, "What are you doing here?", Sheriff Evans claims triumphantly we're in the twentieth century and the old Native American demons are nonsense, though we're now in the twenty-first century A woman in a flashback tells the story of where three men arouse the bone eater and kill him, but since all three were killed, why did anyone know that it could be passed on in the legend?) & sometimes it gets more than a little embarrassing. The characters are terrible stereotypes, the little city sheriff who saves the day, his daughter gets involved, which increases personal motivation. And for the Native Americans, there is an old wise man, a young hot-headed, who hates "white man" and a young woman. Who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud & Black Hawk. The movie is as boring as hell, nothing happens, the story is terrible, it's full of plot holes and failures in some kind of logic, the scenes are awful, there is no horror, no nervousness or tension or a Puzzles & Bone Eater The kind of movie where you lose the will to live. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I've seen in ages, from the stupid, stiff, moving bone-eater creature itself is just a selection of bones that magically make a motorcycle a large gap jumps to a horrible CGI truck, which crashes over the edge of a cliff to a delivery truck, which is thrown aside by the bone eater. Whenever the bone eater needs to be sped up a bit, it turns sand and dust into a big horse and rides it! In principle this is a pretty nice idea but it looks awful and the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack! There's a pointless scene in the end when Sheriff Evans cuts his own arm (why?) & Bleeding, but apart from that, there's not a single drop of blood in it when the bone eater kills someone, in which he usually disappears a cloud of dust, boring. One has to believe that Sheriff Evans is a funny-climatic showdown between Sheriff Evans and the bone-eater. The Sheriff Evans is a native with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his dust horse and they have a kind of tournament. A contest that's just too bad to describe it properly. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 700,000, Bone Eater is being filmed in a very bland, forgetful and flat manner. There is no style here. The majority of the movie plays in bright sunlight. If you see it in a decent TV, the desert landscape is occasionally beautiful. There are several experienced "known" actors who are really slumbering here. Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the eponymous, but much better "Creature Feature" Snakehead Terror (2004), William Katt will shit his name for as long as he wants. He gets paid while former Star Trek man Walter Koenig is really desperate to appear here. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is a really disgusting "creature" feature. There really is not much else you can say other than good to keep away from it. The worst movie ever shown on the sci-fi channel that says something, right?
