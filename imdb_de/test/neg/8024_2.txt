It's weird ... one day before I saw this movie, I watched a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so the comparison came automatically ... of course there is no :) <br /> <br /> This movie is weak in every way ... acting is not convincing (especially the one who plays Simona ...) and unnatural ..., in a confused cut and always leaves a taste of an unfinished recording, the music does not fit It does not flow 'It gets boring and the movie looks a lot longer than it is ... oh, and the characters are not showing well, you can not really say much about the girls (except what you see). The film also tries to shock with explicit cursing (which is very ridiculous). <br /> <br /> So ... 2/10
