Is there a firefighter clich√© NOT used in this movie? From the opening line, "I'm getting too old," about the "antics" of firefighters, about the "troubling woman" loss of his best friend in the fire station to the last funeral for the fallen brothers, this movie looks and sounds, as if written by Disney's marketing department ("Our studies show the audience really likes it when ..." and then they're stuck). <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here. Every emotion we feel for these guys comes from admiration and feelings for firefighters. <br /> <br /> Watch Rescue Me if you want to see real heroes: Everyday guys with mistakes who do not mind running into a burning building to save strangers.
