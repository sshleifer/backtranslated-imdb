I saw this morning on a boring Sunday morning. Well, I was attracted by the fact that it's an outdoor movie. I was hoping to find some beautiful scenery, but the prospects were limited. They just go back and forth in the same place over and over again. I hate it when you use these so-called high tech stuff like the Motorola Bluetooth headset, with which you do not need to use a walkie talkie. It was just funny. And they were like ads for those poorly designed Alienware laptops that could connect to a satellite to find people. I could not say more about this TV movie. The end was bad, that it looks like they would make it short the use of rescue helicopters and etc .. * / **********
