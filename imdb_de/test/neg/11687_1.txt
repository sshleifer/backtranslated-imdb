I rented the movie because I like war movies a lot and on the cover picture I read "better than private ryan" ... mmmmm ... I thought cool! Guys ... is just a ridiculous movie. Almost funny. Nothing to do with a real war movie. I want my money back! Why are the peoples lying ??????????? F NO SUBTITLES They tried to make things cooler with the light ... but they did not make it. I'm sorry, but the movie is terrible. The Italians are represented as "Mafia e mandolino". <br /> <br /> The American as a stupid farmer The Germans as an even stupider farmer. <br /> <br /> The actor is ridiculous and unprofessional. <br /> <br /> Please .... please ......
