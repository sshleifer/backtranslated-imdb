I finally got a DVD copy of this production and was curious because I had read so many people praising them in the sky, especially Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Mrs. Lovett. I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it was overkill and bloody. Luckily, this version is not so disgusting, but it suffers dramatically in many ways, in that it would be the least satisfying for me. <br /> <br /> First of all, the casting. George Hearn is appropriate and shows at least a certain expression (as opposed to Johnny Depp's infinite woodface in the film). Angela Lansbury is just annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to convey the point, in contrast to Helena Bonham Carter's whistle and the girl's flat voice, but subtlety seems to be just a word in the dictionary for Mrs. Lansbury. You can not get involved in the story if one of the main characters spends all of their time in a "look Ma, I'm playing!" Fashion and the audience too aware. This is not typical for stage productions, heaven knows - I have been a regular participant of the Stratford Festial for many years, and stage actors usually do NOT behave that way (at least those who want to) can not find a permanent job!) .. . <br /> <br /> Betsy Joslyn. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Has anybody except me noticed that she can not sing that role vaguely apt? And playing George Hearn's daughter is just scary, considering she was married to him at the time. Should not she be a sweet little sixteen? Yes, I realize that this is acting, but she did not even convince me she was younger than about thirty-five, and the term "lamb dressed as a lamb" seems to have been coined for her only. At the slaughter of "Green Finch And Linnet Bird" I had to clench my teeth and switch off the DVD player immediately. The song was so well done in Tim Burton's movie, and that was a sad shock. The song requires the vocals of Julie Andrews in the 1960s and a purity of voice comparable only to that of a boy soprano. Every vibrato kills it dead, and Mrs. Joslyn rode so hard all the time that I thought she would fall off her ladder because she was shaking so much because she was trying to maintain coloratura notes in one voice Mezzo best. Let's go over the drama by vibrating at least a quarter of the higher notes flat by at least a quarter tone flat ... This is simply not a coloratura role, and maybe a sophisticated director would have had to tell her that - but the fact was you Married to the star, the director may have had his hands tied. Cris Groenendaal was adequate, but obviously too old for the role, and there is zero chemistry between him and Mrs. Joslyn. The entire subplot is completely flat. I'm reminded a bit of past stage productions of Wagner's Ring Cycle, where vocalists should have the ability to vocally penetrate or act as actors, or even one, because of the vocal strength that ought to roar over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra good voice, why you have the caricature of the mighty mountainous Viking Horned Brunehilde with a threefold chin and a beard, when the libretto demands an ethereal beauty that is eternally young and enchanting. The casting of the "juvenile" leads is exactly like this: if you close your eyes, you can almost believe Mr. Groenendals Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen, the illusion is destroyed. (And at no point can you ever believe in Mrs. Joslyn's Johanna ...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because three of the four main characters were so obviously mismanaged. I can not verify anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can not understand why people rave about this badly shot and self-confident movie of a stage play. Surely there is more to the camera work in the theater than just putting a camera in the front row? If I want to, I'll go to a decent piece, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where they work together at least for the production and do not constantly go for the camera. I only give it three stars because, apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn, the quality of the production seems appropriate, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> Probably the best thing you can do is to buy the movie's soundtrack cast of the cast, and then combine the two to make a bearable whole. I'll do that and try to forget that I've ever bothered to rent this completely unobtrusive production.
