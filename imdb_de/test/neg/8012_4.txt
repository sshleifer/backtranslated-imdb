I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly, but this movie just left me cold. I expected another American from Minnelli from Paris, so maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> The film had too few songs and impressive dance numbers. I was impressed by the very expressionistic Kelly Dance as Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed by the Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown, too bad the song was so annoying. I also enjoyed that Judy attacked Kelly with a bauble. In the autobiography of Lorna Luft you will find some interesting information about this scene. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film contains some of the most annoying songs by Cole Porter, especially "Nina". Also, Judy and Gene are constantly screaming like screaming kids. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin - which is natural for musicals - but not rescued by impressive dance numbers or memorable songs. I guess the best parts of this movie were left on the tailoring floor. Please, a movie restorer, find these parts and show us what the movie could have been!
