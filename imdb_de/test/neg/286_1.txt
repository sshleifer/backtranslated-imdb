I had high hopes to go into this movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a really great Hollywood product. His fast-paced jokes, incredible starpower, and tight script made him one of the funniest capers I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money it had made, there was a sequel on the way, and I was excited myself. Needless to say, I was absolutely thrilled with this movie. Blown away by how terribly wrong things. This movie had everything to offer; the return of the entire cast, the same director, news stories of crazy antiques. How could it possibly have gone so wrong? <br /> <br /> It immediately starts with one of the most unpleasant and unnecessary opening sequences ever, and goes down from there. After somewhat silly short scenes between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the movie spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia move from scene to scene, telling every single member of Danny Ocean's original team that he wants his money back. Believe me, when I say that these scenes are just there to bridge Andy Garcia's running time, because without those ridiculously awkward settings, his screen time would be well under five minutes. <br /> <br /> This leads me to another important issue I had with this movie. The tempo is so uneven that the characters are completely removed from the story and are only sometimes brought back later. Bernie Mac's character is removed early from the script and never returns, except for two short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes and returns to an exceptionally short scene at the end. Roberts appears at the beginning for about five minutes and is mentioned again, if there are still 20-25 minutes left. Even Clooney himself spends much of the movie in prison. <br /> <br /> That would be all excused if the movie was funny. Ever. 90% of the jokes fall off completely and those who work are worth a giggle at best. The "conspiracy" is undoubtedly worthless, and I felt betrayed. At some point in the film, the team is taking a $ 2.5 million worth of the nearly $ 100 million they'll need to collect before Garcia's two-week deadline. Some characters even realize how absurd it is to waste time on this work, but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the movie revolve around this job they should not even do, and it feels like this part of the storyline has just been added to refresh the runtime. In addition, the equipment they use to pull off this job CLEARLY cost millions of millions to finance. Just wait until you see what they're doing to get the job done, and realize it would cost well over $ 2.5 million when you're done with it. Because of this, they obviously have to pull off multiple jobs to earn the money. The beauty of the first film was the great weakness and how ingenious and complicated the film was subtracted. Here they do so many jobs in such different ways that they permeate all because they would do the movie for several hours. <br /> <br /> We all know that we will enter this movie in the end will be a big turn. Such is the nature of the capillary film. The turn at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; Not because it was funny, but because I could not believe how cheated I felt. I will not tell because I know that most of you will be so stupid as to throw the money to watch this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> What I mean to say is that it makes the most of the 2 hours you've been eating completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I was excited to see this movie after absolutely worshiping Oceans 11 and the crew of this movie has led me to believe that this movie is worth a visit. I've never assigned a movie on IMDb.com, but there's a first for everything. Consider yourself warned ... 1/10
