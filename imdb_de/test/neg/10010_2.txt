So tell me - what a jerk Budweiser drinks? How many selfish drinkers in their lonesome motel room harbor a fully stocked and barely touched variety of drinks that a Millionaire's Playboys bachelor bar might be proud of. And what an alcoholic tends to drink when the bottle is held about 5 cm from his hungry mouth, so that the contents generally run all over his face. Not to mention wasting good whiskey by dousing your girlfriend's breasts, just so that the movie audience of Elisabeth Shue's wealth can get a good eye. Cage seems to be the most eye-catching look I'm an alcoholic who has always adorned the screen, while Shue looks more like a Berkely-preppy slumbering him for a summer than any seasoned street walker. She is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this vile film, with beatings, skin injuries, anal rape, and verbal abuse - all utterly implausible and apparently contained only to give an impression of her terribly degraded state and give the male audience an impression convey amazingly clich√©d, sentimental, sexual fantasy of the "heart". Still, I did see it to the end, until I actually laughed loudly, when Shue's tough street-hooker dulled chopped carrots in the kitchen, ridiculously ridiculous, while Cage - all eyes like a man inside earthquake a road boring machine - trembles and trembles. - grimaced and made his way through the last half hour ...
