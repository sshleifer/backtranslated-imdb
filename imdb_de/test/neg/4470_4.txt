Come on, let's put aside the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honest ... it's not funny. I was appalled that the two main stars would agree to make a movie that is so offensive and harmful to the relationship with the races, and I'm not referring to the obvious black and white commentary in the movie, but to the slams in Towards other ethnic groups, such as Betty White's characterization of Hispanics. Should we just agree that she's ready to make this film a sign of senility ... Is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical garbage? Or is it the fault of the authors? How about the third assistant? No, the mistake lies with us if we want to perpetuate that kind of crap (in the form of a comedy) that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enough ... racism is really true and is not it a laughing matter. We are all different, let's celebrate this diversity, do not enjoy it and promote division.
