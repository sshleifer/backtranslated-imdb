The ruins are for Turistas like Deep Impact for Armageddon, a worse version of a slightly entertaining movie, but much worse. One of the characters is supposed to go to medical school, so why did they all stay behind? "You can not continue cutting." best line from this movie. This is a terrible movie. I like horror movies, but I totally appreciate that most of them are awful, but I had high hopes in this movie after watching the reviews on IMDb. The situation they are in is stupid and how they handle it makes them stupid. It's awful, the only thing that makes it tastier is the cool Aussie scenery, though they spend most of the movie in one place.
