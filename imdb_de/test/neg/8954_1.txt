The fact that this cruel series could provoke dozens of commentaries (or fewer hundreds of voices) speaks volumes about the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization. ! Or at least Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes anthologies. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris. Wrapping up your brain with the fact that you would have spent minutes to evaluate or write about this series was used to get the correct time from your local service. <br /> <br /> PLEASE DO NOT NOTE THIS SHOW !! FIRST OF YOUR LITTLE BRAIN CELLS!
