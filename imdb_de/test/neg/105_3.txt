The Forgotten (AKA: Do not Look The Basement) is a very cheap and very old-looking horror movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very slow and never really achieves anything to be happy about. <BR /> <br /> The asylum patients are embarrassingly funny, especially Sam and the old woman who always quotes an old adage to everyone. (Take care of her when she approaches the camera, tell me you can see without laughing!). Now the Gore is very bad looking, with the blood that looks pink in many scenes does not really deserve its place on the list of video nasties! <br /> <br /> If you are not looking for a fantastic horror movie and have some time, it's well worth the time.
