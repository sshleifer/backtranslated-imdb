The movie is very fast, bizarre and colorful. He's like Mad Max when it comes to shades and make-up. Also very cartoonish, as I said; Here and there appears a comic sequence. The plot is also very naughty, but I think it is meant too. The thing that drives me crazy in this movie is the characters. They are painfully irritating, especially Rebecca, who is played by Lori Petty. The editing is also annoying, very MTV stylized. Another thing Tank Girl lacks is an exciting adventure. The humor is not very funny either. It does have some nice visuals. <br /> <br /> However, many people love this movie, most of them are women, and that's not funny at all, because this movie is all about girl power. Tank Girl this is a real chick movie and the best example of a hate / romance movie.
