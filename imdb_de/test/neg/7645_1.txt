This movie was horrible and the only reason it was ever made was because history appealed to the left. I regard myself as moderate, so I could see this movie as a garbage heap. Although I'm not a Bush fan, your aversion to GW is not enough to see this movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the film was shot on such a low-quality film that it looks cheap, rather artistic. In addition, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. Chris Cooper's character was a bad parody of George Bush; better suited for Saturday Night Live than a dramatic movie. The rest of the characters is a running clich√© and a poor facsimile of other characters from much better movies. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
