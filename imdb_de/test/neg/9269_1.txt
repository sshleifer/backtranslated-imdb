It's hard to decide where to start. I bought it for a few pounds and it's the worst I've ever had. The back of the DVD had no pictures and a few lines of plot summary that should have warned me, but I like bad movies for a laugh, so I decided to give it a try. The film consists of three short stories, each about someone who was on a particular bus at a given time (he never made it clear what the meaning of the bus is or in which city he is). <br /> <br POSSIBLE SPOILER (as if there were something to spoil) The first story is about a man who is persuaded by a car to mutilate it against the will of his wife. The car is a kind of demonic brum and takes over the power of his life. <br /> <br /> The second is about a slob of a man who never cleans his fridge, and a monster bacterial man grows out of it. <br /> <br /> The third of a woman who goes to a dating agency just to discover her date, is not all that normal. <br /> <br /> Between these we are treated with shots of the bus (or a bus anyway) while a narrator fiddles with a load of trash relationships (really, it's like he's on commission to 'relationships' to say) <br /> <br /> The movie does not have any salvation features. The acting, the costumes and the little spfx are all disgusting There are no attractive female performers to admire. Simply put, this movie is a debacle.
