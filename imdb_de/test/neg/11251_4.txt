The plot includes a new, hipper franchise barbershop moving across from Calvin's hair salon. He feels that he has to change and improve his shop by buying newer things and so on. Sounds really exciting. For the rest of the film, many of them are the same material from the first film. The people who work at Calvin stand around, talking loud and talking to each other and to the customers. Once again, Cedric the Entertainer was a bit funny, but it's more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything that has anything to do with the movie. And Calvin faces another moral problem, which is to get a large sum of money. He has already shown that in the end he will do the right thing. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing new. I do not recommend it, unless you thought the first barbershop was the best since sliced ​​bread.
