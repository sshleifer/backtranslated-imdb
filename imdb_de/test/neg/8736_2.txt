"A researcher is experimenting with human DNA to create the perfect human being, and his work has come to the point of taking a human fetus and accelerating its growth to an adult's in a matter of days." His latest creation is "Spoiler Left Out!" but side effects from the process (spoiler omitted), "according to the summary of the DVD case. <br /> <br /> "Embryo" opens with great promise: "The movie you're about to see is not all science fiction, it's based on medical technology that currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb a possibility, tomorrow or today, "Dr. Charles M. Brinkman III. Law. And, Dr. Joyce Brothers, later appears at a party with Roddy McDowall. First, we see Rock Hudson (as Dr. Paul Holliston) lighting a cigarette and driving recklessly (watching this speedometer!) During a storm; Unfortunately he beats a dog. Mr. Hudson brings the wounded dog home. He learns that he is pregnant and he saves the life of a puppy due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth. It's about Hudson cultivating the embryo with an experimental drug so he can survive outside the womb. The dog, "Number One", quickly grows to an adult size and is issued as his mother. <br /> <br /> Hudson lives with his sister-in-law Diane Ladd (as Martha Douglas); because his wife Nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident. Ms. Ladd seems to be more emotionally stable over Nicole's death than Hudson, who survived the crash that killed his wife. Things start to get weird when Hudson's dog has a level of intelligence far beyond a normal dog. Then Hudson decides to apply his accelerated embryo growth to one person, Barbara Carrera (as Victoria Spencer). <br /> <br /> Hudson and the cast try their best; But the "embryo" story is a nonsensical nonsense. When you take away their stupid beginning and end scenes, Mrs. Carrera's brave characterization almost acts; She could have been a bigger star if better movies were offered than these. The infantile ending suggests a continuation; but luckily the idea was broken off.
