I saw Shallow Grave years ago and * that * was one of the films I remembered for a long time. It was intense from start to finish and with many sudden twists. But all that made sense. <br /> <br /> I can not say the same thing about Dead Bodies. Above the title is a subtitle that says it's "even better than Shallow Grave." This is a big lie. <br /> <br /> Dead bodies lose their strength and become less convincing during the movie. <br /> <br /> Two supportive characters, for example, turn out to be far less innocent than they first appeared. That might come as a surprise, but it did not surprise me. I could see it comes minutes before, and that is a big difference to Shallow Grave. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have to mention is that characters in this movie often do not react very realistically. They often behave like this when the movie reaches its end. <br /> <br /> I would have found it much more interesting if some of the characters had remained completely innocent without knowing what was going on. It would have been better for the contrast with Tommy and his friend, who must carry a * big * secret with them. But no, for some stupid reason, the creators of this movie have decided everything characters should show their darkest sides. It does not work in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The end felt like an open end. I had a dissatisfied feeling. I had expected much more. <br /> <br /> First, I would have given this movie six stars because it's not necessarily a bad movie. I liked it. Mostly. <br /> <br /> But occasionally I saw really bad-acting and unrealistic scenes, and because of the disappointing open ending, I'm staying at four stars this time. And because it turned out to be a mistake, I spent my time and money on it. Unlike Shallow Grave, I'll probably forget Dead Bodies very soon. It's just not a special movie. <br /> <br /> The creators could have done much better work with this film. It's a shame they did not.
