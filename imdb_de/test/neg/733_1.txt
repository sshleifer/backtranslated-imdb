I saw "Fuckland" a long time ago. I lied when I said that I remember it in detail; I most vividly remember the irritation that provoked me and the sense of a total waste of precious money and time, not just my time and money watching the movie, but also the director's. <br /> <br /> Allegedly, "Fuckland" is a critic of the Argentines and introduces us (I'm also an Argentine) as a little people who allow themselves ridiculous, ridiculous victories and even boast and think that we are the best that created God (who is also a friend) Argentine). I will not deny that. It is probably a true statement about a fairly large part of the population (the part I despise by the way). And even if that's not true, that's not my point. The worst sin that "Fuckland" had committed was expressing such a statement about its own director. <br /> <br /> The constant impression I got was that the director was too busy impressing us to sneak a camera into the islands worry about getting a good (even mediocre) movie do. Many of the shots taken with a hidden camera are useless. The director decides to show with a stupid edition of old war footage and his own. And there is no action at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to disregard its principles (for example, by involving the director in the credits - another sign of His pride?). <br /> <br /> I found the film offensive, not as an Argentine but as a spectator. I felt underrated. "Fuckland" is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
