If you're a fan of the two original franchises (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked the AVP movie in 06 or did not like it), you'll hate this movie. The countless storylines, flakeys and incredible human characters, awesome special effects, and even worse directorial and battle scenes make this movie one of the worst movies I've ever seen. One of the HUNDREDS of big holes was the Pred / Alien hybrid, which shot up in seconds Breastplate became full blown asshole (he boarded a Predator shipwreck and kills a ship from Preds before the ship breaks even the Earth's orbit.) AS IF. In the first AvP, we saw a ship owned by Sr. Pred Hunter that took off three young hunters to make a hunting party "that deserves their stripes," and then they saw them picking up the "honored corpse" of the remaining youth at the end of the strip. Is it expected that the one-breast Burster Hybrid would kill all of these Sr. fighters even before the ship broke the orbit? Also (and this was extremely cheap production value for the director / producer parts), Face-Huggers' jars and jugs somehow magically appeared aboard the Pred ship, though the entire temple complex and Queen Alien were destroyed in the AvP movie. These face-huggers ultimately play an integral role in the movie ... of course. And how about all those face-huggers becoming full-blown aliens in a few days? What a joke. Although there were many more storylines, I would not believe that IMDb would appreciate filling up their servers by writing them girls Where to start ... Almost all of these antics are from stereotypes of other movies or TV shows. The villain of the city who has left to escape jail but only appears on the day everything happens to save the day ??? Where did I see that? Oh yes, last season at JERICHO !!! Then there's the 20-year-old city sheriff (himself a former troublemaker) who once was Bad Boy's best friend. Where did we see that? Oh yes, JERICHO and Walking Tall! Then the generic soldier (WITH NO RANK) comes home from a generic war front that is not hit like a long-lost loved one and hero at the airport or bus station, but at her own front door by her daughter and husband. And who is this soldier? What did she do in the Army / Air Force / Marines / Navy / Coast Guard? We do not know because the movie never tells us. But ... dun, dun, dun ... she was a kind of soldier / aviator / navy / sailor / shore who knows how to drive a Stryker infantry car and ... magically ... a helicopter !! ! This character is just a generic copy of every service person who comes home ... except that she brings her daughter a night-vision goggles that cost several hundred dollars. For this, soldiers have to sign and not just "bring home". UGH! <br /> <br /> The special effects and fight scenes are what distract me from the worst. Those are the things I enjoyed the most on the first movie ... and watching preds and aliens! The way it was filmed, the action sequences were so dark and so close that you could not tell what was going on. They could not see who did what and what was going on when they fought it. All in all, these hundreds of articles will kill this franchise and the fanchise. Nobody will care anymore about seeing their favorite sci-fi movie monsters, and can only guess that the series will end from here, as producers will not like it, spending millions of dollars more on a sequel toss.
