This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it was another "marijuana comedy", but do not be misleading, that's not the case at all. There are hardly any jokes related to weeds. I do not think they smoke weeds at all in this movie. The marijuana field is just a plotter. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I had the impression that four friends got bored in a summer and decided to write a script with (their idea) funny dialogues and a movie. The product is a simple dialogue supported by mediocre action. To say that this film has no catch is a huge understatement. Do not waste your time or your money.
