I'm from Bangladesh and here C.C.Costigan is a goddess of great sex. A joke aside, a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night watching movies on the Encore: Action channel as we came across a series of sci-fi esquire strips. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad, ... not bad at all) ... then Judge Dredd (Stalone almost ruined his career), then a movie called "Lethal Target". One might think that the title "Lethal Target" could only be awarded to a really cool and really cheesy Rambo tee. But no, what's being delivered is what I would call "semi-softcore action, semi-pseudo-action, semi-sci-fi movie" ... actually, I can say that this is not a movie , If the main character had not been pretty hot, my friend and I would have turned off the movie when the opening credits were rolled. <br /> <br /> I have a few questions for the people (would not I dare even say "professionals" who made this movie) - why in the future will they use the weapons we used in 1999? Oh, wait, I understand, it's all they could get their hands on ... right ??? ... well then ... why is the main character wearing something like a regular linen shirt and a vest, somehow like what people wore in the late 1990's ... oh ... I understand ... in space it MUST have been a fashion statement .... well then ... WHY, OH, WHY pulls the main character out of a 3.5 floppy - a point in the movie for her to upload bullshit ?! wtf! ... we've progressed so far that we have space travel, but we still do not have more than 1.44 I think I'm just asking too much. <Br /> <br /> Question two, let's just say ... that yes ... that's a softcore porn, why is it just a real sex scene and why does it take 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean, you take the REASON that people stay up in the middle of the night to see this crap (can not I say "movie"?) ... and reduce it to 2 minutes , They should have just taken this sex scene and sold it to another porno movie, and they would have made more money with this "crap" than they did. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is hot. And no insult to the actress, but she behaves just as well as I do. and I am mentally retarded and have only one testicle ... (C.C. Cortigan, ... write me an email ... we will have lunch) I would write more, but I have no room left.
