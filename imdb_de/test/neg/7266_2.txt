What can I say about THE PLEASURE PLANET that I have not said to countless other boring softcore porn movies? Very little . It's just another movie with a very weak plot, with very little convincing scenes between male non-actors who spend too much time in the gym, and Bimbos, who obviously had silicone implants were built. In fact, the sex scenes in this movie are a little less compelling than you normally see in this kind of movie, when the performers tighten their hips and have painful expressions like constipation or something. No wonder many people claim that sex is overrated, they probably saw too many of these films on late-night cable stations
