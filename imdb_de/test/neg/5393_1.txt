How many did I notice this bastard when I was surfing the canal? It's a horror movie that plays in the woods and has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it and he was part of some great horror movies. I know he would not steer me wrong ... Ugh! The most insulting thing is that I actually saw it. I see that director Johnny Martin is a stuntman. Well, this stunt is just crap, and how he got some actors to do that watery stool is the biggest mystery of all ... I can understand Casper Van Dien, but pity, Mr. Rooker. Your good name in the horror community is forever clouded and your agent should be fired immediately. I'm sure that this nugget of fecal matter is available on DVD, but if you enjoy McDonald's 99-cent menu, you'll get more for your money there.
