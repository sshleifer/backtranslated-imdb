Designating Rocketship XM as a science fiction classic is more based on the release date (1950), the ability to capitalize on advertising for "Destination Moon", and the appearance of actors later on television as Sea Hunt's Mike Nelson, Rockford's father and Wyatt Earp are attributed to <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad enough to be a good feed for MST3K and is best viewed with comments from Joel and the robots. This is the type of film most suitable for adding riffing from the MST3K characters. a little preacher, slow, badly written and full of painful misconduct. While unintentionally funny stuff like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" is not suitable for satirical comments (as the movie always puts the hosts in the foreground), really bad and boring movies like "Rocketship X-M" are ideal. Add a few stars to the rating if you see the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The basic story lets the crew take an unplanned right turn onto the moon and land on Mars. What they find on this planet are the remains of a human-like civilization destroyed by a nuclear war. Only one Martian can be seen in close-up, a normal-looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes. The men look like the "goons" in the old Popeye cartoons, scurrying around the cliffs and throwing boulders at the crew with amazing accuracy - especially when they're supposed to be blind. Of course, none of this is explained as this would require a sign of logical analysis from the writers of the script. <br /> <br /> The scenes on Mars are presented in a so-called "sepia color" to distinguish them from each other. The rest of the B & W movie. If you think of "Wizard of Oz", you'll be disappointed, because it's black and white with a slight brown tint that is added to post-production for printing. <br /> <br /> Consistent with the feeble-minded sexism In the film, the icy scientist messes up her fuel calculations - both at her arrival and when she's walking. Her inability to compete with the men makes her feminine side emerge, and she and Mike Nelson co-operate as they face their fate (insert the sound of choking here). <br /> <br /> The true stars of the film are the reporters in the command center. So much so that MST3K was inspired to greet these unknown heroes in particular. The intrepid cadres of the "Newsies" are shown in the first 10 minutes of the movie and take stations about 10 inches behind the technicians and surveillance equipment in the command center. Later, they are asked to ask the idiotic questions that the Head of Mission needs to explain the film's already too obvious message. The DVD has an extremely low audio level, is not subtitled and is accompanied by a short film. Although you'll be grateful that it's only 77 minutes, it's still about 60 minutes too long, as each 30-minute episode of "The Twilight Zone" has many times more content than the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Then what else do I know? I am only a child.
