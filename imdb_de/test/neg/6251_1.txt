Even as a big fan of the horror genre with low to no budget, I could not find this catastrophe a bit amusing. With terrible actors, a painfully generic "plot" and no dimensional characters, no matter how boring and drunk you are, this is not worth 81 minutes. Do not make the same mistake as me. Rent something else. Anything else!!!
