James Stewart plays Johnny Mason, lawyer. Carole Lombard is Jane Mason, wife. Lucile Watson, mother-in-law Harriet Mason. Johnny sees Jane and marries her quickly. Mother is disappointed. Mother lives with them. Many problems are upon us. Jane can not cook. Can not put the table. I can not do many things that suit the mother. The interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film. Stewart and Lombard are married, but have no real magic on the screen. Stewart is Stewart. He is good as a shy husband and son, but that does not carry the movie. Can Baby Mason build bridges between Jane and Harriet? A credible movie for married people.
