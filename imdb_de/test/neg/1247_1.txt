I rented this movie in the hope that it will provide good entertainment and cool poker knowledge or stories. What I got was a documentary look at average male life that was really good with cards. Do I want to see the romance with his wife? NO Do I want to know everything about this guy's life other than poker? NO. Well, you get that with this movie. Acting is good for such a little crap. The film never tries to break the mold or make something original. It just sleeps through the script. The end is disappointing and never really takes a look at Ungar. Instead, it focuses on what was already obvious. He was a drugged card player with an average life no different from any other average Joe in Vegas. The film focuses on the aspects of his life that were more extraordinary than the UN. The poker scenes throughout the movie add up to about 4 minutes. Ungar's success in winning the WSOP three times seems to be one life after another. A 10-year-old could do a better job of directing this movie ... or maybe it was the script that was a junk from the start, which did away with the joke of a movie. <br /> <br /> Film about the gambling watch Rounders. It has at least style.
