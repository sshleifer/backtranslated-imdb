Hercules ended up in the same category as many promising TV productions, which could have been a really great classic, just to make a sad joke. <br /> <br /> I really like Kevin Sorbo and his colleagues, but I did not. It does not matter which direction the show went, since they are equal. I think the show would have had a much more successful run if they kept the same format as in the movies. <br /> <br /> I looked at the beginning and lost interest. I hit the weird episode after that, but my attention span was happy to see it break for a commercial break.
