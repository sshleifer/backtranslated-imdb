And obviously I have not seen it! <br /> <br /> But when I look at the cast and see that Doug Masters has returned from the dead, I now know that this is avoided like the plague! I hate when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors, or any of the above people think that the audience is stupid, that there are no continuity flaws. A supposedly dead Doug Masters coming back is a big giant, will not say that? <br /> <br /> And I can not believe that someone like Louis Gossett Jr. will come back for something like that. > <br /> Did Jason Gedrick really refuse? Well, I hate to say it, but even if he had accepted the role again, it would still have had the same continuity flaw. I bet (if he really refused), he must have been incredulous when he saw his character die in the second movie, but by no means will I rent it or buy the DVD!
