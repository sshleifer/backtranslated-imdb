The young Michael Dudikoff as the young Lord Greystoke was exposed as a baby in the jungle of a Pacific island. But instead of being raised by the monkeys, he fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there because he had not heard that the war was over. And like young Luke Skywalker, it turns out that he fell into his hands and learned the martial arts of a ninja. <br /> <br /> Good thing, because they were separated and the young child got a case of amnesia, but these martial arts did not go away. The orphaned boy, now called Joe Armstrong, joins the army and is stationed in the Philippines. Meanwhile, his Obi Wan Kenobe, played by John Fujioka, himself is rescued and works as a gardener on the estate of planter and terrorist between Don Stewart, using a cheesy accent that seems to vary between French and Spanish. <br /> <br /> When these things happen, everyone meets and Dudikoff solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the Commandant's daughter from the evil in this Golan Globe production. Charles Bronson was getting a bit old and Golan-Globus needed a new star for his action movies. Michael Dudikoff filled out the bill pretty well and did a couple of films for her, including several American Ninja sequels. <br /> <br /> This movie is all action and Dudikoff sends villains in record speed. What he does not do is make Steve James his best rambo imitation and show his considerable martial arts skills. The movie has enough holes in the storyline to pass through one of these army vehicles. But that's not what the audience cares about when buying tickets. Dudikoff certainly looks great wearing his battle clothes. No wonder so many sequels were made.
