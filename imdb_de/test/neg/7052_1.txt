The American television of AZN has acquired the rights to this film, and the network shows it under the English title THE PICKPOCKET. <br /> <br /> The 1997 THE PICKPOCKET makes home movie-style amateur films an unbelievable amount of inconvenience. The film shows a lengthy series of boring walks of an uninteresting, confused man. This main character, Xiao Wu, does not just walk around aimlessly. Unfortunately, viewers will soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unsurpassed talent and slumbers near the most disturbing sounds in China. Knock empty metal buckets that are beaten with a stick - it is there. Every old engine in China is in torment - it's here. A crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, it is here! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most irritating, unpleasant-sounding place on earth. <br /> <br /> The only element worse than the sound of THE PICKPOCKET is photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes even more. Finally, the camera stops, but then it falls to the knee of the actor and just stays there until someone in the crew recognizes the mistake and begins to shake the camera again. The shaky film is mostly framed in long, long, long and long shots. The few times when the camera comes a little closer, nothing compelling takes place to connect the viewer with what happens. <br /> <br /> The photograph is cloudy, faded and often blurry. The use of color is - well, there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color. Usually every shot is kept 20 times too long. Few films are so painful that they can prevail. This movie is painful to watch and painful to hear. And then it just ends. <br /> <br /> John Woo fans may enjoy hearing part of the soundtrack of THE XUE SHUANG XIONG (THE KILLER) as the main character hangs in front of a video store for many minutes. Be forewarned - THE PICKPOCKET will steal your good time.
