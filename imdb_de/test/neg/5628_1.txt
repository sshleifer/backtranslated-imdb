Known as the British film, which was so bad that it had to be given to a newspaper for free, the quality of this "thriller" of Kinderfilmstiftung can be seen from the unusual number of 10/10 votes it receives, and the large number of rave reviews of posters with no record history and no other reviews in their name. The regulars know what that means, the gullible could be attacked. If they dive into the waters of this water, they will not be long before they submerge. Unfit technically, when the boom microphone gets shot down or the crew's reflections become visible, it just goes on forever in a forgettable sub-DAVINCI CODE over $ 5 a day. The end is just offensive, but do not worry. It's not like you're getting that far!
