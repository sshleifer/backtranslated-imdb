Not since "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" and the "How High" previews <br /> <br /> I've laughed so little about anything the filmmakers would have thought <br /> <br /> would be hysterical , <Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected by the army as a 4-F. He decides to use his money to build his own army of about half a dozen. He then embodies a Nazi commander in Italy and finally tries to kill Hitler. That's the description of the <br /> weak act. <br /> <br /> This movie is as funny as a heart attack. This movie makes "Hogan <br /> <br /> Heroes" look like Shakespeare. If the financiers of "The <br /> Producers" really wanted to lose their money, they should have shown this movie. I can not stress how bad this thing is. <br /> <br /> Lewis' direction consists of two different cameras that record the action <br /> <br /> from two different directions and then work together. This <br /> <br /> sitcom style of direction works on TV, but here it is an obvious attempt to cheat the audience. He finishes most of his <br /> <br /> scenes with a still image shot, as if he were giving the viewer the opportunity to <br/> <br /> double in stitches before going to the next tired setup. I spent the most <br /> <br /> of the movie doubled in abdominal torment, accompanied by <br /> strong flatulence, about this thing. Lewis, the director and producer, releases the film in 1943, but does not attempt to use historical costumes or sets. Each features the latest in <br /> <br /> style and has the latest interior design ... for 1970. The supporting cast is lost as Lewis lets go of his patented tangents. > <br /> that last as long as a major surgery and are just as painful to see. When Lewis becomes a Nazi commander, he spends the last half of the movie in a <br /> <br /> portrayal that is so rude that it stinks of such goodwill you try, <br /> <br / > to bring in at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The last embarrassing shot has Lewis and his cronies trying to <br /> <br /> one in Japanese. They wear bearded teeth, blink with their <br /> <br /> eyes and speak with a "funny" accent. It may be one of the most obvious racist events since internment camps. I was pervasive at what Lewis had done through the whole thing, but that brought me over the edge. Pay attention to Kaye Ballard's tasteless scene where she tries to commit suicide again and again. <br /> <br /> George Takei from "Star Trek" has two small scenes, then smartly <br /> falls out of the picture. This laughs less than the last three films by Mel Brooks. There's nothing sadder than watching a <br /> <br /> formerly respected comedian screw up a project so badly that you're actually ashamed. Jim Carrey learned this with "The <br /> Majestic," but Jerry Lewis keeps appearing on TV while he's doing the same idle trick. I'm sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "Which way forward?" is cheap, unsteady, offensive and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for all involved and all who have to endure this. I do not recommend <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Although rated (G), this includes some physical violence, some violent violence and some adult situations. If your child is interested in seeing this, contact the professional help. <br /> <br />
