No idea how that is rated (5.8 at the time of writing), but this movie was absolutely terrible. Acting was not all that bad, but it did not make any sense and the overall quality was poor. It's obviously a B-movie (or a C, if that's what it is) and it looks like it was made over a weekend in a friends house or something. I'm all for low budget movies and I generally look at everyone I come across, but this is really bad. I mean bad like "The Fanglys". I do not know what else to say, but trust it, because I actually sat down through this horrible, horrible movie and I can spare you the trouble. Seriously ... just not.
