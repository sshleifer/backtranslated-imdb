Have you ever experienced one of those nights when you could not sleep and just turned on the subway to see what's going on? So I came across this threesome. For me it would have been better to throw and shoot the 97 minutes I had wasted with this film. <br /> <br /> In his attempt to be "real," the characters in the film appear as Gangsta stereotypes that should have been the story of the premise for a Wayans Brothers movie. The dialogue? You're welcome! It sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this movie. <br /> <br /> The work was terrible. One of my "favorite" scenes involved a car chasing a series of narrow streets. The characters, however, are tracked, driving through a park with baseball fields in the background. When one of our "Homies" is included in this movie, he miraculously bleeds through the clothes. They have no holes, which is more than I can say for the planned load of .... baking soda. <br /> <br /> Indie films can be great, even if the budget and impact are low. However, you still need to have some cinematic integrity. If I could have given it a 0, I would. If you see it, I hope it is cable, because even the cheapest rent would be too expensive. Actually, 97 minutes were too much to pay ...
