So suppose you're a producer, you have some money and you got Richard Equipment and Bruce Willis. All you need now is a script ... but why should you do it? See, this movie is really awful, the drama is pretty good, but the casting is a terrible piece of equipment, and Willis did her best to play those characters they just can not play. Well, this movie has no plot, or rather, there is something that tries to go out as an act: there is a nasty hitman (Willis) who is cool and dangerous (actually he is not one of those things, but a dialogue between the two) the other characters should have this impression), so this hitman is on a mission to kill someone, now there is an ex-IRA prisoner who is friendly and nice and very personable (equipment), the FBI He will release them from prison. The FBI now "investigates" to find this hit man. The investigation consists of a series of unlikely information - as if a random person had lost their wallet and someone used their name to buy a car - which is always right. Since there is no real plot and the script is so crappy, you can not expect real character development or tension. Instead of creating it through the story, they just add disjointed dramatic music, which signals to you that something very dramatic is going on instead of actually creating something dramatic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a very bad movie and a complete waste of time, which has somehow reached an incredibly high score for their level, probably because of the cast - and that's exactly what the producers counted.
