This movie is absurd. Absolutely terrible Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia really needed the work for this film. The plot is absolutely not credible! Michael Keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective, but escapes. He succeeds in evading the police throughout the hospital - not to believe that he knows so much about the hospital. He leaves the hospital in a very devious way and blows up the power generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And best of all, Andy Garcia (father of the dying boy) and a doctor help the criminal get the bone marrow. The plot is such a nonsense! Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen.
