No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high-art, but the fans expect a movie as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this movie had a confused, implausible storyline that made me falter - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) films. Even the chance to see familiar characters in another movie can not save this movie - including the stupid scenes with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy in Yosemite. I would say this movie is not worth renting and barely worth seeing, but for the true fan who has to watch all the movies, renting this movie is the only way you can see - even the cable channels avoid this movie.
