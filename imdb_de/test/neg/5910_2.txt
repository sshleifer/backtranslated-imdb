I did not expect much with HARLEM NIGHTS, but I did not expect it to be as bad as it was. No doubt the worst aspect is the obscene language, it's really terrible how much there is in this movie and before anyone accuses me of being a weakling, let me point out two things ... <br /> <br /> 1) Among my favorite movies I would count GOODFELLAHS, PLATOON, RAGING BULL, while my favorite movie of all time is APOCALYPSE NOW. <br /> <br /> 2) My universally popular American television program is the HBO prison drama OZ br /> so you watch movies and TV shows with massive amounts of curses that usually do not bother me, but the problem I have with HARLEM NIGHTS had, is the fact that it is a comedy, but it seems as if the production team had come to the conclusion that an audience laughs every time someone (especially if he is black) says a rude word and decides to replace funny situations with bad words throughout the movie, hoping to get a laugh. Well, I thought I would never start laughing and I did not do it
