I am from Australia and have watched respectfully the extraordinary culture of rugby union in New Zealand. I totally appreciate Kiwis comments on this movie. It was a total insult to a people of people and their beloved sport. Anyone involved in the filming of this vile film should formally apologize to anyone who had the misfortune to look at it. Note: People DO NOT kneel and cry while slowly reciting the Hakka. What a pathetic scene that was. <br /> <br /> Should we feel some kind of sympathy for that idiot who almost killed his girlfriend, who refused to listen to any advice from someone with half a brain, then Did he seem to see the light? What a completely unpleasant character (with the visits to children's hospitals, which do nothing to redeem his despicable personality). <br /> <br /> And why do people even make a movie about Americans playing rugby? They are barely ever on the world stage in sports, not even to make a movie about it (yes, rugby is a "world sport", as opposed to rust and baseball).
