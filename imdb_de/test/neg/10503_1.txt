Ok, I'm usually fascinated by Z movies. Some of the actors, directors, writers, etc. in these films have quite a bit of talent. They want to get this talent out, so unfortunately they have to get in touch with shabby people to make their films. But some Z movies have at least one thing that may be remarkable. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw it, I thought ... 'Wow, a blade tee. 'Believe me, if this movie could do justice to the label that would make it a better movie. Instead, I was exposed to one of the most terrifying acts I've ever seen in my life. Master Kao was bad, so bad that I believe that some of my neurons in my brain exploded and tried to understand his behavior. I still try to understand his statement and why he would raise his voice to speak certain words ... to add dramatic effects, I'm sure ... but it was not an obvious reason. Simply stunning, simply gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Oh, and then there's the black man in the purple cape at the end of the movie. Purple Cape type fights with the hero for about 30 seconds, but it's so bad it actually looks like he's scared of the fight. The main hero (Derek Washington) seemed to know martial arts.
