A boring gangster movie that makes you wish somebody worked on him relentlessly. I thought the history of Las Vegas would be interesting, but it fails on almost every corner. Warren Beatty's performance as a stupid and unlikely Bugsy Seigel makes you wish you would look at someone else. Once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene, but most of the time you just can not take care of him. Annette Benning is a talented woman as an unreliable lover, but even she is only slightly tastier than he is.
