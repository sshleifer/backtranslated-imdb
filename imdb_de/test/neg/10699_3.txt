For the most part, I thought this film unworthy, but the last 10 minutes made me write one. You see, this is exactly when we learn (SPOILERS ... if they can be called that) that the devil's envoy has no chance to properly prepare the rule of the world through his master because he has no martial arts! "Prosatanos" has lain in a hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to release it, only to be defeated in a one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris! Imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken Jackie Chan ... (* 1/2)
