That sounded like it was like the silence of lambs or zodiac signs or something, but it was not like that. It really was more like one of the Halloween movies without any jump scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 from space, in the sense that the vicious protagonist was always making crazy speeches that made me want to get a snack without taking a break. The idea of ​​a person who is crazy enough to kidnap and torture people as a form of spiritual enlightenment is indeed an interesting idea, but the execution was too easy for a TV feel. I have to say, it was better than I expected for a movie written with Dee Snider. A good first try. Maybe he will learn some lessons and his next assignment will be less awkward.
