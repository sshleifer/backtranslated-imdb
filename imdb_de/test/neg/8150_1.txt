This movie has one or two interesting gags, but it's not worth the wait. After an inexplicable argument between two guys picking up a car in a drive-in movie, we went to a departing family. Hollywood and driving their motorhome time and again across the screen, while the dialogue with the Inane is overruled. At least I think it's crazy, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so loudly that sometimes the dialogue becomes almost inaudible. <br /> <br /> Finally, the RV arrives at a petrol station at night, where the family disembarks before continuing. The camera then pans to the actor we just saw driving away. He speaks directly to the camera, and we find out that he's the director of the movie we're watching and how he came to do the film. <br /> <br /> A nice idea, the ALMOST (but not quite) worth the previous sequences. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds, it encounters the two characters we met when they chose to shoot at the beginning of the film, and all of them form a film company. <br /> <br All sorts of not-so-funny and awkward comedies emerge as they put together a crew and try to raise the money needed to start filming. <br /> <br /> Obviously this movie was put together on a shoelace and a promise and there is a nice little idea to get around here, but the execution is so inappropriate that the idea is lost. Comedy is more than just things that just fall over and everyone is talking (or screaming) at the same time. So many dialogues are called by several actors at the same time - Robert Altman can do that well because he has a script, rehearsals, decent sound techniques and arrangements. Anyone who yells at the one microphone hidden by the sound in a trash can in the next room does not provide clarity.
