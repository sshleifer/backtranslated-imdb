In the beginning, I'm neither a person judging movies I have not seen yet, nor am I a person who rates movies at 1 if they do not deserve it. This movie was really that bad. The basic plot was extremely formulaic, and although she was not great, she had earned a five. The part that really bothered me was all about swimming in the movie. I have put together a short list of things that are not right with the floating aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. No character development. 2. No sense of time. 3. Completely inaccurate swimming scenes, including: a. A team of six swimmers who go to something called "nationals" and "regional" without mentioning how they qualify. b. The same team, no matter what the hell this meeting was, was not a real meeting at any point in the movie. c. The rival program goes from a high school, a club team back to a high school and then back to a club team. d. In the scene where Ellis is interviewed for a job, the Banner High School show state wins and placements with citizens. However, the team consists of 5 to 12 swimmers, depending on which of the three meetings take place. e. A team of 5 men and one girl wins nationals / regions. f. The girl wins a 100 butterfly event for men. G. In this race, the girl beats two guys from a team that was among the nation's top three last year. H. The announcer changes a race from 200 chest to 100 chest back into the 200 again in the span of about 45 seconds. I. In the last season, the 4X100, which is swimming in a 50 meter long spa pool, you see a swimmer make two turns. j. In the same season, the teams anchor swimmers and get off the blocks, resulting in an inspiring pep-talk that lasts about two and a half minutes or about three times as long as the leg would hit a national caliber. k. The film will begin in July or August, assuming that Ellis applied before the beginning of the school year and that the pool should be closed in three months. So, assuming that both things are true, the swimmers could not swim in less than two years to gain national or regional goals because the pool needed to be cleaned and the children did not practice for a while. l. I'm sure there are still a few hundred, I'm just trying to block them from my memory. 4. The entire movie does not always mention the time of a swimmer. 5. If you have a movie about swimming, it is a good idea to rent extras that are good for swimming. 6. The scene in which the child is submerged is physically impossible. <br /> <br /> All swimming scenes were too slow, the bathers had a terrible technique and the idea of ​​qualifying for a child national meeting within three months of learning to swim is simply offensive to swimmers. <br /> <br /> OK, if you still do not believe me, let me say that this movie is one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and this comes from the man who Gigli, Soul Plane, Manos: The Hand of Destiny, Skullduggery, and any number of other dead bitch possesses that have been filmed. Please do not go!
