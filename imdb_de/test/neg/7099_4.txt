On the scale of 1 to 10, I gave a 4. I thought the movie was not very good, with too much violence and not a character that you could like. On an erotic scale I give the a 6. Many of the sex scenes were marked by ugliness. I always enjoy nudity and Nancy Travis and Faye Grant get through, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.
