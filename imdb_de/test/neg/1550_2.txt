Well, the episode I just saw made the older "Gastineau Girl" howl why people mentioned her husband (Mr. Gastineau, apparently a famous American football player). She does not seem to accept that he's the only reason she's not turning out burgers, she's married someone who's famous, and that's why she has cameras on her, she gave a wonderfully round reason why people are referring to her should be careful: "I work very hard on my reality TV show". Then she said, "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality." <br /> <br /> I am not sure who this series should be, except for the people who already had their intelligence removed. For no one except gold diggers, it's certainly a role model, because the two stars only spend money, and all you say about rich people is that they have no money problems.
