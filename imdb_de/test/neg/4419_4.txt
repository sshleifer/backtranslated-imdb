Occasionally funny, but generally boring. I recognized Robert Hegyes from Welcome back Carter (aka Epstein) as an ex-celebrity. There is a knee-slapping scene in which the Frenchwoman has a bad reaction to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman and Tom Arnold are billed but have only subordinate roles. You never get to know the characters and it's hard to be interested in what happens to them. Not recommended.
