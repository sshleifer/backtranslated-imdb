Fame did something strange. It was not just a musical originally created for the screen (most based on Broadway musicals), but a television series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct this sentence. Fame is not a musical. Musicals have song numbers to advance the plot or to show the feelings of the characters. The singing in this music is not used for that; In fact, there is no purpose at all. People just sing randomly to fit in the plot. And that's not the kind of musical I know. <br /> <br /> The so-called action of Fame has a rush of characters (all of whom were presented at the last time when I saw this in a movie. [Gosford Park] It had catastrophic results) that for to audition and enter the New York High School of the Performing Arts. All of them are for various reasons, i. Acting, singing, etc. The quote unquote drama unfolds as these middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that high school should be selective. After all, it's a free college, and they can not let anyone in. Why is it that some people who are really bad attend college? Obviously, a drama could emerge between all these different people. And why is the person not even billed for no reason until the end of the movie, unless we feel uncomfortable? There are many disturbing situations in which these untalented people are immersed, but you can not feel bad for them because you do not know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you do not know. And these characters recognize things about themselves throughout the movie, but you do not know that because you do not know what they were like. <br /> <br /> As for the vocals, it seems random (and should be funny?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it is played in the middle of a street, and before you can say that Ferris Bueller is dancing all in the middle of the street, they are dancing wildly and off of it. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene is superfluous like the whole movie. Fame is an unpleasant movie, to say the least. I would say more but luckily most of the movie went out of my mind. Just do not see it. They do themselves a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for language.
