There are some beautiful landscapes here, if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see something of it. I'm a big fan of slice-of-life movies, but these guys are just bland. Although there is nothing political here, the entire film can be seen as a political statement, showing how communism destroys the individual, making everyone the same threadbare animal that is currently spending his life sleeping, eating and eating occasionally to love.
