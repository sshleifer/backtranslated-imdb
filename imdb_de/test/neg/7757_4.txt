From what I understand, Mr. Bava has given up on this project before completion ... and that's right !!! If I were him, I would definitely have made EVERY copy burned and if anybody would ever have asked me about this movie in the future ... IT'S NEVER HAPPENED & IT'S NEVER SEEN ... end of story Despite some great Sets and good photography is this a horrible movie ... is it supposed to be scary? (not in the least) should it be funny? (Pooh-leese) A total waste of time ... and I really do not want to say that !!
