This movie was fine as far as the movies go. It could have been made into worldly films as a crossover. However, it had little to do with the books left behind on which it was allegedly based. Important story premise have been removed and new big story premise added. <br /> <br /> Most disappointed me, as Nicolae was portrayed. He was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have in the books at the time. Antichrist is not Satan, is not omniscient and not omnipotent. <br /> <br /> Faith and faith were portrayed in a strange, surreal way, which just seemed to make the movie stupid.
