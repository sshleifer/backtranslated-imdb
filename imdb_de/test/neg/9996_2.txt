This is a dreary, sluggish, self-confident hole. If the only thing that suddenly gives life to a movie is hanging, you know the company is messed up. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic, self-sufficient, caricature, insect-like caricature ridden by Tic. Why he is so is never explained and we hardly get any background information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of "In Cold Blood" and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed author of "To Kill A Mockingbird," Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capote in his first investigation into the crime, and their presence immediately suggests a much more interesting topic for a biopics. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly put out of action for endless scenes of Capote complaining of his agonizing existence. To look at him is as if I were dr. Watching Lost in Space, Smith complains about every "delicate back" that will be listening for two hours. The difference is, though, that Smith enjoyed watching while Capote did not. The film's precious self-worth kills him, as does director Bennett Miller's unwillingness to add any kind of shading. Like the morose piano score, the film is a miracle with a touch and offers no contrast, no emotional coloring and no intimate drama. If Capote really was so irritating, why would he make a movie about him and expect the audience to see him? Although the supporting roles are played well (Chris Cooper is his usual, relentless self), they serve only a small dramatic purpose, because ultimately everything about Capote (!) Is clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's "legend". Her product is stillborn Oscar bait ... and is more proof that a big genre picture carries more "truth" than a dozen clusters of oh-so-straight crap like this one.
