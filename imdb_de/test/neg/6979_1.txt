I have endured this movie just to satisfy my curiosity. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever eaten. I am amazed that this film currently has a rating of 7.5 stars. The drama is terrible, the script does not exist and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a funny movie, I can not remember giggling once and not seeing how it could be defined as a comedy. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this cinder and consider other alternatives that would give you much more enjoyment. Watch movies like the holiday or 27 dresses, these films would provide a far more satisfying cinematic experience. I sincerely hope that more educated moviegoers will vote negative for this film in the way it truly deserves, giving it a more realistic rating that other movie fans could base their judgment on. Come on, guys, let's be fair to all involved and give those involved a real reflection on what they produced - a very mediocre image that deserves to be quickly forgotten.
