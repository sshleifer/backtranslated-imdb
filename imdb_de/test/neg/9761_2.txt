Do not think twice, because the premise of this movie is good. It is, but that does not make a good movie, does. <br /> <br /> Comedy requires a sophisticated script and masterful direction. Unfortunately, this poorly executed movie has no. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comedic farces (Les Bronzes series is another example). <br /> <br /> The comedy timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hashed by other movies. Others just sit there as if they would give you time to laugh. The plot has messy negotiations (allergic daughter, lesbian co-owner) and simply does not develop or surround the viewer. It's not funny and not believable for a second. <br /> <br /> Compare this to any comedy by Billy Wilder (some like it hot, a foreign Afair, etc.) or LeCene's compatriot Francis Veber, a veritable genius in French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde, etc.), and you will recognize the difference in their close scripts, their great comedic drama and timing. A joke leading to the next one. Watching Mon Meilleur Ami twice would be cruel and an unusual punishment, not a good sign of a comedy.
