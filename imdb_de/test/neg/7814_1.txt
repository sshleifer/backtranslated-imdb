This movie has to be one of the worst I have ever seen. The humor was raw, hardly funny and was heard a million times before. The start was special and it got worse and worse. I was about halfway finished and could not bear to see more of it. Fortunately, I only saw it on TV, so it did not cost anything, but I strongly recommend that you waste neither time nor money. The characters were not developed at all. I actually think it would have been better as a little kids movie than it was full of stupid unrealistic "funny" events ... that's like it would happen at home alone or something. Not implying home alone was so terrible in some way.
