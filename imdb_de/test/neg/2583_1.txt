I saw that at the Toronto Inter. Film Festival in September 2005. The description seemed fascinating - how wrong was I! This could be the worst movie I have ever seen - in 50 years! I see the director is my age (1948) and lived with Nico from Velvet Underground, who leads us to Andy Warhol, who happened to be the one I thought of when I saw this - Warhol's 24-hour Movies in which not much happens. It's not art, it's boredom. <br /> <br /> Special: Black & White. OK, maybe ... but what's the purpose here? Surely they had 1968 color! And there is no opposition to the present. And yes, the subtitles were of course white. I do not think I missed much, but that made about 20% unreadable. Next, it's a purely chronological order, but with seemingly random events. What is the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the dinner table? It does not add anything to the movie. There were many similar scenes - almost as if someone had taken a camcorder and filmed random people and put them together to a movie. <br /> <br /> act? None. The "uprising" consists of some figures in the distance, occasionally lifting a stone off the canvas. Most of the time it is a torturous time to see people (in the distance!) Standing around. The repetitive opium smoking is just as boring. When the main character got a sweet girlfriend, I was awake, but no, she was boring too! This is perhaps the only French film I have seen where nobody undresses. They were probably too boring to bother. <br /> <br /> Romance? None. The girl seems to be completely indifferent to everything - maybe her sculpture is of interest, but if it does, that's not shown to us. We are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters, because they are all not attractive. Maybe that's the point of all this?
