I am shocked and amazed to find reports that are miserable for this horrible film. I've rented this "movie" or feces, whatever you want to call him, with several friends and after 30 minutes we had to stop watching. Just hearing the dialogue left a terrible taste of sour milk in my mouth. This movie was about as smart as an ass pimple. I hope I never see again that Anne without a brassiere (Julianne Nicholson) looks the same (Julianne Nicholson). But instead of a quick but painful 30 minutes (all I could endure), it was agonizing 90 minutes.
