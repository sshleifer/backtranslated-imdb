Charles Darwin was nonsense, according to this masterpiece of filming (pun intended), when he introduced his theory of evolution because he did not mention any alien intervention. You see, aliens sent Chupacabras down to earth and they form the missing link in evolutionary theory. The rest of the film, however, seems to clearly emphasize that Chupacabras are a typical Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I do not really know where it fits. Are you saying that all Puerto Ricans are foreigners? Whatever, it's pretty much irrelevant anyway. The only thing you have to remember is that "El Chupacabre" is an absolutely cheap and moronic amateur B-movie that lacks excitement, character development and style. Several duos of humans chase this goat mouse monster (reminiscent of the miniature version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have an infallible dog catcher and a nagging writer, two vile police and the supposedly evil scientist with his humble accomplice. Since they are all extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can frivolously consume all the Latin American immigrants in the neighborhood. The monster itself looks fine and the make-up effects on the remains of its victims are acceptable gross and bloody. The acting performances are incurably horrible and headache stimulating. In particular, Eric Alegria is pathetic in his first and only starring role as an overly ambitious Animal Control employee. Yeah, it's an incredibly stupid movie, but you've certainly struggled with worse and less amusing low budget garbage.
