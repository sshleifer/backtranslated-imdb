Oh, but that's sad. One good actor after the other turns in lamentable dialogue in a half-hearted manner in an unbelievably pedestrian direction to make it acceptable. I like Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favorite actresses. Tom Courtney can behave well when he's knocked, and David Suchet is a high-integrity pro, but they all bubbled around like fish in a watery gin. I swear that Courtney was intoxicated with painkillers or both. <br /> <br /> Was there a good performance in the whole thing? Well, David Hood, a Junior Underground Engineer whose companion was washed away, looked like he was taking the thing seriously and blaming him. It can not be easy when "everyone around" loses, so to speak, or maybe His scenes came under the direction of the assistant director (if there was one). I just do not know what these people did in such a poor movie (apart from paying the bills), I can not say how disappointed I am in them. YOU SHOULD BE DAMNED YOURSELF! <br /> <br /> All the positive things except David Hood the third ... yes The aerial shots of London, which were mostly submerged, were very well done, and the responsible effect artists deserve better than their fine work through such Emphasizing a Flat Story If you forgive the expression, the few people you see will do so on a much smaller screen than it would be best. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? Why are British filmmakers trying to imitate such characterless, spectacle-driven genres on the tabloid level as the catastrophe film, and then make it worse than the Americans? Cunning realism, intellectual character traits, capturing real emotions in ways that make you feel and take care of them ... The Family Way, Spring and Port, Get Carter, The Long Good Friday, Trainspotting ... Not I'm wrong, I like a bit of escapist Hokum. The true "Italian Job", The Adventures of Tom Jones; But oh that it should come to that, there was a more realistic drama in Carry On Camping.
