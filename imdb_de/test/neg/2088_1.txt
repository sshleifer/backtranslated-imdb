This movie is bad, but if the producers used a REAL KANGAROO, he would have killed the actor he was punching. I am Australian and have seen two seven meter male roos fighting each other. It is not a pretty sight, as one or the other opponent should kill his opponent (this is one way to secure the female herd.)) And there are cases where someone has wrapped a kangaroo and was injured or killed. So if you see a kangaroo on TV or a movie, it's probably a woman or an animated one, since it's a good idea not to hurt actors (they might get angry if they lose the ability to breathe). There is a strange notion that Australian animals are cute and cuddly, that's wrong, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 deadliest snakes live here) and most are just ugly (koalas are as soft as wool). So if you come to Australia, be careful !!!
