I saw last night and I'm a fan of the first Demons. I had hoped that the successor would have the same fun, eerie mind of his predecessor. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The setup is similar to the first one in which a horde of carnivorous demons escaped into reality by being released from a horror movie ... (The first was a movie theater that takes place here in a movie theater dwelling and on television.) Once the demons are released, it comes to madness and mass murder. That's pretty much all the plot development is about. In the first part it worked well with the scary make-up effects, the fast pace and the unpredictability. The sequel, however, does not cut it off. The first problem seems to be that there are far too many characters who in one way or another are not really interested in us. If they were annoying or idiots, then there would be at least some kind of satisfaction if they were inevitably slaughtered / demonized / eaten alive ... but these people are just waiting to be slaughtered. In addition, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and out of them) is constantly torn between them, which keeps drawing me out of the story. There are some amusing parts, courtesy of Splatter FX and Campiness. Like a steady stream of dripping blood slipping through one level at a time as if it were an alien acid ... The first demon possession of a crawling birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire group and a creepy demon child fighting his way through the room of a tenant pregnant with child. However, this sequence becomes a ridiculous-looking rubber demon baby puppet thing jumping out of the chest of the human child, who is constantly flying around the room with his intended victim. I got some giggles from this scene, but I do not think that was Bay's intention. The scene would probably have worked better if they had just kept the childish demon around to attack the woman, but hey ... Other trifles like the overzealous behavior of most of the characters and the bad synchronization do not help. In summary, I have managed to see the unrated version on DVD, and I can not imagine going through the entire R version so far, because only the make-up effects and the Gore were the only thing I got out. Noteworthy is also an early role of the future hot daughter of the producer Argento, Asia. In fact, it probably delivers the best performance of the entire cast and is barely visible on screen. The fans of Argento / Bava might just want to try it, but they'll probably look at their watch as I did. Gore fans may get some of the movie, but they laugh at the stupid-looking evil baby doll since Little Selwyn of Dead / Alive. You could make it worse, but it certainly does not match the original.
