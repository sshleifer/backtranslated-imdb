STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> The former New Orleans Murder Commissioner Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is Moved to Columbus, a small but violent city in Mexico, to help local police stop a major heroin smuggling operation in their city. The culprits turn out to be ex-military leaders led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, also known as East Enders Jase), who uses a special method he has learned in Afghanistan to fend off his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason to pull him down, pulling the two men into an exploding final showdown, with only one going away alive. After the death, Van Damme seemed to be on a high. He was able to show that he could make the most of the action films. While this was a much more dramatically oriented film, he returned with The Shepherd to the high-profile action in which he did not become famous and produced his worst movie since Derailed. It's not nearly as bad as the movie, but what I said remains. <br /> <br /> A boring, predictable movie that barely has any exciting action in the way. The least of which consists mainly of a few flabby battle scenes that try to look cool and trendy, with a few cheap slo-mo / speed effects that make them sadder, rather desperate instead. Director Isaac Florentine, as a Mexican set movie, has tried to make Robert Rodriguez / Desperado feel, but this only adds to despair. <br /> <br /> VD gives a particularly uninspired performance, and he's never been a kind of Robert De Niro actor, that can not be good. As a villain, Lord should not expect to leave the Beeb soon. He gets little dialogue in the beginning as he struggles to create an American accent, but becomes more mysterious towards the end. All supportive actors are just as boring and do not help lift the movie spirits. <br /> <br /> This is a shepherd who has strayed directly from the herd. *
