I had seen Rik Mayall in Blackadder and the New Statesman, so I thought I would try this movie. <br /> <br /> I bought it at 4pm, at about 8pm I started to watch 8:15 pm I went through the rest of the film to see if there was anything left for a man with a brain. . But that was not the case. At 20.45 clock I threw the DVD in the bin. And there belongs this "film" to it. What happened to British humor? The humor that is so fine and witty, intelligent and artistic can be found in Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Vicar of Dibley, Fawlty Towers or The Fast Show? The black humor for which Britain is so famous? I do not want to offend anyone, but I suppose even stupid kids would not find it funny. They deserve more intelligent fun. And Rik Mayall, you can do better, so please!
