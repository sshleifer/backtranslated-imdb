My first impression of the Saikano: Live Action Trailer (available on YouTube) was "Wow, this could be one of the few better live action animations." This time I was wrong! Simply put, the live-action movie Saikano was a mystery that lacked some parts. just put together enough to get the vague picture of everything. <br /> <br /> * STORY * <br /> <br /> The movie story vaguely follows the anime and manga, but the movie story is just the frame of a car, not a complete automobile. It seems that many parts of the story that originally appeared in the anime have been left out, changed or completely changed. In fact, the ending is totally different from the manga or anime finishes. <br /> <br /> characters especially; many were left out or had a different feeling. The connection between Fuyumi and Shuji is reduced to Shuji, who knows her because she is the video store lady. Chise's character has already felt too strong and only the infamous I apologize a few times in the film. The same can be said with Shuji. We've lost the shy, but big, male lead, the song he's humming, and his frequent act of calling Chise stupid. Other characters like Tetsu and Akemi had a different, diminished feeling. Maybe the falling and weakening of other characters has focused much more on Chise and Shuji, which did. Way too much. Do you expect many sweet action scenes like those in the trailer? Good not! Those in the trailer plus a few minutes is the only amount of action you'll get. The movie talks so much that I thought I had a regular Asian love drama when I flipped through the movie before he saw everything. <br /> <br /> The pace was far too fast. In the film we see the famous scene of Chise, armed with small wings and a chain gun arm in less than nine minutes. There is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. What they should have done was split it into two movies or even a trilogy. If it had not been for so many things, they would have to be changed or dropped. <br /> <br /> But again the movie behaves like a frame. The anime was more of a complete automobile, because even if all these little details and trifles are minor, they can really add up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> - Visuals were disappointing. Many of the special effects looked very cheesy, especially the CGI. Unfortunately they were like in sci-fi channels. They are bearable and this movie is not for the effects. <br /> <br /> Music was average. Much was orchestral music, except that there were really no topics. The movie has dropped the addictive song that Shuji always hummed in the anime. An eye-catching piece of music, however, is the trailer to be heard in the trailer. Not a bad and nice song. It's a shame that it was not integrated into the movie as either itself or as an orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> -Casting- Saikano's casting was like that. The main star was Chises actor Aki Maeda, who is famous for his role in the Battle Royale films. The actor who played Shuji was pretty good, but they took the glasses away from the original character. Oh yes, and Tetsuo looks like Lupine 3. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what I've heard from a few others, acting in the live action Saikano was not so bad. I feel more guilty about the way the story was arranged and the series was compressed into a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> * What can you learn from the Saikano live action: * CGI- I really wish the CGI in Saikano was not so bad. But just so we could have gotten a few fight scenes! Probably, the most anticipated live action anime adaptation Neon Genesis Evangelion is unlikely to suffer as they've been assigned WETA studios for the effects. <br /> <br /> Modernism - Fuyumi owned a video shop. Chise used an audio cassette player to listen to music and gave Shuji a mix tape for his birthday. Why? This movie was made in 2006! Not only that they can create something like film in the reality of the film, so that this is not possible in the 90s! The future is an age of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. In Evangelion, Shinji will hopefully have a Sony Walkman MP3 player. NO playing cassettes. <br /> <br /> -Story & Pacing- As mentioned earlier, the Saikano movie moved too fast, forcing the story to drop lots of details. It was a smart move for ADV Films and whoever made Evangelion a solid trilogy to have more time to tell the story as true to the original as possible. <br /> <br /> -Characters- Leave most of these character designs alone and let these classic quotes say! What if the live action Evangelion is not Asuka's "What do you do, stupid?" or Shinji "I can not run away!" Sometimes as small as they seem, they add common quotes and are the ones that are the characters. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> All in all, the live action movie Saikano had potential. It really did Those who are not fans and do not see this movie: they are reluctant to start the anime or manga (so do not watch the movie first!) To let people who have seen and liked the anime / manga Do not hope for this one. Studies show that you will most likely be disappointed. It was still fun to see how the anime was brought to life in the live action adaptation, but it could have been so much more. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly, I give the live action Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) a 2-out <br /> <br /> As Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br /> <br / > ~ NekoTakuto
