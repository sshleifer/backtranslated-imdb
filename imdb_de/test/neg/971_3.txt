MINOR PLOT SPOILERS FORWARD !!! <br /> <br /> How did such talented actors engage in such a meaningless retreading <br /> <br /> retinue? Robert DeNiro plays a stupid Hollywood version of the violent cop with violent attacks (ie he beats the bad guys together and turns his gaze on police officers who prefer to stay with him the book), and Eddie Murphy plays a <br /> <br / > not so tough policeman who would rather be an actor (ie he screams, <br /> <br /> "Freeze, Police!") and has his "hard look" knocking down). Of course, they are <br /> <br /> partners when Bobby's loose cannon tactic gets him into hot water with the media and he's essentially blackmailed into playing a starring role. <br /> <br /> "Cops" -like reality show. Breathe in, because that's as funny as it gets <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> No energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale renewal of <br /> <br /> Each buddy movie was thrown into a mixer with "15 Minutes". <br /> <br /> Yes, DeNiro himself, pretty much the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> The jokes fall off, the action feels listless and nobody seems to have <br /> <br /> a good time. It is dead on the screen. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste time. Even if you have an overwhelming affinity for one of the actors - avoid it and do it a favor. If this earns <br /> <br /> money, these scripts are considered absolutely acceptable for actors. <br /> <br /> For actors of their quality. <br /> <br /> And Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious films. I remember them - <br /> <br /> they were good. You have been nominated for your awards - remember how much fun it was? Now after "Analyze This" (which was good), "Meet the <br /> <br /> parents" (which was good) and "The Adventures of Rocky" and "<br /> <br /> Bullwinkle" (which was not good), I think we have to see how you parody yourself less and be VERY VERY. "Casino" feels like a long time <br /> <br />. And no, I do not count "15 minutes" as a serious bobby. Anyone who has taken this media satire seriously must receive its weekly world news
