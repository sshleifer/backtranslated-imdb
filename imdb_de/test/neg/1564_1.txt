Cultural vandalism Is the new Hallmark production of Gulliver's Travels an act of cultural vandalism? Not really. After all, not a single copy of the book is burned. But if this is the only Gulliver that people are exposed to, and for many it will be like that? These people will not get what Jonathan Swift intended. If Jonathan Swift were alive, Hallmark could be sued for copyright infringement and they would lose. This is a good way of thinking before starting a project with the ideas of others. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. Through his hero Gulliver, he travels to places where he is tall, small, crappy and ?? Human. The little people in Lilleput are small in every way. Petty and stupid they fight, the great and minor, endless wars of annihilation, at the end of which their soft-boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table. Sounds a bit like us. <br /> <br /> I forget most of the rest: It has been years since I read it. The TV program reminded me of a few things, and as for the good side, I made myself want to read it again. <br /> <br /> This gift to mankind was crapped, as Gulligan among the branches under the vulgar yahoos and Danson, Steenbergen and especially two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be thoroughly ashamed. Some "creative people" had the ingenious idea to focus on "the star": "Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose actors are just bad, portrays Gulliver as crazy, all of his travels were caught up." Weeeeel Yeeeaaah! Of course, the countries he visited were imaginary: this is called fiction, his aim was to talk about humanity and our often terrible relationships with each other, his journeys of his imaginary character into imaginary countries are his method. But these people treat the fantasy as a disease, and anyone who has a moment that Hallmark could not turn into one of his Anodyne cards is suspect, so I'm sure I can understand why Hallmark is making that crap, it's so bad that O 'Toole, always profound, looks as little as his Lilliputian, he is of course in character and comments on the character at the same time as many, if n Not all big actors. The information of the figure provides information about it. Our light completes the character. She becomes three-dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. Most actors do this very subtly, as Hopkins does in The Remains of the Day. Others, like Nicholson, play the two parts pretty far apart in most things over the past twenty years. Nicholson actually plays with the relationship between his two points and with us as well: with him, everything is like a cradle, and he holds all the strings while he is laughing away. Great fun, as well as O'Toole. But something is missing here. He shouts into a megaphone (as grand as ever) and all the senses are a hollow shell that stands below him. <br /> <br /> That's because it is so. Look for "anodyne" and there the word "Hallmark" should be synonymous. Harmless, bland, harmless: Hallmark is the doll that can not piss because it has no genitals: it's the norm, the average, the person who makes no difference. The indicator of the license plate is to have no license plate. I never suspected that such people despise those who have the imagination so much. Suddenly Pound's "Disney Against the Meta-Body" stands out in bold. Einstein's "men of genius are always forcibly opposed by mediocre heads." In fact, anyone who has an answer to questions other than "a)" or "b)" for this mediocre type is suspect. Then who is more distinctive than a man who travels to the darker places of the human soul and illuminates his small flashlight to illuminate what can be found there? Hence the act of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world in Jericho, the barbarians the great statues of the classical era. These things are obviously vandalism. Hallmark strives to protect us from foreign enemies by undermining our own culture. the one who nourishes and sustains them. And we. <br /> <br /> Please buy a copy of Gulliver's Travels wherever you live and read them. Or order online. I like to use ABE Books.
