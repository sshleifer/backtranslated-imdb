Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This sticky movie version of his fifties short story about time travel and its effects on de-evolution is not well known (or had it?) From the movie case and now exists as a DVD on the shelves that were released during the past year slow week. <br /> <br /> What looks like a fancy sci-fi thriller from the opening scenes quickly deceives us, as the computer-generated graphics in a movie that should be different from others will go through unchanged. A journey into the past, when a big company offers macho boys the chance to hunt dinosaurs in 2055 by paying exorbitant fees for the time travel to the prehistoric jungle. A slip of the foot / butterfly during one of these things and the course of evolution is changed, and the resulting time waves roll across the planet, turning everything into man-eating plants and beastmen. Of course, there's a pretty girl who knows how to reverse the process, and a hunky man who risks his life to take her orders, and everything is fine after all. <br /> <br /> Yeah, that's the story ... and the most surprising thing about this poorly scripted, miserable mess of a movie is that it attracted some talent to portray the flat characters of the comic. Edward Burns (all Buff and Hunky) is our hero du jour, Ben Kingsley is the necessary vicious businessman with a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the omniscient woman, and Wilfried Hochholdinger the evil man is a great actor and should have known better than with to vote that flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers, the creative department has sold out some of the craziest animations that have been on screen for a long time. One has to miss. Grady harp
