This show is intended for people with an IQ under 80. The jokes in the show are so lame. If you're on a lonely island and have nothing to do, you'll better take care of this garbage ... you'll hate its accent, its behavior, and all the stupid jokes and pranks they're trying to carry out. I really puke that the audience gave Reba 6.7 in their vote ... Sure, I knew there were some people with an IQ under 80, but I did not know there were so many of them! Guys, if you were to read this, I hope you will never download or buy this garbage sun ... I know it's not the place for him, but I'd recommend a much better miniseries "scrubs".
