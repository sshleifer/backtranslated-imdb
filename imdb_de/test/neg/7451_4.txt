This movie started great. The first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters. That's the good news. The bad news is that the movie becomes too repetitive and then becomes stupid. <br /> <br /> What we end up with is a Santa with "magical" powers and a lot of New Age nonsense. It's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of "Christmas movie" I would expect from Jim Varney's "Ernest". I can recommend a movie.
