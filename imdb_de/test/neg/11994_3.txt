Glenn Ford, a boy from New York, who has saved his money, his thumbs and hobos on the ranch he bought in Arizona, where he hopes to find SKY WITH A DENTAL FENCE. A movie with a Dalton-Trumbo script and a story staged by Bardain Ricardo Cortez, the foul-smelling Glenn Ford, and the troubled Richard Conte should not be so damn cute. Although the system - usually considered common cops and railroad bulls and property owners - is as horrible as one might expect from the left Mr. Trumbo, every single proletarian is so sweet and kind and the salt of this earth feels nauseated. It does not help that the heroine - a cute blonde thing, an illegal alien refugee fleeing Franco's Spain - annoys for scripting and acting reasons. <br /> <br /> So why look? Richard Conte already plays a very good role in his first role. And there are some left-wing 30s moments that are pretty amazing. (Does Dalton really have to stop a large part of the movie in the Russian worker's mission? All that was missing was the portrait of a beaming Joe Stalin!) This is Glenn Ford's first substantial role (though his performance is not good). <br /> <br /> Why not pay attention? In essence, the film has an unconvincing vision, is associated with a political stance that is vulnerable, and the two main roles have made much better films. The strengths of Dalton Trumbo as a scriptwriter are nowhere to be seen. Instead, we get a movie that the Coen Brothers Barton Fink could have written in a jiffy (and avoided that infernal fight with writer's block).
