MELTDOWN is pretty interesting SCI-FI. No big budget, very few special effects; but decent spectacle and a history of global demise suffice to sustain seeing. An asteroid streaks the atmosphere and pushes the earth into an orbit closer to the sun. Global warming is fast becoming unbearable. A determined LAPD policeman (Casper Van Dien) will do everything in his power to save the world from destruction, as the rising temperatures are devastating. There is pressure to save humanity from this solar catastrophe; as well as protect his daughter, ex-wife, and TV reporter girlfriend. The cast includes: Stefanie Von Pfetten, Venus Terzo, Amanda Crew and Vincent Gale.
