I looked at it today on TCM, where the other reviewers have seen it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I was the only one who accused Davies of being a weak actress with a really terrible attempt by an Irishman (Irish-American or American American). Since she's the star, I found it hard to get past it, especially since the other reviewers said that was their best performance. <br /> <br /> Another particularly dreadful performance by Davies was in "Marianne". (1929), which I also saw today. In this film, rated 9 out of 10, her accent changes from that of a (true) Frenchwoman to an odd combination of Italian and Swiss. Interestingly, TCM's one-hour biography of Davies - "Captured in the Movie: The True Story of Marion Davies" (2001) - The film historian Jeanine Basinger claims that "one of the things you notice about Marion Davies in her sound work is how well, it sets accents. "Of course, this biography also contains comments from fans (make it what you want). Davies was a very attractive young woman and under all circumstances a terrific comedy in real life. And because part of her anatomy has contributed immeasurably to the real response to Joseph Cotten's quest for the meaning behind Kane's last word in the opening scene of the great "Citizen Kane," she has taken her place deserves the great stories If Hollywood's story. <br /> <br /> But I think Welles & Mankiewicz got it right with the "Susan Alexander" facsimile of the actual article for the most part. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about voting if you agree or disagree with this post, as I really do not care.
