Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Woody drama, lame effects, and a terrible storyline make for a movie that you do not necessarily want to see. PV is one of those movies that does not even have the good grace to be pleasantly bad, instead this bile seems to try to make itself offensive, dull, and crap so humanly offensive. <br /> <br /> A vampire has made a serum that he sells to elderly people as a life-enhancer, and those who take it are under his control. A former intern is working with a nurse to stop him. Someone should have stopped the makers of this garbage. <br /> <br /> No one has a reason to watch this movie, and I'm really appalled by the human race on the grounds that at the time of writing 2 people have given this cruelty 10 out of 10.
