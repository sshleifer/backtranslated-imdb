This movie made me so mad because of its stupidity that I felt the need to create an IMDb account to share my opinion with you. I liked Ashton Kutcher in "A Like Like Love" and that's why I still wanted to see this movie despite the current rating of 4.2. It is very overrated. I trusted that an actor (one of them) would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such low / high quality production. It is very disappointing. The theme of home-sitting was much better used in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". Things that make no sense here: First of all, the homeowner leaves his precious pet with someone who does not know how to take care of it. Second, the rule is not to let anyone in the house, but the house sitter does not follow this simple rule. The door is not locked?! And so on ..
