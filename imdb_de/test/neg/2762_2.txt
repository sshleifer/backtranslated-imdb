A good cast ... A good idea that turns out to be flawed because hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in court. So many good actors and they all act so bad! Why did they all get involved in this mess ... And yes, it has its good points, like lighting, etc ... But in the end, I asked myself two things ... How could so much talent lead to such bizarre chaos? What is this accent Nigel Hawthorne sets? He is / was a great actor and what is this accent about? It is impossible to identify? What did he want to do? Maybe it's his subtle hint, as if he wanted to say, "I've dealt with a turkey, so here's a crap accent that fits!"
