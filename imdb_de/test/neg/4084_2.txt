I can only feel so good when I pass those precious minutes of my life, telling each day how awful it was. And even if I say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life, I will not fully understand my point of view. Just stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a difference in movies like this and movies like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my other least favorite movies. The last two were awful, yes, but that was it. Evan Almighty takes a strong cast and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... WHY GOD WHY !? All these people have a much better talent, now, when I see one of them, I will think of this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was when I saw the movie. There was a mentally challenged older woman who violated the shouting of bird shit and jokes, tools and construction tools was thought to be so funny that she had not stopped laughing all the while, almost stroking it.
