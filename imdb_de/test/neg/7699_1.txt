This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, and did not leave out a single cliche that could be imagined as a Hollywood-style thriller. The protagonist is a loving father and a private investigator who is engaged in a special task: to find out if a suspected "snuff" movie is real. by Mexicans) & Sex Theaters is his field of research as he searches for the murderers of the woman in the "snuffle" movie. With the help of a "smart" (he reads a book) sex shop employee he gets a murderous bondage film producer and his personal perverts responsible for the movie ... ... and what do you expect? They are presented as the simple evil, with no explanations, background and story: they are the bad ones and he is the cleaner. Boom. Murderer of the killers. End of the movie. Is it that bad? Yes, I fear that. <br /> <br /> Ironically, "Machine" (the mega-pervert who committed the murder) even points to his ridiculous character: in the final scene, our hero forces "machine". put on his leather mask (yep, of course he wears one) and realize that "machine" looks just like the normal 08/15-type of the road. Then "machine" says: "blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I had a nice childhood, I just love to do what I do!" <br /> <br /> I just love killing people. Yeah, sure, "everyone loves to kill people" (Bender). It's not just the total lack of character that made this movie so boring, it's also the ugly "I have to kill these people" attitude that makes you sick. In one scene, our hero has tied one of the killers and tried to shoot him ... but he can not. So what does he do? He calls the mother of the killed woman, says that her child is killed and asks her if she loves her child so much that she wants to see the murderers dead. The mother is crying, she would love her child, he goes back to the bound murderer and beat him down the police does not matter), moralized in a ridiculous form against pornography, does not take their characters seriously and wastes your time with a stupid Plot. The only good thing about this film is probably that it's not trying to do a pseudo-psychoanalysis ... even that would be too much a plot. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with it. <Br /> <br />
