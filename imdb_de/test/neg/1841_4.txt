I do not have to agree with the people who say that this is a lousy horror movie with good acting and camerawork - I would say it's an okay horror movie caused by shockingly miserable acting and bad camerawork. Spend your time with this Rubbish. The main idea behind the movie is more of an original idea, considering that there is an abundance on the basis of killer doll festivals that has imposed on us over the years. Unfortunately, the story is treated with all the sophistication of the latest Michael Bay actioner, a group of characters that are unbelievably unlikely and actors who are believed to be from Korean soap operas played with precision of perfect horror. It's not scary and it just manages to dampen your expectations for the next Korean horror movie. Well.
