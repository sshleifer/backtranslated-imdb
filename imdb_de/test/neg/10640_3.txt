*** SPOILERS! *** I sometimes wonder why sequelers think they explain (and therefore have to destroy) the secrets behind the iconic horror movies. The original "Hellraiser" from 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. The sequel "Hellbound" from 1988 was also a fantastic horror movie, although I personally did not like the way the audience got background information about the Cenobites, some of the scariest horror villains ever in the original. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992), was quite a mess, the manufacturers of which obviously considered it necessary to add an extra dose to the previously incomparably scary lead Cenobit Pinhead (a typical stupidity of the 90s) The fourth part, "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996), is a bit more atmospheric than the third, but it reduces this quality by giving it more stupid and completely unnecessary "background information" about the Cenobites and opening the gates to hell. <br /> Seriously - did we need to know how to craft the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell? I do not think so, and that is not the only mystery about the Cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film. The shot of "Bloodline" goes back and forth in three different time periods. The film begins in a space station from the 22nd Century, when the scientist Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) tries to shut the gates to hell forever. If government soldiers disrupt his mission, he must explain his reasons. In the 18th century, the merchant's ancestor was a playmaker who was to build a puzzle box from an occult-obsessed aristocrat. An evoked demon, the Princess of Hell, took over the corpse of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the Gate to Hell is the one who built them, the toymaker's bloodline is cursed, and his ancestors were besieged over the centuries by Cenobites, and the 22nd century is really a mess. I admit that the eighteenth-century role has an eerie atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but also the smallest part of the film. The parts in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. The movie's strong points are undoubtedly its great make-up and gore effects, the absolutely gorgeous Valentina Varagas as Demonin and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who despite his uncanniness is still threatening rogue. For the "Hellraiser" fans, it is an almost offensive idea, but Pinhead should be overcome by a ridiculous light show. All in all, "Bloodline" is not a complete catastrophe, but it's certainly an unworthy sequel to a series that started so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed, as he preferred to be called Alan Smithee. All in all, this is only recommended for hardcore pinhead fanatics, and most of them will probably resent the horror of their favorite demon once again. Everyone else is well advised to stick to the brilliant first and excellent second part of the Hellraiser franchise and skip all others. The make-up effects in "Bloodline" are scary, but almost everything else is disappointing. My rating: 3,5 / 10
