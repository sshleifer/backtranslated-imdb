Agustus and Call really did not do anything? Why are they heroes, they did nothing but the bad guys, where they were dead. What was the purpose of this show? I was very disappointed. I expected more action, more story and the birth of heroes and great deeds. Instead, I saw very little, it seemed Agustus and Call, where is just a side story for the great Indian chief. <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure if the story is very close. They did very little to show why the Texans and Comanche fought each other. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Zhan, who played Gus very well and is a great actor. A lot of good stories that could have disappeared. It was sad and I wish I had not seen it.
