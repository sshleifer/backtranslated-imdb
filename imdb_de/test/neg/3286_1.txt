The actors and actresses of this series are fine, but the scripts were absolutely terrible. This family is so dysfunctional that it is not even funny. In fact, the scripts very often show how one is not a parent. The scripts are so bad that Homer Simpson looks like a better father. <br /> <br /> Anyone who becomes a parent, if you want to see what's wrong with your kids, this show is the perfect guide. I think the garbage this show feeds is indescribable. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport has seen much better material in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need a strong lead and better, much better scripts than I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> If you think this is generations, my teen has even turned off a show of it, because he thought that this is the case terrible.
