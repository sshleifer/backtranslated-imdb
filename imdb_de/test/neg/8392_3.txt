Paranoid Park is about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who causes death, even if he was accidentally killed by a security guard. As the movie continues, Alex explores minor issues such as his parents' divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend Jennifer (played by Taylor Momsen, who you can currently see in Gossip Girl) while being burned with guilt. I have only seen a movie by Gus Van Sant, Elephant, and I can assure you that he has kept all his manners in this film. Once again he crosses the timelines. Once again he uses comic film techniques like the infinite shots of people walking ... maybe you like those movie techniques, I know I'm not going. The plot feels unsatisfactory to me ... it's almost too easy to be researched for so long. The feeling I get (as well as Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant is trying too hard to make an "artistic" film that causes the film to lose substance. Also Gabe Nevins was pretty bad as Alex, it makes a difference whether you look alienated or distant and look like a robot. If you are a fan of Mr.Van Sant, look at this, otherwise skip it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
