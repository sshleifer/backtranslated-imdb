This film stands out only in its banality and use of clich√©s. Unfortunately it was obvious until the end. But do not be wrong to think that it ended strong. Just a little unexpected, but it's not worth looking through. <br /> <br /> From the silent and abused hero to the Germanic baddie to the expendable team, the characters were completely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (Geddit?) Gave hope for humor, but that did not matter. <br /> <br /> I'm a big sci-fi fan, but it's hard to find a redeeming quality in this movie. A turkey! <br /> <br />
