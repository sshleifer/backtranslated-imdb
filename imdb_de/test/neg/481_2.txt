It is so wrong! The plot seems to be a generic adaptation of the average Blaxploitation movie. The most common topics of blaxploitation, such as racism, oppression and the struggle for the integrity of your community, are presented as simple / flat. And the jokes are not even funny! Dolemite offers these monologue comedy routines that are really painful. All the people around him give that canned laugh. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's the funk. For a much better comedy in a blaxploitation try "Coffy" & "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic Blax experience, try Black Heat.
