The first two hours of the televised version are full of character and action exposures - after an early short sequence of Las Vegas struck by tornadoes, the action does not start until the second two hours. Nevertheless, some character relationships only become clear in the second part. The performers are in competent performance, but nothing special (but better than the ones in "Aftershock: Earthquake in New York"). An exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The plot is a fairly standardized mix of parts of "Independence Day," "Speed," "The Day After Tomorrow," "Earthquake," "The Towering Inferno," and several other films. You can predict what will happen next, and you come close to the dialogue word for word. The special effects are unbelievably bad. Despite the twister effects, the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than in "The Wizard of Oz," and other effects were apparently made for less than series such as "CSI" and "Cold Case" for the film's entirety of a single episode , If you need to watch a television movie for TV, read "The Day After", "Asteroid" or "Special Bulletin" instead. So you get better plans, spectacles and effects.
