I always think it would be nice if you could preview some of the old movies that were released on DVD before you buy them. This will save you time, money and a certain amount of aggros when you feel totally disappointed. <br /> <br /> "The Buddy Holly Story" is such a movie. <br /> <br / I do not want to go into the characterizations, the holes in the storyline, or the mess of historical facts that this film contains, because I had already resigned myself to them twenty years ago when I started to do them to watch. <br /> <br /> I had it on the old (Monaural) beta machine in the early 1980s and I liked it so much that it became a regular favorite. In my opinion, the best part of Gary Busey was the young buddy, and his almost perfect vocals and guitar playing. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to the day I ... STEREO ... and here comes the disappointment into play. <br /> <br /> This DVD version is (supposedly) remastered in both audio and video according to the shell information, but I'm afraid I dropped my head sadly and glanced at my watch and wished that she would end. <br /> <br /> The sound is bleak, bordering on the incomprehensible and so unprofessionally mixed that I long for the clarity of my old Beta cassette! <br /> <br /> Regardless of what you think of the pictures, the plot or the characters, the actual drawing card here is the MUSIC ...... and if you can not hear the lead vocals because of them those are drowned out by the cymbals, the background harmonics or other ambience, then there is not much left, right? <br /> <br /> I will convert my old beta version to (mono) DVD for subsequent viewing and place it where it belongs with the garbage out! <br /> <br /> "Extinction is the rule, survival is the exception ..."
