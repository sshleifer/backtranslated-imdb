Much is wrong with this movie. It can be said that it was a bad idea to make a sequel to "Halloween", and we should be lucky that the previous posts, even at the lowest, were still visible. But even today "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" - even today - is so bad, it is shocking. Bad filmmaking in the worst case. There is so much guilt to go around. But where should I start? On whose shoulders does this guilt rest? Was it the director of Joe Chapelle? Well, at least the sixth rate is visually fresh. And as far as the visual effects go, you see Michael kill in a pretty cruel way, even if it does not quite fit into the overall sound of the series. <br /> <br /> Daniel Ferrands' troubled script is the culprit? To be fair, he did the best he could. When you reach the sixth entry in a series, you will no longer have places. Michael's reason to find is not a bad concept, but rather an uninteresting, especially dealing with it. And it really does not help that the movie was hacked into pieces so many times and sewed back together that the story was completely lost towards the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe Dimension / Miramax messed up the whole thing. After all, this was the first studio movie in the "Halloween" series, and we all know what happens when too many cooks come to the kitchen. Are you looking at the incredible lows they pulled "Hellraiser" to? I think everyone is to blame, because apart from the actors and the visual effects guys, it seems nobody bothers to deliver a decent movie. Cut, cut, roll, or kill with electric current until his head exploded. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" was never a good movie. An all-time low for the series, which would almost have denied Michael Myers credibility, "Curse" is just that: curse. The thorn angle was neither interesting nor likely to be expanded. The unnecessary Gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the hallmark of the name "Halloween". Towards the end, the movie does not make sense, stops pushing a plot, and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and finish the movie before everything else is lost. It is sad that Donald Pleasence's last performance in this film is immortalized, even though the man did his best in the worst conditions. And for the most part there are other strong performers in this movie. Paul Rudd plays the crazy, anti-social adult Tommy Doyle quite naturally, while Marianne Hagan portrays the sympathetic female lead pretty well. On the other side of the coin, remaking Jamie Lloyd was a shame, and thankfully, Devin Gardner does not make films anymore. As the kid in the movie the "Man in Black" is following, Danny is the anti-Jamie, being annoying, whiny, and totally unbelievable in his role. It's sad when you can not even feel sorry for a child in a horror movie. But I think that's "Halloween 6" in a nutshell. In essence, this is the anti-Halloween of a director who did not know what he was doing and a studio that had its own agenda. Hell, even the music is bad. Many will try to paint this as the weird "Halloween" because it's a sci-fi variant, but it's really just stupid. Apart from some good visuals and decent characters, "The Curse Of Michael Myers" is as good as it gets. And that comes from a fan!
