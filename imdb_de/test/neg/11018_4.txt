This totally listless film is so exaggerated and pathetic and unrealistic that I've looked at my watch almost 70,000 times during the entire 90 minutes of torture! Lucy Bell is so much taller than this crap and for her it's pretty depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in laughed hysterically, but the majority was Greek or Italian, so I think that humor will probably make them laugh, but not me. Everything you do in this movie is sick when you watch these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. God, and I can never get the 90 minutes back!
