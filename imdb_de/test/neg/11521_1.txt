Badly traded, poorly written and badly managed. Special effects are cheap. Best performance is from Yvette Napir, but that does not say much. Story is a bewildering mess of corporate greed that leads to the sabotage of a space station and attempts to rescue those stranded on board. <br /> <br /> There is little tension and less action. There is a chase that is not bad, but the rest of the movie is just a waste of everyone's time.
