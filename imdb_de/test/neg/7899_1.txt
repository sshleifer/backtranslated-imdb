My boyfriend made me see this horrible movie ... ugh ... it was so stupid ... <br /> <br /> It's about a black guy getting an airplane company and making a stupid pimp thing out of it < with Snoop Dog acts as a pilot for God knows why .. this movie is throwing white people in the bin and has a lot of racist, stereotyped events that make fun of the white people and try to make the movie look like all blacks are cool pimps and all whites are losers ... and blacks get all girls, blah, blah, and so on. <br /> <br /> I despise my friend for making me watch this movie .. I always said "GOD TURN IT OFF !!" and he's like "NO, I BETS WHEN FUNNY WHAT IS" - we ended up halfway there ... Thank goodness ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people with a lot Poor taste in humor ..
