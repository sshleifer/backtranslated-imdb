When I went to the video rental to get a movie, I saw this and I immediately thought it would be funny. The picture made it look like a classic comedy style involving teenagers (eg Road Trip). When I turned the train, I was disappointed because the jokes were awful and cheesy. The only thing the director might think was funny was someone slipping on a wet floor. This is not a joke and would not make people laugh. I was actually wondering if I would turn this movie off when halfway through. I was upset about this movie because it was just a waste of time and money to let it out. Not enough attention was paid to making this film and not enough time and effort was invested. I also found the acting pretty bad. The only time I laughed was the extremely bad "jokes" or actions that were really not funny. I rate this movie with 1/10. I hope you found this comment helpful.
