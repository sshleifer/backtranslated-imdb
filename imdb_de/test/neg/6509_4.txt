Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see this and it was one of the worst he ever did, and Steven Seagal did not help much. It begins with strange religious murders that make little sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He's surprised to see that a new partner is waiting for him to work alongside him to clear up the case, but Jack Cole does not seem to be the one who considers himself all to be Jack's ex-wife in one of those ritual killings he is also killed the suspect. It's the same as all his other films: Smoking Past, involvement of the CIA and now trying to be a regular cop. Why does Steven dress like a western movie? And the prayer makes it a bit confusing.
