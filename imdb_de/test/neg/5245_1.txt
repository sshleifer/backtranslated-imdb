GOOD: Techno music accompanies medieval sword fighting. Also, the movie looks slimmer than most B movies, but let's be honest: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere. Usually I also see the potential of very bad movies. Shit, I love a good B movie like "Split Second" and the like. But this has only boredom and stereotype to offer ... From beginning to end absolutely predictable. Oh, and I've forgotten those lousy special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than anything but a myth! Using a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me! <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Just boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it's so sexy!
