Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It's definitely a horrible example of a movie. So terrible that I do not even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that has to be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of videotapes in my friend's house. It was late, and we had nothing better to do, so we decided to watch some kitschy horror movies (we chose one, unfortunately). Well, in the 90 minutes this thing was played, we ended up having it laughed so hard that we almost vomited. The thing is literally meaningless in the truest sense of the word. It's just a cheap, badly made rip-off of Evil Dead. The whole "story" seems to be nothing other than a guy who wants to scare off his friends by inviting them into an abandoned house and being ravaged by demons. I bet the authors wrote the story while it was being shot. I've seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (shudder) I have to say that Demon Wind could definitely handle some movies with stupidity. Just look at it, if you like to laugh at silly movies. <br /> <br /> Interesting Fact: This movie is like a cockroach about steroids! Similar to the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it mysteriously reappears. Somehow scary, right?
