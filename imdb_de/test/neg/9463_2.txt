I know this movie is a low-budget horror movie intended for those who prefer shocks and "cheap" gore, but even considering that this movie is just too boring, filled with an incoherent plot, together with terrible music and obvious signs that this movie was never finished. <br /> <br /> Without saying a spoiler, I simply say that things are completely explanted with the last part, either through film or narration. The girl Anitra is really attractive, but that's not a good reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of these great movies from the 60s and 70s, then you should take a look at it. But be warned that it does not even reach the usual plateau of this type of movie.
