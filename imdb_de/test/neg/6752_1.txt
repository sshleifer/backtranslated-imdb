They should make terrorists see this video as torture, not just the disturbing final scene, where clinging and beating a woman with mental health problems seems to be a source of comedy. About half an hour of it would convince even the most convinced fundamentalist to spill the beans rather than just another minute of disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful. I rented it because a friend said it was weird just to find out he was talking about the hard director making the commentary and not the movie itself. I think if you find unrestrained arrogance funny, you'll like it. It seems like he's always talking about the chicks he "popped", the tastiest example being when the lead actress appears on screen. <br /> <br /> Actually, CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie. Her radiance shines like a diamond in this terrible dunghill. This is apparently the only movie she has filmed according to IMDb. I hope she's into theater or indie stuff, because I think she has the talent and natural beauty to truly benefit each production.
