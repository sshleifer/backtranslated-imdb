Usually I finish any movie or book I start, even if they are poor just because I hate to give them up. That was so bad that I was incredulous. <br /> <br /> I'm not just looking for Spielberg magic - I'm lending foreign films and I'm actually lending old sci-fi movies (recently Soylent Green) - that's well worth the rent). I like Hollywood action as well as developing slower characters. Different films have to be approached differently in order to be appreciated. I could not find any redeeming element for this ... The action was so wooden that I was not the least bit nervous. The character development was virtually absent - you do not have to apologize or even identify with anyone. After all, there were so many parts that were just wrong. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time - better if you see paint dry ...
