A man (Goffredo Unger) drifts in the sea between the rubble of his destroyed boat off the coast of Florida. A helicopter beckons him only to show that his two legs are missing under his knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and her partner Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) is a marine biologist researching dolphins in the sea. While out at sea, Hogan hears a strange high noise. He and Stella are fascinated by Peter (Micheal Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado), who are developing a device to locate and track the source, or something similar, because it's not very clear. Meanwhile, a scientist named Florinda (Cinzia De Ponti and Cinthia Stewart), working for a rival organization called "West Ocean International," is brutally murdered as she threatens to expose someone inside the organization. More and more people are being attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko as John Garko) is in the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra made their way to the sea. They soon find evidence that something outrageous and unfriendly lurks below the surface. Together with rival scientist Professor Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon, and the US Army, they set out to destroy the monster, but there are other sinister forces at work, as someone does not want the genetically engineered creatures of one be exposed costs! Directed by Lamberto Bava as John Old Jr., this is a long way from the classic Italian horror and splatter movies of the '70s and early' 80s. The screenplay by Gianfranco Clerici, Herve Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is bleakly slow and will put most people to sleep before the 90 minute runtime. The monster is barely used, large parts of this movie are made of footage of boats and helicopters. Big chunks of the first half concentrate on the not so mysterious part "Who is behind it". There's really no horror you can talk about, a guy who has bitten off both legs and someone with an arm. The special effects of the monster itself are generally poor and it shows up very quickly and disappointingly. The occupation of the virtual nobody does not help to make it easier to prevail. There really is not much to recommend, so not. Do not bother, you can do a lot better.
