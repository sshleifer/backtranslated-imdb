When I heard that the largest and oldest surviving Germanic heroic poem was turned into a movie, it almost became my obsession to see it. The first gleam of my appearance never disappointed me. A futuristic interpretation With Lambert, our favorite Highlander and Mitra, Tomb Raider was starring in leading roles, though some doubts arose (an important female character in Beowulf?) ... Two hours ago, I saw the movie. After reading the director's name, my world broke apart. As I said - from that point on there were not many surprises. First and foremost, the movie has NOTHING to do with the original Beowulf, if we ignore a few violent and pointless stolen names. If they had not stolen the names and declared them a new story, they might have passed F-class stupidity with beautiful costumes and scenography. That way, it's just a crime! An attack on a legend and its ideology as well as on common sense. Ok, let me be positive for a second ... Apart from the general electro-goth atmosphere, which is nice, it also has good music. That was it for the positive part as well as for this comment.
