Nowadays, writers, directors and producers increasingly rely on the "surprise". The old art of completing a movie, bringing all the information we've learned throughout the film to a beautiful conclusion, has been lost. What we have now is a movie that, no matter how complex, detailed or reckless, can be completed in just five minutes. It was all in his head. This statement is the director's safety net. If all else fails, or if the writing was not so good, or if we run out of money to finish the film, we can always say "it was all in his head" and finish the film this way. The public will buy it because none of us are psychologists and none of us suffers from schizophrenia (not we know), so we take the story and believe in it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some films did it. But these films are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap. Every director / author now believes he can do it, because Fight Club has made it and has earned a lot of money. So we get movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity and this movie (just to name a few).
