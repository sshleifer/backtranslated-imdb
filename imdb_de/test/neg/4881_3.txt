I saw Bogard when it was released in the 70's. It was one of those pictures that received an X rating for violence. We sneaked into our local grinding house and saw it anyway. Pretty good picture. Much blood from the street fights, although the cheap sound effects for the beats decreased a bit. And a lot of sex. I remember one of the early scenes when Bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she shows him. Without saying a word, he picks her up, puts her on the window sill and nails her. From what I remember, the picture sailed on from that point on. When I learned that Bogart was also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard for television. So many scenes that I remember were missing. I wondered if this was actually the same picture.
