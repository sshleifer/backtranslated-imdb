Get the CD instead. The show is tame and the editing is shit. The crowd gets way too long, as does Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time shaking their heads in the same way (which leads to the assumption that it's exactly the same attitude) as Richard Krupe's Solo in White Meat. The scenes change so fast that you can not see where the camera is pointing, and the renderings are simply superfluous. Not worth the tape on which it was recorded.
