Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother, so I watched the movie, and I have not seen him in all these years. We are sorry! it was bad. I've been told to write 10 lines so I can bring in a few trifles. Tom and Tuesday Weld were to be "introduced" to this picture, and Tom was asked to bring Tuesday to the premiere, but Tom said no, he went with Joan Collins, and he did, and because he had only made Tuesday, Weld became introduced. I thought it was very funny then and still do it. The movie was a weird concept, and the actors were impressive, but some of them were just not funny. The continuity was abstract, at best, as if I saw two different films at the same time, each running in the other. Sorry, Bob Gilson
