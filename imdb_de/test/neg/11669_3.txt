Even if I allowed my undisguised love for the first two films in the series and was able to carry away any kind of biased leanings that I had for Max's character, I simply can not confess to rating on average this caricature's waste of space almost polluted what had gone before. <br /> <br /> Gone is the robust, evil streak that has mesmerized the character of Mad Max Rockatansky, and the sense of despair in an apocalyptic world is over is the passion of director George Miller for the franchise. The horrible result corresponds to the comic heart of the film. It seems the creators did not really know what to do with the amount of money that was given for this third and fortunately last installment. Sure, the stunts are just right, and of course Miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by removing himself from what he has done before. Still, he's clearly been fighting for new ideas with the action since The Road Warriors crowning of the Petrol Tanker pursuit is replicated here, except he's using a train instead !! It's just a very bad show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn in the mid-eighties; But looking at the three films together, Thunderdome looks like a director losing his nervous approach, sadly caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that none of these genre-skews would have worked uniquely in this series anyway. I'll give the movie 3/10 for a really good Thunderdome fight sequence, while the stunt men deserve some credit here. But this is the third time I've tried to like this movie, and as a punishment for punishments that I'm undoubted, I'll never try again.
