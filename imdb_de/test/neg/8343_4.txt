This movie is alright, pretty stupid and easy to take. What I can not stand, however, are the numerous heroes and the ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL commentary of this boy at the end: "Look, they all look the same". Is not that the good taste standard? I found it repugnant, as well as the heroic, unselfish acts of some people in this film. I'm not saying it's not going to happen that way, but if I pull up all the bravery, my stomach will be upset.
