What we have here is Disney's standard direct on DVD episode, where I would expect cots to be cut in all areas, resulting in a neat animated movie that lags far behind the original. That's not to say that this is a horrible movie, it's just a very mediocre movie full of preaching messages that show children the virtues of friendship and be nice to each other unless they are subtly executed (which is not here.) fast to adulthood. The film has a very narrow plot in which Kronk tries to gain the approval of his father and finally find the true meaning of wealth and success. This has comedy moments, but is not enough for a full-length movie.
