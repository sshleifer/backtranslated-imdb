There is nothing in it that the viewer could point out and call "good." The acting was boring and calm. The sets and cinematography look like they were designed by someone who grew up in a Starbucks and tried to make the perfect gap commercial. Characters have no drive, no motivation, or no reason to look after them. There is so much interest and tension that it is difficult to follow the mundane actions and dialogue. And the conspiracy ... if anyone finds it, I'm sure it would be as boring as anything. <br /> <br /> That's not funny, it's not romantic, it does not reflect the human condition. If you're looking for a good stoner comedy, look at Half-Baked; If you want a good stoner drama, you should consider Trainspotting. The only reason I gave these two stars is because it's kind of fun to see well-known faces in the mid 90's. This is a flat reason to even give the movie a star, but this is again a flat movie.
