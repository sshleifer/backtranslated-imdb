Disappointing movie with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When he is discovered, he is forced to sign a document stating that he acted on orders from England. His refusal to sign the document leads us to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Pidgeon is led back to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort John Carradine, who speaks little, but is still as always, the embodied embodiment of malice. <br /> <br /> On the way to being persecuted, Pidgeon meets Joan Bennett, the latter, who shows a beautiful cockney accent. <br /> <br /> History comes to a standstill Something develops between the two, but as we approach World War II, realism becomes the object of the day. <br /> <br /> The approaching scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is well realized, but we know where the arrow will go. <br /> <br /> Very interesting that Pidgeon flees from Nazi Germany, but he meets again with a young Roddy McDowall, one of the many co-stars of Pidgeon in the same year memorable "How green was my valley" , How green was "Man Hunt"?
