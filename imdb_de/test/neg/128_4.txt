The opening of "The Jungle" promises a safari adventure with a sci-fi element, but mostly we get a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding (and the occasional leopard attack). The film is leisurely, if you want it to be gripping, and tries to attract interest in the process with poorly staged matches between various wild animals (I had no idea that lions and wild boars are natural enemies in the wild, or? Big cats clung to hunting eaters, but apparently the producers knew better. <br /> <br /> As for the actors: Cesar does his usual great job of weighing his mustache, and Marie Windsor is reasonably believable as the progressive-minded Rajah's daughter (beautiful eyebrows, by the way!) Rod Cameron is barely visible as the hunter returns as the sole survivor of his expedition, I'm sure he was in demand at the time, but here he comes as Rent-A Center Bogart: Rough-looking, but without bogey's reach or timing, he spends the film between stoic anger and angry stoicism, and ever Of the time the script tries to create romantic sparks between you and Windsor, you just have to laugh. This scratchy, gnarly face is not a good means of tenderness. <br /> <br /> The script is not without merit, although it makes some strange decisions. At the beginning of the first act, the script spins out a moment in which the heroes decide to bring along the compulsively skilful little boy and monkey mascot, but then essentially ignore it until the monkey somehow grabs a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally near Windsor. This is so that Cameron can prove his courage by showing up and saving their lives at their own expense. *** END SPOILER. It's possible that the Indian version of this movie (which I believe ran for over two and a half hours) may have given the child and the monkey more work. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes the movie its age ** SPOILER ** is the edition of the woolly mammoths (the plotter that actually sets the safari in motion). When they finally appear and the scene is shot, it is obvious that the "mammoths" (obviously elephants hung in carpets) really do not "attack" or move so fast, yet Cameron immediately tries to give it a try to wipe them with grenades. Nowadays, the idea of ​​destroying the last known specimens of a species considered extinct would be unthinkable, especially if they seem to be just rolling through the jungle in one easy step. *** END OF SPOILER *** So IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production (normally, Lippert Hack jobs are two or three stars at best). It's not a train accident or anything; In addition, it seems good that the Rajah's daughter is working to improve the most repressive aspect of the "traditional ways" and the elements of the "mixed descent" romanticism that was quite progressive in 1952. There are also beautiful landscapes and an exotic spectacle. See it, if someone offers you to show it to you for free, but do not expect much besides an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema.
