A rather disgusting company suggests that Welsh is an infantile artist who is helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best but unable to withstand vacant expositions rooted in banal fantasies. The first story is a ham fist, meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise. The second attains something bad, but only through the outrageous excess of humiliation that is visited on their central character. The third and most experienced part seems to be a dislocated sequel to Child's Play. The direction is consistently unaware - all whirling noise and anger, a slave to the extreme inconveniences of the environment; suffocating in a poorly chosen music and indifferent showy spectacle. This is sheer stupidity that covers itself as guerrilla sensibility - as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that connect the three sections.
