Bay Area residents are likely to remember Paul from the Diamond Center, a mild night owl who lashed out cheap credit and cheap bricks on late night television in the 1980s and early 1990s. I only mention it because in Death Machines there is an actor who looks like JUST LIKE HIM and plays the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this most terrible and almost unsurpassed crime thriller about a dragon lady (Mari Honjo, who cleverly hung up her acting spurs after completing this movie) who controls the local syndicate. Our hero (let's call him Paul from the Diamond Center) plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of The Simpsons' Luigi ("She lika da spaghetti?") And does not seem to be impressed when one of his guests complains about the food. No, there is no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce: In the pasta is a red Buddha, the card of the homicide commander, who sends a statuette to each of their future victims. Death Machines is bad and boring in every way, which is an even worse crime.
