A totally uneven movie in which the main problem is the uncomfortable mix of comedy and thriller. For me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedy, and they should have opted for a complete comedy. For example, Rock has some weird lines, but occasionally he's too unlikely for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband is scalped is too uncomfortable for a less violent comedy. An even better example is the left Hollywood writer, who preached us through Freeman's character early on the plight of the Indians. I mean - yawn! You should have said something funny to Freeman in this segment, but of course that's a lot harder than just writing him a boring PC speech. <br /> <br /> There's even more New Age PC knowledge in the form of the end: Not only does the girl not get the boy - she does not get a boy at all; In fact, the message is that the girl does not need a boy at all! Something feminist statement there. The first half hour is faint, but the film gets - ironically - better once Zellweger comes to Kinnear. I say "ironic" because I'm not a big fan of Kinnear, even though he's solid here. Zellweger is as always very sweet; It has the kind of American sweet looks that should appeal to almost anyone, and I have to wonder why women are no longer "represented" these days, rather than the dogs that inexplicably became stars, like Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore. <br /> <br /> As the film sometimes tries to be very serious, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character, who is the gangster of the movie world's gangster-heart of gold. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between freeman and rock, even remotely suggesting that they were father and son.
