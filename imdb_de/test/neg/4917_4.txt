At the speed at which these films are plowed by the artifacts from the Amityville House, it will not be long before we get to the floorboards, but for now, it's a mirror that matters for more cardboard figures in this sixth installment of the series prepares. A homeless man hands him over to artist hairstyle Ross Partridge, who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. This worldly horror is racing at a slow pace, leaving us waiting for a build that never comes, as the various "scary" events lead to a stupid finale. Boring and lifeless, with rough actors and Partridge's huge hair does not help.
