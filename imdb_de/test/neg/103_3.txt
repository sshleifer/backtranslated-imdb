This movie is not too bad. While "Nemesis Game" is a bit entertaining, I found it hard to put my disbelief down the length of the movie, especially in the situations where Sara was herself. Should we believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) This hot chick will be sleeping in the middle of the night, unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels, just to solve a few puzzles? <br /> <br /> 2) The protagonists are supposed to be such experts that they play puzzle games for fun, but do not put the whole "I Never Sinned" puzzle together until the end ... and then ... and then. .. and then ... do you know ... she has to do all the mirroring to finally put the pieces together ?? I know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on, but do they really think we're that stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) When Vern and Sara go to Chez M to interview the blonde, there is not a single topless chick in the whole building. Nada Come on. I know it's Canada, but I'd expect more from a country that gave us Shannon Tweed. <br /> <br /> And everyone else notice that when Vern surfed the web and found this Riddlezone website when he came over the internet left the cursor remained an arrow and did not turn into a small hand (like DO ALL CURSORS IF YOU CLICK ON A HYPERLINK)?!? I mean, if the internet is going to play such an important role in your movie, you should at least do the little things right. My goodness.
