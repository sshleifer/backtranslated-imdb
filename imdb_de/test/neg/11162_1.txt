I love the TPBs, but this was a lame episode. Did not have the same feeling as the series or the movie. It looked like it had been hastily assembled. I did not enjoy it at all. The so-called acting was terrible. The cast seemed as if they knew this was the money for an episode to hit the market quickly. I hope we do not have Easter next, because that will be for me. Writing this episode was definitely the worst in the history of this show. The direction left much to be desired and I felt almost bad for the cast and crew of this feeble attempt at a Christmas special. Like I said, I love the TPBs, but they go to the trash.
