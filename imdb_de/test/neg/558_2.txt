I had avoided this movie for some time ... because I considered it an unnecessary consequence of a series that should have only had two parts. But after reading some pretty good reviews ... from some IMDB observers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented them at my local video store. Do I have to go further ... when I say ... that was a buck-50 lost. This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. First of all ... I know that nobody wanted to see a 33-year-old macchio in this movie ... But why could Miyagi not have made her read a letter or something from Daniel-san ... maybe explain something Daniel happened ... the hell, they could have mentioned Daniel or something quickly. But no ... and to compile the already bad script ... they added these stupid monks ... I thought monks would take a vow of silence ... think those yapping monks do not take their vows seriously ... hehehe The education the girl had gone through in the film was hurry and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young men ... was a confusing concept, to say the least. This was anything but a martial arts film. ..with the girl who only struggles briefly in the final scene .... and then she did not even come close to being hit only once ... by the man who fought her ... give me a break ... she would have been hit at least once ... I think the writers and directors thought it would be shocking for a girl to be beaten by a man in this man. I could go on and on, but basically ... in the end I'll say this movie was just so bad ... even the girl she chose was not nice to look at (she was kind of "butch" looking ".... I can only imagine a handful of movies that I sat through ... compare the how bad this movie was ..... DON" T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ... ..... ...
