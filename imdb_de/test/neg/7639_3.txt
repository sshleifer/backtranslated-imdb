A lack of character development proves to be fatal for this film. Valeria Golino's character Grazia looks like a bipolar personality, but quickly degenerates into a caricature and looks unreal. The other characters are thin, probably the writer's guilt is not the actor's guilt. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as a younger son Filippo: His energy and his bravado are funny and convincing. <br /> <br /> I think the little cruelty of the children should contribute to an atmosphere of desolation and the pervasive primordial spirits in the city emphasize, but for me the baseless cruelty is superfluous and contributes to the overall boredom of the movie. Some scenes were amusing, but not necessarily so, for example, when the poorly treated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look as if they are ready to show. The pretty cast and setting make for a responsive trailer but can not carry the whole movie.
