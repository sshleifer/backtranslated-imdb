Tim Burton was loved by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by Hollywood for his softball and user-friendly filming techniques. With his new confusion of a film legend Sleepy Hollow, Tim Burton has decided the scales too much for the favor of the formula. After the search of Ichabod Crane? played by Johnny Depp, the only highlight of this dreary movie? At the heart of the mystery that surrounds the seemingly random and cruel murders of a city by a fabulous, headless horseman, the story runs as if it were intentionally reluctantly predictable. Childrens story is considered a childish story and is associated with exciting, non-engaging chase scenes that create about as much anxiety and thrill as the undeveloped characters fleeing their lives, like The Nightmare Before Christmas. Throw an endless bundle of old trees for an ambiance and a big-eyed blonde with big eyes (Christina Reechi) and Burton herself has a movie that captures the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow and made it like one Disney movie without the charm or the fascination. The dialogue was choppy and ridiculous, the heads were innumerable, and there were enough plotting monologues to embarrass James Bond. Even with the support of Emmanuel Lubezki, Hollywood's most coveted cinematographer today, Depp's marvelous play and Burton's astonishing fame, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose.
