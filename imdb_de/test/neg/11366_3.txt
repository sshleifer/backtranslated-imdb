Not much to say, except plenty of wire-fu and alleged Sholin monks about kung-fu and Japanese cartoons plotting China to take over China. All this would not be so bad if it were not for the totally fake Japanese sword fighting. If you've seen one or two samurai movies, you may find that the "Japanese" fight in the movie is simply the same "kung fu" (really circus acrobats) that makes the same people, except with a Japanese sword. However, there are some funny moments when, for example, a Japanese woman Ninja tears off her clothes in mid-flight to disarm a monk and catch him with a fishing net. In terms of history, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia about whether the Japanese should be portrayed as utterly despicable or whether there might be exceptions. The "Japanese" protagonist is portrayed as mostly honorably, but not beyond, unjustified cruelty, for example, when he murders a sedated monk so he can have his duel. Very disappointing with a very stupid ending. Does not even give the appearance of an epic battle.
