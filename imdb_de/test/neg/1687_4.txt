My wife and children were charged for the 00s-owned Cosby show - but unlike the latter, it was not funny and unsurpassable. In fact, it's so poorly written, and some of the jokes revolve around Michael Mickey, who turns the stupidity of Michael Jr and the fact that he's such a loser - which became more and more annoying and annoying as the show progressed. What a promising one actually Was later turned into a stupid, stupid show in which the ideas were so OTT and ridiculous. And as far as the second Claire is concerned, I was so displeased with this character: she became a spoiled, childish and groaning teenage brat in most later episodes. MWAK was not a Cosby trendsetter, it was more of a bad black sitcom for general conditions.
