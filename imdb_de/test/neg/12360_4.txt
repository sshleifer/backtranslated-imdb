The limited view of the countryside was the only salvation for an otherwise uneventful and boring movie. The drama was borderline absurd, which I blame on the script and the script. Nicole Eggert did not look the part, did not play the role and was absolutely unconvincing as a mountain guide. After looking at it, I felt that some friends had time and decided to do a film. It must have been created with a pocket purse. The plot was thin at best and with the low caliber of acting sometimes the question arose as to whether to ask, "Why are we doing this?" I managed to go through the whole movie, but I also asked "Why?".
