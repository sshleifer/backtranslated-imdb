It was almost impossible to reconcile with Ricci's character in this film. If she was to be depressed, I neglected the scriptwriter and the director before making this film because Ricci's character was more of a self-centered, worthless bag than a victim and survivor of depression, the forced attempt at an introspective narrative as ridiculous as the painful interactions between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I could not buy it. This goes directly to the video hit. I'm glad I did not pay.
