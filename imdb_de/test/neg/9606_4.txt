I tried to give this show a chance, but it really does not suit me well. Although the services are good, it is not the writing. The two oldest step-siblings, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I have the impression that we should be on the side of Casey, because she is the protagonist, but I do not like them at all. The parents are constantly portrayed as completely unaware. The three younger kids are the most conspicuous things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are as nice as they get together, and Marti is adorable. The lines of action are a bit far-fetched and the whole premise is usually hard to swallow - mixed families are common, yes, but this family does not really try to mix like that. By and large, I think it's a thumbs-down.
