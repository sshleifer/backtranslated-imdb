This movie is so mild! I tried not to expect anything bigger from this movie, but it was still a big disappointment. The basic idea of ​​the story is interesting and potential. That could have been so much better. The characters are really simple and have no depth. It's a shame that talented actors Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen did not improve on the already poor characters. The director can not emotionally involve the viewer with this piece of Cr * p at all. <br /> <br /> And the hunting sequence at the end of the movie. That's disgusting !!! <br /> <br /> Why did there have to be such dumb and old solutions to this situation? <br /> <br /> It's too much item that's worse than filming. OH NO!
