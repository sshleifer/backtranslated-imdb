ALL GROWN UP is basically a spin-off and not much of the original Nickalodeon RUGRATS cartoon featuring the babies Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and (later) Kimi (Chuckie's sister) and Dill ( Tommy's brother)). I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was a great cartoon. It had excellent humor, beautiful stories and the creators of the show, Klasky & Csupo, were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies. The new show ALL GROWN UP tries to regain the magic of the original cartoon. I was disappointed when I saw it. I found the "adult" Chuckie just annoying and the whole "Pre-Teen-Acting-Mature" that (unfortunately) * affected all the characters was boring and washed out. There are still some funny scenes and jokes in the new series, and it was interesting how the artists make the entire RUGRATS baby gang look ten years old in the original show. Overall, this show is "fair" and can only be viewed if a) you are an inveterate fan of the RUGRATS, b) you have never seen the original show, c) you are a teenager who has nothing to do, or d) you are so bored that you were somehow forced to watch this show. This show is not so good. It is not comparable to the older RUGRATS episodes in quality, humor and everything else.
