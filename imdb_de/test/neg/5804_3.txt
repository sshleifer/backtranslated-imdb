In all the positive reviews of this film there is a fundamental bias - it's just a mindless comedy, do not take it seriously. Chillax buddy !!! Well, that's a point of view. The other is - why do we accept in all these "comedies" exactly the same script, the same formula and the same dismal people? <br /> <br /> What you get is a slacker who comes through some completely unreal circumstances, has to change his life (always one), overcome a number of circumstances that are only a problem for a raccoon or a teenager , beat the equally stupid evil who is trying to steal the girl he had met two days earlier and triumph by staying a Slacker, but with more money / self esteem. On the way somebody makes something crude, but very illogical. This means that after the film, the viewer can call someone and say something, "They will not believe it." Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Most of the usual names are coming in. David Spade and Rob Schneider are not fun, but they are Crrrazzeee characters - a Russian and, I hold my pages, a waiter in one vegan restaurant Adam Sandler, the king of mindless, unwelcome, illogical comedy, produced with, and some talentless man named Dante reappears The US must explain to the rest of the world what this guy Dante is famous for, because we are ignorant. Allen Covert plays a 36-year-old who got the biggest laugh of the night from me, he was 42 and looked years older. <br /> <br /> Did I laugh? Yeah, but not more than me on a TV Sit-Com would be and I do not have to pay a dime for it. Please stop doing those movies.
