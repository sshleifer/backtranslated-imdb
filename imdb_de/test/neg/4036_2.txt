I had the terrible misfortune to see this "B-movie" in its entirety. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is: --- Save time and money !!! This must be the worst B-movie of all time, it should not even be called a B-movie, more like an F-movie! Because it fails in all aspects that make up a good movie: The story is not interesting at all, all the actors are paper thin and not believable at all, they have a bad direction and the action sequences are so fake that it's almost funny. ..... nearly. <br /> <br /> The film is just packed with shitty one-liners that no serious person could find in the least entertaining. <br /> <br /> This film is supposedly geared towards men, but all the women in it are absolutely unappealing, especially the old wrinkled thing that is coming to an end. They try to appear sexy in these crazy, horrible costumes and fail miserably !!! <br /> <br /> Even some of the most ridiculous B-movies will still make you laugh, but that's too painful to watch !!
