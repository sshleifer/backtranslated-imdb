Okay, let's go hunting - there's no way I can give anything other than 1 in 10. and yet you have to see it! The drama is bad, but it's not as bad as the script, which fades in front of production values. Papp√§xte? yup, we have then. Car mats with silver paint as armor? here it is! <br /> <br /> The film itself pretends to be artistic, but is only cheap; The same settings are used over and over again - especially in the long battle scenes. There are (very luckily!) Very few dialogues, and there is a lot of "artistic" music to bring the horror home! And yet all that awfulness is compelling - you just have to look it over so you can say you've seen it. I have not even come across the infertile sets, the "conspiracy" or the rising special effects. This is really the school that you can not do. This has to be seen - spread the word and let the world constrict to find out what is going to happen on earth in the end. <br /> <br /> Best of all, they did a sequel.
