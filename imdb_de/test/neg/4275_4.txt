Okay, I have not read the book yet, but I have to say that the main character was wrong. How can I say that the book you asked for was not read? It's easy. As a spectator of this miniseries, I was irritated by the manners, gestures and gaze of the main character Fannie Price. It is one thing to be a good person, but it is quite another to be a stick in the mud creature that refuses to look someone in the face or meet his gaze in any other way. Apart from the exaggerated "Susan B. Anthony" profile, she seemed determined not to look at another person. In the scene where Edmond pours out his heart, she keeps looking straight ahead, forcing him to do the same. As a result, it was just awkward and I just could not understand anyone who fell in love with them, let alone Henry and Edmond. Many have said that it is consistent with the book. If that's the case, I can not believe Jane Austen would make such a figure as her main heroine. It is possible to create a figure that has been created by others and that can gain their trust and affection, but the figure of this character in this miniseries simply did not do it for me.
