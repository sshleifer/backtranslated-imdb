This movie was released in the UK under the name Blood Rites. It was invariably forbidden and was never submitted for publication. <br /> <br /> As The Ghastly Ones, it was reportedly a hit with the dread-hungry residents of New York City's famed 42nd Street Grindhouse race track. If you are looking for some damn horror then you will find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, one can see how the incapable Colin (Hal Borske) is knocked down on a living rabbit shaky 16mm camera work that makes Ed Wood look positively wonderful. Three sisters spend three days with their husbands in the family home before the old man's money is paid out. Of course, in such a situation, people start to fall dead. Family secrets are revealed and much blood is shed, especially during a cruel dismemberment. Maybe it was the bunny piece that the British objected to, I know I did it.
