*** Possible spoiler, but probably not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called donkey kong, but donkey kong is not even included <br /> <br />! Diddy is gone too! <br /> <br /> The 1st Donkey Kong Country was one of my two absolute favorite super Nintendo games. (The other is Super Mario World) <br /> <br /> The 2nd Donkey Kong had at least one Ddy Kong and good levels, <br /> <br />, although it felt more like a pirate game. <br /> <br /> However, this is the worst of all! It does not feel like <br /> <br /> the original or 2., The enemy looks stupid and the levels are <br /> <br /> even worse. It does not look realistic anymore! I did not enjoy his game, unlike the last two, the first had great background music and the second was not bad, but the music in this <br /> <br /> game is awful! /> <br /> It happens very often nowadays that watching movies, shows and sometimes <br /> <br /> video games that start fantastically will be ruined at the end of <br /> a fool! I'm sad to say that I feel like donkey kong is not so good as a saga, now that it has Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> You should have left it at the original or maybe the second one.
