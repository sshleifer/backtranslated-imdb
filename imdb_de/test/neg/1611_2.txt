Stranded in Space (1972) MST3K Version - A very poor TV movie pilot for a never-to-be-done series in which an astronaut finds himself with the evil twin of the earth.

In 1991, the launch of "Stranded in Space" ran with three shots of three people falling into a matter transmitter and disappearing. It is a sequence that has nothing to do - not even thematically - with everything that will follow. <br /> <br /> To add confusion to the nerdy B-movie, one of the actors in this film, Kay Lenz, later appeared in a movie titled 'Trapped in Space' (1994). Knowing that this fact can never save your life can lead to very large scores and admirable glances from other trash movie lovers - if you could ever find a way to maneuver the conversation so that you can occasionally lie down, without looking like a total idiot ...
