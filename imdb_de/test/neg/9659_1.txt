First of all, this movie is not nearly complete. I suspect that someone actually bothered to steal every other page of the script. <br /> <br /> The film contains bizarre time travel without notice, inconsistent dialogues and all the missing details In addition, the music is not all that bad at all, apart from the missing tracks and the fact that the volume between the different tracks is high and low goes down. The cutting room has actually made a descent, and that says a lot. Missplaced sound effects, however, destroy the tension. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, he just looks worried and occasionally coughs headlines from hell. <br /> <br /> I seriously rate this movie as the worst of 2007, and I've seen a few bad ones. Do not spend money on it, it's not so bad, it's a laugh, it's worse. A rating above 1 star should be a blacklist on IMDb, as this is a damned lie.
