It is impossible to avoid comparing the "hero" of Zhang Yimou with Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". They were both great Chinese kung fu films with stunning cinematography of the Chinese landscape and a group of superstars. Aside from the obvious, there is nothing else to compare. "Hero" does not deliver on almost all levels that are really important, and proves that famous stars, beautiful landscapes and action effects no substitute for the artistry and vision of a director. <br /> <br /> All the marketing hype that preceded The premiere of "Hero" has done nothing but make their mistake spectacular. Keenly awaited, "Hero" drew crowds at its first opening in theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, making it an instant box office hit. Although the script delighted the government's censors, Chinese audiences turned to new insights of caustic criticism and sarcastic jokes to express their contempt. Online critics, both professionals and amateurs, proclaimed the film as "ideologically troubling," "from the point of deep bondage," "written either by an amateur historian or by someone with other motives." An article was titled "Hero, you make me sick!" <br /> <br /> The movie's deepest failure lies in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible and based on an unforgivable historical fallacy, but - worst of all, a movie - is boring! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberty with the facts of history, but "hero" goes beyond the artistic license to unforgivable ignoramus when he tries to glorify an emperor as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. "Hero" does not offset this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or funny. Instead, it is an insane attempt to be "deep," and he manages to be overbearing and preaching. <br /> <br /> Although historians agree that the first emperor of China was recklessly violent, Mao Zedong was known for admiring this ruler - no surprise given the tyrannical rule of Mao. Similarly, the communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and his own methods of iron fist, so that they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the stars of "Hero", commented in an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by destroying student demonstrations because it was necessary to maintain "stability" in China , For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocked reviews in his hometown of Hong Kong, but merely explained the film's underlying message. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the goal values ​​of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung fu novels and movies to reveal a higher wisdom , Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" proves to be: THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have permeated this message, art has been the last sanctuary in which individuals could truly find freedom from such tyranny. The great popularity of the Kung Fu novel is explained by its ability to facilitate an escape into an alternate world: one in which Kung Fu warriors roamed the country to seek adventure and fight for justice, free from fear and against all contradictions against them, superhuman abilities are gained. Only in the novel did the individual in China gain institutionalized power, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. In contrast to this tradition of the kung fu hero, Zhang Yimou has not risen to a higher truth, as he had hoped, but to the level of government propaganda. It's no wonder the government was so happy. <br /> <br /> Some film lovers secretly ask themselves: "All moral judgments aside, is it at least entertaining?" Fortunately, the answer is a clear "No!" As the same story is narrated again and again with only slight deviations, it becomes boring to watch them. Moreover, the three contradictory versions of the same story only serve to confuse character development, as the viewer has little time to feel sympathy for any of them once the "real" version appears. <br /> <br /> The movie is not without beautiful pictures. However, all scenes are flat because they do not connect to or enhance the plot. The use of different colors to distinguish each version of the story seems simple and invented, and the cinematography is self-confident and not really beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you've seen the entire movie. <br /> <br /> For those in China who showed contempt for unrealistic kung fu from Crouching Tiger, much was expected of 'Hero'. 'Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a true kung fu artist who held national titles before beginning his acting career. His previous films had limited acting skills, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could bring out Li's supple body movements while bringing him into a role that would not affect his acting abilities. But it should not be. "Hero" tries to go beyond the kung fu genre, so there are not many fight scenes, and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult play of drama: an inner transformation that leads to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director could have expected, Li fails miserably. The only combat scene that reveals true kung fu skills is the first of the film between Li and Donnie Yen. All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so "hero" is not satisfying even at this level. <br /> <br /> Although most viewers outside of China will barely discern the historical mutilation of the cruel history of the First Emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's version of "Chinese wisdom," which is anything but. Perhaps the only time an audience came out of a show of "Hero", smiling rather than yawning or frowning, was at the special screening for Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
