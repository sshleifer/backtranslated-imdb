Once again, the posters lied to me. <br /> <br /> The marketing of this strip did not match the content; "explosive"? When I read the summary for this movie, I expected a city full of grotesques. Each man was killed by blood and bloated with alcohol, peppered with heroin needles and hunched with chronic masturbation. In such a "vice pit" would come the clean-shaven hero, who shone Gabriel. Instead, the movie was just the opposite of what I expected. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie showed us that Middletown is a simple little place where poor people do the best they can. whether you fumble a bit to make ends meet, to drink, to forget the pain, or to watch cock fights (chickens, not penises) to stop the boredom. In other words, the citizens were desperately ordinary. <br /> <br /> The only (deliberate?) grotesque in the play was Gabriel, the ghost-washed Presbyterian preacher, played by Macfadyen, whose face is designed to suggest a permanent stream of puzzled anger. If I were amiable, I would suggest that the Paisley chants of the preacher are a witty remark that Gabriel and his faith should despise. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is so incapable of being a filmmaker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie, and the audience has to be annoyed by over 80 minutes of dark, hackneyed age. My only respite from this celluloid waste was a game in which "guessing the accent" was interrupted with rounds of "Spot the Location". Are we surprised that Gaybo steals his brother's child and stifles his father? Of course not; He is a preacher of the Bible and therefore psychotic. All the citizens are standing around looking shocked at the end of the movie, but I suspect they've just realized what kind of turkey they gave their name to. <br /> <br /> The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission has a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this weak company. The only good thing I can say for this movie is that it has succeeded in replacing "Superman Returns" as the worst movie of 2006. a damn good performance. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
