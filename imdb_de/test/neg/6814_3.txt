Very sober, very gloomy, not a real drama. Why not just make a documentary? This is not exactly the passion of Joan of Arc. The only reason to see Chronicles is to hear the performances. I love Bach's music and it was even hard for me to sit through the misery of a movie. The great Gustav Leonhardt plays (in the double sense of the word) Bach. We hardly understand him as an actor because he has so little to do to act dramatically. Mostly he goes targeted or angry from different rooms. Bach's life, of course, was not an Errol Flynn movie. It was actually quite boring and more than a little hard. This probably means that life is not a great candidate for a movie. Of course the music is a different story. I recommend the stations of Bach. Much more information, on the one hand, and some insight into the music, which is why Bach interests us at all.
