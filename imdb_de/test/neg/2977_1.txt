Although I have recently tried to escape German films, I was attracted by positive reviews about renting this film. Since I am again deceived by German media, which repeatedly hew flicks home. For me it is no wonder that nobody wants to see this crap abroad. The idea of ​​making this movie is not an idea at all (I guess a fool read a women's article about speed dating). In short, the characters (who are not), dialogue and content are so amazingly trivial, banal and clichéd, I kept looking because I could hardly believe what I saw. Incidentally, calling the flat theses mechanically supplied by the figures (certainly from the aforementioned magazines) a dialogue would simply be wrong. The acting is so exaggerated that I can not remember anything worse than on the screen for a long time. You have to guess that the director had no idea at all. Amazingly, traders and producers across the country are still wondering why German films (with a few exceptions) do not arouse worldwide interest. Why? Because it's a waste of time and money.
