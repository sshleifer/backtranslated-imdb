A young woman nicknamed "T.N.T." Because she was a virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of appearance, she goes to the most lawless part of Hong Kong to find her missing brother, Stag Jackson. When she learns that he has been murdered, she decides that she will bring the killer to justice in a way that only she can. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, right. Well, the basic requirement as a starting point for an action thriller for martial arts / Blaxploitation is really nothing to complain about. This should be the goal. The leads also turn out pretty good, with Jeanne Bell playing well in the role of "T.N.T." fits. and Stan Shaw as the ambitious, power-hungry Charlie. Where this fails miserably is the fighting that it offers. The fight scenes are totally unconvincing and / or sometimes so over the top that they reach the point of ridicule, which does not help if the main focus of your movie is on a kung fu action heroine. The poor lighting, actors with accents that make them difficult to understand, the confusing camera work and the sometimes bad sound do not help this obvious low budget. This delivers in an area that can thrill some fans, it offers a lot of T in "T & A". In fact, virtually every fight scene in the movie is followed by a kind of nude scene that Jeanne Bell actually has an extended fight scene in which she is completely topless. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is not something you want to visit again because the fight scenes are so pathetic, laughing bad.
