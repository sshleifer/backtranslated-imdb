The worst film of all time, when characters from Carnosaur 1-3 were inserted, only to die the same death as in the first film, so that footage and special effects could be reused. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie debacle. <br /> <br /> Corman ruins his heritage. He made some amazing movies and produced them - but that era ended with Carnosaur being his last "creative movie".
