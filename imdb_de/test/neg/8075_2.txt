Stephen King TV movies can be 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS miniseries, but would a two-piece killed someone? The film rolled over events that should be mentioned and events that could be omitted. I'd like to salute the stars' performances ... They had a tough job because they did not really look like the Stooges, but the ghost was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out a cassette from American Movie Classics that had the right deal and laughed silly. The movie was emotionally pretty tough, especially after Curly had the stroke and Moe had to keep the business going. As Curley started to cry, I lost it ... As I said, the movie was good, but could have been, and should have been much, much better. Maybe it's fitting ... The Stooges were demolished during their lifetime and now, 25 years later, it happens again.
