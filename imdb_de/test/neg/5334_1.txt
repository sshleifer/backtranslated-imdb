Try not to see this. I thought it would be good because I'm a fan of kitschy 80s movies and I liked Linnea Quigley's work to some extent. I was wrong. I should have said "No" and instead should see Gigli, which is probably a much better movie. I think my biggest problem with this movie was the attempt of humor. Nothing was funny or almost funny. Acting is bad, even for the films of the Queen of Cheesy 80s. There is no story, only random clips. I think I should not hate it so much because it was just a funny and stupid piece, but I did not have fun and was not even entertained. I even had to rewind to the end to get through the crap. I'm sorry, but I do not find zombies funny when doing aerobics.
