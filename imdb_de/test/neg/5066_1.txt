I admire the effort to reach the rest of the world with this tragic story. The movie is so bad, however, that most of the people I know could not stand it. The film has been relevant to me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place, but it is terribly written and does not attract the attention of a person who knows nothing about the matter. The music selection is not good with the movie. It seems that someone in the background is turning on a CD player to "put the actors in the mood". Acting ... well, what acting? The only people who act are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, even if Prochnow appears uncomfortable in this role. As for the development of relations between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it is like watching a train crash. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their "righteous moments". This is not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get a message out (could have been a documentary!) And a good movie. This is a failure, and anyone who says otherwise asks me if he is trying to promote it. As a native Estonian insult me ​​this miserable effort. This tragedy deserves more than just a home-made budget-conscious chase for a movie. That could have been much more!
