Well, something special for everyone, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet would be the most terrible repetition I've ever seen ... subtly nuanced like a paper bag and as inspiring as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie until the end was the hope that it would get better or be unintentionally funny. No luck. <br /> <br /> No disrespect for the understudy or staging of Zefferelli, but nothing can offset the bustle of the main character. I have seen Hamlet well portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough warrior, as a romantic poet, etc., etc., etc. But in my opinion, this depiction was just a lack of wit along with most of the weak ham.
