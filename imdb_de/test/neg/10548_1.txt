The Toxic Avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is that a person who is considered by the ordinary population to be loose, then thrown into a barrel of toxic waste and mutated into a superhero is completely disfigures and sounds OK for 1985 too. This movie is listed as a horror ... I've even read of a cult episode with this series .... <br /> <br /> Well, this movie has even been given when he was just made so bad that I was The acting is horrible even for an independent film that I think should be the horror part of this movie. <br /> <br /> Drug Trafficking, Sumo, Godzilla Entrance .... I'm all for anti-drug movies ... damn, I like Godzilla and also Sumo ... I'm not on it, but still, I think the heights of sumo would love to give this movie the 1000 handshake and the ground salt to the eyes of the people who made this movie ... <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm almost willing to write to the film company that made this movie and ask them back the 87 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> For me, 1 in 10 is too high, it's too bad that there are no 0 (zero) or even negative integers here that can be placed here in a movie. <br /> In other words, this movie is JUNK ...... I would rather dry paint and handle explosive diarrhea, then I have to watch this movie again and again ... I would be the first Person who would use this Not only the packaging of this movie as a kid, but I would like to burn a good movie and a script.
