This is one of those movies that you can run on a Sunday morning for a few hours. You can do other things without really losing complications, if you lose understanding of the procedure and become fascinated, if you wonder why such mediocrities are gaining the manpower and financial resources that should be produced in the first place. <br /> <br /> Of course, with all the cable channels and Lifetime's to fill their windows with about 100 hours of movies a week (along with) with incessant "Golden Girls" reruns), this type of fare is now a TV staple. It also appears that these flicks provide a livelihood to the Canadian venues where most are made, as well as the host of Canadian actors. Tori Spelling is like the Ferret's Face of Paris Hilton someone who - if not because of family connections and resources - would probably work at The Gap. But at least Tori has become a C + level, appearing in occasional presentations suitable for this level. <br /> <br /> This story is a story you've seen on Lifetime and similar places - many times. Devious woman, a total sociopath trying to mess up everyone else's life as he did the first parts of the story with more prudence than a CIA employee could do, murdering if necessary, and "heroine" life destroyed by the Stingray <br /> <br /> As usual, male leadership is a completely unsuspecting fool. In these films, for example, you can find characters that you can really "take care of" in about 10% of cases. This is in the other 90%.
