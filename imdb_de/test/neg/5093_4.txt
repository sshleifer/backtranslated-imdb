I was really looking forward to this movie, but unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. <br /> <br /> A good movie has made audiences identify with, feel or sympathize with the lead actor. Unfortunately, that was very difficult for Samantha Morton. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed very disconnected and did not flow as it should. Keifer Sutherland seemed a bit more than a shop window, and made me wonder why he had agreed to play something that seemed a bit too small. Beautiful scenery and the acting of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis was about the only advantage. <br /> <br /> Maybe as a kiwi, I've raised the bar for locally produced films. Maybe the change of director / allegedly hard work with the main actor has biased my opinion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just trying to find excuses for a movie that could have been great. <br /> <br Many Maybes who still do not explain why this movie just missed something special. <br /> <br /> It could have been great, was not it.
