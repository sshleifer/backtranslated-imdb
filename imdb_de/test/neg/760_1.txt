A terrible movie; badly written, badly traded, clich√©d, cheated, slag. The premise is so good and a chance to catch up on black cowboys, but the movie is really bleak. It's a curious mix of a bad Randolph Scott B movie of the '50s and a bad Western of the' 70s. The villains are made of cardboard, the flashbacks ridiculous, the tales torturing. <br /> <br /> The deliberate anachronisms (such as "Victorian" rap singers and modern swear words like "motherf **** er") irritate the extreme. <br /> <br /> A Frankenstein monster who died on the lab bench.
