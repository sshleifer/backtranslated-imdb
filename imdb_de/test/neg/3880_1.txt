Rs.30 / - is all I've paid to rent the DVD for the movie, and believe me it's not worth it. it is not good. Please grow up. <br /> <br /> Here a dialogue from the film -'AGAR TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE to LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI 'just fools. That's it. BHAGAM BHAG. <br /> <br /> Well, it lived the title, I had to run away. :) I switched to Star Movies and instead looked at Home Alone 2 and laughed well.
