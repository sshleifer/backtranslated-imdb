I remember thinking that because of the cast, the theme and the director, I would love this movie. <br /> <br /> When I stepped into the theater and sat down, I was like a dizzying schoolgirl looking forward to the opening scene. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the opening and felt that I really loved this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes can be considered a spoiler, please stop reading. I will not give away anything really important, but it could be seen as such, so this is the warning. <br /> <br /> Spoilers can be included below, beware. <br /> <br /> I think the first scene that struck me as absolutely ridiculous was the Russian space station. I mean honestly, refuel a shuttle with no real warning and then just show the station so fragile that a simple mistake can make the whole thing explode. <br /> <br /> While all this is possible, it seemed exaggerated. I'm not sure if it was just the situation or whether it was cheesy, the stupid view of Russian technology or just the fightless attitude of the scene itself. <br /> <br /> It just got worse afterwards, because then We seem to endure loud explosions in space for two hours ... you know, this place where there is no sound because it's a vacuum. <br /> <br /> But the blessing for me was, frankly, the weapon scene. (Spoiler Possibility) - Earlier in the movie, we see Bruce Willis ripping her land vehicle (the vehicle they're going to drive around when they get there and help tear them apart) when he's told that this is is what they are going to use. He pulls out pieces and complains because much of what is written on them is heavy and is not needed for what they do. <br /> <br /> So, if we walk on the asteroids, we see that they did it. I decided to add a massive gatling like a weapon to the vehicles ... you know, the standard rate of NASA is that to have heavy weapons for all space missions, if there are aliens or something like that. <br /> <br /> I could have taken the explosive 2 hours, the stupid Russian gas station, the gaudy love scene just before the end. The character of Bruce Willis is nothing more than most of his former characters, but the Steve Buscemi goes crazy and shoots the spacecraft's weapon over the place and causing chaos / damage that threw me the whole thing over the edge. <br /> <br /> Save money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteor movie, read Deep Impact. If you want a fun space movie with great special effects, see Space Cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this streak.
