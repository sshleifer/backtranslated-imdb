Another Indian legend that you have never heard of is unleashed. As the name implies, this is a vengeful mind that gladly picks up the skeletons of humans while they still use them. As usual, ancient burial sites (can you say "poltergeist?") Have been disturbed by stereotypical land developers building things. <br /> <br /> The CGI, if it had been better, would have made the effect even more treacherous-looking, but sparing it on the budget, and that shows - weird. The unleashed creature would probably need to be kept off the stage during the first kill - which may have sparked a mystery or imminent doom - but the awkward director decided to show us what it looks like and what's not impressive in the first five minutes , The deaths are just bad, again with inferior CGI. I think old ghosts always kill with cheap special effects. The "victims" look like they are laughing every moment while making silly screams. It is always clear who will get it: a character with only a few lines appears, weird sounds are heard, CGI points fly, exit character. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> However, there are still some chase scenes with the monster that actually made this thing observable. Unfortunately, the director seems to use this as a means to fall back on (hence he is used too often), unless he can think of what his characters can do. Overall, it's pretty stupid, but I've seen worse. This strip is cheap, but it's funny to see it.
