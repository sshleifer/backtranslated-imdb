Take your video camera with you, turn off all the lights in your house and film people walking around with flashlights for an hour and a half, and you have the basic idea of ​​what this movie looks like. It's very irritating to watch this kind of movie. To be honest, there are scenes of daylight at the beginning and at the end of the movie. I like scary movies and creature features, but that just did not help me. So sorry. I really tried to like it. There did not seem to be much of a conspiracy except that we need to find a way out here. I did not learn much about the characters, so it did not matter if we lost one or two on the way. This is not the worst movie in the world. "Open Water" holds this title for the time being.
