I do not know what the creators of this movie were trying to either achieve or say, but they failed in all that it was. Unless, of course, the viewer should be completely confused. I only saw this movie because Drew Barrymore was there, and it turned out that she had a smaller than a small cameo. The idea of ​​taking this kid on a wild car ride to win a big cash prize from a gas station game and hit all sorts of wackos is absolutely ridiculous.
