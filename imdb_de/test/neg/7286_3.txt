Hello. I looked at the first part when it came out, and I can not remember having made such a bad impression on myself. <br /> <br /> At first the animation is choppy, wooden, unedited, it lacks naturalness - I understand that the drawing style should be of a kind of "Atlantic", but it could be done with the usual Disney finesse. .. see "Tarzan" to see what I mean. If I had not seen the DISNEY logo at the beginning, I would never say it's a Disney movie. Second, the plot was more like a PC game style, like a good old search. Not that it's bad, but it lacks a story that ties the viewer to the characters and their goals. At least it was not convincing. The movie was meant for kids, but that was sometimes too childish. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the music ... I would say it was inappropriate, but it just goes with the plot and the animation in the whole scene ... <br /> <br /> Overall, believe me I thought this was some kind of fun, a sort of side project by several apprentice entertainers, just to fill up the number for Disney movies. I'm sorry to hear that from me, a big Disney lover ...
