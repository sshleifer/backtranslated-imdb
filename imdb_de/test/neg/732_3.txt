I'll confess that after watching this movie, I had a firm grip on myself, forcing me to see him to the end. Perhaps this was a latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted our hero to tackle it with his victim, or perhaps the fascination that he received money for making, distributing, and filming that made me credit him with merit search, or perhaps for some bizarre wish fulfillment fantasy, that at the end of all pain could be a point. But no such luck. <br /> <br /> So you're warned not to look at it, lest the same thing happen. There is nothing worth to waste the hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The first-person mockumentary and the shit about Fabian's "search" to impregnate the women of the Falkland Islands looks even more like a sophomore (maybe freshman-high school freshman, this is a film student project than you The implication is that the residents (who are real people besides the two professional leaders) are both mockingly ridiculed and have a rather disgusting sexual policy (whether you take it literally or symbolically, it is meaningless and sexist ). <br /> <br /> The reason I ended up seeing it all the way is because, once you scratch a scab, you have an irresistible fascination if you keep going until it's gone Even if you know, it's bad for you, you just want to see what happens, and in the end, it's rather dishonest filmmaking, because it's not a moral center, it's not Clarification on the local political situation or any place in the way has the political-sexual-personal film universe a la Goddard. In short, it has nothing to say and spends a lot of time pretending it is. Complacent would be the one-word slogan. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that the filmmakers rent "Waiting for Guffman" a couple of times, or even "Blair Witch Project" if they want to follow the trend A bit more style and a bit more righteous feeling. Or at least entertainment value.
