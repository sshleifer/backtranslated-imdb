Zombie Planet seems to be an example of good ideas and commendable ambitions that exceed the budget. I found the explanation for the zombies really original and crisp, and I loved it when the dog chewed in the exposure scene. The rest of the rage worked in a low-budget manner, but was too far apart in the entire movie. The problem was that it was too long and carbon neutral. Sure, they had a fascinating, albeit derived, plotting line, and a similarly familiar, but cool attitude, but a low-budget zombie movie must be truly goretastic to make an impression, and there simply were not enough red moments in me , I think there was an excess of cheap-looking and bloodless fighting scenes, especially given the generally low cruelty. And for a two-hour movie, there's very little closing in the end, and though I somehow want to locate Zombie Planet 2, I felt a bit cheated. So it's worth looking for them.
