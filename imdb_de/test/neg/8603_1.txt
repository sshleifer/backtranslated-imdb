Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail had some crucial things to say about this film, including: "Look all the way through the miserable minutes, and I guarantee you shake your head and ask," Did we really go down? 'Yes, we did, because if ever a film has testified to the utter cynicism, tastelessness, and moral corruption of those who commission and produce British films, that is that abomination. "Tookey continues," headfirsted with unwashed underwear, dirty heads and knuckles grazing the cobblestones as they walk. This sex comedy is so shabby, unsightly and foul-smelling that it's enough to deny sex and movies for life. "Before he concludes that" Sex Lives of the Potato Men "is not just a really disgusting movie he is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant masturbation, jobbish and sadism now being celebrated on the screen. "I do not usually listen to critics too well, but in this case, Tookey has earned the money. This film goes beyond the bad, going beyond mere mischief and entering a bizarre parallel universe in which every painful minute lasts for an hour and the definition of "hilarious" seemingly "two in a brummie accent" seems to be. , It's depressing for anyone with half a brain who grew up with the goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, Not Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. <br /> <br /> Ideally, Sex Lives Of The Potato Men would have disappeared after his release and joined the equally bad Vix spin-off The Fat Slags (2004) and the poorly staffed All Saints vehicle Honest (2004). 2000) in the cemetery with celluloid, but since it is intended for endless nightly planning film screenings and misguided "Best movie ever!" rave about people who should know better, so I have to apologize in advance that they have tried to correct a wrong behavior that the British film industry in all its wisdom has done to an undeserved world. Yes, I'm really sorry to bring this back from the celluloid dead, but I actually remember thinking, "It can not be as bad as the critics say" ... but as God is my witness, it was BAD <br /> <br /> Drama - horrible from start to finish, especially mention of the legs of Albert Steptoe of Mackenzie on the body of a young man "Crook". <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - Cut and paste "Ladrock". The mostly ska-based, camp-lout-friendly pub-jukebox piffle brought back the horrible memories of seeing this chirpy cockernee at Lambeth Walk and a watered-down imitation of the specials button-shiner insanity on every single comedy / variety show. Program in the eighties ... and "Ace Of Spades" by Motorhead as theme music? What the hell ... trying to wake up memories of one of the most exciting scenes ever offered by The Young Ones, in fact ANY ever offered a comedy show ?! Cheap shot, far below the belt. <br /> <br /> script - written by a 12-year-old who has just read every last issue of Smut and Zit in a long Red Bull session ... SURELY? Come on, no real, real, worldly, adult person could put that kind of retarded Hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was there ... Mark Gatiss ... the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen and Goodies fans who has taken part in such a massive pile of troubled film exits? "One of Britain's Brightest Comedy Stars"? He is not anymore! On the subject of League Of Gentlemen, someone will give me some lead-based diving boots and Steve's face like a broken rectum 'Pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproof room before I die ... PLEASE ... <br /> <br /> Cinema British or otherwise is not much worse. Kent Bateman's The Headless Eyes (1971) is a masterpiece of the new wave compared to this disgusting dirt.
