Okay, I'm Singapore and I want to say that it's time to stop stereotyping Singapore and make such films. Some of the actors have talent but unfortunately not much was shown in this movie. I fidgeted in my seat as I watched. At that time I was still young, my parents dragged me along. Honestly, I could say that I would fall asleep. And there was this arrogant, weathered boy, who was just getting on my nerves. All in all a boring movie and a general waste of actors' talents. I have seen better singapore movies. Chicken Rice War was good. However, I can not believe this movie is a better Singaporean movie. Sorry, I would not recommend it.
