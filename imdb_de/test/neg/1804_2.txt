If you're looking for a movie that will make you sleep, Heart of Darkness is the movie for you. The book was not what I expected, and the movie disappointed me even further. The cast list was pitiful, and the plot was anything but a book, apart from a few scenes. I understand that everyone has their own point of view when reading Heart of Darkness, and that he creates his own movie in mind, but the director cuts important scenes and adds meaningless ones. If there was someone in the film who was supposed to be of a particular culture, he should have used an actor from that culture. There are actors from all over, and I'm sure they would have found better ones to match the roles. Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and created a book that entertains you when you look for it, but the film was cheap and futile and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book should have done. If you want a movie that draws you into the dark, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
