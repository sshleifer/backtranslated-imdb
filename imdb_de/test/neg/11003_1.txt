This movie is awful - honest. The acting is awful, the script frightened me, the effects are totally bad (which I usually do not mind in older movies, but that was done two years ago), and all that annoys me. A few friends go to the forest for Halloween and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, it has the stereotype "You really believe in it, Ha ha ha, it's just a story," which pulls out for a while. The witch's cannibal son has been left behind (I do not know if it's a comedy or to scare her, but this movie failed both). It has minimal blood and no nudity, which makes a bad movie even worse. The only good thing about this movie is the leg eating scene, and even that could be better. Honestly, do not even waste your time looking at it by cable, and certainly not considering buying or renting it, otherwise you'll be putting yourself out there to waste your time on something more constructive or entertaining Could spend funds.
