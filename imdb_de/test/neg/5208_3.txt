Nico Mastorakis' banned film was pretty disappointing in my opinion. The film is about a couple who go to a Greek island to kill all perverted people (apparently). You know, you've seen something pretty sick, when in one of the first scenes a guy has sex, who has sex with a goat and then kills him. <br /> <br /> But things are getting worse from that point on, as all the scenes look almost the same. They meet some people, so they either kill or have sex with them (preferably with both). <br /> <br /> The end is fine if the couple turns out to be a brother and sister and they let him rot somewhere but overall, you would have expected more. I have no substance here. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
