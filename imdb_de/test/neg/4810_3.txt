I can not believe that I actually bought this movie! It sucks! ... where I live Mexican movies Mexican movies are never advertised or even available ... you can not find them on regular rentals ... so I had to buy them ... I really like Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots and to my people, and they are much different than what you normally did ... but this was so predictable !!! You could guess what would happen ... I'm not a horrible movie! It just was not worth what I paid for it! yeah ... but if you have time and are really bored, then you should see it ... but if you love Mexican movies and love the theater itself, do not look, it will be painful! lol
