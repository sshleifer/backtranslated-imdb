I think this movie had a really bad production value. The lack of actors makes me think they should call it an early docudrama. Maybe he had no money available. I'm sorry it was a major league ride for Jackie Robinson. I think he was much better than many of his white players. He really had to be great to break the color barrier of the time. No bypassing that this was a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> I wish there was more information about the creators. Perhaps they were limited by the quality of the actors who were willing to take on the project. Maybe no money to get good people.
