Impressive. Not because of the 3-D images, which were sometimes used well to provide good depth images, but what a lame ending! The end of the film seems to implode on itself. This movie must be one of the dumbest movie monsters of all time and one of the most miserable attempts to explain it. The misogyny of this movie is also painful. If you are looking for a bad 1950s sci-fi movie to laugh about (also known as "bot-lining"), then look for it. Otherwise, look for better movies.
