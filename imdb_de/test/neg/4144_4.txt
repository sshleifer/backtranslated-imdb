I did not want to write this movie on the critics and critics in the western world. I mean, how wrong were you with Asian cinema, which has become a staple of the Hollywood remake monster? Plus Jet L is damn cool and he shot some interesting movies in Asia. I was surprisingly averaged by this movie averaged. <br /> <br /> There are good points. The story is very clever and uses M-Theory as a basis to advance the plot that there are multiple universes, each with its own versions of worlds, and most likely you too. Each time one of you is destroyed, the rest releases energy and power. The idea that someone might try to purposely become the only version of themselves in all universes to find out if they become a god. <br /> <br /> There's also Jet Li, and he's not a bad actor and a nimble martial artist and Jason Statham, a good all around actor. As for the special effects, some of them are really cool, a mixture of bullet time and slow motion at normal speed, which is very cool in places. <br /> <br /> The bad points? Well, Statham's accent is appalling, and some of the effects are not as compelling as others, so it's obvious that the money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably on screen as too short or just The budget was tight. <br /> <br /> A big painful point for me is the tight camera action that has long favored Hollywood, which Jackie Chan has often talked about. Close-ups of battle scenes serve two purposes. A single hit or movement is more emphasized, which looks harder and more real than it really is, and it also obscures what is going on around the camera lens. For example, people who hold a wrong arm or the face of a stunt double, etc. <br /> <br /> What Chan always said was that he tried to open the camera and show the audience what was going on, let them see People fight neatly instead of approaching from a face and a fist, with someone falling to the ground. It's more effective to show the whole thing, and it's more impressive. <br /> <br /> So the close-ups were more annoying than anything else, you did not see the impressive power of Li's fighting skills and it was hard for you to do this See some of the action. Slow the cuts and Panning the Camera Hollywood Directors out! The biggest problem, however, was the story. Despite their strong base on which to build, they seemed to lose sight of the plot and focus on the action scenes. There are some serious plot-building and explanatory moments that are completely overlooked and covered in a few sentences, but these could have led to an outstanding and complex character development. <br /> <br /> It also held everything together and it was not enough from history. All in all, not a great movie and its potential was greatly spoiled.
