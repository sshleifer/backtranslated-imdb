4 realz son my game iz mad tite yo i can not wait 2 get a stay and roll in da club on n real 905 style with crazy models n bottles, son! <br /> <br /> No, that's just fun. This is a sad show created by sad men for and for pleasure. Men who are neutered by modern existence so that they direct their frustration into the clubs, where they seek fleeting self-validation for chicks, in the hope of touching their little Viennese, to mitigate and even feel the sting of loneliness If only for one night, as if sitting on the board of the Sausage Party in Toronto would be less permanent. <br /> <br /> I read some comments here saying that this show represents Canadian television, which eventually puts itself on a par with American television or anything else. Well, that's not short at all. It's like, yes! Get on your back, Canada - you've finally cracked the elusive formula for groundbreaking American content like Studs, Change of Heart, Elimidate, and The Fifth Wheel. See, the real brainchild here brings "... meets Candid Camera" on the field. Genius. And there's nothing that bridges this thin line between camaraderie and latent homosexuality, like a group of grown men picking each other up with a hidden camera and admiring the other's "play" in the club. The man-love exhibited here is so palpable that they should really consider renaming it "Keys to the Steam Bath". <br /> <br /> How interesting that the people who gave it have received such glowing reviews as having registered an IMDb account for the express purpose (I guess it's my fault I did the opposite here. My personal favorite is the enthusiastic reviewer who claims to be from the United States. "It's clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to produce American-quality television." <br /> <br /> Smooth. <br /> <br /> But why even the online buzz production? You can not really cancel it - you're on the comedy network in Canada, baby! The audience will ignore your show for years to come. In all likelihood, you'll feel comfortable traveling comfortably along the proverbial level of mediocrity with the majority of Comedy Network's original programs.
