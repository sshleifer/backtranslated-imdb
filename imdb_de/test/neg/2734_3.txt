It seems that the script has been borrowed from a certain other film (um, cough, cough) using a self-propelled manned drill. Scene by scene, the two films were almost identical. Just enough of the serial numbers filed here to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, I have to say that I found this a little entertaining as I like deep-underground-in-the-gen genre of movies. As far as science is concerned, it's a bit stupid, but if you're willing to really pinch your eyes and pretend that you have not noticed that here and there and everywhere science prevails, this movie is almost bearable , Far better than "Supernova," another film in which Luke Perry starred so stupidly stupidly stupid that nothing could save her. A note to filmmakers: Hire someone who knows something about the subject the movie is about. It would be a very small part of the film budget, but it would altogether help prevent your audience ridiculing you for stupid science. <br /> <br /> Production values: almost passable. I have seen far worse in my time. <br /> <br /> A New Thing for Disaster Movies: Instead of always having a happy ending to save the world again, how about some where things are a bit more realistic, sometimes even more the best efforts are doomed to failure. Especially if the problem to be solved was caused primarily by sheer stupidity. Stupidity-induced disaster films with glowing, heart-warming ends justify stupidity by saying, "No matter how terrible a problem is with Braindead stupidity, it can be fixed." Which is definitely not the case. A self-made catastrophe film with an unfortunate ending would rather serve as a warning fairy tale of "Do not be so damn stupid from the outset". Should you watch this movie? If you are bored and have seen anything else in the sci-fi area at your local video store, you will not know why. But avoid "supernova" as I can assure you that you are NOT bored. This was definitely not one of Luke Perry's better films. This one is better. That does not say much, but it's better. <br /> <br /> A dead hoof, a profound genre movie. A dead hoof because he was ripped off the script of another particular movie of the same genre.
