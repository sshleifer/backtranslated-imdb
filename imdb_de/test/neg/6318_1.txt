I was 19 years old in 1970 when it came out, and when I found out how funny it was when it came out and read the reviews here, I finally rented it and looked at it. I did not laugh once - a very listless movie - and I usually love Reiner. I can not imagine why that is so funny. I had not a single giggle. And I love comedies! Well, at least now I know what the shouting was about. Not my idea of ​​a comedy. Rent the Navigator or the Love Nest of Buster Keaton - now are the classics of comedy! If you rent these, you have a replacement rent, so the whole evening is no loss. Score 3 out of 10
