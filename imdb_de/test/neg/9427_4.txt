An anonymous movie that could be directed by anyone at all. Where is Anthony Mann, the director of classics like "El Cid", "The Naked Spur" or "The Man of Laramie"? <br /> <br /> There are wonderful shots of planes in the clouds, which are lovingly filmed. The story is very banal and almost without any dramatization. The couple lives an almost everyday life, and the user, complaining about June Allyson's decision for wife IMHO, misses it completely. With her less attractive looks, husky voice, she was the perfect housewife who needed the script. Back then, women were barefoot and pregnant: there is not a single woman among the core workers, even at the desk jobs - all they had to do was worry about their Hubbies fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never heard but in 1955 it was not hard to guess. <br /> <br /> wonders why a young person who has never seen a man movie should choose this movie from all his great movies.
