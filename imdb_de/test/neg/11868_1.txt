At first glance I have to say: The Contractor 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and a more dramatic action. <br /> <br /> The detonator has a terrible plot focused on a kind of nuclear bomb that plays in Romania and is terribly directed for an action movie - it's not exciting moments and an action movie gets bored. <br /> <br /> Really, what do you expect from Wesley Snipes when offered terrible scripts like this one? Do not blame him, he needs the money. <br /> <br /> This was the first impression when I saw the movie 3 years ago. But I will never see it again. Screw it. It sucks. There. I said it. <br /> <br /> PS: I do not think I ever said in an IMDb review, "This movie is shit". Thank you, detonator!
