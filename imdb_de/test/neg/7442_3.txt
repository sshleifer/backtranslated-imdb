Unfortunately, producers do not know when to go alone or are recycled to the point where every rubbish that Hollywood produces is displayed in Alpo. It seems every science fiction action adventure movie has to go through a sad list of episodes, and Robocop is a tragic example. The first movie, directed by Paul Verhoven, was a wild, stylish ride and even found time for some social commentary on what the dark side of biotechnology is able to do us. This movie has none of this, except that it may tell us that drugs are bad for you and could make you do things you would regret if you're sober. Robocop 2 lacks the vision, the most frightening vision of what we are becoming, and instead leads us awkwardly into a boat trip in the way that foul-smelling drug traffickers and their victims really are. Social commentary is damned. He really bit the big guy for me. If you only care about the SFX, go to her, my friend. Do not waste any time with this yeast-free sour cake and keep the exactly measured, heavily loaded pumpernickel of the first film hot from the oven. As simple as that.
