The new groove of the Emperor was a great turn for Disney. It was not a musical! It had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. It was just a damn funny movie. <br/> <br /> Kronk's New Groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. My 3 year old still loves Emperor's New Groove, but fell asleep during Kronk's. There really is no conflict (leading to all the crazy adventures in the first movie). Because of the lack of conflict, it seems that the animators are kicking out the writers and making the plot just as they move on. , , and I am still.
