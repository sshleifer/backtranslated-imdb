Although my confrontation with world cultures is limited, I try it. This was a movie that I tried and hated. Worst of all, when I heard that so many people despise the superficiality of typical Hollywood dishes and their stereotypical caricatures, I saw that too immense characters for "Eastenders" were portrayed as realistic. Clint wants out of drug life and he wants to be a waiter. To aim high, I always say. It's hard to say that Brad Dorif, or a faxed photo of him, or possibly a curly wig on a stick, offers Clint's offer when he gets a pair of shoes. Clint, and a huge entourage, are apparently wandering all over England trying to get him shoes. Finally, they end up in a suburban home. Whose is not clear. Mom helps a girl to shoot. Oh, now there is realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha find a vein. Good God! Dad comes home and sings some Elvis songs and chases the kids away. <br /> <br /> Why did not Clint borrow money and buy shoes at a second hand store? Why did not he go to church and ask a friendly nun for help? Why was not he hanging in front of a shoe store and pan handle? I just do not know! None of these things seemed to be below him. Benevolent groups like Goodwill and the Salvation Army have businesses to help people. I know people who work there! If someone showed up without money and needed shoes, the staff would give the person some shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some form of foot covering. Not many of these groups distribute cell phones to the needy, but shoes are usually not a problem. What a stupid concept. The world or at least the west is just not that cruel. In England, it may be more of "The Queen's Royal Charity" than goodwill, but the people who need shoes get them. <br /> <br /> Apart from looking for shoes, there was no apparent plot conspiracy. Not that it made the movie faster or more bearable. Although I had checked the band jacket several times, I did not look at the 20-hour version, it just seemed that way. <br /> <br /> Did Clint get his shoes? Has Brad Dourif's cardboard cutout set him up in the restaurant? Have I ever seen something alien again? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes and yes. <br /> <br /> As for the fate of this movie, I decided to finish it all. I took out my S & W .45 and shot half a inch through the cassette. Blammo! (I made sure I rewound it first.) I put it back in the adhesive tape case, gave it back in the rental business, and, surprisingly, did NOT call ONE ONLY !!! Of course, that means no one else has rented it for the remaining three years that I lived in this city. Others knew something that I did not know. Live and learn. By the way, if you're renting something you've never seen before, and someone actually pulled a bullet, take it as a sign. And if you work in the video department of Kroger, I'm just kidding. <br /> <br /> Footnote: This classic still has to see the light of the day on DVD, for which we should be eternally grateful to the digital gods.
