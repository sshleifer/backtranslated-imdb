If you want a complete waste of time, if you pull lint from your navel, clean the wax out of your ears, or trowel your tiles, this is your idea of ​​a carnival part that you should not miss. For one thing, forget the VHS coverage. NO body looks so attractive in this movie (ie the Indian). Someone else commented that the one who posed for the cover is not the same girl, and I agree. The cover is the most exciting thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> To put it in perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds into the movie, I knew I had been demolished. <br /> <br /> I was done with this because 1) I paid 99 cents after all and 2) it could have been possible that a scene in this turkey might have been more successful than a trapped bread. <br /> <br /> There was not. <br /> <br /> Good grief, Fonda. I know you've had a hard time on roles when you did this, but it's up to you.
