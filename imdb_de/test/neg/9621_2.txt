"MirrorMask" was a very disappointing movie for me. I had expected a lot from a Jim Henson production and had found cheap reviews compared to "The Labyrinth" and "Alice In Wonderland". Unfortunately, the film ended up in one of those "style over substance" piles of movies. <br /> <br /> While most children dream of running away from home to join a circus, Helena is a kid who grew up in Europe a circus (child labor, anyone?) who wants to run away to join the real life. Helena wishes that her mother is dead, which is a bad step for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a child's fantasy movie. The next thing you know, Helena's mother flutters and for some reason she is suddenly transferred to another world. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I felt as if I was brought to the Museum of Contemporary Art with a pair of foggy, sepia-colored glasses. <br /> <br /> The showcase with CGI-generated creatures and backdrops was interesting at first and I liked the Orbiting Giants. After a few minutes it got a little tiring and I felt my thoughts wandering ... <br /> <br /> Without a sense of narrative and clips and soundtracks in MTV style (the sphinxes reminded me of Basement Jaxx's "" Where is your head with "), I did not feel involved in the plight of the protagonist and also frustrated, as we waited for the film to lead us where it wanted to go, hopefully in the direction of the" Exit "sign Theater ...
