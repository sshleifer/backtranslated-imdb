Bad political actor. Badly photographed, acted and directed. Each scene is underexposed, including the few that are recorded during the day. It does not matter where the location is. At an important White House conference, no lights are on, and the only available light is a bleak blue filtered through a few windows. The Chinese Prime Minister makes an earthquake telephone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should think about a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting. Honestly. It's like he has a tiny spotlight on his face and would otherwise be in total darkness. The slow motion deaths are now compulsory in any ill-conceived movie. Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo are doing well, but Scheider is rarely seen on screen. The other ideas are to be rejected. There is a pretty oriental woman in a short, tight skirt who wears a gun and comes straight from a Bond movie. The accent points to a childhood in Basset, Nebraska, which should remain the model that she probably started. Anyone who plays the surviving intelligence agent aboard the cruise ship was probably selected for the role because it most closely resembles Johnny Depp, not for talent. The Chinese villains, representing both Taiwan and mainland China, hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty awful and gets recycled from other, better movies. Onboard the ship is fired a lot, and practically all of them are hauling minced meat. Two-thirds of the passage explodes the ship into the expected array of fireballs. Then the movie divides into two coherent parts. First part, another shootout, this time in a warehouse on the water. The second part, an exchange between the Vice President, who is now in office, and the oily Chinese premiere, was removed from "Dr. Strangelove" and "Fail Safe." We unintentionally launch our rockets. They start their as retaliation. We can not convince them that shooting was random, even if we help them destroy our own missiles. There is even General George C. Scott / Walter Matthau, who believes that their "nuclear" armory can not agree with ours. That's why we should meet them with everything we have. More fireballs. <br /> <br /> The end is not too early.
