I was in this film as an extra in the Dallas filming in July 1975. Some of the things you see today that are natural to filmmaking have been implemented in this film. The film premise, the costumes, the special effects, the drama. Everything was ahead of its time. It opened the door for movies like "Star Wars", "Terminator", "Matrix" and "X-Men". Now people look at it and say, "Well, that does not fit into this new special effect story ..." She did not have computer graphics and how they make the new films today. It had a story, a wonderful cast and a damn director! The places where it was filmed were the World Trade Center of Dallas, the Zale Building and the Ft. Worth Water Gardens was the most modern and futuristic setting to shoot in those days. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was affected by human desires and ailments. It was my first movie experience, the first of six films I have ever been to. Just because he was filmed in Texas, he is no less a wonderful piece of filmmaking. Take a look again and appreciate it more. This film was the foundation for many great films that we now enjoy. Well, my hand is flashing ... I have to run. Christmas time awaits ...
