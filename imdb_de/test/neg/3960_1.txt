This adorable dog (in the movie different names) is apparently loved by the whole city ... but he is alone. He is friends with two children (Cindy and Paul played amazingly bad), but her dad does not let her have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - another adorable dog. They fall in love (at once) and it leads to a hysterical montage of the two, who are frolicking in the grass and drinking from a fountain ... in slow motion no less! Benji also lives in the cleanest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then the two kids are kidnapped and hiding from the most awkward, clumsiest kidnappers I've ever seen - right in the house where Benji lives! <br /> <br /> WOW was so bad! A big hit (for some reason) in 1974 that led to many sequels (which I will NOT see). The movie is just horribly played with "humor" that is so insipid and badly made that you just gawk at the TV in amazement. The film also has a song that NONSTOP plays during the movie - so much so that you want to scream. It was inexplicably nominated for the best song at the Oscars - it did not win. Yes - the dogs are adorable and much better than the human performers - but I need more than cute dogs to interest me but I've seen it with my 5 year old nephew. Within 20 minutes he got bored and stopped looking. I kept looking in the hope that it would get better - it did not. Really lousy - but VERY patient children or dog lovers might like it. <br /> <br /> Note for parents: It's a rating of G, but a dog is brutally kicked a few times. You do not see it - you just hear it and the dog survives, but that could bother real children.
