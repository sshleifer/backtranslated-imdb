Directed by Diane Keaton and based on a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother, Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell), is struggling against a very serious illness, and her self-proclaimed inventor husband Sid (John Tururro) is a bit too weak in the emotion department. Sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) is dissatisfied with the new home and decides to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mother is fine. Steven seems to be happier and even interested in the habits of his strange uncle. He even decides to change his name to Franz. In the early '60s, this drama is a bit weird ... change that too crazy. BUMPER HEROES is not a fan of MacDowell and assures me of my attitude. Although I liked the movie, it is not a total waste.
