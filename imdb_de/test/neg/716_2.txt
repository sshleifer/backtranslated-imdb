Of all the Perry Mason films I've seen since 1985, this film is my most unpopular. <br /> <br /> I admit I never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress. She just seems to know how to play a certain character - a hard-bitten career woman with an undefined chip on her shoulder, which is why it's extremely hard to sympathize with her in any way. This is no exception - it is true to educate yourself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this movie is, in my opinion, a serious effort by Scott Baio as a prosecutor, and the movie is worth watching for him alone.
