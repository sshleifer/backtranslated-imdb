There are some people who complain that this is NOT the opera, but they do not argue with the movie by CABARET, which was not the original show either. All movies of musicals / operas are and must be "adaptations" or do not work. CABARET has taken more liberty with the original show than the PORGY AND BESS movie, yet it has retained its original integrity, reworked the material, and has been judged an artistic achievement. The same applies to PORGY AND BESS - she has reworked the opera into a dialogue / lyrics libretto because the audience loved musicals at that time, but kept away from the few operas filmed in real life. For Preminger it would have been an economic suicide to produce a film about the opera - for the Goldwyn Studios it would have lost a fortune. <br /> <br /> That is, this is a good match. The drama is excellent, Andre Previn's Oscar winning score is great, as well as the choir singing, and the individual vocal performances are incredible. Robert McFerrin (father of pop musician Bobby McFerrin) named Porgy and Adele Addison Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his own songs in the film, his recording contract did not allow his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album. That's why Cab Calloway (spectacularly) recorded his numbers for this release. Brock Peters' bass / baritone is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is her own unique piece. Diahann Carroll, though a fine singer, has the small role of Clara, who demanded a high soprano, so that Marni Nixon, the old singer, has baptized her vocals. The Gershwin Estate hates the film and refuses to grant the film any musical rights, though the dramatic rights are public. This type of hate feud sustained CAROUSEL's video release for nearly fifteen years (though in this case the dramatic rights were in litigation) and currently prevents both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE YOUR GUN from being released on video. <br /> <br /> Of all the stage productions that are shown in movie versions, the latter are the only ones exposed to video. Only a letter campaign to the Gershwin Estate in New York could loosen the reserve.
