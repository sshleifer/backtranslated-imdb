The acting was terrible. Although the special effects were extraordinary, they dominated the movie. The writing was pathetic and the dialogue was incredible. And the stupid little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was wrong. <br /> <br /> But the worst offense of "Armageddon" was the total lack of scientific reality. "The asteroid is the size of Texas," says Billy Bob Thornton. Uh, that's 800 miles wide! Nobody in NASA sees the asteroid until a meteor shower devastated in New York. Suuuuure NASA hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and train them in a week? Yes exactly. Someone bring a weapon on the space shuttle? Yes, that's realistic. And Bruce Willis blows up the asteroid in three seconds. Like Disney-esque! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I was rooting for the asteroid!
