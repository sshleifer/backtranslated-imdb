This is my first review on IMDb and I am glad that the default rating is 1 in 10, because then I do not have to change anything. <br /> <br /> First, there are horrible movies. Movies that make you laugh, like Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. That is perfectly acceptable. They make a big party enhancer. Then there is the worst movie ever. I can not believe how stupid this steaming pile of dog feces was. <br /> <br /> I found it in a second-hand store on VHS and quickly bought it because I like sci-fi, terminator, post-apocalypse and so on. Everything on the boxing art was very promising , Then I quickly loaded the tape when I got home, and first I noticed ... WHAT? There may have been 10 minutes (or more) of switching between existing clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that make you sick. And it goes on and on again. Then there are some "acting" and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this abomination of humanity actually exists ... And then I realized that there are actually two setbacks. I did not think about it first, but the title says "3" ... And I was horrified. But when I actually watched it with great pain and agony until the end, I thought nothing would ever make me worse for me and this universe ... But then a little text with the inscription ... "Next ... "and ... NEMESIS 4?!?!?! NO PLEASE NO !!!!!!!!
