From the terrible special effects, I was totally stunned by how bad someone can make a movie. Let's just say, I have absolutely no directing experience and for the first time, when I saw a movie, I thought: I can be better than that! while watching this dad. The acting in this movie was awful, I think the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man, but the Frenchman from Aliens3 was so wooden that I wondered how he got the previous job. The plot was mediocre and I think, like most movies, if the rest had been done well, he would have gotten up. I usually do not write reviews here, but after seeing some people rated this movie with a good rating (cast / crew must be), I felt I had to say my piece to save someone who accidentally stopped or wasted his money cacking
