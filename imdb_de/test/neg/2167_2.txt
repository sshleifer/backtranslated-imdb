"Tales from the Crapper" is bloody, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, low and skatological. But that's fine, I was prepared for anything I had done from my previous Troma experiences. I was NOT prepared for it to be funny, listless and boring. The true anarchist spirit of films like "Class of Nuke'em High" has been little preserved. instead, we get ENDLESS fart jokes (to the point that you wonder if Lloyd Kaufman becomes senile, and think adults are farting so fart so weird!) and a cynical, shameless exploitation of the viewer, essentially Investing time and money to see a "movie" that even Kaufman himself seems to know has not been released at all. Oh yeah, there's a lot of female nudity to be seen, but let's face it, the average porn movie probably offers a better plot, higher production values, funny humor and, above all, more RESPECT to the intended viewer than this cruelty. <br /> <br /> P.S: Kelly Powers AKA Suzi Lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the section "How to make her own movie") is one of the most beautiful women I have ever met.
