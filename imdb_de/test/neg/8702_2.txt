I know it's very hard to live the first The 10 Commandments movie (who was great and not a Charleton Heston fan in person), but wow ... this movie / mini series was disappointing. Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that got me down was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, the version of Paul Rhys just seemed so weak and Pharoh-like. The acting was really not that great. For a modern adaptation I expected something better. It just did not look as stunning as the first. I think they had a tight budget or something. There are occasional speakers I found strange and unnecessary. It also broke the flow of history. And um ... God's voice / lines were kind of weird.
