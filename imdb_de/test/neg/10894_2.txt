This film is about a young couple who have gone off to start a new life in LA, which is eventually followed by a psycho at a deserted rest area. Actually, it's really just about the girl (Nicole), because her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. The movie is extremely fast and one wonders early on how he could extend his story to length. It does not take long for you to realize that the movie is doing this by simply wasting time on unnecessary scenes that go nowhere. <br /> <br /> The story is not just paper-thin, it's unstructured, stupid and incoherent. Minutes after the disappearance of her friend and car Nicole finds a mobile home at the service area. She sees the flash of a camera and knows there are people in the house, but she easily gives up trying to get her help if nobody knocks on her door. After finding out from the killer that her boyfriend is in danger, she walks around the truck stop doing all kinds of stupid and unnecessary things. This includes having a TV turned on (and even looking amused when she thinks she has encountered a pornographic film even in this terrible situation), sitting around, wandering and drinking for hours from a bottle of brandy. She does KNOW that her friend has been kidnapped, that the killer is still going and persecuting her, and taking no action to ensure her immediate safety (she does not bother closing the doors or being watchful) stay). Oh yes, she's trying to call for help with the aid of a radio, but why bother if there's a mobile home with people at the truck stop? It seems that the scriptwriter forgot this important fact when writing this part of the story. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of entrapment or omnipresent danger in this story. The heroine wanders freely in and around the various buildings of the rest area, and the killer enters only occasionally to scare them before he leaves. There's nothing that keeps Nicole from simply getting off (even if the rest area is far from anywhere else, it's better than sitting around), but she decides to stay anyway. At a certain point in the movie, the main character even acknowledges that she can run, but not. The story goes nowhere and instead jumps from a pointless segment to a pointless segment. Nicole eventually enters the mobile home and it turns out that the residents are a family of protected, presumably innate or psychotic religious fanatics. They purposely seem ignorant or careless of the killer's actions (but there is no indication that they are in any way related to him) and kick Nicole out of the race after a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In the next irrelevant section The main character wanders into the bathroom building. She discovers one of the killer's former victims (a young woman named Tracy) who is still alive and locked in a closet. For some strange reason, Tracy begins to vomit ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole gets a crowbar to open the closet door, and when she returns a minute later, both Tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without explanation. What was the point? Nicole finds a wall with many missing persons and sees that Tracy had disappeared in 1971. Was Tracy a ghost or something? The writer never makes an explanation. <br /> <br /> Next, a police officer shows up in the middle of the night to occupy the police office at the rest area, which was previously unattended throughout the day. Nicole tells him what's going on, and when the killer drives in front of the office in his truck, the policeman goes outside to face him. What does the policeman do when he knows that something is seriously wrong? He goes upstairs and talks calmly to the killer (who was even told by Nicole that he was the boy who chased her) and buys the murderer's lie that he just passes through and needs directions. Serious. The policeman is talking to Nicole outside, completely unaware, when the pickup turns around and drives him over. The cop quickly starts telling Nicole that he is a jerk who is "happy to breathe", but he still is strangely, does not die for quite a while. The two talk a bit more senselessly, and the all-important fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned too long. When the two finally try to use the weapon, Nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets, which blindly shoot at a door when the killer may be behind it. After two bullets are left, the policeman asks Nicole to use one to put him to sleep. She shoots one in the mouth and he lays down for a few moments, a piece being blown out of his head. Then he suddenly and inexplicably screams, "You've missed!" and she has to shoot him again. Quite cheap shock test. Nicole finally confronts the murderer and fails. The film ends with a scene that does not last long, and a woman reaches the now strangely much more active rest area. In the bathroom building she hears Nicole in the closet screaming for help (locked up like Tracy). It makes a cop go in and check it, but he finds a seemingly normal and clean cabinet. The policeman leaves and thinks he was tricked. A troubled Nicole comes from behind some boxes in the closet (she would have been easily detected if the policeman had searched every ten seconds), apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the cop was there. WOW. <br /> <br /> This movie is apparently the first in a new line of "high-quality" direct-to-DVD movies that are considered too extreme for cinemas. In reality, it's just more cliche, B-movie garbage.
