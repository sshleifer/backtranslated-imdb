Despite a completely misleading advertising campaign, this film proves to be an irritating stereotypical, submerged house film with a completely implausible end. Note # 1 for anyone considering seeing this turkey: Sam Raimi has not judged him. Although commercials for the film play his part, he is actually one of four producers. It's too bad that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be associated with such a bad movie. I do not think he would have ever directed such a thing; This task was left to the Pang brothers. <br /> <br /> The script for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other "horror" movies, so you'll find absolutely zero original content in "The Messengers". "What we get is a scene here and there that was torn right out of 'Pulse,' a couple that could have come from 'The Birds,' one or two from 'The Others,' and so on. Almost every scene, almost every line Dialogue is one that has been picked up by any number of other films, making it so predictable that almost anyone can figure out the "end of surprise" long before it comes. <br /> <br /> This is exactly where it should be Good time to point out that advertising is being done The campaign, which focuses on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this film - in fact, anyone can see the ghosts Mother figures certainly see them early on in the film, and I'm sure the one in charge of marketing created this campaign because the film needed a unique perspective to work at the box office, which would otherwise be completely wrong Well, you know, so do not be fooled! What this film lacks most is perhaps something akin to the chemistry between the actors. It just is not there. All interactions are awkward. Paired with the hackneyed story and the ridiculous pothole holes (what does a guy who murdered his entire family still do in the small town where the murder took place - in any case, to a profoundly unsatisfactory ghost movie that has been with anyone for over ten years cheap blows can surprise: loud noises, visual flashes and anything but a figure jumping out of a cupboard and "boo!" All we get this time for our money is another badly made movie about ghosts trying to Keeping people away from a home If there's a message that "The Messengers" delivers, it's "Do not waste your time on this movie."
