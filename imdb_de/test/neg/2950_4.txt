1. viewed 18.02.2007 - 4 von 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): Fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of Moby Dick, the famous Herman Melville. This film is about the captain of a ship who stole the eyes (the extremely rare black pearls) of a native tribe's god sculpture and hid them in a place that only he knew before leaving Tivi Island. He became very ill and was on a secret journey to return to the island to fetch the pearls for himself, while others (like his daughter) thought he would return to be treated by the local medicine man. Others did not know the reason for the trip. A stowaway actually knew the true reason for the journey - to return the eyes to her god. The stupid part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue, and the natives had eyes all the time over their tribe without their god eyes (causing them all kinds of problems). Along the way, we are (for some reason) fought a short underwater nature show with an electric eel against a native octopus (I think only Herman Melville knows what it is all about). Once they have reached the island, the captain dies, but passes the whereabouts of the pearls on to his daughter, but she also gets the bane of the disease. One of the bad guys finds out where the god is housed and persuades the daughter to go there and steal the pearls, but at this point the good guys learn what's going on and a fight ensues. I will tell you neither the results of the fight nor the end, I leave it to you to find out if you want. As I said earlier, the movie was fine, but some very stupid things I mentioned earlier have mitigated the impact. I'm wondering if this new "Pirates of the Caribbean" got anything from this plot - hmm? Black pearls, a curse (I'm wondering). Well, it does not matter, these elements did not make a very good movie in this or the other case. It seems like they are learning that they are a lesson, but since the money is spent on this newer movie, I'm sure they will not. Well.
