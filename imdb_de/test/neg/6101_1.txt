And again, Columbia Pictures decides to just "hash" by using the original version with Curly and without the jokes or jokes! Towards the end of this wretched strip, as Joe gets stuck in the bull, the studio did not even bother to re-record the sound, because if you listen carefully, you can still make Curly here with "Woo woo woo woo". Although Moe and Larry throw the darts to "slow the bull so he can get out," this is off the original, as Moe and Larry actually appear "magically" fifteen years younger. Why, oh why did Moe allow it all? It's a burning question that probably can never be answered because, as far as I know, in real life he was quite critical of any kind of criticism and had pretty high standards for his work, as did Larry, Curly and Shemp. Do not waste your time with it.
