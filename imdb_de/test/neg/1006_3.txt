I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando. The box I would sell for $ 2 at a flea market with all the videos. The story is about the main character who has returned from the success of previous films to ruin everything with this garbage. Why did the creators with this cheap garbage want to destroy the reputation of the last 2 films. The story is so lame that it had to be an outrageous sequel. I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same mood that a man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without scratching. Both this movie and Cobra wanted to show how the hero fires his rifles at waist height and the enemy falls in large numbers. Police officers spend hours at the shooting range, so why were they gunned down by gang members shooting aimlessly from their hips? This movie was so bad that for a minute I thought it was Death Wish 4.
