Robert Altman's "Quintet" is a dark, grim, hard-to-understand thriller that you finally give up after awhile because it's so complicated. By the end of the picture, it was less than a quarter full. I've never experienced such a mass exodus without an emergency that drove people out. That should tell you how bad it is. I think this is the worst movie ever shot with such great talent in front of and behind the camera.
