I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not like his singing either. But his songs are madness in India, especially among the citizens. Well, when he dared to become an actor? that was a big joke! What courage must he reap as much as possible in his best time. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing has changed. The movie becomes a super super hit! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor's cash register collection of 14 Crores raked? compared to Apne, who has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. If I can sit through Apne and Rajnikant's absurd Sivaji? I should also give this movie a try to understand what made this movie so great. The story is about the real singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR), who went to Germany for a concert and falls in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). A German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now Himesh is arrested for murder. The mission of Himesh (in the last 40 minutes), after escaping from prison, is to prove himself innocent and find the real killer. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. He tries, but fails miserably. He's pathetic I was thinking about what could have made the movie so hard to click? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First, the saving grace of the film is the script to the point where Himesh escapes from prison. (But then the movie nose jumps into unbearable stupid boundaries.) Second, the songs in the movie are good, catchy numbers that attract viewers. Third, Mallika Sherawat? she looks beautiful and behaves well as a second wife. I imagine Mallika fans will only see the movie for them. Fourth, is the movie's cinematography pleasant? Especially the German locations are a feast for the eyes. Fifth, the main part of the story is a love story between Himesh and Riya. with Clichedian dialogues, which would probably connect with young people. Sixth, director Prashant Chadha has done a decent job to cover Himesh's pathetic acting abilities as well as possible with shots in which Himesh has little to do. The heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a movie heroine on a budget. Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role. Overall, the film is below average. <br /> <br /> I have been thinking throughout the movie ?? What if the same script was created with Salmaan as the lead actor? I think it would have been a much better thing. Maybe then I would have given the movie 6 out of 10. But now ?? (Stars 4.5 out of 10)
