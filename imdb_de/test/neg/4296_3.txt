Has taken the chance to see if a really good movie from the First World War has lost my attention - that's not it. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are both stiff in their acting. The dialogue is silent or absent; The flying sequences are okay, but pretty repetitive. Compared to the grandiose "Blue Max" this movie should never have been made. Take a look at George Peppard, James Mason and Usula Andress at the BM and find out why this movie is one of the best war movies ever made, and that's not it. Released recently on DVD, Richtofen and Brown are presented as a great "lost classic" from the 70s. I sold mine again the day after purchase. Do not waste your time or $.
