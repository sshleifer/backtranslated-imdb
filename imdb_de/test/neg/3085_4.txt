I saw this movie in the middle as he went through a breakup. It was about three o'clock in the morning and I struggled with a quick snack for insomnia. It was not that bad at the time, but every time I try to see it since, I can not get involved the way I did that night. <br /> <br /> At the time I thought it was cute and I loved the variety of characters, although in my opinion they were absolutely better than Goran V. But the only thing that had been watching me was Heather's character and her sad "commitment" to her husband, who no longer wanted her, which at the same time saddened her and made me responsible for her. (Considering that I was in a similar situation at the time, maybe I like them so much.) Not a bad movie, but you have to be pretty romantic near the character to appreciate it, and let us hope you never come.
