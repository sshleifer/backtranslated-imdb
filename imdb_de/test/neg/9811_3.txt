The Slaughter Trail is a western B with big claims. But it has landed in the history of Hollywood for a very unworthy reason. <br /> <br /> If you look at this movie with its score that can only be described as presumptuous, I have the feeling that Howard Hughes was trying to recruit a movie singing cowboy for RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt, as reliable as he ever was, but he was not a singer. I think Hughes saw how much money Herbert J. Yates brought to Roy Rogers in Republic and decided that he would get one too. <br /> <br /> So Terry Gilkyson, who was a very good performer and a much better song The writer was recruited and sang some of his material that was not his best and worse. It looked like they were shoes in the picture. Worse yet, there is this annoying chorus that sings a lot of the story and honestly overwhelms the actors, the extras and even the horses. Needless to say, Terry was never a singing cowboy. However, he wrote classics like The Bare Necessities and Dean Martin's big hit, Memories are Made of This. The plot is about an insider on a stagecoach jewel robbery. That's right, the Outlaws of Gig Young, Myron Healey and Ken Koutnik, who have Virginia Gray on board as a passenger on board, whom she experiences carrying precious jewels. <br /> <br /> It's a great act that Gray and Young bring with them. Young takes her away from the carriage, presumably a worse fate than death, and they play the scene right within earshot of the passengers, but what he does is that she drops her prey. As the last point, the authorities could look, if they do not run away with it. <br /> <br /> But when they flee from the raid, they are on tired horses, so they stop in a cabin to take some spare mounts and shoot three Navajos who oppose that brings back the Navajos on the warpath. It did not help that one of the victims was the brother of Chief Ric Roman. <br /> <br /> This is the situation that Captain Brian Donlevy deals with in the Fort when the Trainer and The Outlaws meet there for protection. How everything works out is predictable, but in an overproduced way. <br /> <br /> Actually that's the problem with Slaughter Trail. It's a simple, uncomplicated B western that has been made into something almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real reason why Slaughter Trail went down in history is that this movie marks the official beginning of the blacklist. Originally, Howard DaSilva was supposed to play Donlevy's role and could have actually completed his scenes when Howard Hughes officially dismissed him for communist sympathies. His scenes were shot entirely with Brian Donlevy in the lead role. <br /> <br /> Considering the fiasco of this movie, I'm not sure if Donlevy or DaSilva should have thanked Hughes or kicked him out in the movie.
