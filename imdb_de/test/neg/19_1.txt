This movie can not be serious because it has a nerd-looking kid named Curtis who kills people. The other two psycho kids are kind of cute, but Curtis' kid is just so ugly because he's wearing those huge, brown, ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to the vengeance of the nerds. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really hate about this movie is that Curtis spends his sweet time filming people. I kept my finger on the fast-forward button because it took too long and what was going on with his voice. He sounded like fourteen, not ten. Another thing I hated was that he always smiled like an idiot and that did not make sense. Then they put the annoying child in the freezer and somehow found a flashlight there. That did not make any sense, nor did the music. The music did not match any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch another movie on your birthday.
