The film is easily entertaining, if one does not acknowledge the numerous inconsistencies of the conspiracy and the lack of credibility. Bruce Willis as "The Jackal" never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld. Instead, he frolics in broad daylight and shows a mish-mash of modest disguises. Why this man was never caught (or even identified) is not mine. The audience is not even impressed by his cleverness or bravery; Considering the price he charges for his services ($ 70 million exorbitant), his methods are extremely cheap and stupid. <br /> <br /> Those who persecute him are at least as ridiculous. They show no sense of skill, but rely on half-baked guesses, which they pull at will through the country. Unbelievable, these far-fetched assumptions (maybe he's bought a boat, maybe he's in Chicago, etc, etc.) always lead them directly to the Jackal, who escapes his clumsy grasp. Richard Gere, whose Irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station, plays the inexplicable role of a jailed detainee who is released from prison to work alongside the FBI. He is actually a compatible partner just because his means are as amateurish and incompetent as his colleagues. At one point, he does confront the infamous Jackal, but the FBI can not trust him enough to keep him out of sight, but he can not equip him with a weapon or any other means of communication. What kind of surgery are you running here? <br /> <br /> The film also seems to rely too much on cruel violence, which is completely superfluous and does not cause any tension. The allegedly stolen Jackal looks more like a denied and meaningless serial killer who makes people out of sports with sports and writes with blood on the cheek of the victim. <br /> <br /> The film's action scenes are predictable and unrealistic, and many moments are ruined with melodrama. This film is performed poorly on many levels, with the only point of light being the consistent Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think. <br /> <br />
