A giant praying mantis is awakened from her sleep in the Artic region and moves south to cause chaos. Boats, planes and trains collide with the flying creature. Before the NYC uprising unleashes its full fury, the mantis meets its fate in the hands of the armed forces in a New York tunnel. The special effects are of course crude by today's standards, but for a ten-year-old boy in 1957 this was very memorable. The main roles were William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway.
