And also a wonderful start, a quick start. It keeps you eager and waits for it to come. Unfortunately, the high level of adrenaline dries up quickly, but half of the movie is sure to be over. <br /> <br /> And it's a pity, because this movie has really good ideas and researches a lot of them thoroughly. But that is also a mistake. If you research too many things, it gets mixed up into too many things, so you end up too confused to follow any action or figure. It's very dark and moody, but that does not help much when it comes to genre hopping, just to find something - and all in its history!
