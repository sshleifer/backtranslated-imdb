Having seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought that "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. Boy, I was wrong! On the other hand, A-PIX movies have a way to show unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect. I believe that this is the first A-PIX sequel, and it could be an indication of what to expect in the future: More A-PIX episodes Later parts of the movie in which Jack Frost's offspring (essentially snowballs) are released with eyes, arms, mouth and sharp teeth) begin to kill people with the typical comic dialogue and stupid voices. They are shown both as dolls (with a stick below them to move them) and as computer animations, which, I must say, looks very kitschy. The computer animation surprised me because the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects. <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend that you see the original "Jack Frost" before you see it (both would prefer to watch with a group of friends) to have the full fun of it , and because it makes more sense ("sense" is a relative term). <br /> <br /> Now only if it's "Uncle Sam 2" ...
