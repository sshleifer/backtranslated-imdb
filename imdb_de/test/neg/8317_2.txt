I do not know in which neighborhoods the people who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live, but I'm glad I'm not there if they do not comment on the cartoons. Okay, we learn to lift our disbelief in movies like the "Die Hard" series, but to see little Jodie knocking a whole gang of streets with a Glock as NOVICE ... c'mon. All she needed was a bald head and a torn T-shirt, and she would be Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Apparently Jodie as executive producer has blinded her for a joke and a waste of her money. Or she lived in a kind of fantasy in which she is the only blonde and everyone else is a brunette black or Hispanic. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only good one and (apart from a black policeman) everyone else in town is a nasty minority who cares about them. If your fear of your acting talent has waned enough to make you believe that the only way you can become aware of is to have the only point of light (literally) in front of the camera in a dark, gloomy and dark neighborhood / movie / cast his? Apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. Ridiculous action holes, furniture chewing, unnecessary violence ("Look girls, now you can too!"). Spend time with your family instead of watching the drek.
