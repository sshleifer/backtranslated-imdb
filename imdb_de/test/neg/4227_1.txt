Although this film has a slow, dream-like, almost hypnotic pace and an interesting, if not entirely accurate, description of the criminal investigation and staff of a French country staff, I find it impossible to recommend it. I think this movie is just a piece of setup to get someone - the director suspects - with disgust for heterosexuality. Of course, human sexuality in all its forms can have its vile moments without denying it! But choosing the bad uniformly at the expense of the good, as this film does with each move, suggests a distorted sensitivity at work. In short, if you enjoy masking homo-eroticism as compassion, and portraying heterosexual lovemaking and female form in a vile and degrading light, then this movie is for you. I do not know and it was not like that.
