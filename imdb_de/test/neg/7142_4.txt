Hello! The grudge 2 What's going on? I have a friend I would like to meet. The Grudge 2 hit Johnny's Worst of 2006 list. Johnny's Worst of 2006 List hits The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? I had the impression that this was more like a sequel to The Grudge than a remake. If this is the case, then why is it nothing but warming up the original? This swimmer does not even feel like a movie. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the comic contortionist chick that creates this annoying croaking sound. <br /> <br /> A sound that I recommend that you do not start me. It was kind of scary when I heard it for the first time, but I've heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it's been quite a run. It is even more annoying by the 20 spectators, who find it strange to imitate the sound, if the film has a quiet spot. Sigh. <br /> <br /> People, you are not funny, so just shut up! I promise, EVERY ONLY ONE time, that a character walked slowly through an empty room (which accounts for about 97% of the movie), someone in the audience would start it: "Uhhhhkkkkuuuuhuhhhkkkkkk". Yes, I know that this is a terrible way to reproduce the sound with letters, but you understand the core. Then some people giggled in the audience, and in order not to be outdone they made their own interpretation. I was very close to just running around the audience and hitting random people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to start me. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely nothing about The Grudge 2 that I can recommend. There is not a single original fear or idea throughout the movie. There is no memorable acting performance. Are you a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan? Welp, enjoy her two minutes of screen time and a dialogue line. Are you an Amber Tamblyn fan? I hope you can handle the fact that all she has to do is run around like she's got a nerve. Can you believe that history (if you can call it that) is even worse than The Grudge's? <br /> <br /> At least the original was pretty scary and had some powerful jumping scenes. I have not jumped once during this Lametrosity (yes, I've come up with the word, deal with it). Right. Not once. The "horrors" are so made and they are so obviously telegraphed that there is no shock value as soon as the "Gotcha" moment arrives. Watching this movie is like a good game of chess - you are always four or five shots ahead. <br /> <br /> There are also some weird scenes that do not make sense. One that immediately springs to my mind is a scene in which a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins throwing it back into the pitcher. Huh I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot of it during the movie. Laugh. Sigh. Shaking his head falling asleep (I've done it twice). <br /> <br /> The film even makes a 1/5-hearted attempt at a plot. Impressive. It is so bad that I think we should not even appreciate it by calling it a turn. Did they really think someone would be surprised who hid under the hoodie? You're welcome. It was as shocking as Elton John coming out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And of course the ending ends with the whole "non-closure", we may have another sequel. As soon as the credits rolled, the audience broke out. My feelings exactly. If the public paid money for that damned burger, things would most likely have gotten violent, and I would have liked to prosecute. <br /> <br /> We learned from The Grudge that there is a Japanese belief when someone dies. In a powerful anger, a curse returns. Similar to a Ben Affleck film, it is a "stain" that is forever part of the place where death took place. Well, in The Grudge 2, we learn that when a horror movie hits its budget during the opening weekend, its successor got out of hand, and in most cases, it will be so bad and any theater where the movie leaves a mark will show movie. <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> If you're a total pennant and have never seen The Grudge, it could trigger some cheap horrors. But I strongly recommend saving your money, otherwise there is a good chance that you will go out of the theater with a grudge.
