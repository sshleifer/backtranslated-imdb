After reading the book Heart of Darkness, the film did not do it justice. The film shames the book and anyone who has not experienced the book would disapprove of the story and the plot because it was so poorly portrayed by the movie. In the film, the characters and the set were just some of the disappointments that occurred in the movie. The director has omitted so many important and interesting aspects of the book that it has become one of the best literary works of all. <br /> <br /> Of course every book is better than the movie, but they were not even comparable. As a writer, Joseph Conrad was brilliant at vocabulary and the wisdom of the written word. The movie does not even show it all. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out, just as Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Even as Marlow went to Kurtz 'intentions to send the news, she reacted differently in the film than in the book. Another key difference was that Marlow saw the image of the woman blindfolded at the end of the film, not the beginning, like the book. This had an impact on how the audience perceived Marlow, and the movie has completely messed up that. <br /> <br /> The book was as finely tuned as any place looked, but the scenery in the movie was a failure. There were a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and as a compliment, a bunch of bad actors. There was one exception to the terrible actors, and that was Isaach De Bankol√©, who played Mfumu. His character was best represented. Although the movie was not great, I would recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well. In this way, you can see and think about the differences between film and book. If you have not read the book, I do not recommend the movie because it is a boring, lifeless mess. I loved the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
