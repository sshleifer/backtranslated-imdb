I hired this kind of "soft core" long ago, but I can honestly say that I did not expect it to be the same kind of thing as "Rod Steele: She lives only to die" - which was both sexy and funny. It had a good script, a sincere leader and a purpose. It also has Gabriella Hall, which is hot. The reason why I did not expect this movie was that in the box the label "Must 18 for rent" is missing. I was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake". <br /> <br /> First of all, I think films can not start with "actors" who are looking for a role in a talent agency (or wherever "actors" rehearse). Watching these films rehearse as the "actors" sample rehearses the lack of preparation for the real characters to be played in the film. <br /> <br /> Okay, after finding out that this is a soft-core movie, I did not find anything. I have to turn it off and reclaim my money. The dizzying way in which the extended video scenes of "erotica" are added to a supposedly late-night pay-cable release is very annoying and can be done quickly without the sustained quality of, for example, Rod Steele. They know that they must have had some money, because I think part of it was shot abroad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the lead actor who is NOT trying to pour the invisibility potion is one of the most amazing acting jobs I've ever seen. And I saw Torgo from Manos! It might actually have been worth the dollar rent (that and Gabriella Hall). Nevertheless, there are better, crazy movies that you can rent with your friends.
