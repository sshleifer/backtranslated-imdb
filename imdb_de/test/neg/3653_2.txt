I was looking forward to watching this movie, it seemed everyone who had seen it loved it. I was totally disappointed. Acting was so exaggerated. It seemed as if the author had collected 25 different scripts from different films and arbitrarily chosen dialogues and put them together to a plagiarized script. Spoiler: Was no clich√© omitted in this film? There was a mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous godfather wannabees, the main character who fell in love with the prostitute, cross-dressing, police torture, Hannibal-Lechter-style mutilation, me could carry on. <br /> <br /> Line's like <br /> <br /> - "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I do not want you to work anymore) <br /> <br / > - "Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (Who would pay the rent if I'm not working.) Unrealistic scenes: We never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes, but when the main character disappeared, his father was picked up by the police and has been Weeks tortured. <br /> <br /> The only way to make sense of the whole movie is if the version I had on the scene was heavily edited from the original. I definitely can not recommend it and would enjoy to discuss it with anyone who would be interested. <br /> <br />
