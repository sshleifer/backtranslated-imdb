I saw this as part of a vampire film marathon with research intent, otherwise I would not have seen it all the way. The first scene in which a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs seem to be electrocuted by various slow weapons worn by a still-slowing Van Helsing would-be ... in black and white ... with a voice-over , determines the tempo for the entire scene rest of the movie. The fight scenes look ridiculous, the dialouge would be funny if the drama were not so bad, which makes no sense for the plot, and bite the production values ​​(to the bouncing off of Spike's coat, which the hero has worn, to the ( magic magician's cape encircled by her leadvamp) <br /> <br /> I've seen some bad movies (see The Magic Sword with B. Rathbone or the Raven with a very young Jack N.), but this one gets my vote for the worst of times.
