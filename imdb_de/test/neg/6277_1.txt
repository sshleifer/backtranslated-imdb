I wish I could have zeroed this. Sure, I admit I misunderstood that too because I thought it was the Spielberg version. A clever marketing trick that will be released at this time and presented prominently in the video store. However, I was willing to try anyway - I wish I had not. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I've read some of the other reviews here and have to say that I disapprove of anyone who thinks that any of the acting was good - sorry, even C. Thomas Howell stunk. None of the performances was good. No one. <br /> <br /> Even though the show was decent, the dialogue is awful! "Ginormus" and "Dick Skinners" just do not really cut it off. <br /> <br /> Well, as far as the story goes, it's been terribly adapted and must have been handled by a 5-year-old girl. The main character is constantly in situations that are comfortable - or at least appear so, because the movie was edited together. For example, he tries to come to a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a short break, someone randomly gives them directions to New Hope. What the hell is that? When he comes to New Hope, he accidentally stumbles upon his dying brother. Then there's the part where he's driven away from his destination for days and accidentally found the car his wife and son went into? He has a black backpack that appears random and disappears throughout the movie. There are parts of the movie where the characters wake up in the morning and two seconds later it's nighttime - or worse, the next day. I also can not forget that the main character and the preacher fall without reason through the floor of a house - we learn only later that an alien has landed on the house. Which reminds me of the moment they go and suddenly stand under an alien that they have not noticed. What the hell the aliens are like two stories with big bodies and multiple legs - how could they miss it? There's a point where an alien kills a random citizen, allegedly by spitting some sort of garbage at him - but you never see the stuff flying, as it just appears on the boys' faces. The special effects are generally terrible. The entire film is like a bad "train accident". When we finally come to an end, after this guy has tried to get to DC to find his family, they just appear. No search, no questions, nothing. Oh, there you are, I'm so happy - the end. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if my review slips a little bit, but this movie was so bad that I found it difficult to organize my contempt. Please save your time and do not look at this insidious heap of movie scent. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I would rather have had a root canal - it would have been less painful.
