I was really looking forward to watching this movie after spending some (fantastic) college weeks in Barcelona myself. The premise is coherent - a confused and disturbed young person enters a world of equally confused and disturbed young people. However, the director's weak directors in terms of symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark, confusing and confusing us, the audience. Bravo. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been shown as a European "American Pie" stick, I would be able to turn off my brain and take the ride with me. But the director cultivates our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of twisted highways and the dichotomy of the "inner self" versus the "public self" (the "mother tongue" versus the "secondary language"). , In addition, he bravely delves into the topic of racial / national stereotyping. On an interesting start, how? <br /> <br /> WRONG. That's as far as it goes. These interesting topics are barely mentioned, except at the fictitious end of the epilogue type where the director seemed to be concentrating on the subject. It reminded me of a meandering speech that goes nowhere, but the speaker ends with the words, "I hope in the end that you see how this relates to my original thoughts!" It should be noted that cynical jab betrays itself in stereotypes. When it comes to ridiculing the use of national stereotypes, why did the director introduce a Cockney-speaking, beer-bred English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a Neanderthal (literally beating his breast and making monkey noises at one point) while the Europeans tolerably tolerate him? Why is the British girl the one who sinks in front of Slub (the French are called "frogs" and the French language slaughtered) while everyone else is above all this? The answer is that this is not a profound or elaborate movie. It is simply the answer of an Anglophobe to the Anglophiles. But it really does not differ from the prejudices that it wants to ridicule! Well, there is a funny irony that needs to be considered. OK, philosophy, artistry and social commentary, besides that, I was still very bored with this movie. There is a very funny gag about fooling a friend of the girls, but otherwise I was barely entertained. The only reason I have seen it through to the end is that I would like to refresh my French and Spanish. (You see, we monolingual Americans may be stupid, but we'll try.)
