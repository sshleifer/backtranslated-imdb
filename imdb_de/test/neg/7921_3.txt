All dogs that go to heaven was a quirky, funny movie; With good name talent, the voice of a sign gives an adult who is basically meant for children. It was just interesting enough to be sympathetic to adults, except for something good for the kids. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a worthless sequel trying to make some money with the coattails of the first one. Charlie Sheen is a decent substitute for Burt Reynolds in this second film, and Sheena Easton's voice in some of the films, which are lovely but forgetful songs, makes her a worthy choice as a co-star. Add Dom DeLuise from the first movie and you would think that this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately also with other good speakers Like Bebe Neuwirth in the awful role of Anabelle, this movie can not be saved from the cruel production values ​​and animation skills (or their lack) in this movie. Horrible editing, voices synchronization, and flat spaces in which the characters' mouths should move, but not combined to make this movie look like a college intern's animation project. All in all, I would say if you're not a big one If I were a fan of the first movie, I would give that a very big pass.
