I was so looking forward to seeing the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless films I've ever seen. But also the creators of "Overnight" - buddies (ex?) Of the mastermind in question - have to learn how to make a movie. Various unappetising remarks, shouting obscenities into the phone, and drinking his liquor make Mr. Duffy look like a cleaner. But there is no understanding why the guy got a contract at all, what his creative process or vision is - what is Boondock Saints doing? How hard is it to meet Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are trapped? Since the film does not attempt to answer these questions in a coherent manner, he also does not have the opportunity to tell Dippity-Doo about Hollywood. So, who cares?
