Do not get me wrong, I assumed that this movie would be stupid, frankly, I gave it an incredibly low standard. The only reason I ever saw it was that some girls went (different story for another time). When I started to look, I noticed something, this movie was awful. Now there are two kinds of terrible things, there is Freddy Vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke, how awful it is, and then there's a movie like this. The cat in the hat did not interest me. When I saw the first piece, I was not only bored, but felt as if I had somehow been hurt by the awfulness of the film. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie did not click. The directors / producers / authors / Whatever changed, among other things, that they refused to use the colors of the original book (red, black, white) for other characters than the cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture anything of the original (and I hate to use that word, but it fits). The book was like an ice cream Sunday, colorful and tasty, and the movie was as boring and hard to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like a leprosy prostitute.
