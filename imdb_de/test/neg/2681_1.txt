The taste is a subjective thing. Two people can see the same movie if one of them loves him and the other hates him. Since it is "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers", I fall into the latter category. <br /> <br /> I think that in 1978, John Carpenter shot one of the best horror movies of the decade, despite its shortcomings, it still lingers into the 21st century. Many of the old horror movie machines have been reused, but used in an original and effective way. There was no claim that it was anything but a film about a psychiatrist who had stalked babysitters on Halloween night. And yet there were "ideas" in the film, but subtly introduced and not hammered into the skull. It linked the myths of the macabre festival to the reality of events in history and did so with a wonderful ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The "filmmakers" of this "film" would probably not even understand this previous paragraph. That's why we saddle ourselves with this miserable and inappropriate piece of disposable celluloid. Director, script, drama are the lowest imaginable layers. This is the kind of movie that is so stupefyingly boring and evil that you want to crawl back into the womb and die. It's also really sad to see British actor Donald Pleasence wasting his acting skills with this spit-up of a movie. He seems to lose all of his energy and resigned that this could be his last movie. Maybe that killed him.
