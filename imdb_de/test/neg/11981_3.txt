I was quite surprised when I found out that a movie based on the Far Cry game was made. The story here is not something I would consider a strong point in the game universe. Do not worry, because in typical Boll fashion, the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it's based on. Now I understand that certain freedoms are required to transpose from one media form to another, but it seems he really does not even try to connect. Not only that, but the drama and action sequences are so hackneyed that you almost feel like the whole project is a big joke. It has been said a million times, but why could not someone use the video game rights for a movie ????
