I was looking forward to this movie. I like Road Thrillers. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and a great soundtrack. And I was particularly interested in making a film tour of Europe to see if I recognized my own travel spots. <br /> <br /> From the first scene, however, this movie was not available. What was Guy driving on the wrong side of the road? What could possibly have blasted the van, who rolled gracefully down a flat, grassy slope? If they are such bad drivers then why do they accept a delivery job? And that's just the first scene! Not bad enough to be belligerent or stupid. Just terrible! Dreadful! Dreadful! Waste of time. Continue to something ... something else!
