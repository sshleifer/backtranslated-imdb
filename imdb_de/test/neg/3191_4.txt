Usually I do not watch Hollywood dribbling, but I was dragged along with some friends to see this one, which proved amusing in places, but completely original. Do not worry, you do not have to think about it - Tarantino-like storyline leaves enough obvious clues to predict correctly, where these are about fifteen minutes before each "turn" for a Hollywood movie pretty well, but that it no climax for the climax. And boy, my fears had become clear - YMCA could not save this, but Liv Tyler almost did it. I expect to be male and helped in my twenties, but she did a great job - obviously she did not have to do much except look absolutely stunningly sexy, but what she did made her good! McCOOL'S certainly will not become one of Hollywood's big hits (or should I say "should not") because the American film industry is nowhere to go and has not been a rarity for at least a decade (like AMERICAN BEAUTY, TITANIC and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and even those had big flaws), but if you're a teenage guy, do yourself a favor and see Liv - she's a hot girl. Rating: 5/10. See also: everything from Quentin Tarantino, every American teenage movie of the last decade, all with sex as the main selling point.
