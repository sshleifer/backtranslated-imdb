Let me first say that I believe in ghosts, and I really know that they exist. I have had enough experience with them to know that they are there. <br /> <br /> What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and religion into all this. People forget that there is more than one "Bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways of interpreting what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God and not everyone believes in stereotypical religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not do it all, one of the things I should mention in the Bible, many of which do not know, is that even the fiercest proverb of the Bible should violate the rules you have written Never carry more than one substance at the same time, slavery is fine, and you can murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this "Oh, that was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is the Word of God and can not be changed ... there should be no changes or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts and people who follow so blindly that "there is no other way". The excuses that these blind followers use are either pathetic or they can not properly explain the discrepancies themselves and instead use excuses, which are given to them either by their pastor or teacher. <br /> <br /> But still on the rating. I'm a decent fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard this show was coming soon, I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. As much as I like to see "Ghost Hunters," I do not like some of their members, and I do not like how they can dismiss a place as a haunt, but can not explain what's going on. Just because your examiner does not record it does not mean that the camera that is filming the show did not. I'm glad that they are skeptical, but it's as if they do not understand it, just because you did not get anything on your recorder and movie does not make the place a haunting or not. If ghosts were so easy to grasp, it would be known as fact and not as faith. It's more of a "right place at the right time," and if there's something, what makes you believe it will "perform" for you? This show is kind of stupid. It's usually boring and there's a lot of talk, many clairvoyants, and yet hardly anything happens. The filtered narrative of the main human is usually boring, or it is basically not needed. <br /> <br /> Also, the trust in the fortune-tellers is too great, as I believe that very few of them are really gifted. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to have this show, but I have not been impressed by the few I've seen so far.
