I bought "Rocketship X-M" in a double pack with "Destination Moon" on DVD. Now I understand why the lenders have done that: no one who had ever seen this movie would buy it alone. <br /> <br /> I can not understand what school system the reviewer turned out to be, claiming that RXM was "great" His predictions of how space would take place ... "Start straight up, and then turn right 90 degrees and circling faster and faster until you reach the escape speed I do not think I remember the Apollo program Remember, the astronauts should be weightless after turning off the engines Gravity changes direction every time they go through the hatch into the engine room Going to the moon but "missed" No problem, it's just a jump, and a jump (with a helping hand of Divine Providence) and you will be on Mars, and if you want to spend life on Mars given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a pardonable convention for the sake of storytelling, but you can make it look as if they are a little strange? These Martians looked like fellow combatants from the occupation of "10,000 BC" I can accept some scientific mistakes, but this would not happen to a second-grade student who is above average. <br /> <br /> Apart from the screaming holes: 12 minutes before the start (as you will be reminded) From the nagging PA voice, which constantly says "X minus so many minutes"), the astronauts hold a press conference! I think the time bang is why Dr. Eckstrom did not change his coat and tie before he shot into space. And how practical that is, even though they intended to go to the moon and have pressure suits, they brought hiking gear (and rifles!) With them, just in case they landed on Mars. They are lucky that they landed somewhere, because the method they had developed for the landing was obviously to let Dr.E look out the window and tell the "pilot" (Lloyd Bridges) that he was off and throttled to the throttles. Note for the designers of the XM-2: How about giving the pilot a window seat? <br /> <br /> Also the previous comments on casual sexism, which is the eye candy of Dr. med. Lisa (Osa Massen) had condemned them all by repeatedly messing up their fuel calculations, but those were the early 50s. She was there to fill her sweater, not a useful feature. <br /> <br /> "Rocketship XM" is notable for being one of the first of the first movies to say, "Oh yeah, we'll all blow ourselves up with these A-bombs here," but you can tell, without wasting 77 minutes to see such filth. By the way, this message might have had more impact if the budget for the actual ruins of the Martian city would have been a little more money than just mops on the budget. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate "good". bad sci-fi, the unique way the "future" looked in the past, and the inherent (though condescending) humor one can find when we look back on the naivety of the audience 60 years ago, but this one Movie must have been offensive even then. "Rocketship X-M" is not even suitable for a MST3K style lampooning. Sometimes bad is just ... bad. <br /> <br /> Who wants to buy a DVD? Used only once, I swear.
