If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, it is not. If you are looking for one of those horrible movies that are so awful that they are really good, this may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughter in this movie that you could almost speak of a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles that say "Jack-O", and then add the word "Lantern" as if the viewer could not figure out if the movie is about a Pumpkin of the Giant Pumpkin on both front pages and the Opening scene of the movie. After that, the movie goes in about 20 different directions, none of which makes much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he's in people's houses, in the woods, and yet he never seems to do much. He makes some kills, but the long build-up of these murders is so bad and constructive that you almost wish Jack-o would be angry at you, the onlooker. Besides, the plot consists of bad acting, undeserved nudity, and a ridiculous act. The acting in this film is one of the worst I have ever seen in over 35 years of film shows. The boy who starred in the film (the director's son) has about as much emotion as a corpse, and just about all the other actors / actresses are just as bad for many reasons (especially the big-eyed woman with bigger eyes) as saucers). But after you've said all this, if you think that's what it is (that's a steaming pile of crap), you'll get some laughs from this movie. What I also find amusing is that the creators of the DVD wanted to release a "10th Anniversary Version" of this movie (as if the original was not good enough). And somebody actually had the idea of ​​doing a behind-the-scenes movie, which is also included in the 10th Anniversary issue (I'm not sure why) ....... I'm giving this 3 crushed one Pumpkins of it 10 ...
