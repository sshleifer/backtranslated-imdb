I should have known better ... the clues were found on IMDB.com. This movie was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record. The cast is a series of unknowns with the possible exception of Joe Estevez, who seems to specialize in bad movies. Suffice to say, I see no reason why anyone wants to see this horrible, amateurish attempt at filmmaking. Turn on any broadcast channel at 3:00 am to watch better movies. Nuff said.
