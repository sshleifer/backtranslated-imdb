The best thing I can say about this porn horror movie is: Fools Dumbheads Fools! <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is made by a Hindu / Indian with some background in pornography or the like. <Br/> <br /> Content: Talk show presenter and girlfriend are persecuted by a psychopath angry about the plight of the homeless and taking advantage of it, you guessed it, beautiful real estate agent ladies! (Movies like these are the reason the slasher movies of the 80s got a representative of misogyny.) <br /> <br /> This movie is not really a slasher, but has the same kinds of implausibilities and stereotypes: the stupid ass, The villain is an old white man, and the women are busty women. <br /> <br /> If you like porn horror, this is your movie, otherwise stay away. (Adrienne fans will see their breasts for a second or two.)
