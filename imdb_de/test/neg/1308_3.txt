Usually I do not write reviews, but for this movie I had to. I am shocked at the acting talent on this train that is wasted. They spend the first half of the movie wondering who they're talking to and who they are on Earth with. The last half of the movie slows down a bit but has neither depth nor feel. The only salvation is the beautiful, but still limited CGI, and the location is London. I gave away 3 stars, and the fact that the actors were still trying to do a good job with the fraud they got. If you feel like losing a few hours of your life with mediocre popcorn movie entertainment, this is the movie for you. However, I would recommend doing something else instead, like seeing the real archive footage online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
