I borrowed this movie courtesy of Netflix because I thought I would get the 1972 version. I sat there unaware and looked at this new version. I thought: The production values ​​were spectacular! I was convinced that the soundtrack sounded a bit '70s. I was even more convinced that this was a movie from the '70s when I realized (almost every five seconds) that the only thing missing between Gene and Finney was an intense hug, a stressed look, a passionate kiss I was sorry, although John Knowles himself pointed out that it was not a homosexual relationship, it is painfully obvious that yes, that's exactly what it was. When people (usually adolescents) of the same sex have "intense" friendships, it means that all the craving for love, togetherness and the desire to express themselves sexually spills over. These guys had to connect but were never allowed to. <br /> <br /> Despite a spirited performance by Toby Moore, I never had the feeling that the emotions were real. I never connected with any of the guys, that's why their relationship was not really honest. <br /> <br /> People want to live in a fantasy and think that this was so in the 1940s that these guys could not do that. I had these sexual feelings for each other. But I say they did - at least in the book they did, and in that movie, Finney had made her almost painful for Gene. The "intensity" John Knowles suspected between them was a closed homosexuality, a hero worship, an idolatry that under normal circumstances would be expressed in a sexual way. Even if those guys stifled it, it should have been crystal clear, but this movie does not really suggest it. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an incredibly bizarre moment when Finney, who has broken his leg, is playfully jumped by all the other players during a ball game. If it was not just a bunch of Nincompoops, they would know they could not possibly throw their bodies against him. Obviously, this bitter moment was lost for both the director and the producer.
