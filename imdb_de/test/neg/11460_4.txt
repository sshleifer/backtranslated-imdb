Unfortunately, this film is typical of the dilution of a good movie by numerous sequels. Universal produced several serial monster movies in the 1940s that were pale imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptologist Imhotep has been replaced by a Frankenstein in mummy wrapping that shows no signs of intelligent life. This movie is entertaining in spots, but if you've seen The Mummy (1932), you'll be disappointed.
