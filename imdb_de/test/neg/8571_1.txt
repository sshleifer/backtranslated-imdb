Review: Nunsploitation Movies. It has always existed. A few that come to my mind are the Mexican devil child movie Alucarda, Night of the Demons 2, The Monastery and of course Dante Tomaselli's Desecration. Can not blame someone who has been trying to exploit a religious / sacred image and twist it to make it sinister. If done right, it works. Here's the latest addition to the non-sploitation sub-genre, which is simply titled The Nun. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of girls who live in a Catholic school. In this school there is a nun who is one of the girls especially cruel. The girls who act in self-defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and decide to bury her and not tell anyone about it. 18 years later, the nun is looking for revenge from those who killed her. <br /> <br /> This film was produced by Brian Yuzna's Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that produces horror films in Spain. Do you need a reminder of the kind of films this company produces? Well, here's a little reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: The werewolf hunt, Rottweiler. You get the picture. The only really good movie this company produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. That's it. Oh no, wait, I think they also produced the excellent Christian Bale vehicle The Machinist. But that's it. When I purposely rented this movie, I knew that I would not see anything that was incredibly good. Despite all these mental preparations, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the best things this movie promises is its chic look. The movie has some nice footage. It does not look like a cheap horror movie. The special effects of the films were fine, The Nun could travel through the water. Well, that was a picture that offered itself for some cool moments that sometimes scratched in cheesy area but were sometimes cool enough to watch. I dug this scene with the nun, who hurls himself at the people like a bucket of water. It's not a particularly deadly move, but it made for a cool picture. There is some blood here, but not much of it. A certain scene with an elevator death was cool, but unfortunately the film reached its climax with this scene. And it was only halfway. After that nothing really cool happens and the film is deceiving itself into an unbelievable Borefest. <br /> <br /> The movie just turns into The Nun, which pops up every now and then to make us boo scared, she'll kill somebody and then CUT! We go back to the characters who talk crap, go through rooms, open doors, get the exercise. And I personally hate it when a horror movie comes out of it. People open doors and enter rooms. Boring! And when the characters speak, that's a terrible dialogue. In a particularly stupid scene, a character decides out of the blue that the nun will always turn to flesh and blood when she is in the water, and so they try to kill her. And everyone just says OK! They all work out this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Well, who gave this information to the guy and why did the others take it for granted? Who the hell knows, but his scenes make the movie stupid. <br /> <br /> And one more thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this movie was the fact that they used Spanish actors as a very tight accent. When they try to speak English, it's very hard to understand what the hell they want to say. I prefer to sync them, then try to find out what they say and get frustrated. The fact that this DVD has no English subtitles did not help either. <br /> <br /> So this is a movie that has some smooth visuals, nice sound effects, but a horrible, terrible script. I think that shows that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your film has a bad script with terrible characters and situations your audience can not connect with, then you still have a bad movie. That was the case with The NUN. <br /> <br /> If you really want to have fun with bad nuns, rent one of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, as for the creators of this film, they should say ten Holy Marys and light fifty candles to their saint of their choice to see if they will be forgiven for this sinfully horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5.
