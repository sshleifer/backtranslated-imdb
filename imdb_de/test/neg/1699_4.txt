If you are a Catalan nationalist anarchist socialist and do not reverently worship the mythologies of the Spanish Republic, this movie might be for you. Two brothers, true real-life brothers (one of whom is Marc Recha himself) play a fictitious version of a realistic journey they made through the spectacular Catalan landscape. Artillery booms on the soundtrack), but not shown. There are very few dialogues, and most of it is random: the story is told in a voice of a third person. The voice is that of an actress who embodies the real sister of the real brothers. The pictures have little to do with the story, which is not much. Many are stunning and brooding over semi-arid mountains and rivers (think of Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant - there's not much of "Gerry" and "Last Days" here), with stunning stills and motionless images. These are best enjoyed in the film's superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately boring narrative or even the occasional background music (some pretty good, some pretty weird, but all unfounded). The best that this movie has to say is said in these sequences, with occasional no-comment coverage of power plants and dams. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the brothers remains sketchy and generic; A main character is a man-biting catfish that is never shown. The more Catalan nationalist anarcho-egalitarian commitments the director proposes, the more undermined the richer, unspoken message of the film, and the more irritating narcissistic the experience becomes. Although the director at the NYFF show said the film was conceived from the beginning with his third-person narrative, I would like to see a version of it without the narration or the music, and only with the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialogue. The result could be more moving and definitely not much less confusing. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, this is probably the only movie you'll see this year, with a man in the frame walking over a piece of clothing (the bathing suit he was wearing?) dangling from his penis. This is one of the few moments in the entire movie where your interest is (unfortunately) stung by something that actually happens on the screen (what is it, why is it hanging there?), But as usual, no answers are provided. Very warholian, very sixty and a little tiring.
