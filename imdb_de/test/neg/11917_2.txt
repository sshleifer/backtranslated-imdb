It's not really worth a check, but I'm sure it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are pretty good reviews of this Canadian bombshell ... Bad Acting and a Slow, Totally Boring Adult A story, in which 3 boys live is turned upside down as a man emerges in the forest in their clubhouse while fleeing. In the first hour, the boys do well with the intruder, and you even see him as a role model ... But that changes ... and you still are not interested. You will recognize Chris Penn, whose most important cinematic influence is Corky Romano, and a young Devon Sawa, whose career peaked at "Casper". I was hoping for a '12 and Holding ',' The War 'or' Lie 'and all I got was a waste of time. This film strives to keep the audience's attention and never affects anything from afar.
