The update of the Clare Booth Luce game and the 1939 film is a big disappointment. The cast of women is excellent, most individual scenes work, but nothing is related. There is no connection between scenes, as if the film had been made in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. Granted, the story of a woman who deals with her husband's unfaithfulness and how she's helped and disabled by her friends is a less shocking thing in a time when divorce is so common, but at the same time it's as topical as ever I just wish they had managed to connect all the pieces together, because the way it looks now, you really do not feel trapped by the plot. Wait for the cable.
