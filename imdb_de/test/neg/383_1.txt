What do you do with all the material that does not lead to the final editing of a movie? You can pick it up in case a director-cut or extended version is released one day. You could sell some of them as stock footage to use in part of another movie. You could just catch it. Or you collect it, gather more and more of each movie you make, and then use it to make another film without paying attention to coherence or meaning. Throw in a very primitive skeleton of a narrative and put a number of possibilities (no, excuses) into your celluloid offshoot. Excuse the heinous nonsensical nature of the plot by putting everything in the head of a director of the horror movie, and you have yourself a horrible movie. All this can be done in just a few days. And idiots like me will spend two hours of their lives watching her. And then come here and try to warn others. The entire chain of events is a big waste of time.
