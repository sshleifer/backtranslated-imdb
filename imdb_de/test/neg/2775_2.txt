This is a cheap movie by Al Adamson - a man who may have been the worst filmmaker ever - even worse than Ed Wood, Jr .. Adamson specialized in horror and skin movies on an extremely low budget in the '60s and' 70s and 80s and with such titles as FIVE BLOODY GRAVES, HELL'S BLOODY DEVILS, SATAN'S SADISTS and LASH OF LUST it is obvious that he did not make Shakespeare !! All of his films had rotted production values, sensations, gore and laymen. Here in BRAIN OF BLOOD are several actors of Adamson (like his wife Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto) with the ride and appeared in Adamson's previous film Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN. That's lucky, because the previous movie was so horrible and so poorly performed on all levels that BRAIN OF BLOOD can not help but look good! Of course, the make-up is ridiculous. The plot is stupid (it's the omnipresent brain transplant scheme) and the action is Level Z, but it's STILL better than your last movie! <br /> <br /> About the only positive things about this movie is that the aging support actor, Dwarf Angelo Rossitto actually had a better part than usual - with more dialogue and a more important role in the plot - and sometimes there is one certain sense of danger and tension. As with Ms. Carrol, she still looks like a stripper. The rest of the cast is limping through this stupid movie. However, it's bad enough that it's good for bad movie fans - you just have to see make-up from the guy with burn marks and the jet cannon that seems to be made up of an old taillight!
