This movie was terrible in a word. It was boring, predictable and downright scary. I have always been waiting for the end and when it happened, I was horrified. The end left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least. My advice to anyone interested in watching movies about female sexuality: stay away from this movie. Films like these give classics like Lolita a bad name.
