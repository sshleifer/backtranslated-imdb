Leatherheads is aptly titled, but a leather bracelet would be more useful if you'd like to flagellate yourself after purchasing a ticket to this harmful entertainment attempt. Clooney's attempt to vilify himself hits him with a faint thud as his behavior implies that he is anything but. Maybe with another actor playing the role of Clooney, the movie might be barely tasty. I'm sorry, George, I doubt that this time will be an Oscar nod. George Clooney is definitely a fish out of the water when it comes to comedy (unless you're referring to his politics). Anyway, only the most passionate Clooney fans enjoy Leatherheads, everyone else will long for the days of the silent picture.
