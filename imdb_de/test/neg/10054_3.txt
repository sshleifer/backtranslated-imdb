The Bridge At Remagen contains one of the most unruly screenplays I've ever seen. Apart from the wood-based acting, no tank commander attacks with armored tanks in the middle of the streets and with troops whose arms are not ready. The constant suicidal behavior triggered my "tilt switch", so I was often unable to enjoy the movie. Apparently the scriptwriters and directors never went through a real warfare and never bothered to bring an expert. This movie is just the opposite of the outstanding detail in Saving Private Ryan. If you are not under 7 years old, I recommend you to look at something else. <br /> <br /> GB
