First of all, how can anyone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this. I saw this movie and after a few hours I scratched my head what exactly the director wants to say. <br /> <br /> If it's a thriller, there's no thrill, if there's anything, there's no action without a hunting sequence, there's no drama, and the much-lauded love story never actually goes down. No passion, no emotion. Nothing is there. <br /> <br /> Actually, I did not expect any miracles from the movie, but after opening the bumper, I thought of giving it a shot. I have no problems whatsoever with Himesh Reshamiya, and I'm not one of the guys who will beat him on any given occasion. I came up with an open mind and came out with a closed one. <br /> <br /> Let's not blame Himesh Reshamiya, he's just a debutant actor. But direction, script, writing, make-up, everything worked out. Himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time. He can take over the role of the Don. Hansika is just a kid, and it shows up on the canvas with her baby fat and the way she walks. <br /> <br /> The only good actor was Himesh's friend in the movie, I do not know him name, but he looks promising. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk, not even good to look at it for a while. <br /> <br /> ** We strongly recommend to avoid this movie. **
