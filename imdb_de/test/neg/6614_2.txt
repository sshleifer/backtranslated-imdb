I watched with great concern, and my concern was well founded. What was this movie about? Knight? The season? The players? What? It was everywhere the whole time. There were no tensions (sorry, we all knew that Bobby would curse and throw things), but Brian Denehy, a good actor, acts as an e-mail in anger and does not deliver tension. Positively shot, like a MacGiver episode. Compare this Thanksgiving main course to the job HBO did in the Don King movie "Only in America" ​​to show you how to make sports biopics, warts and so on. Note that ESPN challenged hell and never showed it again?
