The best thing about "The Prey" is the marker line ... "It's not a human and it has an ax"! The movie itself is a padded Stinkaroo ... endless insect and animal photos will make the viewer die! No Slasher fan will like this junk ... Take another look at "Friday the 13th" and burn every copy of this movie you'll find! <br /> <br /> It's also one of the 25 worst movies ever made!
