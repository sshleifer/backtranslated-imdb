The parallels between this film and "Captain Walrus" (an independent film shown at the Team Projection Film Festival in 1994) are so obvious that any praise of "Sally Marshall is not an alien" must be viewed with the knowledge that it is rides on the success of another job. <br /> <br /> In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen) examine the bizarre behavior of their new neighbor, Britney (played by Louise Farley). As the two boys watch through their telescopes, they watch the repeated visits of a man in uniform whom they call Captain Walross (played by Peter Sargent). In Captain Walrus, however, the focus is on the senseless and somewhat power-hungry actions of neighbor Britney and less on the friendship between the two boys. <br /> <br /> A key success at the film festival is the plot of Captain Walrus was apparently appropriated and rewashed to give the Australian Film Community another mark on the belt regarding children's products. Although Sally Marshall is not an alien, she is a good movie and a tribute to her producers, but her spuriousness makes her earn something.
