Can anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS? In one issue, Charles Bronson (Robbie Coltrane) was interviewed on his new movie GLC: <br /> <br /> "It's about a man, a common man whose wife and family are being wiped out by rogues, and I have to hunt them and kill her in a sadistic and graphic way "<br /> <br />" And to GLC, what next for Bronson? "<br /> <br />" We're using a new perspective. My family will not be wiped out, but I go after that crawl as well "<br /> <br /> This describes exactly the evil that men do. It's a Bronson Vigilante thriller whose motivation is not due to a blood feud, but that leads to credibility being strained, as shown by a videotape of interviews with the victims of The Doctor, not the legendary time traveler a notorious torture expert. It has never really been explained why The Doctor is so infamous, as there are a lot of these sadists in every police state, and also why The Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents film and incidents happen because the scriptwriter has to make a difference no matter how unlikely it is that one of the bad guys is invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things like the sister of the doctor who is so lesbian are revealed T & A may be included br /> <br /> In many ways, it's like one of those evil Chuck Norris vehicles that were released at the same time, but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE Two highly regarded war dramas that are often shown on Sunday afternoons. Believe me, this movie will be shown long after the watershed
