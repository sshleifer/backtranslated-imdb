Badland is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's usually good and I can continue my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the Iraq war, I think it is necessary to say that the story, the plot, the action, and the depiction of what soldiers go through upon their return, was pure garbage. It was as if the director / writer / one who had borrowed from any clich√© about the repatriation of soldiers ran and ran and ran away with them. The "navy" uniform looked fresh from an excess store shelf and a pattern that had not been used since the first Iraq war. I will not go on forever, that's a terrible movie. If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers, there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.
