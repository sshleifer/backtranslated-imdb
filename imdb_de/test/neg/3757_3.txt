You have to hand it over to director John Hughes. With a tremendous success in teens / high school, he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy and found a great ally in comedian John Candy. Here, the seedy adult Candy becomes a better person, having agreed to babysit his brother's clever children; It's a surefire formula that will please cynical teens as well as their parents, and no wonder the movie was a winner in the theater audience. Nevertheless, Hughes relies almost entirely on Candy's charm to pinpoint the scenario, and at the end of the repeated gags, you can get tired of the star front and center. The kids are sitcom-smart, the other adults are shapeless blobs, and Amy Madigan is too intense and plays too much with Uncle Bock's girlfriend. Later, a television series became fitting, as the material was already perfected on television. * 1/2 of ****
