Mr. Bean is just a bunch of listless slapstick humor. It's the flattest humor TV series ever made in history. The scenes are often disgusting and the terrible, canned laughter makes shivers run through the spine. Mr. Bean is a selfish and rude character and you can only sympathize with how pathetic he is. It is unbelievable that such a TV series of low quality can be maintained for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to see even one episode, and one can not help but express disgust and pity for why Rowen has portrayed himself as such a two-dimensional, unsteady and ridiculous character. Or are you ashamed of why you even bothered to watch an episode? Watching this is an aggravating experience.
