Mansfield Park is my favorite of Austen's novels in the second half, and Fanny Price is her hero's favorite. I am saddened by the unfortunate fate she has suffered in her portraits of large and small pictures. The only good reading of the character I've heard was made by Amanda Root for the radio, which gave him the same quality as the character Anne did in the film Persuasion: a stern, sure, heartfelt moral centering. If the actress had been younger, she would have been a good visual casting as well; but the fannys that have come to our notice today have become more similar: Mary Crawford; Ruby the rinse-maid; and (in this incarnation) a merry servant, or maybe a bastard, pulled down a pen with their high moral principles. <br /> <br /> Well, I was hoping for improvement, but I feared worse. The series had a solid Edmund, in an actor who was best in sympathetic saps, and the perfect, i. completely abominable Mrs. Norris; otherwise it was boring. The film, which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or another bad theater idea, came as mixed burlesque. After such disappointments and recent disappointments with the sister pieces of this production (the new "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey"), I could not help but have mixed expectations of them. and by and large I felt a little better inclined by this than not. It cleverly condensed the novel, leaving me with the same feelings as a comic book version in the end. On the other hand, most of the characters, except the Crawfords, had to be reworked, and most or all of the most memorable things in the book were reduced or eliminated, including the most famous characters and what should be if It's not his most famous scene. <br /> <br /> The character is the treacherous Aunt Norris who is always ready to direct other people into what she should do, but always avoid having to do anything on her own; Here you do not get any sense at all. And with her goes much else: Her comment that cuts through Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; Sir Thomas's discovery that she has forbidden Fanny to have a fire in her room over the years, and his apology in the roundabout for her; Fanny's honesty, on a visit home, acknowledged that Aunt Norris, with all her mistakes, managed the household better than her two sisters. But all this journey is missing in the story, and so most of what happens in the rehearsals and most of what disturbs Sir Thomas on his return; and indeed, Sir Thomas and his wife are different from what they were. Especially the scene in which Crawford suggests Fanny, one of Austen's most complex, is simplified to a mere storytelling. Behind this is Fanny's consistent commitment to what she considers right, and what she considers most likely to be true, against all the distractions that Crawford and everyone else can direct to her. For a male reader, written now when he was written, he reveals with unsurpassed clarity - unsurpassed, as far as I know - what a woman goes through trying to do justice to a man who meets her Reason for mistrust. It's a brilliant scene in the novel; on TV it's just a scene. <br /> <br /> And, Fanny, oh, Fanny: When will we see yours similar?
