This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my opinion. Nicholas Sparks is a great romance writer and this movie had every chance of being as great as the notebook, but what makes the two of them if the notebook has a dream team leads McAdams and Gosling, but this is where the balance gets through The awkward spectacle of Channing Tatum was miserable <br /> <br /> I felt that many scenes were inconsistent due to their performance, many emotions in different scenes are lost because he can not act and leaves a clumsy and uneven situation , Amanda Seyfried did a great job only to let Tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene can not recover to be right, but it became a handsome boy who can not act. Tatum should stick to what he can do, movies that are more about his physical abilities, albeit horrible, like GI JOE, step-up and fighting. The less he talks, the better. <br /> <br /> Do not try to see me as a starving hater of Channing Tatum. I went into this movie with an open mind, because I was often surprised Adam Sandler in control of me. I gave Tatum the same chance. I did not consider him here as the sum of his last roles, purely through his performance in this film, which unfortunately was a failure
