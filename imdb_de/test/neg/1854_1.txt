It's hard to imagine two actors of this class and experience, such as Michael Caine and Michael Gambon, getting involved in such an embarrassingly inappropriate movie. The responsibility for this poorly judged production lies with the author Neil Jordan and the director Conor McPherson. I doubt I have seen such a bad movie with such good credits for a long time. The comedian Dylan Moran, who has made a name for himself as a cranky and incompetent bookseller in the black-book TV sitcom, does almost the same routine here, just with such excess and lack of comic control that he squirms. It's easy to see how the story could have worked, because the situation is interesting and full of comic potential. A classic actor (Caine) tries to demolish the mob (Gambon and Co) along with a boring would-be colleague (Moran) helper, with predictable results. It could have been and should be good. Unfortunately, it should not be.
