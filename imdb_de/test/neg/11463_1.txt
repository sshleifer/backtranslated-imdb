I know that most people do not know who Solomon Kane is and that the movie is shot in front of a much larger audience. But why call it "Solomon Kane" if the name has no marketable value? The characters certainly have NOTHING with the R.E. Howard character. Only he has a big hat. Here the similarity ends. <br /> <br /> It's always a bad sign when a superhero / fantasy / sci-fi movie lingers on a story of origin, but when you invent a whole cloth for a character who has not done so. If you have none at all, you have already missed the point completely. Kane is no longer even the fanatical Christian warrior of the stories, but rather an early villain trying to save his soul (this part is in the opening scene). <br /> <br /> With the most basic character elements changed or simply ignored, using the name Solomon Kane is simply confusing. Is it just that they can say "From the Creator of Conan" and hope to enter an aspiring franchise when the new "Conan" movie launches? Without ignoring the full abandonment of the stories, the film is proficient when it's completely generic for the first half, but then turns into mere stupidity in the climactic scene, with several super baddies (think of three "bosslevels" at the same time) ) think of which none is least interesting or threatening. <br /> <br /> If I was not a Kane fan and was disappointed that they completely ignored the source material, I would probably give the movie a 3 or 4 rather than a 1 even for the (most) viewers who are not know about Kane, it's a pretty thin cinnamon.
