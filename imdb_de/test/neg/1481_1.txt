A garbage classic! Basically, here's a story about some American teens (a man, a woman, both naturally beautiful people) who seem psychically connected by pushing each other's dreams when they both fall asleep Your innermost wishes ... think, Mills & Boon meets X-Files and you're somewhere near the mark. Actually, it's more of an unfortunate mix of one of Ed Wood's famous-bad B-movies and a particularly stupid episode of Melrose Place, so sticky are the special effects and so amateurish is the acting. The actors who inhabit this strip (I would not say act) say that their lines look like they're reading and pouting from cue cards when they're supposed to show an emotion, and that's not a big shock (or loss) industry), which have now faded into darkness. The whole is just a ridiculously misguided mix of styles that do not match at all, and the end result is a fascinating curiosity that will undoubtedly come as a surprise to the supplier of so-bad-she-good movies in recent years. I'll probably be the only person ever to comment on this movie, but if you've read and seen, please come back, it'll be a bit lonely here ...
