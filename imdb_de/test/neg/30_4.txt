Sometimes Rita Hayworth is just amazing and the only reason for me to watch this stupid movie. Despite the exaggerated lipstick of the 1940s, Rita was one of Hollywood's omnipresent glamor women. In fact, for a few years, I can not imagine anybody who looked any better, except perhaps Elizabeth Taylor in her best form. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the co-star of the series, Gene Kelly, is not playing his normal sympathetic type, at least the guy we all know him in "Singin 'In The Rain". Here, Kelly's "Danny McGuire" pouts most of the time. Phil Silvers, whom I've loved on TV at "Sgt. Bilko," is so dumb as "Genius" that you hurry up in front of his stupid jokes ... and they're stupid. The visuals are good with great technicolor, which looks almost great. You can also see many pretty women here, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, the story is not that much. The focus is Hayworth, who decides on a career choice. Along the way, we get the usual shabby treatment of marriage and an insidiously stupid end. All in all a memorable movie, except as a showcase for Hayworth's beauty.
