I bought Jack-O a few months ago at a blockbuster video sale, and at that time I did not expect anything out of the ordinary. When I saw it, I realized that not only did I get less than I ever thought possible, but much more. It seems weird, I know. And it is. But it fits in perfectly, considering that the ultimate craze is "Jack-O" the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie follows a boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow he is marked by the relatives of his relatives for the death of a crazy, sensitive man with a pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's great-grandfather uncle cousin and so on. Now that the villain has been revived, Shawn's death is obviously crucial to his hell-mission of revenge. Anyway, there's a lot of "horror" as Jack-O makes his way through various neighbors before he fights with Shawn to the end. Find every value in this movie. I can honestly say that Jack-O is one of the worst-produced movies in the history of the time. The acting is dead (unless it should be), the script seems to be a first class project, and the production budget should not exceed $ 150. Some of the most ridiculous death scenes are featured in this antithriller, and they are all the more humorous when you realize that director Steve Latshaw seems to be really serious in his movie. <br /> <br /> really enjoyed the movie. I can call it a horrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say I had a great time seeing it with my friends and have seen it several times since the fateful first look. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this film unbearable and unnecessarily time-consuming, and that's understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously, you'll find Jack-O as an instant classic that's also understandable. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so hard to judge this movie. If I rated Jack-Os quality as a movie, I would not give anything for it. In fact, the studio owed me stars. However, if I rate it for pure pleasure, I would award an 8 or 9. I give a 4, so somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone to go out, rent this and make their own conclusion.
