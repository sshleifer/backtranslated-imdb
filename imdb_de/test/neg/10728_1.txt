See Dick work. <br /> <br /> See Jane work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> You are successful. <br /> <br /> You have a son. <br /> <br /> You have a nice house. <br /> <br /> You have a Latino housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The housekeeper teaches Spanish to the son. <br /> <br /> The son speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Ha-ha. <br /> <br /> See how Dick gets promoted. <br /> <br /> The pompous CEO is a crook. <Br /> <br /> See how Dick chooses the pompous CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane gives up her job. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane at work. <br /> <br /> Dick & Jane turn to the crime. <br /> <br /> As a plotter, they decide to rob the CEO. <br /> <br /> See the robbery be botched. <br /> <br /> See how Dick & Jane finances the company's retirement plan with the proceeds of robbery. <br /> <br /> Yay. See the credits. <br /> <br /> Okay, so you have the plot. In addition, Dick and Jane take care of each other from one scene to the next. Hardly any connection to the last or the next. The whole thing is terribly episodic. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey did not bother to bring his "A" material, he just seems bored and a bit ashamed. But damn, if you get paid over $ 20 million, why bother? Tea Leoni is hectic. I think I would be insane if I did not blame myself for this flop. <br /> <br /> Dick & Jane just have something. Carrey and Leoni are not funny and have little chemistry. The script is not funny. And it is not well planned. <br /> <br /> But it can be bigger. The reality of Dick and Jane may be a bit too real. Maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their job in an Enron-like situation when real life is still lacking a happy ending.
