OK, Chuck Norris has shown in many entertaining films over the years. This is not one of them. I will not even try to deal with the conspiracy of a biblical delivery. The "play" of the main characters is as wooden as if Pinocchio had done a better job! The synthesizer-based soundtrack is even worse than Deathstalker's. While traditional low-budget spooky films often try to capture their audiences through much graphic violence, they try to catch an audience by throwing religious mambo jumbos at the viewer. The plot results in different versions of the Bible.
