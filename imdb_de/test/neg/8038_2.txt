This is one of those "family" movies that I can not imagine being called on for over 9 years. Secret passage in the country house of her eccentric uncle, to which they were evacuated from the London Lightning. ... and there you have it, all in one sentence.

The only reason I can look at it is to see how much Freddie Highmore's outstanding talent sets himself apart from the rest of the mediocre performances.
