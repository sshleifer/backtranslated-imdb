The back of the DVD for this film raves: "Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films." This is less of an insult to Quentin than to Christian films. This film is poorly written, stiff and edited with a purposeless intensity. The scenes take place in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice timelapse shots. Flashbacks, crossfades, grayscale, stills to determine the time (unimportant in the story) are all done for obvious reasons, except to give the film more cinematic credibility. The camera is arbitrary, some beautiful crane shots are cut with ridiculous mounts that have no meaning. Due to poor blocking and lighting, the viewer is asked in many scenes who is talking to whom. Oh and the audio is terrible. The special effects were decent and luckily limited. But that's all technical. The film can not engage on an emotional level. The dialogue is so wrong, and the actors seem to have just read it for a moment before the camera was shot. The story ... the things that happen in a row have no motivation. The characters struggle to get the one-dimensionality under control. And the characters have to deal with Christianity and faith in every scene. Take a queue of M. Night. Christian films do not have to have the name of Jesus Christ in every scene for the movie to be Christian. Quality! Do not try to show this to your unsaved friends with other expectations than laughter.
