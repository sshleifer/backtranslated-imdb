Is this a game FMV or a movie? To be honest, I have seen this from "freedom of choice". It is a huge waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It seems like HK movies are going in the opposite direction of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Try to put more effort and money into a production and we want to see, rather than something you want to look at us. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so terrible as they are from the early to mid-90s with low resolution (as compared to today's movie. <br /> <br /> The way how they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the Wing Commander game of the '90s, the third installment of the series, stop regressing and let's take in the asian look compared to the big guns in Hollywood looks so bad. <br /> <br /> Sure, they have big budgets and better actors, but we have some of the oldest stories, myths and legends, the best technophiles, and possibly the biggest computer graphics talent base in the world! So went so wrong? Have you started using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many movies? Please stop wasting time and money, which is why HK movies are going down so fast have go e not claiming to be the Hollywood of the Orient? Guess not.
