This is like a school video project and a propaganda film that sleeps both the class and the teacher. <br /> <br /> Boring long quiet (yes, silent) strings of disconnected video clips. <Br /> <br /> Instead of this movie, you should see the paint dry or the grass grow - it will be more interesting, unless you enjoy seeing Arabs are vicious to anyone around them. Sulieman (the director) should be embarrassed by this lame film waste. <br /> <br /> She earns one for movie quality, one for the ridiculous propaganda message, and a negative number for the script (or lack thereof).
