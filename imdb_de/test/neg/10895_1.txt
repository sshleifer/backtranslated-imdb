This movie must be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a movie. The spectacle is terrible, the tension is minimal and the plot as a whole is ridiculous. I found myself rooted that the victim hastened and became a victim because she obviously had to be ripped out of her misery. Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will be immediately disgusted by the leaps we make in logic, and the so-called pushy build-up would be fortunate enough that a three-year-old person is slightly disturbed. I'm upset that a sequel is planned, because that means they'll ask us once again to swallow a sub-par plotline. If this is an example of Raw Feeds work, I think I will avoid any future movies from them.
