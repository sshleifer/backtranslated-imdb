B. Kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and amplifying a gigantic left western (not as left as the G. Kennedy episode that came afterwards). <br /> <br /> This is the ugliest movie of the two sequels? looking very ugly. It's Slapdash. B. Kennedy has strengthened it, but without having the genius for it. Hundreds of peons, hundreds of Mexican comrades, hundreds of women, a desert, barren landscapes, a storm - the largest scale. <br /> <br /> Everything in this awkward sequel, which is oddly sympathetic, is wrong <br /> <br /> The movie itself looks very ugly. Brynner, who played the best role in the first film, does not look good in this movie at all. Rey plays a priest; Quintero will be a political leader in the next episode of the franchise. <br /> <br /> If you have so many characters, you may not need a very interesting storyline. sometimes. Brynner meets McQueen, for example; then select other "compadres"; or, B. Spencer meets Coburn; It's fun to see where and how they'll meet the rest of the crew, etc. But at least you need these different characters. Unfortunately, the rate of Burt Kennedy is not very good. <br /> <br /> The return of the Seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Vin and Chris meet there; You decide to save the third survivor of the original Magnificent? Chico, who belongs to a huge group of 300 peons abducted by the Mexican bandits. We find out the name of Chico's appealing wife - it's Petra. Chris has to form a small army again? And here we have a Dirty Dozen party? Chris selects his men from the convicts. Another member of the squad is a womanizer who will take care of the wives without husbands. The sexual humor in this film is particularly unpleasant and unpleasant. It strives to be smart and spicy. it's just boorish and stupid and crude. <br /> <br /> The choice of members of the small army was one of the greatest joys in the McQueen movie. Unfortunately, in the first sequel, the most memorable of the three crews gathered under the name Magnificent Seven. Robert Fuller makes a lousy "Vin"; Oates is the smiley womanizer. <br /> <In this seemingly gigantic attempt, a Mexican revolutionary leader has a gigantic plan. He abducts 300 peons and builds a village and a church in memory of his lost sons. (Needless to say, this crazy Mexican revolutionary is not the role of gelding in the first movie.) B. Kennedy focuses exclusively on the camp and beyond: top stuff: ugly landscapes, a thunderstorm, gigantic lightning, a desert. A great fight between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary Vaqueros. Of course, Return of the Seven (1966) has completely abandoned the good sense of the McQueen movie. <br /> <br /> What's particularly shocking is that this sequel came pretty fast after the original movie, but everything changed in the meantime. The way Westerns are made. <br /> <br /> Both sequels seem funny.
