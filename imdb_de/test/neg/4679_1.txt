The use of the term "comedy" in relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and even worse is the pain inflicted on the viewers of this production. Almost nothing was funny. <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of stand-up comics traveling the streets as they traveled from city to city to perform in small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that their conversations and their behavior are indistinguishable off stage and on stage, but also sad and equally unremarkable. However, it is more difficult to understand the sounds of the audience. Perhas these are the same audiences for whom the lame sitcoms are meant to be on television. This may have been the worst movie I've ever seen in my over 50 years of screenings.
