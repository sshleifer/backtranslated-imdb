One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes, I know that I am not the target audience. The target audience is women, either college, middle-aged, or any age, I think. I'm not one of them, so the makers do not mind if I do not like it. But that can not excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are terrible. The main character Phoebe travels to Europe to find out what happened to her sister Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is an inhuman figure that I hope nobody identifies. Faith is also a figure that is not very credible. Wolf is the only person who seems reasonably reasonable. As I said, the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot sometimes makes stupid things. The worst thing is that the father of Phoebe and Faith is an artist, but his pictures are absolutely terrible. There is nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this film. If you are a type, you will pray for the end. If you are a chick, you may be able to sit through it, but you are unimpressed.
