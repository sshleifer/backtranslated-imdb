I made the mistake of seeing "Dark Star" (1974) one night many years ago. It was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad show. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad writing. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientifically stupid act. (Destruction of an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or in the way only makes things worse: instead of having a large, easily avoidable object, you must track thousands of smaller but equally deadly and difficult objects.) Br /> <br /> 4. Totally unrealistic characters. A painted water polo as a space alien? The authors must have taken too many drugs. Not surprisingly, most of the actors who starred in Dark Star have never done anything else. Of those who did anything else, the majority after Dark Star never acted again. That's why it was a Death Star for his acting career to have Dark Star in his acting resume!
