While everyone in this film does a decent job, I agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, much to a script with no experiment on really talented actors. Therefore, it is not enough to keep your attention. Still, there are some really funny moments, one with Dylan McDermott and a blazing shot glass that I think anyone who was drunk would find it as funny as me; the other is a split second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover does his usual nutty twitch-fest guy and does it well Harry Dean Stanton does his usual nutty patriarch (Repo Man, anyone?) Etc. Only a few gems, seconds.
