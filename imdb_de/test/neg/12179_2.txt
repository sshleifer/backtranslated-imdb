Intelligence agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) was assigned to protect the wife of the elected president, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has her hands full. She is the victim of numerous assassinations, all headed by the president's chief of staff, who wants to kill the First Lady. This movie insults your intelligence not only with the plot, but also with the lack of realistic locations. For example, in the scene showing the Inaugural Parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with Agent Killion and without the President. We also know what Washington, DC, is like in January, and not only everyone is "Top Coat", but you can even see some palm trees at 70 degrees and sunny weather! (Filmed in Hollywood, of course, not in Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. It is not worth your time.
