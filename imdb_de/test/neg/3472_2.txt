Take a look at the miniseries "I, Claudius" produced by the BBC. That was just shit. The drama was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera. Hans Matheson was irritating. The cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation upon repeated inspection. Even Caligula was tame. I think this film was tacitly supported by "religious" groups that are supposed to be nameless;). The obvious tones of Christian favoritism and the persecution were blatant when hinted at. Stay away from whatever you do - the runtime is so long that I could read Harry Potter's first book faster than the time it took me to watch this trip. <br /> <br /> Italy has done better - do not let Hans sweet face fool you. He's not a great actor ... he's a great boredom.
