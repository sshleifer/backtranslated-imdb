The French make either pro-Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - with a few. "Merci pour le chocolat" is the last of this genus. From the opening credits, which tells the viewer what music is played and by whom the composer was composed, you know that you will fall into the middle class's claim. It's a movie of an old man with an excess of over 40 plus people. It is also run by an old man and an old crew who have nothing to tell the viewer about life. The plot is not only banal, but absurd. How many movies show the conspiracy in the dialogue, just to repeat the same message about flashback after about five minutes? Maybe the director and the actors had a low remanence capacity? In truth, there is no durable conspiracy at all. It's a riddle with holes like a good piece of French cheese. <br /> <br /> Whether intended or not, it's a movie about the bourgeoisie. At least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the sophisticated dwarfs who are represented in every scene. I admit that there are some well-framed shots, though they could not use a steady cam in this movie - it would have awakened them all! Apart from a nonsensical story, the film allows the upper middle class to show their values ​​and vanity in a very comfortable location in Switzerland. A crucial line of the movie is when Rodolphe tells Pauly Anna Mouglalis that she does not have to lock her car while she's at the resort! Oh my dear. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, Miss Huppert comments on how she sheds a wrong tear for a scene. Grinning, she says, "Like in the American Actor's Studio!" I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the Actor's Studio. <br /> <br /> If there's a statement that sticks out in my head, it's when Huppert realizes we have friends for the weekend and all the servants are gone. No doubt they had all fled the mental set so they would not be associated with such a vile movie. In the film, they show a hot brew with hot water covered with ointment and a bandage. This should never happen. Only cold water should be used. <br /> <br /> minus 10 marks.
