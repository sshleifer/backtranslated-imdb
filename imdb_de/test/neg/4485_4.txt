I was persuaded to see this from a friend. John was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and looks great without a shirt! I thought it was a love story about both, but it was mostly about his reactions to her letters. Savannah was a sympathetic figure at the beginning of the film, but when she dropped him, I lost respect for her. She said it tore her away and it was hard - he was a million miles away, he killed people and the only contact he got was over her letters !!! She did not have a hard time, she had family and money and he had a business trip !! I ended up feeling so frustrated when he forgave her - he was too much of a sweetheart. I would have waited the three years and welcomed him home with open arms.
