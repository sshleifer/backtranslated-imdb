I can not say that I was surprised by this cruelty when I saw her a few months or weeks ago (can not remember). I saw it as a two-part episode of Zoey 101 because they showed it here in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed at the makeover a nerd thing, superficial, negative, biased and stereotypical are the people in the entertainment industry and honestly I am extremely angry. It was not funny at all. A nerd is a clich√© and makes people very offended. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the people in Zoey 101 do not have any real problems. Logan has a big house, he has a famous father, he has everything and Zoey is also rich. You never have to deal with what today's teens and teens are dealing with, such as peer pressure and stereotype issues. The actors are terrible too. Jamie Lynn Spears does not deserve to be as successful on a TV show as Zoey 101 (what's wrong with the world?), She has no talent as an actor. She is even worse than Britney! The thing with Chase and Zoey was unbelievably predictable. I mean, how could the show continue with Zoey and Chase? What other problems could they possibly have? Apart from the fact that Chase does not get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! The absolutely worse 48 minutes of my television life. Ever. 0/10 (and that's generous)
