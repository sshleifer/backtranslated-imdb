I could not watch this movie for more than 10 minutes. It has set the standard. I'll never give a movie a 1 again, unless it was as horrible as this one. I completely agree with the other comments on this film. But since I'm Dutch, I've seen it with Dutch translation. Apparently they did not have the money for a correct translation, so they decided to babelfish them. With sometimes funny results. <br /> <br /> Do not smoke, do not drink, do not take drugs, do not look at Demon Summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can not believe I just said that.) The script (Was There?) Not in the hands during shooting. I think they did a good job as well ... Well ... um ... no, they did not do a good job at all.
