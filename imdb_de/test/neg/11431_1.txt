With a sense of humor that would appeal to an exclusive, small audience, the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network advertised this show, it looked like it was a big drama or event, complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep. In the air, I was disappointed with how all the characters were so one-dimensional and one totally bland animation. The only thing that came close to humor was the names of the characters, such as "Private Public" and "General Specific," a few vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington struck sheep with her steel wig. <Br /> <br /> Slightly out of the subject, but I do not understand why Sheep should fall in love with this ball of dirty cotton balls called Swanky. It was terrible!
