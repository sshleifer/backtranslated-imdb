If you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it's a classic or a trash. Guess which category SOLO falls into. Apparently from a popular science-fiction novel, WEAPON, SOLO donated Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot, who decides to think for himself and is therefore destined for destruction. He hides in a Mexican village, apparently to save money on locations and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is there when one of the robots and soldiers wanted to destroy Van Peebles. Van Peebles, of course, manages to defeat them all with ease, while Corbin watches this with confusion from a distance. The film is a terrible rip-off in the series THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG and apparently has little to do with the source material. It is terribly written and acted, and the great fight in the end, when it is extremely funny. Van Peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a hoot when he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh. He looks like he's doing Robot Dance most of the time.
