I was hoping to like this movie to get me into a fun evening. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed far enough away to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I always had to doze off again. Judy Davis performed well, but had very little to do. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. The plot was full of "twists" that were just stupid, and as so often happens in films of this type, no one acted as a real human acted. Personally, I thought Marcia Gay Harden was a total failure. <br /> <br /> The film also seemed to shift from a black comedy with a hint of farce to a farce with a hint of black comedy. One reviewer notes that other reviews seem to call this movie something else, and that's why they did the movie badly. All I can say is that I decided that the movie * is * something and sticks to it. He has the feeling that the director had some great ideas, but he could not reach them all. I give a 4 out of 10 points.
