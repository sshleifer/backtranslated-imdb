I mean, you just have to love the Italian film industry. Someone had an action film after the end of the world ("Road Warrior"), and the Italians were busy for years, one rip-off after another. Then another came with a successful barbarian movie ("Conan") and the Italians were busy ... eh, see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to countless other variations of the theme (one of my favorites is Umberto Lenzi's "The Barbarians" with the Paul twins), the Ator series was created. And this, the second, is probably the worst (or the best, depending on your point of view). Ator is put back into action by his old teacher, who discovered a kind of nuclear power. Of course, this has to be protected so that it does not fall into the wrong hands. The old man sends his daughter to Ator, and after some complications Ator, his buddy Tong and the girl back in the castle, which has fallen victim to some of the evildoers (of course, an old "classmate" of Ator). Somewhere along the way, the heroic trio forgets the conspiracy and eliminates a huge snake worship cult for fun (not before some virgins are sacrificed). Just in time before the madman loses his temper and kills the wise teacher, our heroes remember their duties, inventing hang gliding and grenades and saving the day. <br /> <br /> Includes: terrible action by all involved (especially O'Keeffe), hilarious "special effects" (you just have to worship the snake fight scene, which is a kind of homage to "Bride of the Monster") staged battle scenes, numerous continuity flaws (Ator flies two different hang gliders during the Climatic Battle (pay attention to just one example) and a general misunderstanding of the notion of history (cavemen, "civilized" barbarians, castle builders, all cast in a movie) /> <br /> If you are, like me, devoted to bad movies, this is the series you will see, and you will probably finish ROTFL To the records: The third part, which was filmed in Malta, is quite Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Considering the efforts of Joe D'Amato, this is probably the most entertaining movie, as it certainly did not provide any horror movies or erotic films worth seeing, but I am the one firmly convinced that this was completely coincidental. <br /> <br />
