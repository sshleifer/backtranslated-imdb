I honestly do not know where to start when I review such a pathetic film as Ernest Goes to Africa. Apart from two or three good laughs throughout the movie, there is nothing positive about this one and a half hour waste of time and life. It's unbelievable that someone has been able to pull together a group of people who are ready to cast, film, and edit this trash, and it's even more amazing that this is the eighth episode of the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> In the opening credits of the film, we see Ernest posing next to various African objects, such as wooden masks and the heads of African animals, making faces and gestures that would probably make most 3rd graders laugh. This opening scene gives the viewer an impression of Ernest's frequent attempts to show humor, and shows how his comedy falls flat in 95% of the cases. <br /> <br /> The first thing that really impressed me about this movie is how bad it is to act. Everyone in the movie is a typical C-movie actor, but Linda Kash is especially awful. It is the epitome of overreaction. All her lines are delivered with a shocking inhuman enthusiasm that you would only find in a middle school game. Most high school drama students would probably have been able to replace these actors and perform better. Jim Varney has at least occasional comedy skills, but for the most part of the movie he just looks like a complete delay, he tries to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa, where an archaeologist stole two priceless gems from an African tribe. The gems then return to the United States, where an unknown man is being run by a flea market by several henchmen. He hides them in a bucket of "Two for a Dollar" items and then runs away from the scene. Ernest is looking for a present for Rene, a waitress he likes, and so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems. He brings them back to his house later, paints them and sticks them together for a yo-yo. He gives the Yo-Yo to Rene and she explains that they can never be together because he's just an average shoemaker and she wants an adventurous man. Rene and Ernest are tracked down by the henchmen and then taken to Africa to be held prisoner. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie really does not make sense. As soon as Ernest is in Africa, he falls out of the truck they carry him to and ends up in a river. In the next scene we see him as a Hindu servant called "Hey You". His skin is dark and he is wearing a loincloth. At first I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the movie besides Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy when Hey You started talking. Another scene that stings in my head is completely ridiculous is the chase in the African wilderness. Rene and Ernest have taken a truck with ostrich farmers and are pursued by the henchmen. At a speed of about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road, both retainers fire at Ernest, who is behind the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest on the other hand throws ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver. The henchmen never beat Ernest once during the five-minute chase, but Ernest can fend them off by slapping her and her driver in the face, diverting her car from the road, and exploding in a huge column of smoke. I should also add that Ernest hurls two eggs at once from a big bra. <br /> <br /> The set design is also incredibly bad in this movie. There is a large part of the film in which Rene and Ernest are traveling in Africa trying to find civilization. During their migration, we see them walking through fields and jungles that would probably have been shot throughout the United States. The fields are just grassy fields, and there's no sign that they're anywhere near Africa (they could have added at least some African trees in the background), and the jungles look like the woods of rural Connecticut with paper mache - skulls, grapevines and thorns hanging on trees. According to IMDb.com, the movie was actually shot in South Africa, but I still would not believe it. <br /> <br /> The movie continues, Ernest, a joke after Ernest Joke. The rest of the movie does not make sense either. The African tribesmen all speak English for a reason, and Ernest is later challenged by the leading henchman to a "Battle of Truth," who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja but is also something of a bondage submissive , The henchman has a table with axes, swords, knives, and clubs, while Ernest has a sandwich table, a teddy bear, and some other worthless items. However, Ernest wins the fight and somehow saves the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's painful to watch this movie. I could not do it in one sitting; I had to stop halfway and make something productive to balance the lost brain cells while trying to appreciate Varney's humor. You should put a general warning of the surgeon on the box to let people know that they are actually lagging behind after finishing this movie. I would say that of all the films I have ever seen, none is as similar as Ernest Goes to Africa.
