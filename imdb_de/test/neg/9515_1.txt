When I chose my "1" for this film, I noticed that 75 people out of 146 total voices were in the same mood. This means that half of the people who voted for this film feel it's really awful. I saw this at a film festival not too long ago and was really unimpressed by the bad performance. Cinematography is hard to beat, the sound is bad, the story is cut and pasted from many other films, and acting is terrible. This movie is basically a bad rip-off of three other movies. No wonder this has never been released in the US.
