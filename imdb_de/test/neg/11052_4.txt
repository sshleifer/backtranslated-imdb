Luckily I did not see this movie in a movie, on a big screen, just on a small screen. I doubt I could have the movie in a movie theater and see the violence in the movie. After looking at the first 30 minutes, I became disappointed and curious. <br /> <br /> Disappointed because of the hard-to-follow plot, the barely comprehensible screens, the great aggressiveness - I still do not know why they showed me how the Daesu (main character) pulls out another person's teeth, his beast against women, he cuts out his tongue. And also curious to see what the movie is going to conclude, which is the final summary of all this brutality. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was not boring, I did not get the answer to all this cruelty that I had to watch from beginning to end. In my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is Kill Bill 1-2. If you want blood more meaningful, you can record all current war movies, and if you want an Eastern movie, there are much better titles out there. Afterwards, I will take the reviews of the Cannes Film Festival with greater caution, as Oldboy was indeed praised by the jury, but she had not much to say to me and had only 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <I'm hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious with true feelings and a clear message.
