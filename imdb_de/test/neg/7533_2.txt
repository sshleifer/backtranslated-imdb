With Pep Squad averaging 4.7 on IMDb.com, it's no wonder Steve Balderson slandered this site. However, the fact is that Pep Squad is a poorly built "black" "comedy" (both words in quotation marks for a reason). It's a movie full of over-acting (Cherry, Beth's mother), paired with a few lethargic performances (Beth and Julie's friend). A movie in which you can watch cars in a bright red jeep from fifteen meters away and never be noticed. A movie full of not so appetizing cleavage and nudity, asking yourself, "Does the director find this funny? Or smart?" Most of all, the characters are so thin and poorly developed that the movie is pretty unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. Pep Squad can not decide if he wants to be a comedy or a drama or a satire (patriotic music, I understand ...). The film can not be taken seriously because the idea of ​​killing a school post (this is Prom Queen) pushes the line into insanity (not to mention flagfire and drive-by shots, a bad attempt, controversial and nervous) and fails to be a comedy for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes (Big Butt Mama, "funky" black principle, and excessive cursing that the lead actor did poorly). If you look at the documentary "Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere", this movie just got more horrible, with praise for ... the director and the director's father ... hmmmmmm. No black comedy or anything. I think Kansas will have to wait.
