Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? No moment is worth it. Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies ... and it's not the dinos! Tea Leoni ... I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she was the bottom line. I'm wondering if she did a vocal chord during the shoot ... Laura Dern ... she's alright, but why not stand out in the movie? Alessandro Nivola - "have you ever called anything of facial expression? Fellings, emotions ..." ... he has to work harder on that! Sam Neil, no big deal. The soundtrack ... needs to change the record or you'll be sick of it. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor I've never met. He can not save the movie nor the computer-generated dinosaurs.
