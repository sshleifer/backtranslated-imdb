IMPRESSIVE! What a terrible, abominable waste of time proved this cruel cruelty. I remember that I saw it years ago and thought it was fun, but now ... it's just silly. Not to mention the fact that it's a blatant rip-off of "The Exorcist" to the point where it was re-released under the title "The Sex-orcist". The only real difference is that the producers are having trouble further discrediting themselves by tapping on the claim that the events in the movie are REAL. Who would really believe such a bold lie when properly reasoned? To make matters worse, there was a cover art video release that obviously tried to play out on the Rocky Horror Picture Show by throwing a pair of lips on the cover! How deep could you sink? Do not be fooled by the false claims, blatant lies or title prints, because you will be very disappointed!
