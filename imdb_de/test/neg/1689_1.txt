I detest, detest and hate this movie with a passion that makes the red, hot gates of hell seem cold in comparison. It is nothing more than a terrible, frightening and absolutely modest journey into the past, into this oh-so-evil time, the 70s, a decade. I'm glad I was not part of it, if this absolute fate was all that was offered! <br /> <br /> the animation is morbidly outdated, not least with its sticky, missing frames and characters with huge, bulbous heads. This movie is a true miracle cure. From knowingly nodding to the parents with the cheerfully gay seahorse, and it's bearing hand gestures and kenneth williams-like voice, to the frank, unusually droll hymn, High Cockalorum, this movie is sad to say I was forced upon me as a kid and I have never completely recovered from the horror it caused me ... <br /> <br /> This terrible display of utter awfulness should bring an R-certified certificate, so disturbing that it's content!
