The idea of ​​bringing Dracula to the present is not bad - after all, she could revive the series a little by putting a new story element into a series that Hammer almost exhausted in a long series of generally excellent films Has. However, since today's day turned out to be a crappy early 70's, the results were pretty stupid and looked more like LOVE AT FIRST BITE (a deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in a movie filled with 70s hip-lingo and e-guitar chords and ridiculous rock music just seemed stupid. To make matters worse, acting is exaggerated here - with an intense and stupid performance of "Johnny Alucard". I also found it very funny that Van Helsing's grandson noticed that "Alucard" is "Dracula", spelled backwards - nobody else found out for himself! Wow, what a cunning! <br /> <br /> Why was the movie so bad, why it got an almost respectable grade of 4 anyway? Well, when the story came to the expected showdown between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. Besides, and I know this will sound very sexist, but if I had to see a bad movie, at least Stephanie Beacham's character wore some really nice outfits that revealed her rich talent ... "talents," so to speak. At least it was a nice movie. By the way, the movie ends with the phrase "May he rest in FINAL peace," even though this was not the last Hammer Dracula movie with Lee. A short time later he returned for "The Satanic Rites of Dracula" and in many ways was even worse than this movie of a monster movie.
