I can not believe that I saw this whole movie. Another "Ishtar", in which I have been constantly waiting for things to get better, which never happened. The sound is awful, it becomes too quiet to hear the conversations, and can become a loud noise within seconds. The plot is utterly implausible, acting is mediocre, though Keaton does his usual good work as a spiritual case, though it could be quite negative if typified in that role. The director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, medicines, science or technical things. "Sociopath" ???? I wonder how they got that diagnosis. There are so many mistakes, mistakes and things that are not right with this film. Listing them all might set some record. Demerol as a complete narcotic? A motorcyclist on the highway with a non-DOT / Snell off-road helmet. San Francisco ??? The walls of the paper move as they tap, the helmets appear only from the air, the guns point in one direction, but strike into another, the light appears and disappears and there is hardly a scene in the movement that contains no errors. My wife, who is an RN in an oncology department, eventually left the room before the end of the movie, which was angry over all medical errors. I only gave him a 2 because Keaton played, otherwise it would surely have got a 1.
