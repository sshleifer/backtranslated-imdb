Okay, I'm sorry for the cast and crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen. It could have been better (especially in some parts), but it was "okay". Then there was the cheapest video camera (they used). The violence was pretty good. If it ran faster, it would be fantastic, but they do not (* sigh *) ... be afraid. The horrors were well written (in the script), but not well done. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) One girl is half in the attic and the other half is in the dark, lower part of the barn, then she gets it. The monster tears it down and then you hear someone's guts being ripped out. The fear could have been better if the music were not torn from a cheap horror sounds CD. The blood effects were pretty good, but the blood was like "kill bill". K. B. It took off because it should resemble old kung fu movies, but if the crew can not tell the difference between red and pink ... it's sad. The tattered bodies in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for $ 25 in a Halloween shop. Do not be fooled by the blanket, the costumes are shit! My overall grade is 3/10. If you're interested in independent movies, just being satisfied, or just having $ 3 in your pocket, head to Blockbuster and see the horror of failure.
