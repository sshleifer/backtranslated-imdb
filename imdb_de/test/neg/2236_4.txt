This is "realism"? When Rivette sought a study of a woman in a particular place and time and how she was able to influence (and was influenced by) the world around her, he failed miserably. Most prominently, because we never know why thousands of men followed her into battle. There are certainly not enough explanations about the cultural / historical context to define the country's need for such a savior, and God knows there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan as presented here. Unless Bonnaire's wooden posture and flat readings point to transcendent faith and determination. The use of landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling that we are watching actors from the twentieth century wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape. And as for the battle scenes (which, contrary to some claims, account for some 15% of the screen time) - they look like a historic club from your local high school recreating a medieval siege, though the kids would do that, no doubt more passion into it. However, I applaud Rivette for introducing a side of Joan that has been left out of other films: that of an irritable, na√Øve and narcissistic youth (played by a woman at least twice the size of the character, which she should be) obviously unable to understand her place within the movement that she helped shape or the world outside of her own passions. Joan's outrage at her own soldiers, who swear and wonder about their lack of respect and obedience to the enemy, is extremely spontaneous and credible (you suddenly realize that such moments have occurred naturally) in an otherwise inexpensive historical "account." Unfortunately, they also serve to point out exactly what's not onscreen - what made Joan a SPECIAL? I have to say that I was still confused and frustrated by some foreign movie lovers, equating the boredom and lack of dramatic engagement with "artistry" and "seriousness". Does this film really increase understanding or dealing with the topic? Or with anything for it? 10.4.
