Like other films by the worst director, Ed Wood, this movie is very bad, but that's why it's very funny. Maybe not for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing to enjoy a bad movie. How do you rate it? As a movie very low, as entertainment at least a little higher. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explain what a transvestite is, and he does so by a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot), who talks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell), who knows about these things. The doctor tells the detective two stories, and we see that, and apparently the scientist. The doctor tells these stories because a dead transvestite is found, suicide, and because of a headline in the newspaper about a sex change. The first and longest story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself), who is in love and about to marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but he never told her that he likes to dress as a woman when he's called Glenda. The film tells the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily homosexual. The movie almost says that being a transvestite is not bad, but being homosexual, as it keeps telling us that a transvestite is not a homosexual. The second story is about a transvestite who really wants a sex change and does not want to dress up just as a woman, but is much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> A few things make this movie very interestingly bad and therefore ridiculous. How the story is presented is the first, the way in which the same things are told over and over, and the conclusion of it is different. It does not end here. Acting is very bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to read her lines directly from a small screen. Everything she says is funny. The whole dialogue actually made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There is also a sequence in which someone enters a room. The door stays half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not quite straight. Then the door in which it seems to be the same shot, although we know that it is not, is a little less open and suddenly the thing is hanging on the wall straight. Ed Wood did not mind leaving such continuity flaws in his film. It can be a good thing because it is just another laugh for the modern audience. I think you understand it's a bad movie, and I think there's a good chance you'll laugh at the ridiculous mistakes.
