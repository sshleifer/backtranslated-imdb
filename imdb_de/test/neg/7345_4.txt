The story is about to be read by credulous businessman Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who sees a case in which another priest is suspected of murder. The priest denies that he is guilty, but can not discuss the matter because of confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens, who plays cop ... <br /> <br /> Even if the plot is not ridiculous, everything else is. Let's start with the visual side, the cinematography is boring, it looks more like a television series than a movie. The camera angles are boring, there is no single camera angle in the entire film. There are no interesting close-ups revealing details. And the scene transitions, well, there is not much to say about that, they are not smooth at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot. Okay, they've used a transition with music between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions throughout the movie. The times were dissolved, and there was no visual connection between the scenes. The visual part could be omitted if the film offered something different. Unfortunately, the film offers only forced playing wood and awkward dialogue without a punch. In addition, the film suffers from audio problems, the volume is lowered several times in the film, as if the microphones were too far. <br /> <br /> I did not predict the solution of the movie. It could be that the film never gave me the opportunity or it could have been due to the presentation, which was so boring that I never tried to find it out B-movie, where 'B' is boring.
