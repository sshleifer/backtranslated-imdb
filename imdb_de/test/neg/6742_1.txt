This movie is so bad that there are no words to describe it. If I had a video camera from a monkey dancing for an hour and a half, that would be a bit more entertaining than this. The plot is so boring and unimaginative that it is not even worth mentioning. The best part of the movie was when the credits rolled and I got a giggle when I knew the lead actor's name was James Bond III. Just trust me and stay away from this garbage heap!
