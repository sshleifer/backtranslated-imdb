Oh, how the critics fell themselves to praise their Goldenboy Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out. I never saw the qualities they discovered when watching this movie back then. I looked at it again to see if I got it wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a cool, unobtrusive film about an author who lives / works in a cool, funky culture. The shallow adjustments do not catch your attention because they are emotionally impulsive and dizzying. And the rest are just awful there ... with soldiers singing songs about masculinity to which they commit themselves, about purity, the admiration of swords, etc., you learn that you have landed Philip Glass. but then you have to get something out of it. Glasses score does not differ from his other works and gives the film no perceptible value. In 2010, everyone should realize that Schrader has wasted his career due to the work's lack of meaning or importance (Cat People, Auto Focus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). It can burn you to pieces and kill the impulse of a movie, faster than any other. Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.
