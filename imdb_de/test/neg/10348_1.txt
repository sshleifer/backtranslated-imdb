Do I have to say more? The reason the GOOD Australian version of Kath and Kim, as mentioned, was good, was due to their hilariously funny originality. The reason why this new American version is so terrible is that many of them are taken directly from the original. Not to mention the infidelity of the characters. Kath should be a Dag. Kim should be fat. Kel (or Phil, as they baptized him) is said to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is considered a loser, not a person who behaves like heroin and ends every sentence with "Dude." Thankfully that Szubanski did not sell her rights to Sharon, she would probably be a tall, thin blond woman who likes Kim. They are not meant to look apart for two years. And they are not supposed to giggle like schoolgirls. This show is a shame to even share the same title as the Australian version. America: Get your own TV shows.
