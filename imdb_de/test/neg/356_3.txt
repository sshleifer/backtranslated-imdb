Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. Mr Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented Curmudgeon role seems forced and even uncomfortable and not funny. The film itself is full of sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is shown numerous references to religious beliefs and US patriotism, which are more exaggerated than honest. Clifton Webb does his best with a bad script. Edmund Gwenn is still playing a merry clergyman and has nothing to do. The child actor's lead is played by a talentless kid that has a flat effect throughout the movie. His only claim to be known as a performer is obviously a bullfrog-like deep voice that is unusual for someone his age. However, as soon as you hear it, you have heard it and do not need to hear it anymore. Unfortunately, he is in most scenes of the movie. I find this kid so irritating that I always rewind when it shows up. Since he has many scenes in this movie, that means I'm going through a lot of the movie. There were and are so many talented child actors; It is a pity that this movie does not contain any of them. Nevertheless, Clifton Webb is a sight to behold with the traditional hat and wide-brimmed shorts.
