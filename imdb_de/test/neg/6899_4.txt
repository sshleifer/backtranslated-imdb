This film seemed to be composed very quickly in plot and graphics. My two daughters were ready 30 minutes before the end of the movie, which rarely happens when we go to the theater. This was a Nickelodeon production, and it would have been better if they were on t.v. would have been published. Railway station. The animation itself was in some parts o.k. but the conspiracy was terrible. A classic story about a son trying to fulfill a father's expectations is used in many children's films, but the animation or graphics must be really good to get a child's attention. This was not the case with this film. There were also awkward elements between the male protagonist and the female protagonist, which the plot could do without.
