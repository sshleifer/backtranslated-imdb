It is unfortunate that between this film, The Valley of Elah, Lions for Lambs, and Home of the Brave, all are based on common stereotypes about veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The drinking, the fighting, the short fusions, the broken marriages, the guys who freak out and dig a foxhole when they're drunk, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> It happens - yes, but not like that often, as one would think, after seeing one of these films. I find it regrettable that these directors / producers / writers choose to drag their ax against the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an atypical way. Kimberly Peirce has not even bruised us in this film, such as the new children born when a family member was born, or the child who grew up in a ghetto and can afford a college thanks to the GI bill or the couple who can afford a house or start a new business, etc., and so on. Instead, we are treated to the stereotypes because the people who made that movie just want to show you the bad side , <br /> <br /> A few problems with the movie itself: 1) Someone screwed it up by using Phillippe for a Bronze Star with V after leading his squad down a narrow lane after being hit by one Gunner had been dressed in a taxi. Pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) The Humvees had no tower armor, so we're supposed to believe it's almost a war's beginning, but every soldier and his brother have an ACOG and any facility for their M4? Sorry, do not think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as a lieutenant colonel? It's hard to believe, but I've just checked that he turned 40 in May, so the timing is not too late. 4) He kills two soldiers after saying that he would not return to Iraq (after learning that he had a stop-loss). So he is a refugee. When he finally logs off and they bring him back, he keeps his rank and is deployed with the same unit. Sorry, do not think so. <br /> <br /> I can only call it a huge army and infantry stereotype. Did some of the events in this movie happen to some soldiers, yes. In this film, however, virtually all stereotypes are obtained within about 100 minutes, and as a rule, most soldiers do not look that way. I wish the director had researched a bit, instead of starting her agenda and then making a movie. <br /> <br /> Of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best is probably Lions for Lambs, which rather comments on the sad condition of Generation Y + than the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush Administration. If you really want to keep this movie waiting for cable or Netflix, you do not pay directly for the rental.
