This is supposed to be the story of a man called Wirey Spindell from the age of 8 to 36, who is told by the character at any age in his life. For example, if he is eight, it is the voice of the eight-year-old who makes the narrative. When he's in junior high school, it's the one who makes the story, and so on. That's about the only interesting thing about this movie. It looks like every actor playing Wirey is a character of his own. Not only do they not look alike, their life experiences do not seem to fit together. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a bad cold.
