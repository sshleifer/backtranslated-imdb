It's been over 30 years now, but I still remember that this movie was the worst I've ever seen. I would have thought that something worse had been filmed during this time, but I was wrong. I just saw "STARSHIP TROOPERS" and it was very close to me, but it was still more entertaining than "POOR COW".
