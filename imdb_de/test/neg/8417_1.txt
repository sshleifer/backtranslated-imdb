Okay, enough. Every time I think I've seen a movie that looks so wrong, so bad in every way that I think that no one can find anything to praise, I just come to the IMDb, where I go with the usual nonsense welcome to masterpiece "" GREAT movie "- honestly, in which movie do you watch people, because it's certainly not the mess that I just saw on the new Fox / MGM / UA DVD, there are about three amusing ones Lines and an action that adds a new meaning to the incoherence, and then, after ninety-three endless minutes, it just stops and the credits begin, then there's a scene, the DVD is pretty miserable, which fits in with the movie It is hard to imagine that this film was followed by Get Carter, and the critics and the public got it - it was a stroke of fate and a catastrophe at the box office, and that too Right, but you, the experts, keep trying. And I'll keep trying to find a movie that has NO ONE who raves about it.
