The first season was great - a good mix of job and brother and friends at home. It was really a pretty funny show. <br /> <br /> Now it has reappeared and the brother and the two hot girls are gone - and the whole thing is about the airline. Even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill - far too high up where everything was perfect before. <br /> <br /> That and no Sarah Mason - one of the best looking girls in Hollywood. <Br /> <br /> This happens when you allow some executives to get a show in their hands. You can almost see the meeting "the old man is funny, lets us concentrate on him, makes him far beyond the top and does everything about the airline ... it's going to be a crazy version of the office!" Anyway, no hot girls, no clock.
