I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it, but I was hoping for a good, bad movie. Well, it was fun to console myself over the endless sand, to eat camel dung (well, actually eggplant) and funny faces, which I believe were five actors. The DVD needs a comment from the director so I can find out what he was thinking ... or if he ever was. I can not believe that they actually went to England, Austrialia and wherever to film this ... could have happened EVERYWHERE. Would have been better if they had managed to get her naked. The best line of the movie? "He is waiting for his improvements." "Yes, I am still waiting". Well, that was funny! If someone had more than 3 pages of dialogue (beyond the narrator ... SHUT UP ALREADY), I'll look at it again.
