I've just watched this movie and all I can say is where the car is today. It seems like this was a great second movie on a trip in 1977 (maybe played with one of those movies by Joan Collins), but it's only worth it if you feel nostalgic for the 70s. Stupid action, full of holes, but reminds of an epoch in which it was made. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young, and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though she's not much of an actress. In fact, not much is played in this movie at all. It's a kind of Dukes of Hazzard adventure without a Twang or a 1969 Dodge Charger jumping over things in the woods. But here's a Mecrury comet jumping over a dump!
