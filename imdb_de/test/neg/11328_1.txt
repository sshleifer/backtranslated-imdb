It's hard to believe that such a bad movie could actually be released. The dialogue was unnatural. The portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future stepfather was particularly poor. You could say that they managed to have an unpleasant dialogue, but what was said was wrong and artificial. The tension was simply not there. The music was as bad as it gets. The only reason I saw this movie was that I lived in Death Valley and was curious about which places would appear on the screen. Luckily the movie was on TV and that's why I wasted no money in renting this excuse for a movie! I really believe that most amateurs could put together a more intriguing story than was presented here. It is a pity that the time of a whole film crew was wasted with so much garbage! I think the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the sets were good.
