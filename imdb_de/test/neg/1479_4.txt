So boring that you fall asleep after the first 20 minutes. I'm sorry, Mr Boutonnat, I admire your work (all these beautiful "movies" that you have directed like "Tristana", "Sans logique" etc.), but here the plot is extreme ... in vain! Apart from the great photography, everything seems stupid and there is no jealousy to know what will happen to these "middle" actors. In addition, the dialogues are minimalist. The famous question "Where are the children?" Repeated so many times that it looks like a farce. Believe me, it's a waste of time (in terms of conspiracy) and 3 hours is a long time. Surely the real reason for this mess at the cash register!
