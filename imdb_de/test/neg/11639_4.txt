A black-faced man lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in a sort of hut with a monkey. He connects her with a phone and she teaches him how to bring Charleston. Then they fly away in the spaceship and leave the monkey behind. The short film makes the black movie aside and makes no sense. I think that's the plot, but I'm far from sure. One can not say that Renoir is at work despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow motion. I'm in the series of experimental movie videos of the NY Film Annex, No. 18, I think.
