An interesting Slasher movie with several suspects. <br /> <br /> Includes a typical girl who flashes her breasts (Denise Cheshire) as she changes her swimsuit, a scary suspect Get a top grade (Linnea Quigley), a very unusual forward pass, more bare breasts, an athletics event that will NOT be at the Summer Olympics, and a scary mystery a crushing end. No, there is more. Will not this guy die? I bet Anne (Patch Mackenzie) plans no further home visits any time soon. <br /> <br /> If you like teen slasher movies, you may be perverted, even though all actresses are over 18?
