I officially surrendered in my mouth thanks to this movie. <br /> <br /> I expected the worst for this movie, but I expected a heartwarming and pleasant absolute worst. That's just awful. Absolutely horrible terrible like Nazis spreading the black plague. Let me explain: Ewoks speak English. It is terrible. <br /> <br /> The villain looks like it came out of the future Power Rangers. I really want her to rise from the ground and say, "Finally! After ten thousand years, I am free! It is time to conquer the earth!" The clay ... um, I mean the big bad, no matter what the hell they are ... they growl a lot. Many of them look like an even better version of Cryptkeeper. The cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys were not. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this movie was Paul Gleason. This movie might have been better if he had gone to the bad guys and said, "If I have to come in here again, then I'll crack skulls." It would have been even better if one of the Ewoks were played by Judd Nelson, who formulated his words when he said so. <br /> <br /> Also, this fast little creature is pretty mean. Word about it. <br /> <br /> No word on the movie. I want to give this movie two. I want so much. There is a passage that I have learned by heart: The path of this film is marked on all sides by the injustice of the awfulness and tyranny of secession from awfulness. Blessed is not for this movie.
