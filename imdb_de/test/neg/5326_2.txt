One of the dumbest films in the history of cinema. Wait, I'll take that back - this movie can not be included in a category that refers to "Cinema". it belongs in categories like "waste", quark or similar categories. Ironically, there are even about two garbage agents. The film is "Men At Work," a light-hearted crime comedy starring the Estevez (Sheen) brothers in 1990. Apart from the implausible and implausible plot, bad action, poor dialogue, poorly performed stunts and slapstick, continuity mistakes and high rate of nameless Actors never to be seen again, all in all, it was a pretty bad movie anyway (basically, I mean). It was the kind of movie that could be good for you: you can see it about 200 times, learn each line and, in a camping way, repeat it in public with your * wasted * friends, securing your movie Status as the largest dorks in your tenth grade. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I actually submitted an IMDb trivia entry (along with this bad rating) on ​​the film's IMDb website, if only because I discovered a stupid little one Punk music joke, which apparently nobody has discovered yet (via the Butthole Surfer statue). I'm so undecided why I should even waste my time by delivering something that looks like a supporting little thing, if I really want to blow up Emilio's acting career (no, wait, he did that himself.) Thanks, Age!) I'm so glad I just wasted time, not real money. Can I possibly have at least a tenth of her budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better movies, just with what they burned to blow up cars, carefully placing bikini-clad bimbos in the background and useless extras (followers) in beat up fake suits. I would mention Emilio's writing credentials, but it would be a breeze to call this script "writing" - it's more like crayon-drawn cartoon ideas. And Charlie Sheen, if you read this, I assume that M.A.W. You must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a drunken, hooker-loving Hollywood guy who was not yet grown up. (Oops, I'm sorry, part of your life is not over yet) Get well, "half man." Such a promising talent, so * wasted *? Oh, look, there's that word again.)
