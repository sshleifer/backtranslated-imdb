One of the worst shows ever. The show would start with clever comments that would be totally inappropriate and inappropriate. The fat computer geek was incredible, the Bible barker, the bad girl, who are these actors? I've never heard of any of them except Cole, who was absolutely incredible in this game. Every time he opens his mouth, you expect to hear, "You see children ..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show. The stories were as incredible as the actors. Lahm would be the best way to describe it. Somehow this show makes a Slug like Ice-T more believable than a cop and he has written the worst song about cops ever recorded.
