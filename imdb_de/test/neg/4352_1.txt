This is the slowest movie noir I have ever seen. Very weak scripts only give Jack Palance and Rod Steiger the opportunity to deliver exceptionally good results that were made for a play. Palance and Steiger affirm that they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power, emotion and drama. The story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace, mostly in the living room. Obviously, the director moved the actors in rhythmic circles as they delivered exhaustively long lines to prevent the audience from perceiving the slow tempo. The action takes effect only in the last ten minutes of the film. If you are looking for more depth in a drama, this is not for you!
