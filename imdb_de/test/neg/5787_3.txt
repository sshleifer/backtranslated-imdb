The contemporary chapter of the US Navy's elite underwater demolition team is called ... whatever they want, apparently. Charlie Sheen was made an officer. The story is incredible. Michael Biehn is his instant C.O., but he keeps Charlie on a fairly long leash and one of the guys pays it early, getting killed thanks to Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team spends its free time committing criminal offenses. Mostly this is an exercise with arbitrary shots and paper-thin ethics. These special seals are better than crash test dummies. Some good action scenes counteract the stupid processes.
