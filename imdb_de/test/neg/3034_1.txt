I've had less painful surgery than the time I spent this movie. <br /> <br /> If you try to think, it will be something like a Guy Ritchie Stripe ..... Think again! Production, dialogue, drama, script, film work and plot were the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie. My predilection for all honesty was the credits. Throughout the history of cinema, there has never been a better excuse to turn off the TV and do something better with your life. <br /> <br /> Have root canal works done instead of wasting time and money on these!
