This is one of the most horrible movies I have ever experienced. Do not get me wrong, I love a good zombie strip, but that was not one of them. <br /> <br /> ... Could also (at least from the opening scenes) 'Titty' hot zombies from outer space '. It had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or video game (as far as I could tell.) <br /> <br /> The best aspect of the movie is how the two main characters can be covered with so much blood and stay that way dissatisfied. I would definitely suggest giving it and missing it and staying with a safer zombie fan like '28 Days Later 'or' Dawn of the Living Dead '(the remake, of course, unless you're serious about campaigning).
