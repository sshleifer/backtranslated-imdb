(very serious spoiler) <br /> <br /> this movie was a big disappointment. There are so many problems that I do not know where to start. I'll talk about what's good about the movie. <br /> <br /> The cast was great. Steve Martin delivers a really fun performance from a high-class white middle-aged man. Queen Latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black gal. and eugene levy, well, he pretty much plays himself. Add betty white and jean smart, and you have a great cast - everyone played really well. and if you see these guys for 1.75 hours, that's worth $ 8 for you, then you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But the movie makes many serious mistakes. First of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend anyone. All whites have gone crazy. All blacks are ghetto ebonics speakers. The blacks are hip, cool, with and it's poor. The whites are nerds, stiff and rich. (With the exception of Eugene Levy, he is clearly taken by Queen Latifa and "speaks the language" - so Latifa calls him a "freak".) - If you're a white man and like black women and you know you're a street call a freak). The film is full of overt racist insults towards the black performer, and in turn, the whites are portrayed as idiots and breasts destroying latifas character. she comes to martin's home under false pretense, but martin likes her anyway. She is falsely accused of robbery, Martin attacks her case. 3/4 of the way through the movie, we discover that latifa's character has escaped from prison. So our sympathy for you is out of the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real action. The film varies from scene to scene, with Latifa appearing in a place where she is supposed to be "not" (like a country club or Martin's house) and Martin tries to hide her. That's the ongoing gag. then in the final minutes of the film they decide that they will finally deal with the claim of latifa that they have been wrongly accused of bank robbery. As a homeboy, martin goes undercover to get an (open, useless) confession from latifa's ex-boyfriend, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Finally) This movie seems to be a bunch of clips from other movies. The premise is clearly borrowed from another Martin movie "The House Sitter". where goldie hawn lives with martin and stirs up his rough middle-class life. martin and latifa meet online - ala "youve got mail". The whole "quirky nanny fixes the life of a rich man" reaches to "the sound of music" and "Mary Poppins". <br /> <br /> I would not watch this movie again for free.
