Any person claiming that this movie is a ninja classic must have seen this movie before the mid-nineties, or he was less than 10 years old before he saw it. Otherwise, I can not explain this 'classic ninja movie'. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes in this movie are just unbearable. Instead of occupying Franco Nero as a ninja, they could hire an experienced martial artist instead. In no way is the acting skills in such a movie of importance. Nero's fighting ability is hardly a street fighter in a bar. His kicks and punches are lame. <br /> <br /> There are enough old action movies with good action. That's just a waste of time.
