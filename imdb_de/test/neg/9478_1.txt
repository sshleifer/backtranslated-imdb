Exactly what the world needed - another superficial cookie cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This movie teaches girls everywhere terrible messages with stereotypical "Junior High" experiences. They make the learning of everything completely taboo. I can not stand the fake French accents or the guys on the running mopeds that eventually "fall" for the twins. Why am I putting everything in parentheses? Because it's all stereotypical. The twins even complain that they do not have a stereotypical grandfather. You should be glad that you have a grandfather at all. How does that fit with the Mary-Kate / Ashley form? This one has made her fix a single guy who (her breath !!) IS NOT THE FATHER !!!!! Yes, people, they actually have a mother who appears every five seconds. I have not even spent thirty minutes of it and I can already tell you how it will turn out. This movie is so pathetic that Miss USA looks like an academic dish. Really.
