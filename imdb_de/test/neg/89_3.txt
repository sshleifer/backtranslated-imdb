An artificial melodrama with a script adapted by Mel Dinelli from his drama "The Man" concerns a retiree who picks up a troubled craftsman who may be murderous. Despite the solid work of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both doing their best), this lengthy yarn is not particularly resourceful in its one primary set (which quickly becomes visually boring) and understaffed characters (though there is one smart guy who perceives) the worst!). Hokey and humorless, with a stilted statement from Harry Horner (maybe Lupino should have been directing?). Where is the tension the ads promised? Dinelli also served as co-producer. * 1/2 of ****
