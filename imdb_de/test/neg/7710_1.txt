oh man, where do you start ..... <br /> <br /> drop the gun to be in the hand to fight a zombie while a bitten soldier is depressed and think about it He then turns around and bites the person who has depressed him, turning his back to a "fallen" zombie, constantly shooting at the chest and seeing that it does not work. So they shoot the chest even more and have the idea of ​​a child slumping at a desk When blood comes out of his mouth, it's still okay to walk on a soccer field as if nothing was wrong and suddenly I realized that the zombie football team did everything in the middle of the field that looked like they had not seen it before .... <br /> <br /> I could go for a few more hours, but you understand the point ..... childish writing and dialogue, bad direction, terrible special effects, really sad and undeveloped action (zombie-infested campus, must get the viral host, then lose ... (twice), the only plus I can find , is that this contains no clips of the actual game ring the "action scenes" .... <br /> <br /> I say, do not waste your money, but I'm more upset about the waste of time, I I saw it on the cable and wanted di e 2 hours of my life back
