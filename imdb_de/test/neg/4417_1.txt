For me, it's a case you would never understand if you did not live it. Read this to know why I would have such unlimited trouble. .. My dad loved him .. My mother, who loves every little shot of violence, loved him! and how she has seen so far about his "The Big Boss", also called "Fists of Fury", and the experience of seeing her in the Egyptian films, with all the gigantic success. Also, I saw a really good movie about him (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) ... so I cried: Where are your films, Bruce? !! <br /> <br /> I went to the video store ... and it was a stupid move ... (you know why!) .. and waw .. I found a lot of Bruce Lee movies ... I have named one selected (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) <br /> <br /> I did it to myself and watched it. Oh God, please forgive your servant .. I hurt myself but with no intended decision. I would not do it if I knew that it harms bad !! his mythical level of ugliness !! <br /> <br /> After that, I did not understand at all what the great fuss about Bruce Lee is as a great immortal star. Why should nobody care if he's here or there ... this hero (who I've watched!) Is not that talented and not the genius and of course not so sexy ??? <br /> <br /> Until my dad saw this star and asked me to take a break in one of his close-ups, and after a little examination of his face ... he told me clearly, "That's not it Bruce Lee "! So I was too confused to ask: who is this stupid guy anyway ?? !! <br /> <br /> It was 2001 .. 2 years after my first entry in the IMDb database .. Therefore, I tended to know immediately who the hell this man is .. and I discovered the truth Not Bruce Lee. No, my dear friends ... he is Bruce Li !!! <br /> <br /> And what a huge ... so much difference !! I just want to know who can love this bad clone? Or god forbid .. love his repulsive movies .. I saw 2 of them and could not bear to finish the third! <br /> <br /> Afterwards I ignored all our video stores because it is cheap (to write on the posters that THIS is Bruce Lee?) .. and I have the original. The only Bruce Lee, who is indeed such a big star, and Oh Boy, he certainly had the right to immortality. And not less.
