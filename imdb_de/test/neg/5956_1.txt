Where should I start? The box should have been enough to keep me from this attempt, but I learned early on not to judge a book (or movie) by the cover. So I ignored the box's disgusting graphics quality and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they can not properly do a single still image, how dismal will the later ones be? Yes. They were pretty awful. <br /> <br /> The actors in the film were fully aware that they were being filmed because every expression seemed to be good, regardless of the situation in which the characters were or responded. <br /> <br /> However, a good story can offset the decline of low budget productions. A good dialogue can sometimes lead to a poorly funded attempt. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times, as the story was as weak and non-existent as the other necessary elements of a good cinema. <br /> <br /> There are no words for how bad this was. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can get the idea from my rating of -2.3 / 10 from ... the underworld :.
