This was one of Christie's later stories. During her long career, she became interested in the changing narrative and the concept of conflicting agents. Both are essentially the same and relate to the question of who controls or creates the situation. <br /> <br /> In crime novels, the game is a matter of contradictory realities. The killer intends to change reality to deceive the detective, the writer intends to do the same to the reader. Both the reader and the detective fight in similar struggles to accomplish what they see. That is why in their stories often a writer. <br /> <br /> In her work, she explores every combination of tricks she can deal with. Along the way, we often have bodies that do not seem to be, to whom they shine, times and intended sacrifices, and the like. But the true magic of books is this concept of control. In 'Bertram's' it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> Here it is a dead man. Well, sometimes that happens, but not like that. It's as if the writer were the famous Mr. Rafiel. This is especially sweet for Marple readers, who remember the same character from the "Carribean Mystery" that was, so to speak, framed by their nephew. In this story, Rafiel was the transmitter of history to the authorities. The producers of this series have an almost crazy commitment to use a different creative team with each one. Sometimes it produces bland work. The 'Bertram's' episode was pretty brilliantly staged. This one is the most lavish of all and has an active camera. But unlike "Bertrams," this has nothing to do with the story. <br /> <br /> The camera moves and only intercepts because it can. The 'Citizen Kane' quote in the beginning was a bit too literal and blunt. This story is good, but the adapter has taken out some pretty critical stuff, and this irrelevant camera is annoying. <br /> <br /> Teds Evaluation - 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
