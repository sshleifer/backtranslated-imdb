This movie just does not work. No two options. I saw it for the first time in 1998 when it was released, and I did not like it. I bought it for sale a few days ago because I thought, "what the hell, I'll try it". I do not regret the money I spent on Hamilton, but the fact remains the same. This movie is pointless, boring and uninteresting. Stormare is usually a bliss, but that's when he makes movies in the US. At home he does not do the trick. Sure, the movie is well done (if you do not forget the odd stock footage here), but in the end, the only thing Hamilton REALLY lifts over a star garbage is Hamill's move as the evil Hawkins. He has serious fun with the character and is responsible for the film's only two good moments. "Swedish intelligence, huh? Now there is a contradiction," and if he allows Hamilton to have a word or two with his wife the phone near the end of the strip. And that's about all. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
