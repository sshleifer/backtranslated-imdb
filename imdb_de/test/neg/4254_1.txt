That was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why would someone make a movie about murder ?! Mr. Allen is playing the only character he can, the sexually stunted man who can not get the girl. Get a hint, Allen, there's a reason that this is the only character you can successfully portray. Stir off of this movie! It's a waste of time, unless you want to know how to kill someone successfully. I'm sorry for the actors who say yes to Woody Allen. Take a look at his cast and tell me how many of these people are still working. My respect for all the actors who work for him decreases immediately because they have decided to go to the movies.
