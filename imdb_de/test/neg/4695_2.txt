This movie, also known as Life In The Fast Lane, is undoubtedly one of the least entertaining films I've seen in a long time. I think it was done in the light of the sick, twisted and run-down women of L.A. representing about 0.00000001 of the population in the States. The characters are all one-dimensional, even the lead role. After stabbing her friend in the head with scissors, a cheap laugh is tried (and unsuccessful) by putting a cork in the friend's skull to stop the bleeding. Oh, smart! Patrick Dempsey (whose films are almost always a classic - sarcasm), plays this "devil" who changes her life - but from what we've seen, her life was initially a vignette series. No emotions, no laughter, no story. The only reason I have awarded these 2 is that Jeffrey Jones is in order as a priest and there is a bit of style in the camera (Albiet Zero substance). Otherwise one of the 5 worst movies I have ever seen. Grade 2 of 10 AN F! I think even the most drugged junkie, who would laugh at a falling toilet seat, would not like this movie. I can not stress enough how much you should stay away from. <br /> <br />
