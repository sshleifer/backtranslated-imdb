OK. I admit it. I'm a big fan of B-movies. Back then, when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens ruled over sleep. And then even the bad movies were still good. Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just bad. Even a small cameo by Brinke Stevens (who repeated her role as Linda from "Slumber Party Massacre" 21 years ago) does not help. A group of cheerleaders takes refuge in a chic cabin after their van collapses. A psycho pursues them one after another and captures them in various states of disentanglement. Bad script, bad direction and terrible drama just make this bad! Skip this turkey and go to the "Slumber Party Masaker". 1/2 *
