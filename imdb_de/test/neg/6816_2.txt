"Dogmatic," as another reviewer described this film, is a fitting word. The idea of ​​the director was to present Bach without action, drama, fun, theater, dialogue, narration or drama. Mission accomplished, Monsieur Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes. "Cinematic?" Under no circumstance. This is an anti-cinema. Nobody moves. Hardly anyone speaks. The camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes each. Very rarely, the camera is pushed into the camera. You can take a look at Gustav Leonhardt's finger, which moves over the keys. That's it. <br /> <br /> If you like the idea of ​​staring at the back of a (confused) harpsichord head for 7 minutes while listening to Bach, this is the movie for you. I'd rather listen to Bach with my eyes closed on my stereo.
