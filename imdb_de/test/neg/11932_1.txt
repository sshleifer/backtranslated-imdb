This movie is a cash-in. A cash-in depends on a rousing melody for an earlier classic. Yul Brynner has long jumped the ship and therefore has the most production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role from Chris. I can not think of an actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, at least he could have cut off his hair and lost his mustache just for the sake of continuity. Some prisons show this film to punish offenders. One step out of the line and The Magnificent Seven Ride! is brought to the foreground and exercised. They did not even bother to make this movie look like a TV movie! Miserable.
