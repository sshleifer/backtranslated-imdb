(This review is based on the English version.) Orson Welles's legendary unfinished epic was just that - unfinished. It should remain so, not be thrown in this awkward, boring compilation of available material. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure it was done with the best of intentions, the filmmakers not only did this Welles' vision did not do it justice, they also managed to discredit it by getting the audience have insulted with this version. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateurish quality of the sound. The resynced voices are not only a poor performance, they are also inconsistent - Welles original recordings (with his own voice, as he often did) were captured in a handful of scenes and are at odds with each other. There was not the slightest attempt at permanence. Add to that an extremely empty sound mix that has a minimum of sound effects and atmos - a long sequence during a huge festival (including the running of the cops) sounds like it was recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people Sound of an audience that should have thousands. <br /> <br /> The real problem, however, is the inevitable fact that 'Don Quixote' was incomplete and obviously visible. The film consists of a handful of scenes, strung together and drawn into ridiculous lengths just to balance the runtime. A typical case - the sequence in which Sancho searches for Don Quixote in the city goes on forever. It's just Sancho who appeals to people in the crowd and asks them the same questions over and over again - Welles would not have meant to use every single take in its entirety, but that's the way it appears here. It takes more than twelve minutes to complete the movie if it is likely to have been about two minutes absolute maximum. <br /> <br /> While the film's launch is relatively complete and pretty well done, the rest have huge holes that just can not be filled with endless overlays of the Spanish countryside and more shots of Don Quixote & Sancho are going and forth. There is no end either. No resolution, no conclusion, no punchline, no sense. <br /> <br /> Although there is material in private collections that was not available to the filmmakers, it could not possibly explain what would be required to make it a complete, coherent work. Welles just did not finish shooting, mainly because his lead actor died before they could finish. Apart from being incomplete and never could be, I think it would be enough if you only saw a collection of footage from this masterpiece. If you put it all so slippery, unfortunately, you have a very negative impression of the film. What clearly portrayed Akim Tamiroff as Sancho as a terrific performance, is completely ruined with the new voice and the long, sweeping scenes that finally irritate him. Orson Welle's Vision For This film was a little more ambitious and complex than a simple retelling of the story of Don Quixote, but that's what was being attempted here, and as such, the point is lost. The only person who could put all the material together for something valuable would have been Welles himself, and he did not. <br /> <br /> The footage could have been put to much better use in a documentary that recorded the whole saga of Welles trying to do the film. Welles himself had even found the perfect title for such a Doco: "When will you finish Don Quixote?"
