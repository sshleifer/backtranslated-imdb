This movie has NO plot. It has been suggested that a man moves in with his grandmother and everyone thinks he's a loser and he has to save himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he lives with? They have a big pot party with grandma. The highlight of the film did not relate to the rest. This whole conspiracy was introduced within minutes of the end of the movie. I can see how it could be related to the alleged story - that Grandma's VG skills are using it - but that just was not there. <br /> <br /> The film was hellishly funny and relied heavily on the jokes. <br /> <br /> "Her pussy smells like the great depression." "He just sucked his first cock ... yes for 13 hours."
