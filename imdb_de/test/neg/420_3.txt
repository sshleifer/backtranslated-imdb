Personally, the book was a very well written, amazing, exciting piece that did not do the film justice. When I watched the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that much of the book was left out, I was frustrated that it affected the "other" result of the movie. There was something to be desired from this film, but all in all there was a lack of action. <br /> <br /> For someone who did NOT read the book, I could see how entertaining this movie would be with its controversy and suspense. But for a committed reader who has read it seven times, I have not seen the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel. <br /> <br /> With missing main characters (like Maximilian Kohler) and the Sudden Turn in the storyline with the Survival of the Last Cardinal in favor, the plot of the movie was slightly scattered, leading to a different look at the conclusion of the film History. The Hassassin was also portrayed as an ordinary white man compared to the novel in which he was portrayed as a Muslim; His motives in the book are mainly based on his connections to the Illuminati. In the film, however, the motives are based on money and seem more like work than a personal attachment to the task at hand.
