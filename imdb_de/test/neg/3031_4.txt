DIRTY WAR <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Emergency services fight when Islamic terrorists launch a so-called 'dirty bomb' in central London , <br /> <br /> Daniel Percival's frightening film uses all available evidence to dramatize the potential effects of a radioactive explosion in the heart of the British capital, in a kind of documentary realism that characterizes this particular genre since the 1960s. In essence, the film reveals a catalog of flaws in the current UK government's strategy for dealing with terrorist terrorist attacks, and Percival's carefully crafted script (co-authored by Lizzie Mickery) dismisses his spleen against gruff politicians who want to maintain the more upbeat economic status quo to tackle this problem directly. The film covers all the necessary foundations and makes it clear that this kind of terrorism is being carried out by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the Islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life, though subsequent scenes will not reassure spectators of the devastation and misery Secrets. The film is not a mere drama, it warns against complacency. Either that or it's just another tactic that worries about the 9/11 scare tactics. You decide...
