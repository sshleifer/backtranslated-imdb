This may or may not have been a great movie with many educational opportunities for teachers around the world on evolution, biology, creative work in science, research and Darwin's life. For the most part, the script is historically inaccurate, turning a true story into a Mexican soup opera melodrama. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs, this was largely due to his insights during the Beagle's journey, not just his daughter's loss. He was undoubtedly disturbed by his loss, but that did not drive him crazy, mad, and away from his friends and family. Darwin's depiction is an invention of the screenwriter. Therefore, it can in no way be used as a place to learn about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, at the end of the Beagle journey, Darwin had finished the theory and kept them from going public, because he wanted to further develop the consequences and test them against more data. The film is an imaginary conflict between Darwin and his religious beliefs and the mental illness he developed after the death of his daughter, which prevented him from going public. <br /> <br /> The film brings a modern situation that is being debated by Creationists vs. Scientists into Darwin's life and times, so it's anachronistic. It does not portray Thomas Huxley as a man trying to develop a better understanding of biology, but as someone who is out to "kill God," with his own words from the movie and to destroy the church that would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of many unrelated data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensitive person. One combination that I interpret was an attempt to deride active atheists who oppose religion. In real life, Huxley gradually accepted Darwin's ideas, and before Darwin's work, he believed that there was not enough evidence for evolution. His first evolutionary support was published one month after the release of Origin of Species. He was an agnostic, but he did not believe it was "necessary to kill God," except that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The debate between creationists and scientists appears throughout the film, and the formulation of the creationists as "It's just a theory" is part of the discussion. Of course, there were no such arguments or catchphrases at this time. In fact, the Anglican Church has published a positive review of Origin's claim that they saw God's work in evolution, in a sense contradictory to the way the clergy are portrayed in the script. <br /> <br /> Another horrible aspect of this film is that it gives the public the false impression that scientific research is being conducted by a crazy, lonely man who is currently writing a lot. Nothing is further from the truth. The conception of evolutionary theory was the result of thorough observations by Darwin during five years in the HMS Beagle and was gradually developed, as can be seen from Darwin's notes on the journey. Although the Beagle voyage was the most important part of Darwin's life for the notion of "Origin of Species," the journey is briefly mentioned at first, and no attempt is made to show that the book was an elaborate analysis of observations. To make matters worse, Darwin is shown performing a single experiment (pigeon breeding) to validate his theory and give up at the end. I'm not really sure if such an experiment actually took place. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment. It is in no way a tribute to Darwin and science.
