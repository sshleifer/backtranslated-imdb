Angel-A is a change for Besson; monochrome, mawkish and rather mediocre. It is well-photographed on the ground in Paris, although subtitles should pay attention: fast dialogue and good cinematography can lead to frustrating vision. <br /> <br /> This film is not a "Wings of Desire" or "Wonderful Life." Despite his common themes (celestial intervention prevents suicide, angel / mortal relationships), Besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us Even the well-played, tearful moments quickly sink into the sentimentality of the toes. <br /> <br /> The flawed ideology of the film irritates an angel, whose message of love and respect for oneself through his own violent and promiscuous one Behavior is undermined, a "happy ending" that negates the hero's supposed path of helplessness to self-esteem and independence. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: pretty to look at, but confused Moral and philosophical messages affect the movie right there where it should shine 4/10
