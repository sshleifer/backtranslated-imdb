This movie was really terrible. It was not scary at all or even amazing. I saw it with some friends and at the end of the night we said, "The ruins have ruined my night." <br /> <br /> I would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters, lending it, or even accidentally watching it on TV. It's an absolute waste of an hour and a half. The plot was almost nonexistent, the characters were terribly underdeveloped, and they did not give a backstory for everything that happened, leaving them completely open at the end, as if preparing for a sequel.
