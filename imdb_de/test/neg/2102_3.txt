Snakes on a Train begins when the Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) and Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the border into the United States. Then they illegally board a seventeen-hour train to Los Angeles. But Alma's family did not agree with her & Brujo's relationship and put an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her interior into snakes, is not life a bit? As the snakes stream out of Alma's mouth and slide into other parts of the train, they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual disease ... <br /> <br /> From the Mallachi Brothers (though the IMDb claims it Just be a guy with a pseudonym, Peter Mervis. You have to say that I thought Snakes on a Train was crap, it's that simple, it seems like the whole movie was prepared and made into the cult movie Snakes on A Plane by Samuel L. Jackson (2006) This style of money and filmmaking is not as obvious as here on Snakes on a Train. Making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful movie is not a good place to start. The screenplay by Eric Forsberg is garbage, and Snakes on a Plane was great fun at the beginning, while Snakes on a Train is a lot more serious, and if you actually break it down and look at it, it would have been a lot easier a must. In fact, it probably would have worked better as a parody of the type Scary Movie (2000). You know, I'm struggling to find something positive about snakes on the train, it's so bad. For one, the character is garbage and it's impossible to argue with anyone, the story is downright horrible and makes no sense (when people spit all those little snakes, where the big ones come from?) Why has Alma turned into the giant snake? Why did Bujo kill the platoon leader, how was he supposed to stop the train when he arrived in Los Angeles, where did that typhoon come from?), he takes himself too seriously, the first seventy minutes are so boring and so on uneventfully I'm surprised that I stayed awake and it's just a very, very bad movie on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Director Mervis has only a few wagon sets that all look so much like this. The movie is getting very repetitive and boring. There is hardly any blood or blood, there are a few snakes lending themselves under the skin of some people, someone is shot and that's it. The special effects are also garbage, the gigantic CGI snake in the end is really terrible and the least that is said about it the better. It's not scary, there's no atmosphere and it's boring from start to finish. The real live snakes are also a problem, they are just as docile and not threatening. If you look at a scene with a real snake and an actor, the snakes never move toward them or act aggressively. In fact, they always seem to want to shuffle in the opposite direction. Technically, the movie is obviously cheap and it shows, basically it looks cheap because it is. The acting is not great, that the actor no material is provided. <br /> <br /> Serpents on the train are rubbish, I'm sorry, but that's how I feel & I'm not sure how else to describe it? I really can not see what anyone would get out of watching snakes all at once, it's really that bad.
