A less than redeeming hunka junk that is mercifully freed from the consequences of competence. Some idiots from the north are coming to the deep south looking for Confederate rifles set on the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are threatened by scary Hillbillies, in a wide nod to "liberation"; but it turns out that the hicks fight for a Nordic marijuana tug. This is brought to light so early that it does not even turn out to be a twist. The women are imprisoned and raped in catatonia; Instead of saving them, the boys run down to the city to fetch the sheriff who is lazy and does not believe them. I think that if my girlfriend was raped, I would anyway take the shortest route to hiding. It's okay, because as soon as they show up to tend the villains, the girls will be happy and jump around, if in real life only a trauma would be like that. Also a hillbilly with beard who cackles a lot. Not exactly full of ideas with ideas.
