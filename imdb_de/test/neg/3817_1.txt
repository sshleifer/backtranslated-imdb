Is it just me or have all the "horror" movies nothing more than tits, slapstick and an exaggerated rogue that can not be killed. This movie did not make sense. Whatever happened in the days when a person was able to escape the killer like in a hostel. and at least make the killer a bit more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. He reminded me of a demon brood between Quasimodo and Leather Face. It was exaggerated that no one thought to finish the work while the victor was on fire. and the end was the biggest disappointment reminiscent of the soprano finale. I had to agree with the guy behind him when he burst ... WHAT THE F ***! If I could evaluate the film negatively, I would have taken care of it.
