I think after Leonard Nimoy successfully directed "The Search for Spock" and "The Home of the Journey," William Shatner believed he could also direct. Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he is simply not a good director. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is a poor testament to the arguments of trekkies claiming that William Shatner is an arrogant egomaniac. For though his character, Captain James Kirk, has always been the most important character in the original Star Trek, he seems to be the heart of the film in this film, the two other main characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy, are just there, to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief. <br /> <br /> The plot is that some of the volcanic outsiders named Sybok come together with the people in a mindmelding and release the pain that is in them from this traumatic event in early life that changed them forever. Thankfully, they gather with him to make the whole world free of pain and peace. Sybok and his supporters command the building, where a peace conference is held between a human, Klingon and Romulan diplomat. That lures the still-built Enterprise to it, since none of the other ships of the Starfleet "experienced commanders" has (frankly, how the Starfleet is operated, the Klingons and Romulans would have to conquer years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise crew except for Spock (who turns out to be a secret brother to Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Sybok orders the Enterprise to go to the "Center of the Universe" to meet "God," for whom every race seems to have a word. However, it turns out that this is only a minor factor when he demands the use of the Enterprise and Kirk asks, "What does God need with a spaceship?" The entity is destroyed, but not in front of Sybok, as it realizes that it has been lied to for years, it sacrifices its life and earns Spock's respect in death, after the companies inexplicably destroyed the entity's photon torpedoes and the Sybok. <br /> OK Science fiction films are not known for realism, but at some point rationality needs to be enforced. Why do people follow Sybok just to relieve their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I have certainly led a trauma-free life. Why does not Kirk try his crew to Sybok to mutiny and betrayal? What was the point of Sybok sacrificing himself if the torpedoes were going to kill the entity anyway? <br /> <br /> So the action is weak. Another problem is that Sybok, though well played by Lawrence Luckinbill, is misrepresented. Just because he is an emotional Vulcan does not mean that he should behave just like a religious fanatic of man. Shatner (who was both a co-author and a director) could at least have developed a dialogue suitable for an emotional Vulcan. I think he feels that every emotional being speaks like us. Gosh, I think that means that Klingons should say more often than "is not" and "not." And the Cardassians should not extend their sentences because they like to talk (yes, I know, it's sad that I know that). Please ... every ST race uses a unique dialogue. Why is Sybok the exception. <br/> <br /> The only thing you can not complain about is action. I've always known Star Trek with great actors, and this movie is no exception. Cudos also goes to Leonard Nimoy because it was difficult to play the dispassionate Spock at his age. <br /> <br /> Some other things I did not like: <br /> <br /> Shatner and The late DeForrest Kelly shows twice what kind of bad singers they are by doing in this movie "Row, Row "Row your boat" is singing. I think Shatner wanted to silence his critics for his vocal ability. What he did was proof. <br /> <br /> Uhura dances with fans and carries nothing but tree bark to pull some men into a detonator trap. After all, the dreams of all the men of us are filled with images of chubby middle-aged women dancing naked. <br /> <br /> Comedy is all the best as long as it does not affect the nature of Star Trek. too much, but when Scotty encounters an object on the Enterprise and is itself KOs, it somehow goes overboard. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only member of the crew who can refuse Sybok's offer to release his inner pain and see through the impostor of the Godfisher. Not even Spock can do both? Maybe these scenes were Valantines from Shatner for his character, as many suspect. <br /> <br /> The concept of an entity posing as a god has been used more than once in "Star Trek" before this film. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> Speaking of uncreativity. I was not particularly interested in ripping off the music of Star Trek: The Next Generation. All in all pretty bad "Trek" movie. If you are a trekkie, take a look at it because it is "Star Trek". Otherwise, check out "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan". It's much better.
