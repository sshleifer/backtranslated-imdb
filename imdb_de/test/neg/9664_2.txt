I do not think it really matters too much what this movie is about. The main thing you will notice is the extreme moodiness of the entire production. Acting is what you would get when you pick people randomly on the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the verve of a shot in your ear, and at the same time the dialogue is maybe a fifth as loud. Various on-set sounds dominate the soundtrack to a great extent, with the dialogue taking a distant background. The theme music sounds as if it was ready for a quarter when the movie was released because much of the film has no music at all. Camera work can best be described as a gnarled mess, with close-ups where a medium angle would be much better, cameramen walking around and bumping the camera in any direction, paying absolutely no attention to crafting each scene from every position It is most convenient for the cameraman to stand. If the cameraman was one foot taller than the actors and you looked at the heads of everyone in the end, well. Editing is just a butcher job. Everything is thrown together as abruptly as possible, nothing flows or transitions in the truest sense of the word. I do not know if it is a video or a rented camcorder. I tend to believe that it was the latter. <br /> <br /> I only went through three quarters of it before turning it off. I was so upset about the poor quality of the production that I could not stand it anymore. It's like a ninth audiovisual class project.
