It's high time that American critics and fans begin to expose their undisputed, sloppy worship of films like Sergio Leone's "Once upon a Time in America." The turbulent history of this opulent film (and the grand, imaginative myth associated with its production and many versions) refutes its mediocrity on a narrative level. The film staggers back and forth, its main characters are torn and seem to be surrounded by the decadence of the setbacks in need of replacement, the minute details of the production and the clich√©d, but great cinematographic confectionery until 1984. The timeframe of the storyline is confusing, tricky and laborious, with some critics picturing the opium of the Noodles figure as the forerunner of a future "dream reality" as well as the sepia-toned memories. This very fan-boy-apologetic interpretation, presented with ham, glosses over the brilliant irregularities of the presentation. Even at this full (?) Runtime, characters appear and disappear with alarming suddenness: the Deborah figure is fleetingly anchored in a child form, a cold and unattainable "trophy woman" who does not even hint at the force of gravity with which she will straighten up Relationship to a noodle after the prison, the said reunion is from now on completely wrong. The depressing tempo is guilty, certain sequences stagnant for too long, meaning little, suggesting to a director with so little restraint and narrative economics that he often feels compelled to snap every iota of screen time possible to show from his production, fatal for a movie that contains such surly and restrained figures. The Trajectory of Life of the Characters is presented to us as a microcosm reflecting the historical trajectory of America's teenage through prohibition and its prey and ending with the (defiance of) ruin of its moribund central characters (except Deborah, a fumble or department division intent) one wonders yourself). This term is commonplace, even banal. The characters, as envisioned by the one-note script (no less written by seven Italians), are played flat and awkward by all but the younger actors, who dare at least some deviant facial expressions. This is understandable given the almost unworkable material. Some critics argue that the characters may seem so immoderately selfish, but actively pursue their own goals and assume the conformity of others (for example, when Noodles leaves prison, Max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him) That's what he wants and later concludes deals, provided noodles are kept in. This explanation for their abrupt, abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily insignificant and merely serves to highlight the intricate goals pursued by the film's unshakeable followers defending their positions in relation to a film that unfortunately makes little sense.Although Ennio Morricone's score is highly revered, it is undeniably languid and repetitive, it gushes with an emotional flush that the scenes themselves, many violent, just do not In some places, it is questionable whether Morricone's g Watching the movie or not, in which I was so inappropriate, is his work. As a forerunner of American filmmaking, he succeeds in terms of mood (supported by a few masterful editing works between periods) and visuals (which are not supported by this score), but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity.
