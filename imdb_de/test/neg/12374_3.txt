Before we start, may I say, I hope you have already eaten, when you read this. Why? After seeing this movie for the first time, the bird let me eat chicken because of its appearance and sound, after the words "The End" appeared on the screen. So do not say that you were not warned. <br /> <br /> Fred Sears might have directed "Earth Against the Flying Saucers" (an okay movie and one of the bigger examples of Tim Burton's "Mars Attacks"), but "The Giant Claw" is not a huge movie. Yes, it is a prehistoric monster that flies in the air, attacks planes and cities, and occasionally indulges in a parachute man. The beast is huge except in the scenes where it is much smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in a movie? Creepy? It could have been, but not if the plot is hopelessly stupid and the monster looks like a puppet that ran away from Sesame Street.
