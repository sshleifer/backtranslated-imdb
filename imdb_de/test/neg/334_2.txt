I really did not want to write a harsh review of this movie because I really appreciate how hard it is to make movies on an incredibly low budget, let alone try something as ambitious as a science fiction. <br /> However, this movie is really awful. Acting is one of the worst I have ever experienced, and as a fan of low-budget films, this is a pretty serious charge. There are many aspiring actors who are working on a deferred payment if they believe in the film and what the director was trying to achieve. I'm sure the actors did their best, like everyone else involved in the production, but it just was not good enough to do anything of that magnitude. <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. Very poor There is no excuse for that. I had the impression that the script was hastily written on the back of a coaster after an epic drinking party session. I hesitate to use the word "ridiculous", but that's the script. I did not sympathize with any of the characters. In fact, they annoyed me, with the result that on several occasions I wanted to beat a few of them, which overtaxed Mr. Stirton with too many roles. He is not Clint Eastwood. Again, there are talented people who are ready to work on their backs if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this movie have made a lot of difference. For the money they are exceptional, if a bit overused. It's like someone said "I have aftereffects and boy, will I use it". Whoever did the CG work was one of the most talented of the crew. <br /> <br /> The money was simply not available to make as ambitious a film as it was attempted. A kudo for the attempt, but unfortunately he does not reach his intoxicating goals in far too many ways. <br /> <br /> I welcome everyone involved in the production, I really do, but for their next effort, they either have to achieve something, a better producer or a more manageable view. <br /> <br /> In summary, I can not recommend this effort to anyone except the most enthusiastic of film students or familiar insomniacs. If you want to see a true masterpiece of low budget science fiction movies, try the student made by a particular Mr. John Carpenter "Dark Star".
