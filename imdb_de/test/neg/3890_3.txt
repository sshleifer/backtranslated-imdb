Before I start a "small" fix: IMDb says that Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Not correct! I walked past him 10 years ago, and he can not be an ant that's bigger than 165. I'm 183 and he looked like a kid next to me. <br /> <br /> Should have been called "Wheatlands"; a fitting title that complements Malick's earlier (and much better) film Badlands. This film shows that not all directors have the main goal to entertain. In fact, some of them have the main objective of showing wheat in all its glory. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing and relatively unpretentious, with the obligatory tragic end. Nothing more than an average and predictable love triangle drama. The male two-thirds of the triangle did not survive the film. Praised for its visual quality; Although it has the realistic 70s feeling, there are limits to how fascinating wheat fields can be. You can shoot them with 1500mm cameras, but they are still wheat fields. Gere, who at first looks like some lower-level factory worker who is Wheatfield - Worker, is pretty solid, while Brooke Adams for the most part of the movie seems distant and cool, which raises the question of the two guys' love surprised. But for those who are looking for a movie that shows all the glorious colors of a wheat field, look no further: they have found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" Richard Gere and other intellectual heavyweights in Hollywood, contact me by e-mail.
