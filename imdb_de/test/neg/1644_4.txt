Good grief .. to believe, I have seen everything. Danny Thomas looks so out of place in this mish-mash. He really seems to be uncomfortable. He can not lick, and when he teamed up with Peggy Lee (PEGGY LEE ???), she's easy to defeat. Maybe the director has seen this and made him make really bad comedies that he sometimes does in the movie. Peggy Lee is fine, but the whole thing is a mess. Good for a laugh maybe.
