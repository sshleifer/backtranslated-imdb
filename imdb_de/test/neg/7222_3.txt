Riggs and Murtough are back, but the magic of the first movie has dissolved. The story is just awful! I mean, South African diplomats smuggling the mythical Krugerrands to the United States. It's just painful! And the accents are absolutely miserable! Can no one get an African African accent? Or do we forever hear that the British or Americans sound like drunken Hollander? The only one who put the Afrikaans accent right was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that I did not like was when Danny Glover called the Afrikaans accent so shamelessly shit! I mean, what a punch in Afrikaans. There is also enough hypocrisy in this movie to make me vomit. I mean, Mel Gibson's character is against the diplomats, but then sleeps with her P.A. Art! Do not waste your time looking at this unrecovered garbage film. If you want to watch a movie that does not completely offend a cultural group then rent Die Hard 2.
