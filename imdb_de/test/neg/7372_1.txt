Do not waste your time and money with that stinker of a turkey. <br /> <br /> This is an exaggerated melodramatic love story against the background of New France (aka Quebec in the 18th century). Or is it a historical saga of New France with an epic romanticism? I do not know, and now it does not interest me anymore. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story about the intrepid French adventurers, villains and other characters who have settled in Canada parts of the USA. That's not it The characters are total clich√©s, the story is overdone, breathless and devoid of any charm, and the viewer wants to leave the theater in the foreseeable future, have his or her head checked, and take his body into rage at being picked up by the hype become. <br /> <br /> This film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema, especially as a historian and French Canadian or Canadian of French descent (or whatever) A) I'm convinced that the story my people in this country can not be told as well as it would be possible on film b). B) are interested in this topic. C) A movie lover who thinks cinema can do wonders today with this grandiose and tragic story. <br /> <br /> As I said, do not waste your time with this frustrating claptrap.
