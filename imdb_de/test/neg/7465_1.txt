What can you say about a grainy, badly filmed 16mm deer movie, in which the best and most attractive actor is a German Shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this travesty at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality in the US is a taboo and an illegal topic. I strongly suggest that IMDb revisit their weighting formula for rating reviews, as a rating of 8.8 is absurd for this stinker! I am by no means an act and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70s and 80s. However, this is an inferior product, also due to the loose standards of the (then illegal) deer loop.
