This film coincides with Mike Allred's comic mini-series "Red Rocket Seven" and tells the story of an alien who fled to Earth to wait for "Astroesque", which leads to the Book of Revelation and the Apocalypse. This is just part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read also "RR7"). You can easily tell that Allred is used to tell stories with pictures. The direction is very good and the impact is not bad for a budget of $ 500. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the roles, and probably did not have the heart to say they could not act. Even Mike does not show his writing skills in this movie. His Dialouge Spoon feeds the action to you and will not let you enjoy the characters. This was actually disappointing given that he has tremendous writing skills in his comic books. 4 out of 10.
