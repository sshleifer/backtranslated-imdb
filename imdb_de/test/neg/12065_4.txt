It's hard to be too hard for Brad Sykes, a hard-working man who does what he loves. There is an honesty about him that is often overlooked by other micro budget directors. Take a look at the tiny crew credits on Camp Blood. There is not one of the usual thanks to everyone involved in the pizza joint they ate in, Brad and his buddies, and that's it, no overbearing garbage. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not a normal horror hero, but she's good enough to barely notice. Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny it hurts. The Clown is hardly an original horror movie villain, but the design is good, Shemp Moseley does a decent job of bringing him to life, and the image fits in well with the rural backdrop. Camp Blood is a horror as Blaumann and as simple as it is, not a good thing, not a bad thing, just one thing.
