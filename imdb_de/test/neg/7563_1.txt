How LIVING THE DREAM managed to get into Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood is a mystery to me, because it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene in-gasp, Eugene, Oregon, was opened, that this dud of a movie with characters you like and excuse themselves from their exclusion days from high school has pity, but not how they are doing are such losers, is so wooden and cruel with dialogue, that it is beyond bad. <br /> <br /> Then, cliche, the three high school losers land in LA, and here the movie could have been realistic had shown how they are trying to find a career in acting. But no, one works as a used car dealer, the other is a real loser in a garage call center that sells magazines. Even the bastard who runs the place has more appeal than this dreadful actor with the awful foreign accent. And they fraudulently receive money from an insurance fraud to start an executive recruitment firm with no experience. They only show "the supposedly good life" in LA night clubs with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad that they do not have SAG cards ... <br /> <br /> I kept coming across this bad one Film talk, but I went out of the theater, which had six people in the beginning, and when I left, four men were the only ones in the audience. I wanted to like this movie, but I could not find merit in the story, the characters, the writing, the dialogue and the actors. Who occupied this film, should retire. Amen ... enough ...
