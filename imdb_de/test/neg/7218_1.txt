The original Road House was a classic, cheesy movie from the 80s that, though not nearly worthy of writing or acting, was a very entertaining and popular movie, mainly due to the presence of star Patrick Swayze and the great side cast with some outstanding ones Battle scenes and eye grazes. <br /> <br /> 16 years later, and MGM / Sony is trying to re-create the magic that has made us all cite a liner and quote the three rules of jumping. A movie that makes the best deposits quoted from the original and lists the three rules. <br /> <br /> If this was an amateur fan movie, it would be considered a loving tribute to one of Swayze's most popular films. As a professionally made film, he falls flat into the DVD Bargin Bin, whereby the constant reuse of lines and plot of the original film is more of an annoying sign of lack of originality than of cool references to the original. <br /> With that said, with new lines like "I'm going to kill you, just as I killed your father," it's no wonder scriptwriters have decided to reconstruct much of the original script , <br /> <br /> I knew that this would never be so special as being a straight to DVD sequel, but at least I had hoped that there might be some new ideas and new things going on in the Road House Names do justice, but you just get a 2006 remake of the same movie, with a few narcotics. <br /> <br /> If I were the director, I would have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and they are characters. It looks like we thought the figure of Patrick Swayze was dead (killed off the screen by Jake Busey in a lame way), and his brother and son are now the main characters who, oddly enough, have completely different surnames. <br /> <br My favorite song was that Dalton's 'son' drove the same car as his father, a really cool tribute that was later ruined when the car, like its predecessor, had reached its end. This is a good example of how this film goes too far when it contains sequences and ideas from the '89 movie. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the legendary moment in which Wild Bill promises Shane, "just like me." killed your dad "and then tried to send him in a different way.Amazing writing there.I see Schaech listed as a co-author.Stay at acting or best at nothing. <br /> <br /> Everything All in all, this is an OK movie, if you do not want to see anything else and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half, or if you have a haven The first road house was out of sight, but Hardcore fans of the Swayze classic are almost be disappointed until they feel insulting when it comes to how much the film breaks away from the first movie, and when somebody once proposed this movie as an alternative subtitle, "Even Jeff Healy is glad he does not see this movie Stay! "Stay at the original Road House and experience the good old Swayze days!
