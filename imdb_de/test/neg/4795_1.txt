So we should find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle - the war zone - to find out why her fianc√© did not travel to Switzerland? Or should we take it seriously? It's not even funny, smart or entertaining - it's stupid - and the movie too. The lead actress is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar-Jar Binks. Dialogue strives to be funny (almost always), but it is never. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And as for the conspiracy - did they even bother to explain what the rebels are fighting for (except being against the government)? I think that was of no concern to anyone - neither to the rebels nor to the characters who blindly flew into the battlefield. Do not waste your time. "Coronado" is neither funny nor entertaining.
