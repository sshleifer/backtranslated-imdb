I like all kinds of movies, so this is no reason for romantic movies of a guy who just likes The Matrix and so on. <br /> <br /> I just felt like it was a lousy movie. I do not feel that enough figures have built up to fall in love. You've been there for a few days, and while Richard Gere and Diane Lane are dealing with a severe whirlwind and big problems in each of their lives, are they falling in love hopelessly and helplessly? That is not realistic. This movie did not make me want to get involved with it and feel it emotionally, and that's something you look for in a good plot. An emotional connection. If someone can relate that he falls in love so quickly and without real substance, as it were. You are neither right nor wrong. Different strokes for different people. <br /> <br /> Another very incredible component of the movie was that Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter became nice and likable at the end of the movie. Is a young girl so miserable and angry with his mother that it does not come back with his cheating husband, just turn on a switch and be nice? In short, this movie had some big names, but for me that was a big disappointment.
