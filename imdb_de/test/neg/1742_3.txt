I thought it was weird and just bloody, not scary. I have seen and loved a few Japanese horror films, Ringu and Juon; But this movie was a disappointment. It never explained anything about the curse. I just did not see any horror ... it did not scare me at all. All the while, I've been waiting for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it's happening now. If this was an ancient curse, why did not it happen in front of Shuichi's father? And it never told us what happened to her dad. I've always been waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasons behind this curse and then it's just over. I was very disappointed.
