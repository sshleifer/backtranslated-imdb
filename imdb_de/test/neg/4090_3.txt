This movie was a failure as a comedy and movie in general. It was a very slow film that seemed to convey a message, but the message was a clich√©, a hopeless mess. This film falls for a shameless environmental point and even makes a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> While sitting, I did not have to change my mind, except that Steve Carell got nothing more than a single really funny line. The only thing that hypothetically could call comedy is the pitiful attempt to give Wanda Syke's comic relief lines. Her character receives frequent, frightened lines in which they absolutely do not fit. <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty is a far cry from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty and blows his entire record budget on special effects plotters that turn out to be barely advancing. The movie spends the first half building Evans Ark, but in the end we learn that the Ark was completely meaningless and the whole conspiracy was just a jar for the stupid gags and even stupid messages. The film concludes when we learn that the entire ark, tide and animal gatherings were but a weak political statement by no one other than God. Yes, God has tried to influence politics.
