Hey, if people thought Ed Wood was a bad director then they did not see this movie at all. I mean, there were gaping plots and housed cast. Sloppy special effects. I can not believe this movie came from a Hollywood studio. A high school drama club could probably produce a better product. I mean, they had Erika Eleniak, who is great Casper van dien and undervalued actor. Their agents should be shot to ask them to sign up for this dribble. Do not read scripts. I still can not believe that the tiny Lister was a survivor in the movie. I've been beating my head the whole time, why he, and not a descendant of van helsing, is the last man to stand. I'm a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst thing they should use so that they never see the light of day.
