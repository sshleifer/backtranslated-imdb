The computer-savvy John Light (as John Elias) moves from Stanford dropouts to the successful young dot-com era. However, the mocking success of Mr. Light could only be short-lived, with partners such as the ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (as Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan fell asleep with Lights girlfriend Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that booze and casual sex do not end in college. After reading a naughty internet sex session, Ms. Dodds lights up with light. He can also lose the Internet empire "Digital Dreams"! Veterans who try unsuccessfully to give dramatic gravitas include Mia Farrow (as Anna Simmons), the red lollipop, and Hal Holbrook (as Tom Walker) hated by the computer. Mrs. Farrow looks cute with her lollipops. <br /> <br /> *** Purpose (21.02.02) Alan Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan, Mia Farrow
