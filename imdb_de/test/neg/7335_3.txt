The movie starts off with a pliant instructional film about the habits of Swedish housewives. Afterwards we get a detailed reconstruction of the post-war Scandinavia with many great cars, electronic devices and interior design. Minimal jazz score, beautiful camera and stylish titles. There are also some funny Scandinavian rivalries like in Von Triers 'Riget'. Unfortunately, "kitchen histories" collapse like the twin towers on September 11th. Doctors who try to express the emotions "jealousy" just by staring. Corny dialogue full of outdated, gay symbolism: "I do not like white swans, I prefer bears and wolves ... have you ever tasted bear meat?" Cheesier as Yann Tiersen in his worst form. <br /> <br /> It's a pity the director put all the effort into this great set-up just to mess it up afterwards.
