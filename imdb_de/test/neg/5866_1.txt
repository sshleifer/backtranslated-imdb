Man, let's start, everything about this cartoon of the episodes, about the stories, the script, an animation is for me the stupidest, stupidest and most annoying cartoon that Walt Disney Television Animation ever created and made, I'm glad Toon Disney is both (2006) and Disney Channel to stop airing it in the US as of May 2008. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it's a wise choice if you want to skip this cast and the black cloud of an A cartoon when you see it. I'm not saying I did not warn you. <br /> <br /> Your commitment to a boring and right, stupid and confusing time. I wish and pray that I have never seen an episode of this comic buzz Lightyear Of Star Command. If I could, I would have removed the part of my brain that remembers looking at it, yes, that is and was so bad.
