The revisionist story, which makes the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic, is insane enough. But the horrible drama, the amateurish cinematography and the terrible dubbing make this movie painfully bad. The only reason to look ahead is that almost all the women in the movie are great. Amazingly, she is tortured for days, her hands tied over her head and apparently does not affect the beauty, hairstyle and make-up of a woman. My guess is that the producers mainly shot in Russia and selected women for their looks - and willingness to work cheaply - rather than for acting skills. If you decide to look at this because you have nothing better to do or a movie student is looking for bad examples, you will be spun through any scene that contains no nudity.
