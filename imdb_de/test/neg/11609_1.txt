After reading this awful 82-minute movie excuse and wanting to see my eyes out before seeing another James Toback-led confusion called "When I'm Loved", I've come to the conclusion He has the best agent of the world. How else can these terribly written, laboriously directed garbage pieces be made in the first place? <br /> <br /> I like Robert Downey Jr., but the fact that he's in this movie may have driven him to drug abuse. <Br /> <br /> Heather Graham is ashamed of her zombified performance. Half the time the camera is focused on her, she just looks dizzy. <br /> <br /> Such a crappy script. Prepare yourself for the name of Hollywood, which is abundant (for example, five-minute snaking discussions about Denzel Washington's actors ... etc.). Most of the time he spends in the novel he detests. When asked why he shoots Skeet all the time, if he hates it so much, he replies that there is time for CREEP and he will have a longer life. Well .... if you really want to feel the time, watch this movie! I swear ... the 82 minutes will feel longer than a four-hour David Lean epic. It goes on and on and on and on ... <br /> <br /> I hope I never see a James Toback movie again. If I could not give this a STAR, I would do that.
