I had to reduce my rating of this movie to 4 due to the terrible soundtrack. I'm pretty sure it was not a problem for me or the band because some actors and the soundtrack sounded great. However, most of the actors' voices were distorted or mutilated beyond recognition, especially for non-British people. <br /> <br /> There are many cute little twists that would make this movie an entertaining movie - accidentally landing in Bosnia is great - but a lot of humor was lost in the sound.
