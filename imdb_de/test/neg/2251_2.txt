I'm sorry, guys, but I really can not understand the overwhelming feelings everyone has with this movie ... <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I checked my watch to see how much Time I still had to spend nonsense with this kindergarten. <br /> <br /> So why this judgment? <br /> <br /> First of all: The film tells a story that does not bring any excitement! It's not even the amusingly distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we knew. This story could come from the mind of every little child. It has nothing intelligent and nothing imaginative and it continues for hours ... the story has the appropriate content for about 30 minutes. The rest are just terribly improved scenes that should leave a slightly cool image. Does not Work Even the previously seen cuts that Tarantino often uses are just confusing and in no way cool. <br /> <br /> Second, some people go to Germany and kill Nazis. Oh really? Do you? The only Nazis who killed them were a handful of guys, one of whom was man enough to die instead of betraying his companions. Is that the ugly face that Tarantino wanted to give to the Nazis? A brave soldier braver than all Basterds? Certainly not -> fail And what happens to the terrible Nazi-killing Basterds? Well, all are killed by Nazis, except two who are taken hostage -> wow, what terrible, vindictive monsters they are ... Third: Any characters? Yes, one! The only role and the only ray of hope for the entire film is Chritoph Waltz, who builds a really deep and very detailed character here. Great spectacle! Brad Pitt is really shitty and is completely outwitted by Waltz. Never seen such a poor performance by Pitt ... And the rest? Well, some Germans have never seen you and will not see you afterwards. When the movie started and I saw the group of the seven Basterds, I hoped to see something like the "Magnificent Seven": a group of extraordinary types, each with their own character and making their way to their destiny, fearless and knowing ... I was very disappointed when I saw the "inglourious Basterds". No details, no characters, no real men, just a few random types you will not remember, who have not been given a chance to differentiate themselves ... But in fact you do not even have to differentiate, because the "Inglourious Basterds" "Apart from Pitt, it does not matter much in this movie ... <br /> <br /> So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie rank 40 of the best films of all time is the only thing that leaves me open-mouthed ...
