This somewhat lumbering sci-fi horror hit of the late '50s is not quite a loser. It's about a manned space rocket that crashes in a remote area. A number of scientists are investigating that the astronaut is in a sort of coma. He is kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him. However, the title alien monster soon raises its head and causes general devastation, including partial head removal. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the movie is the tempo. It takes quite a while for the Bloodbeast to appear, and it really only comes into its own in the last 20 minutes. He is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation, but that's really not a problem as he offers quite a bit of comic relief. At the end of the movie, where we have the latest version, and this ridiculous creature is beginning to speak with the voice of the doctor he killed earlier, you will be fine for not having a giggle. Even in the brilliant X-ray scene where we see the alien embryos drifting in the astronaut's body, it's just too funny for words. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, the fun moments in Night of the Blood Beast come too little and far in between. If you're a fifties science fiction nut, it's worth checking out. Just do not expect too much.
