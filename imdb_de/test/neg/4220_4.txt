I read the book "Scarlett" and was expecting a good movie when I saw it for the first time. I am afraid to say that I was disappointed. The movie did not follow the book and made many changes I did not like. <br /> <br /> One of the changes that Lord Fenton did not present did not suit me. There was no point in making him a bad man. The end between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was very different and their whole relationship was too close. <br /> <br /> Scarlett and Rhett also had much less confrontation in the film than originally written in the book. The film sent the two in total opposition, and they did not seem to cross often enough to give the impression that there was still love between them. A good movie, but I think it could have been better than it would be if it were more akin to Alexandra Rippley's book.
