There are good-bad movies and bad-bad movies and pleasingly bad movies ... that's not part of it. This is a movie that does not realize how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw this at a screening on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of Grindhouse Cinema. this theater attracts every month. Hopefully moderators Eric Caiden & Co. I'll think twice before leaving author / director Lawrenece Foldes close. What a scammer. The guy got up in front of the movie to speak - you might think he was Orson Welles, who spoke of "Touch of Evil" or another lost classic. Barely. Nice of him that he claimed with his incoherent raid 20 minutes for the audience. <br /> <br /> "Young Warriors" has been described as a cross between "Animal House" and "Death Wish", but if you expect something based on imitations like "Revenge of the Nerds" or "The Exterminator" The script makes no sense, the direction is so bad that the actors looked embarrassing, and what can you say when the best thing about the film is shooting a car up? <br /> < Poor Richard "shaft" Roundtree In this movie he plays another character by the name of "John", but that's about the only similarity his character has here with the aforementioned classic, I hope this movie has allowed him to pay the rent for another month Other actors who look like they wish they could be anywhere else, including Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time, even the Publi kum did not seem to like that (except for the one Spazz boy who sat in the background shouting "whoa" every five minutes) and his girlfriend, who giggled with the fervor of a lobotomized Barbie talking every time she opened her mouth. <br /> <br /> For real movies about vigilantes, I would suggest the following: <br /> <br /> Death wish I, II, III, Annihilation I, Vigilante Force, Ms. 45, Rolling Thunder, the No-Mercy Man (the last two are a couple of films shown in this theater a few years ago - probably the same budget as "Young Warriors", but both were a million times better!)
