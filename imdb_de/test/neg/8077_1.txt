This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography does not match the tone of the film, the dialogue is cheesy and the actors do well. People just do not behave like that in real situations. My question is: who would finance such crap? <br /> <br /> The film begins where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman can not rescue them. Next we meet some bikers in a forest doing stunts on their bikes. A man falls and breaks his leg or something. The fireman comes to help them. In the meantime, someone starts a fire. A few more bike stunts. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
