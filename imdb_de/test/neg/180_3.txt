This film seems to be an expose of the current trend of globalization and homogenisation in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are joining more and more either big conglomerates (the American manufacturer Mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them produce "the perfect wine" - and thus, wines are very standardized and predictable. For some, this is a good thing (especially as few can afford to pay $ 50 or more for a daily wine), and for others it is awful as the uniqueness of smaller wineries disappears. I can really understand the concerns of both sides and I do not believe that there is a villain or heroes in this business. Sure, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but like beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European malls are hardly distinguishable from American) and mega-stores (like Walmart / Asda) take away the uniqueness of the "little guys" a lot. I was definitely ready and willing to listen to these filmmakers. However, with a product that was almost two and a half hours in length AND a general lack of focus, the film became too boring to watch, and I lost interest. A 80-90 minute film would have been much more effective - especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (that's the top word for a "wine lover"). <br /> <br /> On the contrary, positive is that the filmmakers are smart enough not to talk much at all - and just let them talk on both sides of the topic. Plus, the topic is so current and up to date. Despite the choice of a good documentary style, the film just goes on far too long and makes a very boring movie.
