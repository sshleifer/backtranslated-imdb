Based on what I saw from this show, I do not think I'll ever see her again. It's not nearly credible and frankly, the Derek character just makes me angry. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if I can see such a spoiled brat again and again? Why should I want to see this?!? No, thank you, there are many other shows involving deviant characters (eg Pim of Phil of the Future) where the evil does not win or if he does not do it the way she does do. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that I think that this is a horrible picture that you can paint about living with step-siblings. Yes, life is not rosy, but you could try to portray a character who was not downright evil and wins. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you only observe this when you see the villain win.
