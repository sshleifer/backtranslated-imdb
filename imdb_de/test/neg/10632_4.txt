I would say that this is a background movie. Play it as a background when you are busy with the work (washing clothes, checking e-mail, etc.). I thought this was a movie made before Amy Adams was successful after Enchant. Not correct! It was made in 2009! The script / script is pretty awful. I love musicals, but the singing is just average and does not move the action. Ughh. It almost seems like a television movie based on cinematography. Am I a TV show? <br /> <br /> The secretary also breaks into song. What is that f @ # $ going on ?! Actually, she seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so great in Enchanted. Main actor is average. Certainly disappointed. This movie would have been good for life, but that's about it. :(
