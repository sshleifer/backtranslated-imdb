I have nothing against the weird artistic film. But when they are peppered with Arcane imagery and bleak dialogue, and when it's obvious that they were meant for the ego of the filmmaker rather than the viewer, I get annoyed. I'm not a stupid person, but I just did not understand what this movie was about. Or do The movie is a great form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use them for obfuscation instead?
