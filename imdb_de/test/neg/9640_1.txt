I find it terribly ironic that "left wing" Hollywood secures its bets and makes those awful, lukewarm films that neither condemn nor embrace the war on terror. <br /> <br /> The pacifist, and you're hoping for a full-scale condemnation of the war, like BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY or ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, this movie is going to really feel like a rip-off. None of these soldiers actually doubts this war or any war or the idea of ​​war. They complain only about having to do another tour. <br /> <br /> However, if you are a patriotic American and want to see a story of courage and honor, this film will really feel like a rip off. None of these soldiers loves America or even loves the service. The way they pout and pout looks more like suburban teens than hard guys. It's not we were soldiers, and it's not SANDS OF IWO JIMA. It's not even a thoughtless action, and the war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Philippe can not fully support this kind of movie. Although he is devastatingly sexy, in a tough trade, in a man's room, bisexual, it's hard to imagine him as a slow Texas boy who wants to get up and be counted. This is not a Sgt. Croft in Mailer THE NAKED AND THE DEAD. He is more like Joel in Truman Capote's OTHER VOICES, OTHER ROOMS. He can not sell you on the idea that he was in the fight and did his part OR that he wants his wife and wants her now. He hisses on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes, looking as if he prefers to lean forward and make a good, stiff attack from behind.
