Is it a badly traded, clich√©d pile? Of course. Anyone who is not aware that if he picks up the box at the video store, he probably will not have any real movies at all. Therefore, I will now rate the aspects of the film that are really important to us on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore: 4 - For this genre, there are very few deaths and The Gaps is almost not available. Anyone looking for blood should probably look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things, raising the bar a little higher children are looking for. <br /> <br /> Nudity / Sex: 7 - Lots of boobs from three different women, one of which is MTV vj Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes, but little is shown. <br /> <br /> Unintentional Humor - 4 - There are a few good laughs with the kids trying to look weird, but all in all it's just bad, not funny bad. <br /> <br /> Overall - 4 - It's not unsurpassed. There are some funny moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie. However, only watch this movie if you are a big fan of the 80s Slasher movies. This definitely falls on the lower end of the scale, but it's not quite down. The real downside is the disappointing ending. It almost ruined the movie for me.
