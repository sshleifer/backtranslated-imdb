This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I would think you could get that from the title. There is also a special love scene that could be the strangest in film history. I can not even remember why I saw this movie or when. Only this is an absolutely terrible movie experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the absolutely craziest movie that wastes two hours of your time, then definitely rent it. Good luck finding it in your store. I doubt that this movie is very widespread. And please do not show this to children, as it can falsify their impressive mind forever.
