I've read almost every major book about the Manhattan Project. Most people know what it was, but few understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its range was immeasurably massive - in US history perhaps only rivaled by the space program of the 1960s. There were literally millions of people from all walks of life in numerous locations (most of them hidden away) across the country, each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project, which he did not share with Person who was sitting in the cabin next to them, let alone his family. The logistics are overwhelming, especially given the aspects of communication, security and transport from wartime in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> For example - my colleague's father was a carpenter and worked for one of the contractors with the federal government for the Manhattan Project. His job was to oversee a crew of about 30 other carpenters responsible for making molds for concreting massive research facilities in Hanford, Washington. That was "everything" he did six days a week for nearly two years. These carpenters needed food, housing, sanitation, hospitals and supplies, as did Oppenheimer and his people at the top of the pyramid. Just think about it! That being said, it is simply impossible to justify the subject in a 2-hour movie. But in defense of Joffe I would say that they had an impossible task, especially since he decided on a varied script with multiple plots, multiple angles and multiple characters. What exactly was he thinking, and how could he be so arrogant as to believe that this would work? That's Hollywood, I think. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN and LITTLE BOY have so many shortcomings that it takes a book to perform them all. Terrible casting Terrible (and politically motivated) writing. Bad Science The depictions of Groves and Oppie are particularly inaccurate and downright annoying. Despite the all-too-obvious agenda of the script, it's still incredibly boring and sloppy. <br /> <br /> These errors were listed elsewhere in the IMDb, but I was particularly impressed that the scientists had so much time on their hands - softball, horseback riding, parties, semi-formal dinners, ballet etc. not to mention the romance and, of course, the circulation of political petitions. According to FM & LB, we might have won this war before D-Day, if those great brains had come out of their duffs and actually spent some time in the lab instead of seducing Laura Dern. <br /> <br /> One last point of criticism - - FM & LB mentions that "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the code names of the two atomic bombs, but it is not mentioned that these names are a half-good-natured jab at Groves were ("fat man" for heavy) stature) and Oppenheimer ("Little Boy"). Another reason why Paul Newman should not have been in this movie ...
