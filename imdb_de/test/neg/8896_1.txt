Hey, I know that Angel is not the kind of show that brings a happy ending to people, and I know that they could not do everything perfectly, but I could not believe the end of Angel. I absolutely love the show, it may be the best show ever. However, I really hated that end, as did the entire second half of Angel's Season 5 (similar to Buffy's Season 7). The death of my favorite characters was pretty pointless and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters on the show, and when she and Angel finally got together, she turned all evil into a demon. I really wanted to have her back, do not get me wrong. The episode where Cordelia comes back is awesome, but I was still very angry that she was gone. Then on earth Fred was dying right after she came with Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was pointless, it did not do anything for the plot, and the blue-haired demon girl is a terrible, useless character. They spent far too much of the end around them. Another big problem is that the elements were not connected well enough. I know the boys in this black thorn wanted to bring about the apocalypse, but there was not even a date for when it would happen. The Apocalypse was said to have been performed and discovered throughout the season, rather than just mentioning that there are some bad guys one hour before the end of the season. One of the biggest problems is that every character the audience cares about is either dead or has nothing to live on. My three favorite characters died, and Angel, Spike, and Gunn (who I'm not sure if they survive at all) have no job, are not even going to help the helpless, they're in the middle of a big battle, and they're all lost that are important to them. Angel and Spike are never saved, they lose the girl they care about, and almost all are dead, and they still have to fight this weird evil army. I get the whole thing that you never stop fighting, but it was stupid to finish it in the middle. Could not there have been salvation knowing that there will be many more battles? I do not understand why this episode is so highly rated because I think Buffy's end was ten times better and I was not even a huge fan of it. Why did they have to slip in the end, Season 3 and 4 and the first half of five years were so incredible, then they messed up the show.
