I have awarded this presentation with 4 stars. They are all for the script that was slain unrecognized in places. What can you say? They took one of the most beautiful pieces of the last century and methodically robbed them of heart, humor and humanity. I'm not really blaming the actors, who are probably doing their best with inferior directing and incomplete characters. I blame the director very much who has to work hard to undermine the script. There are so many unpleasant pauses in this TV movie, uncomfortably re-staged moments and awkwardly reinterpreted line readings that sometimes I forgot to love the piece. I'm not one of those people who think genius games in the movie are automatically inferior (quite the contrary), but this special genius game was undercut by this excursion. Now I hope they make a * real * movie out of this piece. The world deserves it.
