Can anyone remember BRAVEHEART? It played Mel Gibson, who also directed and was directed by Randall Wallace. The movie contains over 200 errors. Can anyone remember the GREEN BERETS? This is the western John Wayne, in which the duke rescues a homestead called Vietnam from a series of insults from the Commie tribe. If you look at WE WERE SOLDIERS, you can not help but be reminded of these two films. <br /> <br /> First of all, what about this Scottish lawsuit, which is played three times in the movie, four if you are counting the credits. I mean, what is the connection between Scotland and `Nam? Maybe Wallace uses it in vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - with unsatisfactory emphasis - with several Oscars then this movie? Whatever the reason, it really contains pitchers. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I expected him to say something like, "They'll never take our liberty - hell wants them" and it's impossible not to notice any similarities with THE GREEN BERETS Like the epilogue of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior, Moore tells the journalist of guilt in a scene almost identical to the one shown in the Wayne movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience does not remember others Movies WWS is not on its own, it is based on the real events of 1965, but seems to lack integrity to do justice to the story. She never feels like 1965 and she lacks a sense of time and place, probably because it was filmed in America, not in Asia. Hal Moore might have been able to brush up on the French experience in Indochina, but if that was the case, it was unique because the American military was doing its best not to read the French Indochina war. The earlier conflict Westmoreland replied that he had nothing from the French "Who has not won a war since the days of Napoleon," was why I was puzzled by the NVA's portrayal of this film when, in 1965, the American Supreme Command's contempt for Hybri's attitude contempted the North Vietnamese and the VC. It's as if the story has been rewritten to show that Vietnam's rice farmers are excellent warriors. They are, but few Americans believed it in the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> There are a few other things that puzzled me, as if the women were receiving telegrams from home telling them that their husbands are dead? No body is shown returning to the base, and no one on the screen can see who was killed in La Drang Valley. Likewise we see no reinforcement on the screen. How do we suddenly see that the Americans call the NVA? I take this as a mistake of directing and editing Wallace, who does not strike me as a director, and his biggest problem seems to be to convey the horror of the battle. Take the scene in which the American is burned to a crispy fire and flies away with a scream, "Tell my wife, I love her". This should have an emotional impact, similar to THAT death scene in PLATOON, but here is no effect. In fact, I found the scene clich√©d and patronizing, and he is not the only character to say "tell my wife ..." while he was mutilated or dying. I counted that at least two other characters use the sentence. Did the characters actually say that in battle? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have reservations. <br /> <br /> I sat in awe and looked at APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water, I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET. I kept checking my watch with THE DEER HUNTER, and after seeing that we were SOLDIERS, I felt totally patronized
