I have been following THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL for the stated purpose of refuting this so-called scientific atheist. I do not know where to start because he is so stupid. <br /> <br /> He is obviously not a statistician, otherwise he would have been burnt for him forever by 2: 1. Faith in God <br /> <br /> He sees science as a religion and expects us to be believe him as we do God. One only has to look at the language used in his postulations. <br /> <br /> Concerning the faith. This product is extensively used in everyday behavior. Just think about it. If he gets an electrician, he thinks he's wired properly and turns on the switch confidently. When he gets into a plumber, he pulls the chain into his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. As for the belief in science When I was in chemistry classes, I believed and was taught that the atom is the smallest particle and the onion-skin theory of the electrons, both of which have now been neglected. This was taught to me as an atomic theory, so to speak "written in stone". Why should we believe a scientist, especially if he goes beyond the parameters of his discipline? Dawkins explains that religion will be the downfall of civilization. Religion is civilization. Can he or another atheist please tell us which civilization was founded and promoted by atheism, barbarism or cruelty? He now lives in the last stages of a Christian civilization and takes advantage of all that without being admitted to his source. I found Dawkins arrogant, dictatorial, judgmental, an obvious supporter of eugenics, and a Nazi in his attitude toward the youth. How dare he say what a parent can teach his child? The child belongs to them, not the nation, and as the parents leave their genetic material behind, they leave their faith behind. His deprecation of Adam as "he never existed", since he has no proof, was an example of this attitude. So I have no proof that Joe Blogs lives in New York, but he could do it. I just have not found any proof. That does not negate its existence. I note that he argues with the Bishop of Oxford that the prelate chooses what he takes and believes in the Bible. Well, that's what Dawkins does. Where does he draw the line between him as a historical document and a religious statement? He is also selective. I heard all this when Dawkins found the ALTRUISTIC gene. What a scream. He's desperately looking for proof of his craziness and when the Piltdown man was invented, we now have this so-called ALTRUISTIC gene, which causes us to take care of our young and other members of our "group". The problem is that all animals do this - not just monkeys, and with evolution it's the survival of the fittest. not the friendliest, and when he really thinks we're getting friendlier, he does not read the same papers as me. I found his arrogance beyond belief when he said that if we only have this life, we can enjoy it to the fullest. How does he equate this with his obvious position as a wealthy European to a destitute person in Africa who has wiped out his entire family, probably raping and starving? Will he help her? I realize that all his opposition to religion is a) that they go to war. Well, GK Chesterton said the only war worth fighting for was a war for religion. B) We are against using contraception, abortion and homosexuality. All sins against the sixth commandment. Funny that. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic, I find it wrong that Pius XII. The declaration of the dogma of the Assumption in 1958 dismissed. He, Pius, never said that it was revealed to him when he was sitting alone somewhere. If Dawkins does not know, the revelation ended with the last apostle. For years Pius would have sought advice and studied documents that had been handed down over the centuries to make this statement. Even as a Catholic I find the deposition of all religious people satisfied. what a garbage! Every day we fight for the world, the flesh and the devil. We are the militant church. We can also boast at sunset and admire the beauties of nature, even if we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that he interviewed crazy zealots and extrapolated them to us all.
