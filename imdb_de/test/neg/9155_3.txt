Great book, bad movie. Cheesy performances and constructed situations make this film a sentimental boredom. Flat and uninspired works by most actors leave this film in the After School Special category. No doubt there are plenty of talents to tap into in this cast and crew, but something went awry. The very talented Gretchen Mol tries to pull this movie out of the swamp, but even she does not seem to rise above the stupid dialogue. It feels like everyone has just called. Even the make-up (Mulrooney ages 20 years in the course of the film) looks unsightly and crude. Do not waste your time with this clunker ... read the book.
