This is a case where a fairy tale goes too far. The Enchanted Cottage delivers Dorothy McGuire as "terribly ugly" Spinster and Robert Young as disfigured pilot. In short, Scarface marries Spinster, and her love miraculously transforms her into beautiful people (lighting, cosmetics, and the removal of fake scars) - a magical change that she attributes to the charm of living together in a seaside cottage from generations of honeymooners. <br /> <br /> If the story stops there, alright? It would be a fable with a proverbial message: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But it leaps forward and reaches for reality. When Mr. and Mrs. Scarface greet their audience, it is a painful shock to them that they are still homey. You see, they just look beautiful to each other? A situation that the audience is well prepared for, because all the secondary characters have preached, that poor beneficiaries must really lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy. You know. Take up hobbies. Spinster makes woodcuts, for example. Scarface considers collecting driftwood. <br /> <br /> The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and the filmmakers have no confidence in human nature. Their message is: You are either ugly or pretty, and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one. What's worse, ugly people obviously have to think of their lover as pretty. Reality just does not do it. <br /> <br /> It's amazing what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
