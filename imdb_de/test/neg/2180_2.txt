This is supposed to be Charlie's masterpiece, but I want to say that it is actually one of his weaker films. First of all, it's not funny. Nothing in this movie made me laugh. Okay, it's a quick jump into a box that was a giggle, but that was desperation. The first and only talk of the tramp in which he speaks (he sings in an earlier movie), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he's in "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush" - two films that were so much fun to watch at least ten times better than this movie. There is literally only one good scene in this film, the one in which Hitler plays like a beach ball with the globe. That's it. <br /> <br /> Okay, much praise is called for being the first to go to war long before we went to war. Nope. Not true. Just not true, so that the praise can be rejected something. The Three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940 with "You Natzy Spy" - ten months earlier than the release of Chaplin's October - and this movie was really funny! If you want to see Chaplin's biggest movie, just look at it for reference. And then Pop in Modern Times, Gold Rush, City Lights, Limelight, The Kid or even Tillie's Punctured Romance.
