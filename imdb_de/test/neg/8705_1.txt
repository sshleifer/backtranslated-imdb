I appreciate that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel, and that the film helps viewers to put their foot into Moses' shoes and understand the heavy burden Moses has been putting on his shoulders. As excited as I wanted to see this movie, I was very disappointed with the story. (I will omit the videography, special effects, and artistic abilities in this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this film and how far removed it is from the historical accounts of biblical texts. An overriding principle of the Bible is that * God * led his people out of Egypt and he promised that he would bring them to a land where milk and honey flow. He not only made that promise, but he led his people by day into a pillar of cloud and by night into a pillar of fire. He never left her; He was always visible to the Israelites. However, the film shows a god who remains silent during the entire migration through the desert. This film changed the essence and theme of the biblical text, portraying God as a silent, cruel, disciplinary emptiness. <br /> <br /> In addition, the depiction of Moses was just as wrong. Moses was known as a man of faith (why else should he be such a father figure to Israel throughout the Old and New Testaments, even though Moses is known as a man of great faith). However, the film shows him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure loner who despises the vocation that God has placed in his life. OK, I give the filmmakers some creative freedom in the Exodus story ... but that goes beyond creativity - it's heresy.
