Contains Major Spoiler, on the occasion you would actually be interested in the story. <br /> <br /> OK, we have storms destroying a city and a computer hacker blocking the power grid. <br /> <br /> Predictable stroke from the beginning, and if that were not enough, the 5-second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what a bit of tension it might have been. For example: can you make it to the airport in time? Things look dark when we go to a commercial, and the action shot in front of the ad shows them jumping around the plane! Well, I guess they'll do it, but they had to because they're good guys. <br /> <br /> The acting was not particularly impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid as Tornado Tommy), the impact was quite lame, the bad guys got it and the good guys came through. The real disaster of this film was the script, especially the end. Not only did they happily pack things as fast as a soap opera with 24-hour notice, they also glorified the hacker as good-natured. So he has claimed a myriad of casualties. And of course an uplifting television report about people coming together. Kotzen. It was all I expected from the commercials, and I'm glad I wasted my time looking at them. Tomorrow there will be a good conversation at the lunch table. <br /> <br /> Does CBS insult us? For sure? But we saw it, did not we? Have you counted many ads that existed during this pig for home fuse generators? <br /> <br /> Here we hope for the next plan 9 of Outer Space (which gets better with each ad). That's not it. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
