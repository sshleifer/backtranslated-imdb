I will not waste your time describing the conspiracy, the other reviewer has already done quite well. However, I will tell you my opinion about this film. This movie is basically anti-Japanese propaganda. The Japanese are portrayed as unbelievably evil men who are respectful of nothingness and have very poor martial arts skills (groups of Japanese men are kicked in the ass by several women alone) fighters lose almost every (if not every) fight in the film, who somehow takes away the tension. The plot is actually pretty solid and perfect for a kung fu movie. The problem is that not much is fought. If there are fights, some fights are pretty good, but other scenes are badly choreographed. A scene angela mao picks up six Japanese in a church and kick their asses. The problem is that they show how they fight one after the other, if they are to attack everyone at the same time. I think this movie was incredibly cheap, considering how cheap some sets are. They use the same village when they are in Korea and when they are in China without changing it. However, some scenes are shot in real locations and look good. Overall, the only real problem with the movie is the slow and uninteresting plot. Since there are only a few combat scenes, we have to rely on the plot for entertainment, and I was not entertained. <br /> <br /> one and a half stars out of four
