I remember that I saw that years ago. It had a pretty promising start with an interesting premise, but then it quickly became nonsense. Unnecessary characters, failed attempts to add drama and suspense, and a slightly simplified philosophy that all ended in a terrible end. <br /> <br /> It's just garbage. <br /> <br /> Before watching this TV movie, I did not think I would ever have a movie that I thought was the "worst" I've ever seen. But after I finished this movie, I knew that from then on. When someone asked me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I could say without hesitation, "The Second Coming." <br /> <br /> Avoid.
