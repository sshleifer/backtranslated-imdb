This sourly sweet and tedious 5-reel stand is definitely not one of Harold Lloyd's better films. Gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. Saccharin melodrama is abundant. Construction takes forever as Lloyd, the unconventional but incredibly friendly country doctor, spins his rounds and brings a bit of sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly and puppies. It's like a 1922 version of Patch Adams. Pooh. 10.4.
