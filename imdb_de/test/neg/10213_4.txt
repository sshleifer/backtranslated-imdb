Hulk Hogan plays as Champion Wrestler (a real drama ...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, title and girlfriend from a greedy corporation who wanted to sign him for their network (because wrestling sells!) Rip refuses, however, the network gets a championship in the circuit-fighting fight (and I'm really serious) "Battle of the Thoughts", whose champion Zeus (played by Tiny Lister Jr) is perhaps the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and taken to a hospital. No Holds Barred is pretty much what I expected from Vince McMahon's production of the least versatile actor in the action genre (Hogan). It's basically a lot of unwanted humor, a lot of unpleasant sequences, a few neat action sequences and a lot of stupidity. In other words, it's not unlike wrestling, so I rate it above all because anyone who rents it knows what it's getting. The movie is cheap, but good enough for what it is, and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy it. I found that ultimately hilarious. It is moments of such absurdity that one only has to laugh at oneself. (How Hogan leaps 20 feet into the air after standing in a limousine, forcing a guy to shit on himself, and of course the way Hogan quotes from his cuecard. (IE: "I'm not going there If this check works! ") No Holds Barred is a lot of fun, even if it's all about how ridiculous it is. Fans of the camp should really enjoy this clever clinker. <br /> <br /> * * out of 4- (fair)
