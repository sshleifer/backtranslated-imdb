Boring, absolutely predictable soap opera. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson, who has an affair with Christine Lahti. Moore is friends with Lahti and does not know the scam. Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with his baby. YAWNING! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to admit that in 1986 I paid to see it in a theater. I liked all three stars, but even their considerable talents could not do that. I always knew what would happen. As already said in another poster - this is like a CV movie with PG rating. <br /> <br /> Lahti scolded her at one point and even Moore lets go! There are also pointless settings from the top without women playing football (!!!). Otherwise it is TV friendly. The only good thing was that Timothy Gibbs was playing Moore and Danson's teenage son. Very handsome and pretty good actor. Apart from that, there is nothing to recommend. You've seen it before ... and done it better. It has obviously been forgotten. Skip it.
