"Rise of the Footsoldier" follows the relentless cruel journey of gangster Carlton Leach and his associates through drugs, violence, sex, violence, weapons, violence, and did I mention violence? Protagonist Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett.)), Member of the ICF (Inner City Firm); a group of football hooligans who became professional gangsters led the audience through the events that led to the 1995 Range Rover Killings, which killed three members of the gang with particularly vicious professional hits. Leach's success as a bouncer and talent for finding violent friends to control recalcitrant visitors at a local nightclub takes him into the company of notorious drug traffickers and gangsters who profitably benefit from the rave scene and drug culture of the '80s-' 90s , <br /> <The viewer opens with brutally realistic attitudes of the dead and is thirsty to understand what happened, but he remains completely unsatisfied. The next 2 hours meander through a series of innumerable character entries. Each one of them basically establishes another typical "hard man" who shows that he usually attacks unearned victims before he is likely to get worse. What a bit of emotional understanding the audience may form for some of the characters (for example, a family member blamed for missing drugs) is quickly destroyed if they are either killed in an anti-climatic manner or their plot remains unresolved. The intimations of an act introduced in the beginning are inadequately closed with vague impressions of the manner of the murders, as the events are rewarded little if they persist with the hazy confusion of past events. <br /> <br /> This film was developed with a standard formula for an audience that prefers violence and 'Arnsnuss' slang to an actual storyline. 'Rise of the Footsoldier' ​​borrows too much from 'Football Factory', skipping the good pieces, demonstrating no moral impact from the hooligan subculture or empathy in the protagonists. The violence, though brilliantly shot, seems exaggerated and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to be emotionally attached. The implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is justified, but machete bouncers who routinely commit criminal homicide in public spaces are driving the imagination of even the most willing audience. The audience is confused about the relevance of many key events and developed characters that did not affect the final conclusion. The attempted "coarse-grained realism" is destroyed with a substance called "Truth Serum", with which the Turkish mafia brings honest answers from unwilling persons. This is NOT the genre in which psychologically unrealistic drugs must be invented and makes the survey almost absurd. <br/> <br /> The actual scenes of violence (before they repeat themselves) maintain a certain tension, which is linked by quick flashes of color or by the assortment of colors ending a roll of film. Seamlessly choreographed brawls paired with compulsive but effective, shaky hand-held camera work save the movie, but unfortunately the plot (or lack of it) restricts it to a niche data set. In essence, the events of this film are represented on not meritorious, and a sufficiently sequential plot is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot. This movie has a place in the market, but if you like a little brain with your brutality, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/
