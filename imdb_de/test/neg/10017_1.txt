The New York family is the last in their neighborhood to have a television that almost ruins David Niven's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. A bedroom comedy that seldom ventures into the bedroom (and nothing sexy happens there anyway). Gaynor has about as much as an actress as an oven - she turns it on, she turns off. The only compensation for the film is a supporting performance by Patty Duke, before "Miracle Worker", as Niven's daughter. She is adorable; "Happy Anniversary" does not exist. * from ****
