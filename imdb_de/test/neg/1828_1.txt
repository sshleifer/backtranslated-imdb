Anatomy was a German film with subtitles. Besides, he was boring and boring. If it was a horror movie, it failed miserably for me The filming was fine, but more attention should be paid to the terrible banal script. I did not pay anything to watch the video, and I still feel betrayed. I read a book and saved your money.
