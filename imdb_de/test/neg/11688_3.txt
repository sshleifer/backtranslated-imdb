What on earth was that? My family and I have just spent 2 hours of our life for this garbage !!! There was no plot, no tension, just boredom !!! My kids could make better movies with our video camera. <br /> <br /> But maybe we did not understand the point of the movie ... oh, my mother did that. She was the only one who liked it for the following reason: "At least a movie without screaming cars ..." If you're looking for a war movie in which there is no fight, that's still interesting and gripping and has a strong anti-war message, then you should see "The Trench". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 because it's good enough for an afternoon nap and because I'm too nice ...
