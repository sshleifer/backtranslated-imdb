Actually, I'm not a big fan of Abbott & Costello (though I like "Who's On First") and frankly, there was not much in this movie that would inspire me to see more of their work. It was not really that bad. There were a couple of slightly amusing scenes and actually a very convincing giant played by Buddy Baer, ​​but given the duo's fame and appreciation that they hold in general, I have to say that I expected more. As the story goes, the two stumble into a babysitting job, and while Jack & The Beanstalk is read as a bedtime story (with the kid she read to Costello), Costello's Jack falls asleep and dreams of history. There is a kind of "Wizard of Oz" in the story in which the characters in the dream are all correspondences of Jack's real acquaintances and the film starts in black and white and turns in color during the dream sequence. The fight scenes between Jack and the Giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the amusing parts of the film. Of course, Polly also leads to one of the film's questions - what happened to her? Jack and gang apparently left them in the giant's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who cares. Nevertheless - I asked myself. There were also some nice song and dance routines. My 4-year-old giggled a bit, so she could appreciate the humor. I found it an acceptable timewaster, but certainly nothing that could convince you as comic geniuses of Abbott and Costello. 4.10
