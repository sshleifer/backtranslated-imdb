I found that Dominion was a lousy attempt to continue the story's success. The original movie was a story about evil and how it can infiltrate our lives. Schrader's version lacks the evil. Viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of fear, fear or even ignorance. Harlins version offers obvious evil, shows violations of the sanctity of the church and forms a convincing story, which is plausible given the background of Father Merrin. According to Schrader's story, one wonders exactly what has happened. Dominion does not evoke the emotions of the onlookers who empathize with Father Merrin and makes the viewer wonder why he got into trouble at all. Anyone interested in seeing a sequel that corresponds to the original should see Exorcist: The Beginning.
