Eh. I watch this movie in class because someone has picked it up and brought it along. I had expected a half-hearted attempt to depict the Heracles myths, and because the ads looked serious, I expected something reasonably decent. <br /> After ten minutes, I realized it was really CRAP. The only things in the movie that are reasonably true to the myth are the bare (and I mean naked) minimum. Parents, half-brothers and works seemed to be named correctly. Besides, the rest of the movie seemed a huge inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I would say that this was not much better than the Disney version of the movie. The Disney version was designed for small children and was therefore not too serious. This movie of all the sex, violence and nudity was clearly meant for an older audience, but the story depicted in it was almost inaccurate as the Disney movie.
