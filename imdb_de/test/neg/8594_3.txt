The basic action is good and can be captivating. The music is so great that it became theme music for the television program IRON CHEF (though overloaded with WAY and too intrusive in the movie). So, how did this movie go so bad?!?! Well, the plot was 95% predictable and the characters were as one-dimensional as possible. And the dialogue?! Which person would actually allow himself to receive credit for the advent of the STUPID macho bull scrape, which is allegedly dialogue? You get a lot more realism from most cartoons! The conclusion is that this film has some good points, but is clouded by crazy clich√©s and rotted dialogues so that it quickly becomes tiring. And that's a shame, because firefighters deserve a better tribute than this mess! If you do not believe me, look at the number of fools listed on IMDb for this movie - much more than what you would expect. They simply did not care enough to solve all the kinks and problems. As a result, the movie seems to be in a hurry and needs to be rewritten and edited.
