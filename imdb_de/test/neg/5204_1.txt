**** SOME SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you have not seen on the internet yet. Nothing is shocking about this movie. In the film, a man is soaked by a goat, there is a bulldozer decapitation and a lesbian's face burns. All these scenes of "extreme violence" are so fake that one wonders why anyone wants to turn up this piece of garbage at all. I just can not believe I spent hard earned money on arguably the worst movie ever. Do not be fooled by the reviews, this movie would be a shame for EVERYONE ... except maybe prisons who want to torture inmates. For a true classic, see Bloodsucking freaks or even the newer Doom generation. Island of Death sinks to the bottom of the movie toilet and has to be flushed out of existence.
