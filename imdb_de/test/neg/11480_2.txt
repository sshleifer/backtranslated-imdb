This should be renamed "Everybody Loves Sebastian". The rural high school junior from 1983 (or senior? - they seemed to beat the flop-flop on it) with weird hair and a "Leo-like" good looks has a big record full of problems. His stepfather announces definitive plans for a sex reassignment surgery, whereupon his mother gives up the marriage; Sebastian is called the "f" word by everyone and her mother, "kissed" with various girls over and over again, played in a supermarket in a ready-whip, and a "strawberry" prostitute rescued from the fists of her reckless man. <br /> <br /> Sebastian's "buddy" makes Eddie Haskal look like a choirboy; Bad connection will not get much worse. Sebastian seems to opt for "Harold's" suicide attempts (though he does not allow suicidal tendencies). For no apparent reason, the ingenious SAT graduate Sebastian MUST completed a year earlier, although he has no idea about the future and also does not want to attend college (what is this nonsense?). <br /> <br /> This film is a glimpse into a few weeks in the life of a person who is PRETTY MESSED UP. The last scene suggests that things will be alright, even if the HOW is left to the viewer alone. The creators of this film seem to rely solely on the undeniable attraction of the very attractive male lead. The "story" leaves something to be desired. Looking for "What will this beautiful child do next ...?" does not satisfy exactly. The lackluster production values ​​simply do not fit with other films, regardless of whether they're independent or not. A low budget and a weak history need more than a pretty face to enforce it. The "results" of this project are unforgettable and an insult to smart cinema fans.
