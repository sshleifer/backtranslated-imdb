The film uses motifs that could be plagiarized from "Wait Before Dark" (1967), a much better film by Terence Young, starring Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new here - the hidden object in the doll, the bad men who want it, the bad guy who pretends to be a good guy. However, the disability has shifted: Audrey Hepburn could not see the child in DS could not speak. Both stories, however, depend on the handicap. Where "Wait Before Dark" built up unbearable suspense, "Dead Silent" lets guess the result, since the story is such a stereotype.
