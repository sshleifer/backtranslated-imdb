This is one of the films I've seen and wondered why I looked at it. What did I find so interesting about it? I was a truck driver myself and did not find it very realistic. No, I've never used a "big lizard", nor have I ever seen or heard anyone travel the country in a brand new seventeen thousand-dollar camper. <br /> <br /> The same with a pimp who never tasted the woman in question (until the end of the film, and he still did not really ...), and he only got a cut of $ 50 " "if the prostitute gets $ 200.00 (over $ 150) after his cut, yes ...). <br /> <br /> I'm still laughing at the amount of lizard comment that Ivey made (they're Lot Lizards, they're going to mess up everything at $ 20, and some are dressed as a woman ... or something equally scary), that is, we are better than they are because we may still be prostitutes, but we are better paid. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it's just a story of a young man A woman who wanted something more out of life than a dead end when she was living at home (she's 18, remember?) and by ashamed of her mother, who basically does the same thing (dead end). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. She did five tricks on the road ... I wonder if the $ 750.00 she made was worth it? I do not suppose.
