How this film can be classified as a drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen I would try to delete this from my CV. It was historically as accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses were merged in Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew Lot, appears thousands of years before he was born. Canaanites walked the earth ... really? What did the scriptwriters think? Was it just ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and animals, about Lot and Canaanites and all the stuff of Sunday school") or trying to insult the greatest possible number of people on earth - Christians, Jews and Muslims Historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... Was nobody really offended? Anyone who had even a taste for it, would have gotten this train!
