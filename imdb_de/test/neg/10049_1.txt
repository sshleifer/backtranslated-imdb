What if someone made a horror movie that was completely without action? <br /> <br /> Well, I think it would probably end a bit like this. I do not think I've ever seen a movement so stable that it slipped from the hacker (at the beginning) to the complete crap (at the end). I only stayed with it because I thought it could not possibly get worse. Well, until the end, "Necrophagus" / "Graveyard of Dread" has proved wrong. Who would have guessed that a movie with an undead lizardman, evil, robbing cultists, and crazy scientists thrown in for no apparent reason could suck so badly? One would think that there is at least a certain sense of humor ... but not here.
