Retro Puppet Master is complete and absolutely CRAP. In particular, the dolls look stupid and crappy. The acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid. This movie goes back to the past, where the puppets were first created. Retro Puppet Master was rated PG-13, the first Puppet Master rated PG-13. The movie does not contain any horror or suspense bucket of blood, good acting or any kind of entertainment like the previous films have done. Do not watch this movie, do not rent it or watch it on TV because this movie is stale, not violent and totally crappy by 10. As a Puppet Master fan, I'm disappointed ... seriously.
