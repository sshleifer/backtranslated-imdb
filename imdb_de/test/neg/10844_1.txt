This is a strong recommendation to anyone reading this review who has never seen the movie Total Reality. Do not waste your time and money on renting this bad excuse for a movie. This is the incomparably worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I've had nightmares about this movie since I saw it. The acting was terrible and every amateur film maker could make a decent movie. The film obviously rips off far superior science-fiction movies like TimeCop or Total Recall (from which the title seems to have been derived). I'm sorry, but I just think it's more fun to look at the side of a box for two hours. If you've already seen this movie, I'm sorry that you went through what I did.
