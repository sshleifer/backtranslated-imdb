The review on the main page admits the movie is awful, but you should forgive it because it's pretty violent. No, you should not. There are spoilers at the end of this review, but as I can "spoil" this lazy movie, I have no idea. Even if you're a diehard alien / pred fan, I'm waiting for the DVD. It's also not worth the 3.99 rent, but you're less likely to really hate this movie if you pay less than $ 12 per person plus a supplement for a supplement in a theater. <br /> <br /> In the theater I saw AVPr, there were exactly two laughs, both from a girl sitting next to me. Otherwise there was absolute silence. No ooohs or "that was a bad ass!", Nothing. Imagine being a patient on an operating table and getting only the anesthetic. Now you know how you will feel in the theater after the opening scene of AVPr. <br /> <br /> What was the budget in this movie? As with "War of the Worlds," "MI 3," and other f / x-led films, the director seems to do much more with what CGI folks expect to develop than characters or plot. Spielberg has tried this several times and failed, mostly with Tom Cruise. Sure the films make money, but should they? The War of the Worlds and the Minority Report had the budget for a decent script, Tom Cruise and others, and SS itself, but they were still terrible. I'm sure AVP wasted 90% of its budget on CG and had no choice but to hire an actor who would say yes, even though the casting agent would have done it better if he had accidentally gone to the supermarket and actor There's no tension in any scene, so we're never near to be surprised. Who cares who gets killed? We did not know any of them, we all know what happens when the little aliens leave their bodies, we all know the blood is acid. In Alien, Aliens 3, Resurrection and even AVP, the directors use the fact that the aliens can think, hide and fall. This director decided that the Ridley Scott, James Cameron and other idiots were for developing characters that you either want to see live or killed. In this episode, it will never matter to you who lives or dies, not a child, a parent, a pregnant woman. The characters in this movie are for one purpose only to die. The opening scenes show that the movie will be a predictable joke. The scenes of character development mix clichÃ©s, bad humor and bad drama and make the viewer a point where we really do not care if they are killed as long as they die in ways never seen before. But they do not do it. The director was trying to do something different from the ones that preceded him in the alien franchise, but he only succeeded in throwing away the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and stealing the rest from other recent science-fiction films br /> There is no original use of the alien or pred characters. Actually, The Pred has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen, though the last movie convinced us that Pred venerated the aliens as such a deadly enemy that they used killing a rite as a rite of passage. The AlienPred was never really designed as a terrifying creature. His ability to inject parasites into a host has been torn from various films. Lately, Hellboy was probably where Samiel's fragmented tongue was injecting eggs into Hellboy or Doom, where the mutant creatures would leave their tongues after they had stabbed the neck of a victim br /> Simply put, we have no reason in this movie to take care of anything. There is violence, but it is not a shock or a surprise and nothing that has not been seen in any of the hundred Slasher films. The CG is fine and both alien species need to see and move like in previous films. But since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad, we somehow hope they all die. The little girl was probably the gang's best actor, but unfortunately we do not care if kids, women, or anyone else lives or dies. We just want the movie to end. At some point it does, but not before another stolen plot line from Resident Evil 2 has a nuke target Gunnison's way to eliminate the "infection". And not another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for more sequels, but not? In a movie filled with bad scenes, the worst may have been stored for the last moment. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the repetition, but everything has to be repeated: bad script, no plot, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired directing, heinous acting, decent f / x behavior wasted because of the many mistakes. <br /> <br /> I do not mind going to an indie movie and being disappointed. The actors, directors and crew are likely to start their careers on a low budget. For a movie with this budget and hype, I feel disappointed and cheated. This film is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to the credits. Sad to say a preview of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and HB2 did not even look that good.
