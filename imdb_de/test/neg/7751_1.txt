This film is a bizarre fantasy that certainly does not address over 10 years, but is too strange for children. The plot is stupid and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Twenty-five-year-old Kathy Ireland plays a teenage girl who behaves like a 9-year-old. She seems to have the voice of her character listening to Alvin and the chipmunks. Her high, shrill baby voice becomes annoying as soon as she starts talking. All the other plays are bad, but in fact Kathy Ireland is by far the worst. The plot is also terrible and is a mix of Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) receives a letter stating that her father, who left her long ago, fell down a bottomless pit in Africa and when she seeks him she falls into an underground world full of strange Australian accents. It's one of the craziest movies you've ever seen, with awful lines. <br /> <br /> The effects this movie uses for character development are annoying. Kathy Ireland is a nerd who does nothing or goes nowhere. She flies to Africa ... wow, what development! She drops her glasses and does not need them. Why is not it glasses for you to drop your glasses? It should represent their descent into blindness. It's just stupid. The only positive thing I can think of is that there are semi-good special effects and camera work, and the music sounds OK. <br /> <br /> All in all, a ridiculous family fantasy that will appeal only to those who expect nothing from one movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 84 min. PG for violence.
