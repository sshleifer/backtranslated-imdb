There is a point in the film where the boss of the "death machines" (a multiethnic trio that satisfies and is inclusive, I think it's called nowadays) talks about leveraging a businessman. Apart from that, their delivery is that it sounds like "leather event". At this point, this viewer became alert and thought this boring movie would turn a corner into a new world of confusion. But it did not do The boss lady had to talk, because the "death machines" during the entire movie did not say a word and talked. Endless. There's action in the movie, but it's not so exciting and the plot moves from one clich√© to another. The three dumb "Death Machines" live another day at the end of the movie. I hope there was no continuation.
