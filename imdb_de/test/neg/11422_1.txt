I can not believe this movie gets the rating that he's here on IMDb. Of course, I've come to the conclusion that IMDb is worthless to find out if a movie is good or not, since 99% of the films are between 6 and 7. This is the conclusion and failure of crowd sourcing on the Internet. For this purpose, an average of most people are taken, and unfortunately, most people are simply minded and entertain fast-paced idiots. But I digress. The film. I really do not want to waste my time writing about it. Let's just say that I thought it was tailor-made for what appeared to be two groups of people, young teens, the age when violent action movies of all kinds came to the point, and goth types who love to stifle gothic vampire fantasies Get her hands up. If you are not in one of these categories, you will find this movie absurd. I enjoyed the first underworld. It was fresh at that time and had a kind of edgy quality. The second was a bit in action, but I sometimes enjoyed the direction and the camera. But the whole movie felt like a science fiction channel production or even a television series. I found the actors overwhelmed. Her body language stiffened in unnatural idealistic poses, which seemed to be made. Lines were spewed out, as if young actors spit out Shakespeare lines, and they reveled in their own selfish splendor to be in such a role. However, the role was roughly flopped. The plot was dry and predictable from the start. I wish things would just go on, because it was so easy to say what would happen. At first I tried to be interested, but my brain had to switch off. In the end, I actually caught myself falling asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and made no sense that it was not worth listing them all. If you are a spotty teenager or a chronic goth, you have it. For the rest of us, forget it, as if I'm at it.
