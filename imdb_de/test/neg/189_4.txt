In 1904, Tanger, a wealthy American woman and her two children, are kidnapped by Berbers, murderous desert pirates who despise the Moroccan government, kidnapping the "American plague", which attracts the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt. The fictitious historical epic is less of a big adventure than a peculiar, somewhat exhausting, recourse to the 1940s-era desert movies (with a bit of "The King and I" by the way). Sean Connery and Candice Bergen, portraying the camouflaged, mustachioed, bloodthirsty leader and his saucy, haughty captive, could play in two completely different films (no one seems to know how far he carries the camp elements of his characters and dialogue, and both appear singly without proper direction). The various (and anonymous) beatings and beheadings that occur are arbitrary: we do not know any of these victims, and the big action scenes become indistinct, loud montages of violent violence on horseback. The plus points: a much acclaimed music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar nomination, but a loser of John Williams "Jaws"), fine location shoot and cinematography. * 1/2 of ****
