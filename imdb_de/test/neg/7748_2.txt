This film had a very intricate plot and a very fancy setting that I frankly could not follow, which, given the acting and dialogue, is just the result of writing a kindergarten. If you like Kathy Ireland, you might want to see that. The film was probably being used as a vehicle to bring her to Hollywood, but if that were his goal, I'd say that I hope she does not invest too much money in production.
