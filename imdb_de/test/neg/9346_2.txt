Oh man, this movie was bad for the toes. Bad look, terrible story ... the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie. Yeah, it sure is a comedy and everything tells me something about this movie should be the real deal. The movie certainly does not begin as a comedy, but rather as an adventurous movie with funny elements. It's safe to say that they meant it by acting, which was serious and not funny, except for some over-the-top sequences. It seemed to me that they first tried to make a real and serious adventurous sci-fi movie, maybe even a franchise, but soon realized how bad it all was, and just decided on another and intentionally exaggeratedly funny sequence Make the movie more like a comedy and prevent it from becoming a catastrophic mess. <br /> <br /> The film is a funny attempt to mix adventurous pirate-rich pirate movies with serious science-fiction action. The film was obviously inspired by the Star Wars films and their success. The film is not even ashamed to duplicate entire sequences, and even the way the story progresses shows sets, characters, and robot similarities. They tried to hide it by using obviously spoofing sequences, but I do not fall for it. So the film is not even independent, despite its original concept. It can be said that this film is a poor man's "spaceballs" without being even a parody. <br /> <br /> The movie looks bad, with some video game special effects (in some sequences even literally). terrible-looking costumes (tanks and swords in space?). The sound is sometimes even ridiculous. Apparently they recorded some sequences without sound and then forgot to add all the necessary sounds later in post production. Mixing is really bad too. They tried to hide this by temporarily reducing the sound to a minimum and recording the music of Bruce Broughton. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is so busy making the movie look so humorous that it feels totally funny to tell the story. This makes the story of the film extremely messy and poorly written, with an almost undeveloped main plot. It also does not help to really let the movie flow. Much is not explained and some fall out after some time. The movie begins as a "pirate" movie, constantly seeking and stealing water, as there is hardly a planet in the entire galaxy that still has water on it (yes, right!). However, this action is soon abandoned, especially in the middle part of the film, where the film seems to be completely different, with different motivations. It's just like one weird and bad, stupid sequence after another without really making a click. It also keeps the characters too shallow and uninteresting to take care of. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see that actors like John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and a young and unknown Ron Perlman were involved in this catastrophic movie /> OK, I admit that I am liked some moments, especially the end, when they went through the time warp, was original and funny, but really not all was enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie in a camping way. <br /> <br /> 2/10
