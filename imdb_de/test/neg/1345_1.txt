Imagine a movie that is the exact opposite of Lawrence of Arabia. Instead of a cast of men, he has a cast for women. Instead of being settled in the barren deserts of Arabia, it lies in the bustling metropolis of New York City. And instead of being one of the greatest movies ever made, it's one of the most meaningless, boring and memorable. The film is about Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), a perfect woman and mother, the envy of everyone else in her high society in Manhattan. She is painted like a woman who carries the weight of the world on her shoulders, although she needs a life in a nanny and housekeeper to cope with her only child. But I do not want to be too hard for her, Mary does all of this while she embarks on her dad's fashion design job. However, this idyllic lifestyle can not last forever and things start to collapse in a very real way. Mary's husband cheats on her and her father sends her because she has not worked hard enough. Of course, she is angry and breaks down a bit. <br /> <br /> But Mary has to recover to help her impressive little daughter and herself. She does this through rehab, straightening her hair and designing her own clothing line. but amazing for this kind of movie, not for a montage. Maria succeeds; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides that he loves her now. She decides to bring back her cheating husband after realizing that it was her fault he betrayed her because she had not treated him enough. All humans are evil ways.
