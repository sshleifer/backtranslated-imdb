The plot for Black Mama White Mama revolves around two female inmates in a women's prison in the Philippines. A black and a white. These two women are thrown together in jail. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is imprisoned in the hellish women's prison because he danced as a harem girl. <br /> <br /> Lee's friend owes her share of his profits to his drug deals. Above all, Lee is keen to break out of prison to get her boyfriend's drug money so she can leave the Philippines for a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman with a privileged background who is also a revolutionary. Karen joined a group of revolutionaries determined to change Phillipino's corrupt political system. She was captured by the Phillipino authorities and detained as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The story begins when Karen and Lee break out of the prison where they were together. The two were also chained together on the wrist. While fleeing, they also fight with each other because they pursue different goals. Of course, they do not hate when they are chained together. However, they also recognize that they need to set their differences aside in order to survive each other while avoiding admission. <br /> <br /> If this movie looks very similar to The Big Bird Cage, it's because of the majority of the cast in The Two Movies Are Alike, as well as their position in the Philippines. Roger Corman has always had a stable of actors that he used in all of his' 70s B movies. In addition to Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees and William Smith were among the many actors who were frequently featured in Corman's AIP films. <br /> <br /> Like The Big Bird Cage, Black Mama White Mama relies on too much bloody violence to be tasty. Pam Grier conveys her usual hard chick personality and shows her competence as a female action heroine. Margaret Markov is less effective in her portrayal of the revolutionary Karen. She just seems fragile and well-groomed to be a dedicated political guerilla. Apart from Sid Haig, the colorful Ruben, the rest of the cast is memorable. <br /> <br /> This movie has a low entertainment value, unless excessive, hideous acts of violence are your thing. Only the performances of Pam Grier and Sig Haig make this movie worth seeing.
