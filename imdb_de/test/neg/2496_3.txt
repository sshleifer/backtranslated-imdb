The United States built the atomic bomb to demonstrate its superior military might and end World War II. The film Fat Man and Little Boy shows the efforts of American physicists to invent the necessary technology to develop the bomb and the tension that existed between scientists and the military regarding the possible use of the bomb and even the acceptance of its creation. Scientists believed that the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would stop the war by wasting as little life as possible. For the first time, they saw themselves in a race with German scientists who wanted to build nuclear weapons themselves. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop working on the bomb project, knowing that the Japanese did not have the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon, and therefore no danger to human death. Those who supported the continuation of the Manhattan Project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, and asked the Japanese leader to see his deployment on a tiny deserted island. They felt that this massive use of force was enough to win the war without the need for murder. Under the direction of General Leslie Groves, the US military hoped to use the bomb as the actual weapon to be used against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against the Japanese. Due to the perseverance of Japanese soldiers in the small Japanese islands, the US decided to drop the bomb in the populous cities to end the war, first Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The demonstration of this tremendous violence also made the rest of the world realize that the US was the dominant military power, a message aimed particularly at Russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our prominent position in the world. Fat Man and Little Boy was a movie that had good intentions, but it did not look good with the choice of actors, script, and cinematography. One of the main themes of the film was the struggle between the military view of science on killing and the scientific view of science on knowledge. The keystone of this conflict is the persistent disagreement between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does his job in General's General, rugged, very angry, and radiates his dependence on the project's success. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never holds up against the general's demands and always looks weak, muted and phlegmatic in his audience. John Cusack presents a surprisingly disagreeable character in a flat role I've ever seen - it looks like he's just reading his lines. Laura Dern seems to be suffering from the same disease. None of the characters is supported by the script, which is almost childishly ridiculous in attempting to unscientifically explain scientific concepts that introduce the most unrealistic relationship between Mr. Cusack and Mrs. Dern that one can imagine. The thrill, like the army atom bombs on Japan Depends heavily on voice-over - a technique that is evil at all times, even if one explains the true innermost thoughts of a character or tells something that is not possible on the medium of film, but is used here to some to read absolutely trivial selections from Cusack's journal. The cameraman offers us several shots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs, which could be striking if it does not look like cardboard cutouts instead of bombs. The fake atomic fire looks spurious - and why should it be used when supplies last? The footage is so stunning and realistic - and the pervasive brown tone does not seem to be thematically appropriate. Apart from that, it's not a bad movie.
