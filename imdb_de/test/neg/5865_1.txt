We sat through this movie and wondered why this or that scene is in the movie. What does this have to do with the plot? We hoped that in the end everything would become clearer. It should not be. <br /> <br /> I think the director blew up the script, and a smaller (and vindictive) housemate accidentally put it back together, regardless of the scene being filmed (possibly with scissors and glue stick). <br /> <br /> The motives of the film include: Communism bad? Nihilism bad? Bad parenting bad? Threesome bad? TV bad? Coherent scripting bad? Deconstructionism good? It's really not clear. <br /> <br /> After all, no German water taxi would NEVER have an unkempt staircase that would allow passengers to fall into the water. The abundant number of "attention" signs testify to this fact.
