Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br /> <br /> Performers: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Stephanie Beacham. <br /> Review: Sometimes movies can be time capsules that you bring back at any time. In this case ... our time capsule is Hammers Dracula AD 1972, which takes us back to a time when Austin Powers would have felt right at home. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of children (they were not a gang! was a group!) who like to be in a coffee shop called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm, weird last name ... wait ... it writes Dracula backwards!), A new member of the group's group is offering a new way to get their kicks. He offers them a night of black mass and black magic. To which they also say "sure why the hell not, it could be fun!". In no time they will revive Count Dracula from the ashes. <br /> <br /> This movie opens with a peppy party in some rich dachshunds at home. He does not know any of the people at his party, but everyone celebrates the night in his house there. Doing drugs, dancing and dancing. The filmmakers made sure that this sequence was fully integrated into what the young people thought was cool at the time. Everyone says words like "out-out" and "groovy" and they end many of their sentences with "all the jazz". Yes, it is quite obvious that these are the 70s. To top it off, there is a band that sounds like something like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I mean, you're drowned in all '70s. And while I saw this, I kept asking myself, "how the hell is Dracula with his black cloak and getting up to fit in all this?" And that's exactly what happens. Old Dracula feels inappropriate under all the parties, rock'n'roll and drugs. Many of the scenes in the movie are great, but unfortunately, the music they chose to add to the process does not fit at all and gets you completely out of the mood. Something terrible or scary will happen on the screen and suddenly a couple of loud trumpets and congos will beat and you will be whipped out of the horror element. That sucked the atmosphere out of this movie for me. <br /> <br /> But all in all, putting away the distracting '70s music (a disease the Dracula satanic rites have suffered as well), the movie was pretty good. But I will mention that. The story was just a review of what we had previously seen in Taste the Blood of Dracula. In fact, the story is almost identical. Let's see ... a young lad inherits Dracula's ring and ashes ... check. Then he decides to bring Dracula back to life with the help of a few people who know nothing about what they are getting into. Black Mass to bring Dracula back to a desecrated church ... check. The list of similarities goes on and on. Therefore, this movie is not very original if you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are some things that are worth while watching this movie. For example, the fact that the movie was a time capsule to London in the early 1970s makes the movie entertaining. I chuckled and laughed every time someone spoke 70 jargon. I could not believe that some of the clothes that these people wore and the cars they drove! It made the movie fun for us, but we're here to be spooked, were here to see Drac killing some virgins and taking revenge on Van Helsing's house. Did we get something like that? Good yes. There are some good sequences that satisfy old Hammer fans. First of all, there is the Black Mass sequence, which was especially satanic! They call the name of many demons and a lot of blood is shed. This sequence was great, but was disturbed by the music in its most important moment. Then there is the actual revival of Draculas Ill has confessed was great from the visual point of view. Some mist comes from Dracula's grave and slowly, but surely, Christopher Lee's silhouette and face emerge from the fog. Good shot! I loved it! We have a Cushing and Lee in the end. And I could not help but laugh as Dracula tossed a piece of furniture through the air. I laugh because he's been doing that since horror of Dracula in every single movie. In this Hammer tradition, the characters throw each other candle sticks and chairs. And I do not think I'm showing their more exciting things than when a bad guy throws our hero with a candle stick. Well, anyway, Dracula's death in this case is very similar to any other Hammer Dracula's, vampire is deleted, and we cut off a series of frames until all that's left is ashes. <br /> <br /> All in All an unusually funny Hammer Dracula movie. It's trapped in the 70s, and though it's a fun clock (and not as horrible as Satanic Rites of Dracula), it still does not work well with the Dracula universe we'd expected from Hammer. <br /> <br /> Rating 3 1/2 out of 5
