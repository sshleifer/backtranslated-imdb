In short, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is a weapons factory where secret weapons are developed. Because they do bad things, they are not popular, so to speak. A new female manager is added to clarify things and make sure the company's reputation is improved. It does so by passing confidential company information to the press ... Do you believe that? She also starts firing people she has never seen before. Incredible? A pacifist group is trying to destroy the company's mainframe because that's where the blueprint of those secret weapons lay. This mainframe is located in the lower part of the building, hidden in a kind of vault. Of course, the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot that is the ultimate killer machine that resembles an alien alien movie. The crazy scientist likes the female manager. <br /> <br /> The crazy scientist tells the robot to kill everyone, protecting his job, stepping up the chain, and making the movie interesting. The pacifists team up with the CEO and another person on the Board of Directors to escape the robot. Below, they agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe while avoiding the robot. They also discover that the factory has developed a part man, submachine soldier. You can erase a person's memories and replace them with the memory of an experienced soldier. One of the pacifists transforms into such a soldier and will hunt down the killer robot. I think the crazy scientist also wrote the script of this movie. This super soldier looks similar and looks like Robocop, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> It boils down to that. People are running, being chased by a killer robot and being hurt by it, but that does not seem to bother them, besides limping a bit. Of course, the female boss is the main character of this film and can not be killed. ie survive any attack, explosion, you name it. I will not disturb you in the persecution, let's go to the end. They have many weapons, even the pacifist, and they know how to use them. When they are on the roof of the building, they empty all weapons on the killer robot. You enter a lift, with the outside window cleaned. And then the boss knows the magic, on the roof she complained that she no longer has bullets, and how the magic is reloaded the weapon. In this way, she can shoot down the cables, let the elevator fall by about 70 floors and stand by pulling on the brake directly above the ground surface. And as a coronation, the police are waiting for them. The robot jumps behind and kills the bulls. Hilarious no? The robot chases them into the vault room where the mainframe is located, and when the robot is finally so close to it that he can touch / kill them, it stops. Because the crazy scientist did not want her killed. A better name for this guy would be the idiot scientist. Although it was he who made this movie worth seeing. At that moment, I already moved to the killer robot to finish them all, so the movie would end. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie is rated that high and that's why I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like the plague. It's a monster and I'm not talking about the death machine.
