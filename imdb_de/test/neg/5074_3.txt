As? I wondered why I did not see it in the cinemas or just a commercial for it. When I saw the movie, I realized that I had outsmarted HARDCORE. I'm a big transporter fan and a big blade fan. When I saw that, I imagined a killer fight scene between two tails, a lot of shooting, a lot of stuff. Instead, I got the Ryan Phillippe movie with a short cameo by Statham and Snipes. The guy who makes audio and video in the crime lab has more screen time than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie that was expecting a lot of Kung Fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad movies from Hollywood, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the fanbase better.
