There's no doubt that this movie is stupid and funny, but tell the truth, it's quite entertaining (if you're a first time viewer and trying to analyze nothing). <br /> <br /> The story of the two losers who wake up and find out they can not remember what happened to them the day before. Only to find out later that they are being sought by the angry twin girlfriends, aliens, transsexual strippers, alien nerds and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Is not it like the Bourne identity? Yes, yes, I know - how can I compare the two films, but what the hell? They both have no memories; People were after them and so on. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is stupid and is intended only for the viewer who likes stupid film. <br /> <br /> Reason to watch: · Many young talented actors, · Very stupid (after all, you know it's a stupid movie, why not extreme)? <br /> <br /> Reason not to: · If you like to be analyzed then forget it. · Talented young actors become bad · Good momentum gets really bad <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Rating: E ​​+) <br /> <br /> -------- ---- ------------ ---------- ---------- ------ --- ----- ---- ---- <br /> <br /> 'Dude Where's My Car' - Wait, what did you expect from Ashton Kutcher's movie? I think that almost everyone got the same answer for this guy - "A really stupid movie". Apart from 'That 70s' shows, this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (He should thank the show for his call). "Dude Where's My Car" is one of his trademarks - "stupidity". Somehow his film is even worse than Adam Sandler's films (can you imagine that). The movie is really pointless, no action and nothing. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W.Scoot should not have squandered their talent for this garbage. They even came up with "seriously dude, where's my car". This shows how film companies are dying to earn money and not quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: Borrow it from your friends or just forget it
