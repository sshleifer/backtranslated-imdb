I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, this is by far the worst movie I've seen in ten years and I see my share of films. A stinker. This is a bad idea for a movie that performs poorly. Nothing is funny, believable or interesting. I was looking for wit, irony and sincere humor. Instead, it looked like most members of the group were walking to the set to do Tea Leoni a favor. It's too bad that such acting talent was wasted by such emptiness. Do not bother. I have to wonder what opinion the creators of this film have on their audience, exposing them to the idea that Polish gangsters in Buffalo, NY, have sent a contract killer to San Francisco to become a totem assistant at AA meetings. Bill Pullman should start reading scripts before he agrees to be in a movie. Sad.
