Not even Emeril Lagasse-Cooking can save that disjointed, exaggerated idiotic nonsense that shows Emeril Lagasse as TV chef of the Food Channel, who with the help of the crew is trying to make the show better, bad plot and stupid script throw this show down Robert Urich wasted the poorly supporting role and unfortunately this was his last (RIP). <br /> <br /> This is the worst show of the year 2001 and will be on the list of the worst shows of this series <br /> <br /> I am very sorry for Emeril Lagasse for making this sitcom He even said that it stinks. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that they are the same producers of design women that did this mess. <br /> <br /> TV Review: 1 star
