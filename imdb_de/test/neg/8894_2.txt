Any fan of Russian cinema will have a hard time believing in the side-effects of Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and may be stunned by Boddy's seniors and confusing scripts coupled with an unusually weak direction. Most characters wander through the movie as if they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. It's also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not reached an iota since "FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH" and her screenplay is mercifully limited. This is a terrible mafia movie; So much so that the GODFATHER III looks like a winner of the genre. To see the most important Russians at their best, watch the work of Bodrov Sr. on PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS (which also includes Jr.), Mashkov's throw in VOR (THE THIEF) and Bodrov Jr.'s new criminal in BRAT.
