Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, was seriously injured in a traffic accident. End of the story. <br /> <br /> "End of the story", ie in the sense of "End of every physical act". Not in the sense of "end of the film". Ken's life is saved, but he is paralyzed from the neck down. When he discovers that he's unlikely to ever use his limbs again, he decides he wants to die and asks the doctors to stop the medical treatment that keeps him alive. The rest of the film is essentially a long debate about the rights and abuses of euthanasia and the right to die. Ken's main antagonist in this debate is his physician Michael Emerson. Although the case against euthanasia is often religiously recited, it is portrayed as purely secular. If Dr. Emerson has deep religious beliefs, these are never expressed in the film. He passionately believes that death is an enemy against whom it is his duty as a physician to fight; To effectively allow a patient to kill himself would be a surrender to this enemy and a task of that duty. Ken is therefore in a "catch-22" situation. He has to be able to show that he is sensible and reasonable enough to make the decision to end his life. However, Emerson believes that the desire to die in itself is evidence of insanity and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be solved by appointing a lawyer to sue the hospital. Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr. Emerson sent their respective points of view and expounded with sincerity, but that can not hide the fact that "who's life is it anyway?" just does not work as a movie. All of a sudden, filmed versions of stage plays were made in a similar way as in theatrical productions, but in the 1970s and 1980s, this was often considered unsatisfactory due to the differences between the two media. When dramas were filmed, the general tendency was to "open" them by filing on-site as well as on studio sets, taking liberties with the playwright's lyrics, often making significant changes to the plot, and even introducing additional characters. <I have never seen Brian Clarke's acting, but I suspect that this is a story that works better in the theater than in the movies. There are very few physical actions; Most are lengthy discussions about a hospital bed in which the main character is paralyzed. Such a plot is not at all suitable for the "opening" device, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by conversations at the expense of the action. Although it is well written and there are some good acting, I am surprised that there has ever been a film about such a disjointed topic. 4.10
