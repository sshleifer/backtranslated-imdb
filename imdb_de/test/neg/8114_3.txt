I'm sorry, but for a movie that's been coined as a half-classic and horror movie, but seriously, if the director makes me unintentionally laugh, that's not a good thing. The characters in this movie were just exaggerated and unbelievable. I just could not stop laughing at Issac's voice, it was like a British voice of a crying girl. Not to mention Malicai's dramatic arrest. <br/> <br /> Children of the Corn is a city where all the children have killed the adults and worship a god who commands them to sacrifice all over 20's. If a couple has a serious car accident, they come to the city for help. Of course, they fall into the trap of the child and are sacrificed! But Malicai has other intentions when he is fed up with following Issac's orders. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn could have been something great, but it became a bad movie to make fun of. As much as I love Stephen King, I'm sure that was not what he intended, and it was a pretty lame story, or at least the actors destroyed it. As I said, for a good laugh, look at it, but I'm warning you, it's pretty pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
