Such a BS movie. It's just stupid anti-Russian propaganda with a complete BS conspiracy that is in no way related to the book. <br /> <br /> It looks like the production team has received more money from the people who ordered the film than can ever be achieved by selling the film. The plot of the film contains references to some of the recent events in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, but places them in a way that has nothing to do with reality. It seems that the film is a brainwave instrument that helps portray Russia as a place populated by evil people who always dream of killing someone. <br /> <br /> Of course there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the map of the USSR instead of Russia when news is running, a crowd is shown with Ukrainian flags and it is commented that they are Russian elections <br / > There are also many bizarre episodes (ie a character walks through Red Square in Moscow and in a second in downtown Sophia, Bulgaria).
