Silly, meaningless film should appeal to Southern Rednecks, teens with IQ-bound retards, and the average Bush fan. Noble Willingham stars in this simple script and uses a generous dose of MFer, this and Eff and SOBs. The end that I expected to "save" this hollow story was the biggest disappointment, and I stopped and asked myself, "Why?". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you hear the phone ringing every 2 minutes and escaping and screaming in this 123-minute piece of dumpster.
