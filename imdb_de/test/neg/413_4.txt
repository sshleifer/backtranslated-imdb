Recension: Angels & Demons <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Ron Howard. He has also made famous films like The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He also directed the famous TV series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (The Da Vinci Code, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, ??) and Ewan McGregor (Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,? ?). <br /> <br /> At first I was shocked because they made the beginning of the movie so big. Because they have changed the father of Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) in another person, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was nice that they were able to film on location at CERN. <br /> <br /> Then the movie continues: They are spectacular car races in Rome. I also like the role in Chirstian Archives very much, if they destroy the work of Galileo, it was funny. It was also funny that the second time they were locked up in the archives. Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they broke out, the power rose. <br /> <br /> I thought it was very stupid that Robert Langdon did not go in the helicopter, but that the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) came in alone. Another detail is that the Camerlengo in the film is an adopted son of the Pope. In the book "He is the true son of the Pope". If I was to perform the best acting performance, I should say Pierfrancesco Favino playing Inspector Olivetti. The worst spectacle was the assassin played by Nikolai Lie Kaas, I think he was below average because he played in Adam's Apples Faboulous. I think the overall movie is below average because director Ron Howard has filmed some stupid changes. I would rate the movie with 4/10.
