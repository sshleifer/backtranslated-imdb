It did not feel like a movie and was gratefully short (under 90 minutes), it felt more like a commercial business of computer graphics options: most of the special effects are great to be sure. But that certainly does not make a great or even good movie. I'm not saying it's absolutely worthless to look at, as you can see what possibilities there are in CGI or GCI, or whatever it is called. <br /> <br /> If I read somewhere, you can not correct that on the average room, "a bad story and indefinite actor, can not be fixed in the cutting room or even with the greatest special effects! Things can be improved in the cutting room, if they have a real director and material to work from. <br /> <br /> But you thought that this could be sold in the US is an idea, since the US is the crook. <br / > <br /> And is not it so typical of stories on a low budget? You have to create an imaginative country south of Mexico. <br /> <br /> Well, I have it 2! Only because of the special effects is the rest absolute Rubbish!
