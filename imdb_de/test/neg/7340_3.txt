I lived in Barstow Ca. 1968, when the movie The Killers Three arrived at the local theater. The trailer was enough to make me pay my hard earned money to watch this movie. I was really expecting a Bonnie And Clyde movie and I got Dick Clark, a shy Nerdy, while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi made a bad attempt to re-release Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say, it never went well. Maybe that's why it never came to the video. Already as a child I had something left when I left the theater. After all the best parts, where in the trailer of the film. The movie was boring and pretty pointless. By the way Dick Clark is killed, so it was not a total disappointment.
