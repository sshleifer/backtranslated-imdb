This movie was released shortly after the Conan movies, a sort of female Conan, Red Sonja, played by Sylvester Stallone's ex-wife Brigitte Nielsen. Unfortunately, she is not a very good actress, as evidenced in Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole movie feels cheap, but strangely, Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this movie, but not as Conan, though he looks, acts and fights like Conan from the two Conan movies. Anyway, it only appears about every twenty minutes and does not hang around for long. Maybe Arnold filmed that in his spare time when he filmed Conan the Destroyer or something? Anyway, the movie is too slow and boring for an action movie, skip that and watch Conan, the barbarian instead.
