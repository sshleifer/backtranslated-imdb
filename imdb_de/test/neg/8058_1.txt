This movie was unbelievably bad ... It's bloody, but the violence is just too much, making it extremely spurious and predictable. Since everything is shown to you, the imagination is left nothing. And the plot ... what action? There is really no one! The tempo is incredibly slow (despite the random acts of violence) and the script must have been written by a confused 12-year-old kid killing kittens for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I could see why ... not because of the blood (boring and banal), but because it was a horrible movie. It should have been banished from existence. Avoid this like the plague. 1 out of 10
