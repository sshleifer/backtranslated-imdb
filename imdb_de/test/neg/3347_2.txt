I have to take over the role of the turd in the punch bowl again, as Lowell Weicker used to say, scratching at the sheer number of laughable comments. "The African Queen" is not that. The taste of the period is wonderful, yes. Acting is okay, but no actor, no matter how great, can bring the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversations to life here, and I do not care how much of that comes from Joyce's lyrics. Imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall during a Christmas meal of a not very interesting group of people (I do not realize it's a family, as a person suggested), as if they were listening to their mundane table talk and you have the essential experiences of this movie. It happens absolutely nothing. And nothing important is said, but it is said to infinite length. As I said, the popularity of this film is a mystery to me. Speaking of secrets, you'd rather see a good one than this.
