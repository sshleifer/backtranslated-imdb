The first 10 minutes of the movie make fun of sequels and pg-13 films. These are the two reasons why the movie is so bad. You're constantly referring to a movie called "Get Leo," which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time you do that, you'll be really angry. Travolta is not very cool, as is Keitel. The Rock and Vince Vaughn, however, are funny. They are not as funny as you would expect in an Elmore Leonard movie. If you have not seen Shorty, you will probably be cool. If you would like to make short films, leave the theater to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.
