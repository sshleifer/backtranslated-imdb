The name of this movie and the clips I saw made me believe that this movie would have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The desert sand was interesting, but this movie was moving at a snail's pace. It started well with an underground cave and something that came out, but then tried to connect us to the lives of some very unlikely people. When they found bodies, or should I say skeletons with some flesh on them, they started searching for the reason. Sometimes things got a little different when something followed them in the desert. A kind of black mud or something that begins to eat the flesh of humans. When the meat was eaten, a bag of bones began to crawl after the remaining humans. The reason for this black mud was pretty bad, ants? Incredible! Then the end made no sense. I think the motto of this movie will be, if you have an itch and see an ant, kill them quickly before the ant friends smell their flesh.
