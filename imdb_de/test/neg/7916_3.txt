I am glad that I did not expect too much when I saw this sequel to one of my favorite children's movies. The plot was boring and unconvincing, as were the characters. I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I also did not think that the characters themselves are similar to the previous movie. Charlie had changed and now he has a girlfriend. The first movie had some good music, but the music in this movie was unimaginable. In short, this movie just did not do it for me. If you look at the feedback from other users, it does not seem to be the case for many of you. It is not worth looking at.
