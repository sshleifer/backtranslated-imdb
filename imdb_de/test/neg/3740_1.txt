I honestly do not understand why people love this show so much. A friend of mine looks at it and since I like sci-fi, I tried to get involved because the plot of the show sounded promising, but in fact it's a really boring show. The only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the CGI effects with video games and the complete overuse of Muppets. I call it Muppets because they really look like Muppets, not like the aliens they should be. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which; The muppets and make-up effects are overused in this show. You have this guy who could best be described as an alien / dwarf hybrids, you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vampire, you have a floating potty-mouth-frog-alien ... it just feels so much unnecessary, and even to the point of being distracted from the entire plot by a lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Every episode is too special. The creators of this show have managed that so that each episode feels almost like another show. At least to the point where you see the main characters / Muppets again. The whole plot about the main character's return to Earth is pushed too far into the background at points. Acting is also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you are looking for good sci-fi equipment, just look elsewhere. In my opinion, this is not even a real science fiction, as the show is more oriented towards fantasy elements and all puppet shows and strange dreams are going on. And if you only want to see Muppets, then I suggest you watch the Muppet Show and be glad that the horror of a show comes to an end. <br /> <br /> By the way; Does anyone have Dejavus with the concept of a living spaceship? Oh, that's right. Doctor Who started this concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of sci-fi scraps. Screenplays and events that were given up for good reason only to be picked up by this horrible show.
