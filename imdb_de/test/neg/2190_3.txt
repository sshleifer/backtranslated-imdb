Los Angeles-based physician Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) survives a tragic car accident, but ends up in jail in California's high desert. When his time is up, he lands in a small, windswept town called Purgatory Flats. His first stop is a bar, where he quickly pops a beer and is hired as a bartender. So much for the ex-cons who find it hard to find work. This is the first time in a long line of absurdities that make up the plot of scriptwriter and director Harris Done's fool to create a modern movie Noir in the desert. <br /> <br /> His first night on the job, Tom meets sexy femme fatally named Sunny (Alexandra Holden) hanging out with a family of vicious boys: the Mecklins, consisting of Uncle Dean (Gregg Henry) and his two Nephew, the drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband, and AWOL soldier Randy (Brian Austin Greer of "90210"). After his shift is over, he is shot and dr. Tom happens to be around. He agrees to treat one of the wounded and above all not to tell the cops. I am not sure that this is a good step for a guy coming out of the pen, but this script (co-written by Diane Fine) has very little to do with logic. <br /> <br /> Tom makes a number of bad decisions that involve him more and more with the criminally motivated Mecklin Boys, including stealing medical supplies and hopping with Sunny in the bag. Everyone in the theater yells, "Do not do it, go away," but Tom does it anyway. <br /> <br /> In a classic film noir, such as "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity," we have become rooted and empathize with William Hurt and Fred McMurray as they enter the web of bright, sexy, insidious femme Fatals like Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwyck are sucked in. It is not your fault. We would probably have been tempted by all the money or this special lady. But Dr. Tom's weakness seems more due to stupidity than circumstance. Sunny is sexy, but not very captivating, and there is no money to seduce him. You wonder if he attended the same medical faculty as Dr. Nick Riveria from "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> The stupid script would make you believe that the rural house of a redneck has almost everything you need to treat a shot in the stomach, and the one who is so wounded could easily attract attention and effectively participate in a fistfight. It gives us an implausible chase with one of those "The Club" things attached to the steering wheel. Oh, that oil tanker that's just exploded - no one noticed. <br /> <br /> I wonder how such a ridiculous script ever went green? Maybe Brian Austin Greer has more juice than I credit him. It is obvious that he took over Randy's relatively minor role - a hotheaded murder - to show the producer that he had a greater range than "90210". <br /> <br /> It's also a bit sad to see Nicholas Turturro playing a stereotypical Hispanic drug dealer. He deserves better than that. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ over 50, "Purgatory Flats" will make you shake your head in disbelief. I give him 3 stars for the unintentional laugh and the scenes in which the sexy Miss Holden runs around in her red panties.
