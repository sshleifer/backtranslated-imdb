This movie was so awful, so boring, so badly misunderstood - it took a lot of work to turn what should have been a safe thing into such a travesty. I love Lucille Ball, but she absolutely stunk in this movie. Too old, could not sing, sounded like a truck hurling gravel, even if NOT sung - and the biggest sin of all - YOU WAS NOT FUNNY. JUST A BIT. The studio shot himself in the foot with this, and to ruin a fabulous stage version of a fabulous stage musical, some other body parts deserve to have been wounded as well. That could explain it. But for Lucy to think that she was right for a part that demanded Singing - well, that's the saddest thing of all. It is very good to know your limits. Even a legend can not come from such a stinker and still smells like a rose.
