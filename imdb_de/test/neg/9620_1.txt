I saw this movie when it premiered in LA. I think I laughed twice or three times. The rest of the time I was shocked at how ridiculous / bad shot and bad writing. Kirby is indeed the only salvation in the movie. I was disappointed with the performance of Larry Bagby, whom I usually find entertaining. If you like watching your friend's crappy self-made short films shot with their mother's 8mm video camera, there's little chance you'll enjoy this movie. Part of what makes these movies enjoyable is that your friends play all the parts. You do not know these people, so you probably find them just as boring and stupid as me. Dear Mr. Nelson, go back to film school and work for a while as an intern or as an intern or as a low job. Then search as long as you need to find a cameraman who knows what f. Stop means he has an ND filter at hand. Then try again. Repeat the process as often as necessary.
