First of all, the nature in the film is beautiful and there is some Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked Mongolian and the camels, but that was all Mongolian in it. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongolian actress, albeit a lame idea. But she is pretty, which a little bit replaces the lack of performance. <br /> <br /> But I absolutely did not understand what this painful piece of 1.30 hours of imagination is all about, created by Mr. Bodrov. The plot was completely lacking in cohesion. There was no logic for the development of the conspiracy. In fact, there was hardly a story, just a series of loosely tied scenes with a group of men in "Mongolian" clothing who uttered a bit of pidgin that sounded like Mongolian. Most of the actors were either Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most of the scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan or Russia and there was a lot of disturbing pathos about what it means to be a "Mongolian". The dialogue is primitive and the scenes with dialogue are slow. The fight scenes are ridiculous. The supernatural pathos is anything but lame and is obviously just there to compensate for the lack of history. The Japanese actor was like a wooden puppet, and if you look at him, you would have no idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. He looked sleepy, soft, stiff, and miserable for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> And I do not even want to start with the historical relevance of this film waste. To see Chinggis-Khan half of the movie as a slave, to see his first two children born to other men to see his wife sell to the Tangut dealer ... my blood begins to boil , And where is the beautiful story about the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? You could make a great movie out of it. Where is the story of the rise of Temujin? From his childhood, from his relationship with his family, to his brothers, how he had to fight under mighty enemies of his family? Where is Van Khan who helped him a lot? Where is the depiction of life in the steppe, the life of the nomads, their traditions, their relationships with the other peoples around them? <br /> <br /> Where is the evolution of the characters? We absolutely do not know what Temujin has brought with Jamukha and what distinguishes them, and most importantly, how Temujin became Chinggis-Khan, how he, an outcast without wealth and military power, united the Mongol tribes and such an organized and created one an effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the greatest empire of history. All of this could lead to some interesting and dramatic stories with intricate plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we did not see any of that in Bodrov's creation, not even a look.
