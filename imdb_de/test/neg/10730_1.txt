There is no "fun" when it comes to the desperate situation of illegal immigrants. Or the desperate situation of head-shop owners! That the goddess Brian Glazer did not see the irony that the "heroes" do exactly what the villain does - honest, hard-working people rob their savings - does not surprise me! Hell, how could he be richer than God? In this alleged satire about greed, these mental dwarves reveal their hypocrisy: the McMansions, the McToys, the McChildren, the McIllegals, who are paid peanuts to take care of the McMansions, the McToys, and the McChildren! But the main problem (aside from the heinous bigotry) is the premise: as a former manager of a now-disreputable company, Dick would be the big scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! No soup kitchens for him! With high six-digit numbers, you'd think he would not get caught on a Gore / Lieberman poster!
