Can be spoiler, so do not read if you do not want to. Just like the television news. Everything has already happened, a big tsunami sticking out over a city bay and CUT, no longer seeing, Tokay is suffering a big earthquake, has anyone seen more than the 5 seconds I've seen? If you want to make a love story or make a love story, but if you want to use a disaster movie title, please be kind enough to show me THE DISASTER, pd after watching this movie, and check out JISHIN RETTO or Another GODZILLA movie Part One, ready to see people scream and collapse buildings that did not stand a chance in this film. Do not take me wrong. I love disaster movies and I love the original Nihon-Chimbotsu and Jishin-Retto. I even like the latest Poseidon, not too much of a story, but a very good and graphic disaster sequence. New Nihon Chimbotsu often loses the point as Pearl Harbor or the day after tomorrow, but at least these two movies show good disaster sequences, and even enough with the expensive FX that have not shown anything, give me fake buildings if you want, as long as you destroy them properly I know, I have to sound like a sadistic freak, although I actually saw Love when I felt like watching a romantic movie, Grrrrrrrr, even Kimpachi Sensei makes me cry and this movie did not work out. There is also a television series called Nap-Chimbotsu from 1975, which I have on DVD and it is much better
