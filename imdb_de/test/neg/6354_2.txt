You need to. I list them so you can check them off one by one: <br /> <br /> - The police regularly run tens of millions of dollars in money and drugs just because they have no evidence of facilities. <br /> <br /> - When you're shot, you always grunt the same way and fly back in the same way, even if there's no trace on your body. <br /> <br /> - Police are unable to detect the sound of rifle shots and do not believe that anything is suspicious when the phone call of a covert policewoman during a high-level drug and money deal from that gunshot is cut off. <br /> - Bad guys can beat with a dash of mannequins, but not at 100 a big, bulky martial artist. <br /> <br /> - When you rock a car in a parking lot, the next three cars in a row are blown up evenly at 15-second intervals. <br /> <br /> - Until the last point, all cheap cars are always parked next to each other. <br /> <br /> - The smoke caused by the firing of the rocket launcher is much larger and the amount of smoke blown up by four cars. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are a long, long way ahead of any other gaming company can fit on five floppy disks. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are far ahead of any other gaming company and have graphics that look like Windows 3.1 screensavers. <br /> <br /> - Floppies can even be read after being shot. <br /> <br /> - Half-drunk people in bars attentively watch the news when they are in the pub, and have a deep understanding of American modern military history, Agent Orange, and the family trees of senior military personnel. However, they can only articulate their points through a dialogue that sounds silly to anyone over the age of seven. <br /> <br /> - Even though fighting in a bar seems to break out almost every hour, this bar has just one employee, who both pours the beer and provides security. Of course he knows the martial arts. <br /> <br /> - Gold medalists regularly make the easy transition to CEOs of software companies in just a few years. <br /> <br /> - A woman who works for A computer game company knows all about how to beat a game she has never played before, she constantly raves about her competitors' great games and can pass on facts and figures Her company's competitors rattle - but she did not know that almost all other companies outdated in the field in large business combinations. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys always die in slow motion. Always. <br /> <br /> - Wives tell husbands that they are pregnant by raving about the man's encouragement to kill bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Wives make large amounts of their husband's policing work; that could explain why she whines and complains every time he has to go to work. It does not explain why she so much reveres him each time he gets up in the morning, and she can read about his murderous escapades. <br /> <br /> - It's pretty typical of a police officer he's involved in hijacking, killing tons of people on three separate occasions and stopping a multitude of multi-million dollar illegal deals in a week , <br /> <br /> - If you're trying to lose a car that follows you, it's wise to continue on the speed limit. And if you follow a policeman, subtlety is not important - you can leave him miles behind and then park right next to him. He will not notice. <br /> <br /> - All the police are experienced martial artists. <br /> <br /> - It is possible to kick a man from four meters away. <br /> <br /> - People scream or grunt in pain when beaten or kicked, but when they break their arm, they do not make a sound. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys clean their bloody axes with their handkerchiefs. and then leave them in your pocket for many days. <br /> <br /> - Pieces of wood, when swung with a sharp blow, shatter sturdy ladders at six or more points at a time. <br /> <br /> - The photo and the special features listed on the back of the DVD sleeve may not necessarily be on the DVD. The advertised interactive menus? Why no menu at all! The advertised scene index? Why do not you have the whole thing as a scene / chapter and you do not need an index? Likewise, it's fine to use The Matrix's font and title in the tag line and not be a rip-off in any way. <br /> <br /> I am shocked that 12 will come out of line The 15 best actors have never acted again.
