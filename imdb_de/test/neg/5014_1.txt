This movie was such a waste of my money. it was disgusting and disturbing. Honestly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Who thinks about a movie in which a girl blows her dog? Seriously ... it was a waste of my time. I kept watching the movie, hoping it would get better and a conspiracy crop up, but that never happened. I would rate the movie as F-. This film should have been rated R because of its disturbing nature. I would never let kids of all ages see this movie. This movie is shit. This movie is awful. This movie was a waste of my time. I could have spent the night doing something instead of renting this movie. This movie was a waste of gas money to get to the store, and definitely a waste of two dollars to look at it. actually nobody should see this movie. This movie should be banned and burned.
