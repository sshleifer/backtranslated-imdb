From the first shot of the film - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, wandering through a field at dawn, calling out all the clich√©s that cinema has developed to deal with the phenomenon of the strongly-minded, rebellious female character in the time drama Joe Wright not only seemed to have read the book, but also to be under the lamentable misunderstanding that what he was shooting was not indeed a subtle, nuanced comedy by Jane Austen was manners of sparkling, tender social interaction in English salon rooms of the 18th century, but a kind of U certificate for Wuthering Heights. So we were treated with every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy for no apparent reason, in inappropriately harsh scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen and especially P & P are not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies to negotiate the sullenness of eighteenth-century society. This was completely ignored, so the Bennets' house was a wild, chaotic place where everyone screamed, walked around at the same time, left their underwear on chairs and pigs wandered happily through the house; The social balls turn into mangy country dances, a step away from a Matrix Reloaded Dance Orgy. and everyone says exactly what he thinks, without the slightest regard for decency. <br /> <br /> The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void that creates a society in which no one, by an overwhelming consideration, says what he thinks or means for the decency and tragic relationships of their characters Misunderstandings and misunderstandings made possible by this speechless gap. Both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the factor that enables her plotters - especially in this film - has been completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere to be found in his film, sacrificed in favor of an overwhelmed drama that was completely messing with the material and the performances. <br /> <br /> It was so obvious trying to be a * serious * movie. The humor - IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost completely suppressed in favor of this full-bottomed melodrama, and when it was admitted, it was treated so awkwardly. Pride and prejudice are a serious story that produces serious points, yes, but these serious issues and more weighty issues are not only intertwined with the humor, they are embedded in it. You can not lose Jane Austen's technique, just leave the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to be preserved. Not even if you replace their techniques with your own mysterious-false fauxbrow cinematographs. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett is said to be a woman, an adult, mature, rational and clear-sighted woman. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like a blank, giggling schoolgirl and the second half as an empty schoolgirl she considers a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her fierce verbal exchange, her quintessence, the follies of all to see and laugh, including her own, her strength and her serenity, and her fantastic clarity was completely lost and replaced with ... what? Lots to giggle and look into the distance? Instead of being able to keep her head when everything around her lost her, she began to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not really raging either; No, those were cool fits. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to maintain integrity and observation while she was within the confines of society and maintained unquestionable decency, Knightley's Elizabeth had no regard for conventions. In addition, she seemed to believe that barefoot running in the mud in the eighteenth-century coverall version certainly proved her to be spirited and powerful, and therefore had nothing to wear in the character as she was written or in the performance. A surprisingly unobtrusive and mild performance. In pursuit of languor and weakness, she was brought together by Matthew Macfayden. Donald Sutherland, when Mr. Bennet seemed weak, ineffective and permanent without the evil sense of humor and ironic distancing at the expense of man, seemed to make relationships that make Mr. Bennet so intriguing and tragic. His special attachment to Lizzie, as the only two rational people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both were fools in a world of fools and the end of the movie was completely deprived of emotional impact. Mr. Bingley was no longer amiable and benevolent to foolishness, but was played as ridicule for cheap laughter, and the woman Jane played was so unruly that she might have tried nothing at all in character. The script moved wildly between literal chunks of Jane Austen - with remarkable awkwardness - and a completely contemporary language that would not be inappropriate in a modern romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Get the BBC adaptation on DVD and spare yourself the grief
