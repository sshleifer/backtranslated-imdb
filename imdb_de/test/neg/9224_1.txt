This is indeed a spectacularly bad movie, but it is the rare kind of badness that is endless and breathtakingly entertaining! I would like to add more comments to this movie. <br /> <br /> The rock band on the plane looks like three slim casual drunks wearing bad wigs. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the serious continuity problem with the stuffed tiger of the child: it turns into a lion, a leopard and back again; It's dirty or clean, depending on the shot. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! The stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the kid (and the writers)! <br /> <br /> The sight of little Jimmy floating in a coffin down the Amazon, holding on to his stuffed tiger and crunching away, will permanently hold on to your memory. <br /> <br /> Listen to one of the most unsuitable sound effects ever: Late in the story, as the priest searches for Jimmy, the leader asks for the monk's robe as payment - the priest drops to the knee of the resigned Contemplation and it is the sound of a bell, not the deep "BONNNNG" of a church bell, but the "thing" of a bell from a boxing match! <br /> <br /> This is an absolute shout.
