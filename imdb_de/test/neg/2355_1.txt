Rarely does anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, resourceful and prolific directors of all time, because he is comfortable with all these things. It is true genius to scare generations of movie goers through showers and ties. Saboteur is neither creative nor productive. Rather, Hitchcock set out with the soul to make a movie to collect "American Pride," a specific Call to Arms title for supporting our troops, which was a popular topic at the time. Against this background, Hitchcock has seriously undermined other important aspects of the film, including a logical plot, characterization, credible dialogues, and a fluid, flowing plot. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock is usually great for spy movies. Only a few years earlier he had achieved cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but apparently lost his step in creating saboteur and recycled only the one-time thrilling story lines that both provided his previous outings. Without going into a great depth, here is a list of some of the main problems of this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Although his face is plastered on every newspaper in America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind. <br /> <br /> 2. At the dinner party, Kane and Patricia do not want to run to the door because the bad guys could grab them and tell the party they were "Gate Crashers". What logically prevents the spies from grabbing and saying it sometime during the evening? Does anyone have to be reminded that Kane is a wanted terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. Since when can a V-belt cut through the handcuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. No one recognizes him ... his face is in EVERY NEWSPAPER !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The spies meet with Kane in the ghost town and assume that he is the man Freeman sent to work ... should not he have some sort of witness? I know that spies do not walk around with name tags and photo IDs, but maybe a secret handshake? <br /> <br /> 6. Cop picks up Kane, who escapes from Freeman's house, still he does not seem to recognize this guy. <br /> <br /> 7. How exactly does the FBI believe to believe Kane without evidence? They do not even show how Kane talks to the FBI, the scene is just faded in and we have to assume that everything is kosher now. <br /> <br /> 8. When the police raid the carnival caravan, how do you know that Kane is with a woman now? The blind man believed that Kanes story had logically not reported that his daughter was missing, abducted or even more importantly ran with Kane. Why does not this movie use logic? <br /> <br /> This is an ongoing list. The movie is not exciting, the action makes no sense, and the world is full of people who voluntarily take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars because it's no big deal. Hitchcock fails miserably at this.
