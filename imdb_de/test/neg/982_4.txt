In order to recreate "Lost Horizon" as a musical, a musical composition by Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe was required. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. After saying that, my favorite pastime on Lost Horizon is the score. It's just that the score does not fit the piece. The cast consists mainly of non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, all were dubbed and still sounding awful) this and the earlier non-musical movie versions were mediocre at best. The possibilities for a really good cinematic music version are available, but they are not realized here. The movie manages to be a good, rainy vehicle to pass the time. Otherwise, you will feel better if you buy the CD from your soundtrack. Due to the bad reputation of the film only as a curiosity to recommend. I have seen much better. but I have seen much worse.
