This film is full of pseudo-deep thoughtfulness and is so unobtrusive in its writing. These include a Canned Ham Voice Over and an incredible dialogue. A dialogue that is jagged and flat, as Spike is sometimes (not always) when he writes "certain" characters. For those who like nonsense movies like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, this is another movie for you. <br /> <br /> That said, this comment is not against Ryan Gosling, who showed off his sexy chops at The Believer. A film that proves that films are the medium of a director, and when a movie is lazy, you can say that the mistake is there and not the actors.
