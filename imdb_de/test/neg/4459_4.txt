Although I had enjoyed THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula (1974), I knew that I should not expect too much from his even worse predecessor! Surely the smallest of the Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn on the audio commentary on THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes so far as to call the Nadir of the studio!), The film is really freaking out because of its totally unhip - and now embarrassingly dated - update of the myth (today's environment actually fit better with SATANIC RITES) ... ... even though, frankly, it is still preferable to destroy Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! <br /> <br /> Despite Christopher Lee's vociferous beating of the movie, he still makes an undeniably striking figure as an undead vampire (though he looks little and is inexplicably limited to one shot); Likewise, Peter Cushing does his usual dedicated work. The only other notable acting job in the film is that given by Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard (!) - though that's just because of how hammam it is! Unfortunately, the two most famous female members of the cast (both horror regulars) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - can not rise above their physical characteristics. <br /> <br /> The camera work was written by Dick Bush (who shot THE BLOOD ON SATANS CLAW [1971] and was REGULATED for Hammer IF DINOSAURS THE EARTH [1970] AND TWINS OF EVIL [1971]) - but may be on best known for its long-standing association with Ken Russell everywhere there is a pleasant atmosphere, especially during the three crucial sequences: the carriage ride at the (gothic) start; the hysterical Black Mass sequence, followed by the revival of Dracula; and the last confrontation between Lee and Van Helsing of Cushing.
