You will most likely be very disappointed with this sequel, which is not a sequel. AWIL is a classic. But this movie is so far from being a classic as you can get. What a joke, not an actor. And a ridiculously ridiculous subplot that is fast and unconvincing (left with a third of the movie). I mention that the story is less lame than film, but it's too stupid to be funny in any good way. The rating it currently has (4,8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me. My review for An American Werewolf in Paris: 3.5 / 10
