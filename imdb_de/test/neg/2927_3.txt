Billed as a romantic comedy against the early years of World War II, she can not deliver. The problem is that while it is beautifully photographed, it does not have a unified plot or narrative. Based on a murder mystery, it offers its actors no hope as it winds its way through recent history. Depardieu is a trivial role that he obviously does not like to play. Adjani can not carry the picture. The hero is not; obviously an imitation of a Hitchcock role that is unjustly charged lacks its balance. Neither heroic nor funny nor exciting. <br /> <br /> That could have been a good movie. I remember "The Lady Vanishes," who combined tension, romance, and comedy in a serious film about fascism.
