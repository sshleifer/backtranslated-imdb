Wow, I swear it has never happened to me. Yesterday I only saw "Golden Temple Amazons" and can not remember anything that happened in this movie. So brilliant is this movie, I think! By now I can only remember that I was attracted to attract because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art. It shows a wild drawing of a lush Amazon, preparing its bow in front of an unspecified target. I am often deceived by attractive DVD covers? especially Jess Franco? and I still have not learned to resist even literally hundreds of terrible experiences. Well ?? After reading the other user comments, some of my memory returned, though I still suspected that I was confusing this film with another Jess Franco masterpiece that I had viewed the day before, namely "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" ( and, yes, this one had a fantastic result) DVD cover too). <br /> <br /> "Golden Temple Amazons" opens with a line of hot white African Amazons? I'm aware of the contradiction, but do not blame me ???? Slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl for entering the lawn with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. Some years later and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to take revenge. It is accompanied by a bunch of sloppy adventurers who are less interested in revenge but would not mind taking some gold home. The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the notions of ravishing female nudity and superfluous sin. Analía Ivars, Eva Léon and the other unnamed Amazons are among the usual decisions of Franco and like to go around with proudly designed breasts. You'll enjoy watching these perfect female curves as the rest of the "Golden Temple Amazons" is a boring and incompetent mess. There is hardly any violence or action, and no less than half of the film is pure filler, bits and pieces of National Geographic documentaries that have been incorporated into history and stuff. The great DVD cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is completely pointless.
