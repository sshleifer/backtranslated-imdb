While the writing was awful, the acting was cruel, the only thing that saved this "bastard" was the breast count, but that was not enough to look at me again. All in all, I am actually stupider of this movie. This was a new low for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman, who started the movie with a garbage bag and made farting sounds, should have made me realize what I was getting into. This was by far one of the worst Troma team ever released. The best place to show this movie would be for invalids. They feel like they can not change the channel. In the end, this is not a quick recommendation to watch this movie just for the chest.
