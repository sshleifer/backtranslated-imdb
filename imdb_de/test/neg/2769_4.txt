As a young girl, beautiful Joan Woodbury (as Rita Adams) was orphaned after her "chair-pigeon" father was shot to death. As a young woman, Ms. Woodbury has a hard time keeping a job because the ex-convict status of her murdered father makes Woodbury a bad business risk. Woodbury Room with sympathetic singer Linda Ware (as Donna Andrews) recommending Woodbury to connect with old orphanage friends John Archer (as Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (as Mickey Roman). However, none of her friends can help if Woodbury is the victim of a scam that puts her in jail. After the dismissal, Woodbury decides to let the male gangsters for their money? <br /> <br /> titled "Gangs, Inc." This is an obviously weak, cheap gangster melodrama. Still, it's a lot of fun to see Woodbury's marvel with inferior material. She plays the innocently growing, neater "Rita" quite convincingly; and she throws a great deal as a blonde whore. Woodbury has to be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses of the past. "Paper Bullets" also includes an early Alan Ladd (as Jimmy Kelly alias Bill Dugan). Ms. Ware, who sang the hit "An apple for the teacher" with Bing Crosby, sings a couple of decent 40s. But above all, it's Woodbury's show. **** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
