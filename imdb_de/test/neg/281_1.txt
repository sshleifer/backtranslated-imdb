I felt compelled to write about this film after coming to IMDb because I thought it was the worst screenplay I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The drama / other parts of the movie are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works out. The funny banter was also there from the first film. My question is, how on earth did you let this script out of the design process? I thought that the plot did not just evolve like a snail running at the end of the sidewalk, but also that twist? (Can I call it that) was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to demand a refund from the cashier. Never in my life have I felt and used this film in a way that I felt used to. Here I expected something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing storyline), only to find out that they had cost my 8 dollars and made a mockery of it. I still get the fact that this movie meanwhile has grossed more than $ 125 million. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. I still have the feeling that the only part the writers focused on was so little that Julia Roberts was like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
