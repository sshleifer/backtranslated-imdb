The story: Alain, a French policeman, is shocked when he finds out he had a twin brother when his body was found in Nice. He investigates the murder and finds that he had a list of the deeds of the Russian mafia. With the help of his brother's girlfriend, Alain avoids Russian gangsters and corrupt FBI agents while trying to find the list. <br /> <br /> "Maximum Risk" is another long film showing Jean-Claude Van Damme. As far as things are concerned, this is strictly formulaic. The script adheres to the clichés and acting is mediocre. There are some well-done action sequences, with an inventive chase, a fight in a burning building, a rooftop escape, a brutal fight in a lift, and a JCVD ​​fleeing its enemies over an elevated train line. Director Ringo Lam keeps everything at a reasonable pace.
