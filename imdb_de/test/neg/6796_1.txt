I just do not understand why, whenever someone shows a show over one of the country's largest subway areas (Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, etc.), the average person is portrayed as someone who wranglers / cowboy Wearing a Hat, Talking With a Drawl, he has no fashion sense and drives a truck either to the "saloon" or to his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shoot or country concert. I've never seen a microloan drive a police truck ... somewhere in Texas. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this is not done for artistic or comedy reasons, I think the average person is too stupid to see the difference. The bad scripts and bad manners give it away. This show makes stupid shows in the past look like knightriders like entertainment. At least Knightrider had the talking car.
