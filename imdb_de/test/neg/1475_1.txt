This was a terrible, boring movie, even for a documentary. At times, there were insights into life and humorous moments, but overall it was not worth seeing. Every time I felt sympathy for Mark and began to hope that he would be successful, I became disappointed with his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse.
