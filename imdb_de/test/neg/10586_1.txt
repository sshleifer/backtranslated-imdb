It's not uncommon for Hollywood to pump out fucking movies. Occasionally, a handful of good movies come out while the majority just go in the ass. Not surprisingly, these bad movies are retreading old TV series. Occasionally a surprise pops up on "The Fugitive" (who has seen the Best Picture Oscar nominated?), But for every "Fugitive" there is a McHales Navy or other completely unoriginal movie without any action or interest. In my opinion, the Mod Squad is in my top ten of really lousy films that Hollywood should get, I'm sorry, damn it, because he produced what a good movie could have been. We are in the middle of a story that simply does not make sense, talent is wasted and dialogue is bad. We do not know who these characters are, and we could give a fleeting fuck about what they are. Instead, it is expected that you automatically know who they are and what they will do. There is a particularly bad reef about which "I'm too old for this s ** t" line, that's just stupid. Something my friend verbally noticed when we were screaming for the movie just to finish it off. It's just an insult to the Hollywood Cinema. Note: F-
