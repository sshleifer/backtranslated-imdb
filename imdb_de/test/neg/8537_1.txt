I do not expect much from ghost stories, but I expect a story to make sense! Do scriptwriters and filmmakers demand too much? If the villain suddenly turns into a murderous maniac just because a bunch of crows are starting to peck him, then I have a problem spending $ 9.00 on a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock would turn in his grave. Has anyone learned anything in the College Film 101 class? A good movie has an INTERESTING story at its roots! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie: If you have desperate financial problems, move from Chicago to the center of No-Where in North Dakota to grow sunflowers (I'm not joking!). If your toddler has serious neurological problems after a car accident, move from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to a remote small town with at best a community hospital. If you have a teenage daughter, a wife, and a toddler, hire a drifter to live and work with you, out of the blue, without any evidence. (I'm glad they're not my parents!) <br /> <br /> A city where everyone knows there's no problem in missing a threefold murder outside the city. And of course blame the madness of the man for a bad harvest of sunflowers! (Is not there anything else growing in North Dakota?) A few days after buying your rundown house - huge vines are growing everywhere - it reminds Jack and the Beanstalk, a man from the X-Files, ala Smoking Man (I'm glad to see that the cigarettes did not catch him, I think he does not breathe!) Suddenly sneaks up on you while you work to offer you the sale price of your home, plus 15% more, for no reason! <br /> <br /> I think you get the picture. I've seen so many godforsaken, awful movies in the last month, it just makes my head off! Is it so difficult to shoot a movie that does not treat the audience like an idiot? I'm glad that at least the crows in this sad movie had the throats! I wish I could say the same for anyone who thinks he would make money with this celluloid garbage!
