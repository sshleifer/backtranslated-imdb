Something good stage design. Good songs, although as the other one said, they are not played with much energy. Bea Arthur, who did her best to do something with the material, occasionally had a good one-liners role as Mames girlfriend Vera, helping to bring the song "Bosom Buddies." Besides, there's nothing here that's worth your time. Slow tempo, unbelievably bad cinemetography, not very good vocals (except Robert Preston), a terrible screenplay, bad acting (except Bea) and a terrible lead actress. Who would have thought that Lucille Ball would be good as a stylish, life-loving mame? The heads at Warner Bros. were undoubtedly a rift when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who had done so well on Broadway, and instead Ball, who was not nearly as funny as 20 years ago, could do the part not at all "the right way" and used a painful croaking as an excuse for singing. Even if (maybe because) the film was painful for her and even if she funded it, she just is not Mame. Aunt Mame is such a better movie and the soundtrack of the Broadway musical with Lansbury sounds great. For the most part there is nothing here that is great, captivating or even interesting. Forget it, unless you're a big Lucy fan and believe she can not go wrong. If you see that, you will hopefully realize that she is just a human being.
