My above paraphrase on the slogan on the back of the DVD box puts it in a nutshell: This film was far more terrible than terrible. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I have ever seen, as long as I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it and thought it was the Tom Cruise version. The ridiculously gross special effects on the menu screen should have dismissed us. The innocent nakedness, which was already in the opening scene, made us more suspicious. <br /> <br /> But as the movie evolved, we were stunned by clumsy acting - both over- and under-negotiation - and non-continuity of the direction, and editing, trite writing and gross special effects. We gave up after half an hour or less; It could not get better after I started so badly. <br /> <br /> Since I like the reviews that pervade a product without giving it a damn about it, here are a few examples of the film's most unpleasant moments, even if it's spoiler: <br /> <br /> - The main role says goodbye to his young old son as he is about to drive away with his mother. The latter is prickly, because it is their wedding day, but the main role does not come sudden business. The son asks quietly: "Will I ever see you again?" Maybe it should be a premonition, but it is instead an inappropriate behavior for a child of this age. <br /> <br /> - A giant alien spaceship crashed to earth and sits in a huge crater. A crowd of people stand nearby and look uncomfortable, but generally look rash. A woman finally says "it's gi-normous!" <br /> <br /> - After this boat has devastated a village and its inhabitants, the leadership and a spectator, who are now alone near their homes, trying to load their cars an escape, an exchange like this in a slightly confused tone: <br /> <br /> "What was that anyway?" "I do not know ..." <br /> <br /> - A crowd attempting to evacuate across a bridge is blocked by the military as part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship fires an explosive, the crowd runs away, apparently only because a director has told them, not because they are afraid or in any real danger, let alone in unusual circumstances. <br /> And so on ... when you write about the movie, you miss the experience of actually seeing it. But please, please, spare yourself the trouble, even if your curious curiosity is aroused! The film is so bad that it can not even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (unlike "King Solors & Sheeba" by King Vidor with Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short to waste such nonsense. There MUST be something more productive and enjoyable, like walking a dog or cleaning a birdcage.
