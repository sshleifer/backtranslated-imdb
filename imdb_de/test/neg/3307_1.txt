OK, so she has no caller ID. If you are being tracked, get it! And no mobile phone? If you are persecuted, you will receive ONE if you are one of the few full-time working parents who is the head of household who does not yet own one. This mother gets a big ZERO in the parents department. So her mother is in the hospital and she decides that a shopping spree will help her. Just a stupid movie. I'm glad I have Tivo and a FF button on the remote. And what about the minimum of 10 lines, I just do not have that much to say about such a bad movie. I think I can ask why she opens packages that she has no idea who they are. The son has not added much to the movie either. The bulls were also a big zero. Now go to the next Verizon and get the damn phone. @@
