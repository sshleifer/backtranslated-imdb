This movie was disappointing for at least two reasons. The resulting tension disappeared due to terrible acting or lack of direction from the director .. I do not know .. it was like a tasty chewing gum that apparently lacked flavor, but you still chew on it because it tasted great once. Like most thrillers, The Hitchhiker did not live up to the promise when I had bright eyes and wanted to turn down the volume (I saw the movie in the dark alone). This so-called thriller simply broke out as if it were turning Lego into something else. The gas just ran out and I stared with one exception on a TV style film. It was probably rated -R.
