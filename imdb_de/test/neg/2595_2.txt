Have you ever seen one of those shows that have become so popular that at some point they might get away with shabby nonsense and repetitive, half-hearted gimmicks that the creators can get away with? If you have not, you have never seen Family Guy. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show seem to consider it funny, nervous and poignant. It's none of it, but it's boring, repetitive, insulting and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The "humor" of the show comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Irrelevant idiocy. The show often has flashbacks to things that have nothing to do with the storyline and are usually just absurd and meaningless. And then there are the random movie references in which the characters of a scene reenact a scene from a popular movie without effectively parodying it. , , or parody it at all (which is not funny !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) the same crap that's in every episode of the show. One is a sexual deviant with sexually transmitted diseases, AHA HA! Is not that funny?! Hey, do you know what's even funnier? Make the same joke about him in a single episode somewhere between one and fifteen times. And not only do it in a single episode several times, but pull it out so that a whole scene is dedicated to the one joke. Now imagine that this routine is used over and over again for virtually every character in the entire series. <br /> <br /> The unconventional humor "un-PC" is not as "un-pc" as he would do it Do you think, mostly they just say what the idiots are about the latest headlines of the newspapers, politicians and random ones Celebrities think. The series had its moments, but now I think it's time to blow the show off and get it done. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's funny? I still like that more than Nausicaa from the Valley of the Wind.
