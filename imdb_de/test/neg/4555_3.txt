Dean Cain, the one-time super-man, plays Max Hooper as a super-thief. He can break into any business and steal everything at the right price. Unfortunately, his latest raid takes him to a skyscraper where someone else has set fire to his own attempts to steal the product. Now the thief must be the hero who saves everyone in the building. Unfortunately, the other thief is still in the building and the F.B.I. & C.I.A. Waiting outside for Max. <br /> <br /> The film is barely passable. Dean Cain is a fun actor and has done a lot better with better material, but here he is saddled with a weak script and pretty bad direction.
