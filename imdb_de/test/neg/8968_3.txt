Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman, the prayer mixed with positive thinking - and is considered by the locals to be a witch. Kate tries too hard to convince us she's a hillbilly (Trigger Hicks!), But you can tell she does not even believe in this unintentionally funny scenario. Constantly smiling Robert Young plays a foreman who works on building a mound that will become Trigger's first flock ... but he's married! No amount of white magic can revive this formula based on a game that R.K.O. has brought to the screen. thrive with a too wide hillbilly. It is godless and almost unsurpassable. * 1/2 of ****
