I turned that off in the first five minutes. It was very sick and disturbing. The moment I turned off the device, the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse, and the skull was pierced by a small instrument with tubes. This creature lay shocked on the floor before she died. The narrator said that the animal dies instantly. I do not agree with graphic realism about animals, insects or other creatures. I was very disappointed when I just saw 'Eyes Without a Face', a brilliant movie, and this short was attached that spoiled my night - since I could not hurt a fly, I saw this gruesome documentary film /> Reading other reviews on this page, I noticed that they used words like aesthetics - this is not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound, but not aesthetic.
