I have read the positive comments on this film. I suppose the people who were in this movie must have come to this site to give good press because this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I always watch the whole movie, despite the quality or the lack of it, which explains why I saw the whole movie, but I do not think I laughed for the entire duration of the movie. The jokes were usually very bad, but when the jokes promised a lot, the delivery was over. If you liked it, maybe you should dismiss the buds because you have to get the remaining 5 or 6 brain cells. This film had a bad script, bad drama, bad direction, faint plot ... nothing virtuous and was not entertaining. If you have not seen this movie, do not do it.
