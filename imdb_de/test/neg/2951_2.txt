We waited in line for The Good Girl, an excellent movie starring Jennifer Aniston, when a lady found herself with this cheap fake twenty-dollar bogus ad for MANNA FROM HEAVEN. "Come and see this movie!" She said. "They will love it!" <br /> <br /> She introduced us to the director of the film. Well, that should have been our first clue. I mean, in how many cinematic situations does the director of the movie stand in the lobby and ask people to see him? "Is this a Christian movie?" I asked, did not really care about one way or another. I love Jesus. That's no shame. "No!" she said defensively. What a lot of crap. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. So bad. And that's not just because of the obvious Christian agenda, but also because of the dreadful dialogue that alternates between wooden and exaggerated action and the apparent lack of editors. The movie is way too long. If it had been an hour and a half, maybe (just maybe) I would not have had to visit the Suicide Prevention Center after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm lying. After one hour of this garbage, we crept into SWIMFAN. At least we know with SWIMFAN that it's rubbish before we see the movie. We know that we have to support ourselves. And SWIMFAN has hot half-naked people. The only thing semi-naked in this movie is the despair of the stars involved, whose apparent lack of scripts is far from concealed. And the actress who dressed the nun? It's called a personality. Get one. <br /> <br /> The people who shamelessly begged for ticket sales in the lobby told me that if I liked MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, then I * would * love * (their emphasis, not mine) MANNA FROM HEAVEN , Law. More like, "If you like GLITTER, you'll love MANNA FROM HEAVEN." And Mariah could actually surpass all clowns with this movie. If that is not an insult, then I do not know what. <br /> <br /> I scolded enough. Watch indie movies, but do not see the bad ones. This is definitely one of the bad ones. MANNA FROM HEAVEN needs some divine intervention.
