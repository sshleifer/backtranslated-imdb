Lance Henriksen got paid for it. I hope it was a lot. <br /> <br /> Kristie Phillips, the former US national gymnast, starts with Charlie Case, a Turner-Turn-Secret agent (as it is very common for Munchkin gymnasts to become government spies ...) There is a truly hysterical opening scene in which Charlie's routine for uneven bars is sabotaged by an opponent from the Eastern bloc. What follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes I have ever seen ... and they want you to take it seriously! Do not worry ... she is holding on to her descent. <br /> <br /> Everything is just a chaotic mess of a spy movie. Watch the first fifteen minutes for camping gymnastics and run for cover.
