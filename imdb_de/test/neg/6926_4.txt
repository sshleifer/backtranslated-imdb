I was so looking forward to being a big fan of the book. But when I came out, I thought it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time I've ever spent in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Basically, drama, sets and music were excellent and that is the main reason why I rated this rating as 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sara is a bit too intrusive for my taste. There was no way she had deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just so she would not punish the other girls. In the book she describes lies as "not only evil but vulgar". <br /> <br /> There is far too much Disneyfied for me; Sara's father came back from the dead and trotted into the Indian sunset. While the book may have a happy ending (and critics may say equally unlikely), it does not make you think, "Oh, puh-leeze." About the only things that were due to the book: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father is a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father ("Do you memorize me?" / "No. I know you They are in my heart. ") 3. Sara's friendship with Becky and her" adopting "Lottie (though the latter was not as developed as it could have been) 4. Changing her room by adding various luxuries. This part was done well. 5. The basic core - a rich girl who is suddenly thrown into poverty - is there, but it's about everything. <br /> <br /> People might say that this adjustment is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say is that I have two cousins ​​(7 and 12 years old) who call this movie big fans until the book is read. <br /> <br /> If you just want to "feel good" family movie, then deliver this. If you're looking for a movie that actually tells the story of A Little Princess (if you've actually read the book), you should not waste time with this movie. It's such a shame; with a cast like this, if they had at least stuck to the basic story, it could have been fantastic. <br /> <br /> Do I make Harping a bit too much about "reading the book" and "reading the book"? Very likely But if someone tried to turn a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, he should at least have done the same. Preferably more than once.
