Me and a buddy rented the movie the other day. At first glance, it seemed to be another teen movie that we hoped would be fans of simple horror and comedy fans. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to disappoint the audience as well. It quickly accelerates to something that holds a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it never completely leaves the ground. We thought it was something that seemed like an hour when I slept, half asleep, said, "Dude, this movie is shit." It was only 35 minutes ... Man agreed. <br /> <br /> The problem is, the movie is just not funny. It should undoubtedly be funny, but it failed. It failed in a way that saddened me. It somehow reminds me of me. I had the potential to be anything I wanted, and instead I saw cheap horror movies all the time. I feel sorry for the creators of this film from the bottom of my heart. It is so sad. All the potential ... and nothing.
