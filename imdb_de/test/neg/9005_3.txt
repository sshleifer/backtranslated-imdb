"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a not very good movie, which is only redeemable for the topless shots of the former supermodel Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> That's it. The plot is negligible, Pierce Brosnan on the phone in his role, and Dennis Leary plays (as usual) an annoying Irish police officer, but I can not ignore the beautiful woman Russo. There is a good love scene on a staircase, an incredibly sexy ballroom, a topless beach scene and a roll in the sack. Oh, and a painting has been stolen from a museum, and a catamaran is sunk. <br /> <br /> But we hope that other directors recognize Ms. Russo's bold attributes and bring her into other, widely visible roles.
