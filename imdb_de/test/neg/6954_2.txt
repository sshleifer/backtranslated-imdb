Michael Caine might have tried to make a larger-than-life character successful, but the entire story and character around him were not sympathetic or interesting. It was all very boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau, a favorite actor of mine, did not matter. He was useless. Michael Caine became irritating after a while and the movie could not decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tries hard and good with him, but I feel the direction and action abandon him. Do not waste your time. It starts well for the first 10 minutes and then it's time. A movie for Die Hard Caine fans. Stay away from this ...
