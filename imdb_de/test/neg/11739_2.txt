A remake of a successful movie can be a tricky affair at best. To recreate a real classic, especially one that is definitely the final movie of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else again. And after seeing this version of Psycho, directed by Gus Van Sant, I immediately think of two things: What is the meaning and what on earth have you thought? Especially with regard to the fact that Van Sant used the same script (by Joseph Stefano from the novel by Robert Bloch) that Hitchcock used. The end result here underlines some of the intricacies of film art: First, a "remake" should be just that; a retooling of the original instead of a "copy" with new players; and secondly, photographing with paint, using more blood, and using a bit more graphics will do little more than affect the film's impact. Although this was a noble endeavor by Van Sant, ironically, he suffers from the same mistake Norma Bates suffered: the "spirit" of the film was divided; half was Hitchcock, half Van Sant. And though the Twain is fulfilled, he will never be bound. Van Sant, who worked on the original script himself, would have done better to make his own film - to the end - instead of trying to copy exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. For example, the opening shot of the film and especially the "Shower" scene, probably one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema. Hitchcock is copying, from the shots that look directly into the shower head, to the drain, and with the same `skree! Skree! Skree! Sound effects - even in homage to Hitchcock - distracted only from the story. If you consider the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you have another split in the psyche of the movie. Macy is a terrific actor - one of the best character actors in the industry - and his performance here is excellent. But as good as it is, the attitude and surrender are pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times) and apparently not in the context of what Van Sant does. The film ends with a threefold personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I saw House Of Good Will Psycho Games. <br /> <br /> As far as the performances are concerned, Macy's was as solid as they would come, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating an original character who was caught up in an imitation of Janet Leigh has withdrawn. The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's friend so unfriendly and unappetizing that you wondered why she had anything to do with him at all. and Vince Vaughn, who, to say the least, was just as terrible as Norman Bates. His whole performance was that of an actor playing a role (and not very convincing); When he touched on feminist mannerisms and influenced his speech with "spontaneous" outbursts of inhumane laughter, he made his caricature a caricature rather than a figure that was unbelievable and presumptuous. It gave the film a sense of a reenactment of a "true incident" that you would see on a television program; It would have been perfectly in keeping with the film's sensitivity to cutting Norman, who sat alone in his salon, by a sober Peter Graves: "That was Norman Bates' attitude to that fate, a rainy night when Marion Crane got out of her car and stepped into his life - 'The side cast includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster, Philip Baker Hall (Mrs. Sheriff Al Chambers) and Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers)), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the Car Dealer). Not least, Van Sant's Psycho is a curiosity that shows that a good director, a predominantly excellent cast and crew A script that has proven to be a proven commodity is not necessarily a success.Surely, today's era of psycho gossip, 'American Psycho' and Hannibal Lecter have the edge, as it were, on a character like Norman Bates removed; But in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims, there is still a unique intimacy that will forever remain intrusive and frightening. But Van Sant can not convey that sense of fear, the throat-searing fear, with this film. If ever a movie was made that was intended for the video, that's it. Better yet, it would never have been born. I rate this as 2/10
