I am amazed at how overrated "Cemetery Man" is among the horror fans! I usually welcome films that combine two or more genre styles, and I love almost every zombie comedy I've ever seen. To my horror, this Italian cult classic really did not show me much to overwhelm me ... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery staff and his retarded man-child Curly Joe. They are looking for an assistant, since they are primarily concerned with the recently deceased people shoot out of the ground seven days after their first death. He meets a widow whom he "enchants" with a cruel cemetery atmosphere, develops a quick romance, and soon has sex with her on the grave of her dead husband. The man's body jumps to life and bites it, triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the movie. "Cemetery Man" tries to integrate all elements like horror, romance, comedy, action and fails in the long run. It's cumbersome to never focus on one aspect long enough to make it interesting to the viewer, such as the buddy's relationship with a living severed head, a motorcycle zombie shooting out of the ground, the main character, the decides to shoot down random people on the sidewalk etc. This thing is so kinky and boring that it's almost impossible to take it seriously. Sure, it's stylish and often "elegant," but even the most "artistic" films need the right line to make sense. "Cemetery Man" trudges away and does not seem to be able to concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes, which becomes very tiring after some time. People argue, "It's a more sophisticated zombie movie." Honestly, when it comes to zombies, I do not want anything more "sophisticated" than Romero ... There's a bit of gore and nudity - mostly in the scenes where "horror movie" is supposed to be played, but not nearly enough for the uncompromising lack of Balance structure. Terrible movie.
