What a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square meters of reconstructed ancient Rome, 2 million cubic feet of 50 foot tall buildings, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of work, an International Ancient History Committee (sic!), Some first-class actors and actresses. The final result? An empty television movie for single-digit IQ participation.
