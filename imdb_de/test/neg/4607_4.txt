An excellent cast that does its best with a horrible script, an inappropriate direction, and one of the worst scores I've ever heard. More TV movie of the week than serious drama. Which is sad, considering that the source material is very serious and very real. The filmmakers decided that instead of the drama and the character, the most graphic and violent pieces should be shown, and hope that the audience will be shocked in sympathy and care. In my opinion, one of the most blatant forms of customization of cut and paste films.
