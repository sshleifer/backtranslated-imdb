Only if it's the last thing you do and your sense of humor evaporates, you should ever try to see it. If you see it, look at it, do not invite anyone, it will never see another movie with you again. For this purpose, it could be an excellent tool. Invite people you want to get rid of in your life. <br /> <br /> Apparently I have to write more about his film to qualify as a review. That's a sweet irony for this movie, it really sums it up perfectly. after wasting my time, it wastes more time. IT has a function, I take everything back. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, look at it, it provokes it, really go on.
