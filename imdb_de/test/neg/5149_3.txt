A crazy chick movie. A Beauty Candidate ends dead and the Usual Suspects are distended. Another entry in the style of the Texas Cheerleader, this is an average example of this guy. <br /> <br /> Yasmine Bleeth gets into her usual, healthy girl performance and Jill Clayburgh does a good job when she's a stressed out mom. <br /> <br /> Some mild, funny moments, listening to the dark, selfish PR that comes from the mouths of the participants. (`I would like to own a restaurant so I can give food to the homeless.) <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what people need for a brain when they think of a cheerleader place or beauty crown worth killing for! <br /> <br />
