Worse than a mediocre thriller about a battered wife who enters the Lam after being cumbersome with the death of her husband and sister. Determined to prove that her husband lives, she follows the entire state, and her danger rises at each stop. Chasing after him are the traditional partners of the "good policemen" and "bad policemen". One is convinced of her innocence, the other more interested in closing the case and coming home. This couple is often in a position to corner the suspect, but never quite catch it. All major players meet in a remote desert town, and the truth is starting to develop into deadly consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! That was a bad movie. The leadership behaved as if calmed down. The police could not find a suspect if he or she is in the police station (this happens twice) and everyone else is as one-dimensional as possible. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
