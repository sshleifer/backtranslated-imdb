A stupid fool of formerly talented John Hughes, who will soon make a movie with the sperm of "Look Who's Talking" as his stars get younger. He re-recycles the 'Home Alone' formula to produce this idiotic comedy in which a baby rides in Chicago, while the intrepid kidnappers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley find him on the way, the much tiring slapstick survives. If Mantegna and Pantoliano do not laugh anywhere in your movie, you're in trouble, but the laziness of the movie is most likely in the scenes where crowds do not see a baby crawling on the sidewalk. Complete nonsense.
