"Death Wish 3" is the equivalent of a shooting range. All characters (with the exception of Paul Kersey of Bronson) merely exist to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or "retaliation" (the villains). The director simply pours out the mindless violence (people are even burned alive and blown up alive) and turns them into an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy shots). Fans of this short thing (and apparently there are many) will enjoy it, others ... beware. (* 1/2)
