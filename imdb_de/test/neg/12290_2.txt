I saw this in the video store and thought I would try. It sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That's it. The characters looked good and the actor playing "Noel" was the most convincing, though he had no hard time in the movie. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is a minute that my book gets. When the movie started, I always wanted it to get better, but to no avail. Aesthetically, it was good. The sound and the light were good, but the acting in this movie killed it for me. It was like a bad soap opera. I kept saying, "I can not believe they published this step like that." I paused several times, out of sheer unbelief that acting was so bad. There's so much I want to say, but I'm just saying that, everything else was mostly good, it was the acting, the last cut that really made this movie.
