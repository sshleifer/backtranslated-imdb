When paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the house of the Argyle family at the very beginning of the film, he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members who was executed for murdering his mother two years ago. An innocent man was convicted and a murderer is still around. But as the movie progresses, the disappointment inevitably increases. <br /> <br /> "Ordeal by Innocence" is a boring and sometimes boring movie that does not increase at any time. Nothing interesting happens all the time, and even the final revelation of the facts is not surprising and intense (whether you guess it or not). Donald Sutherland, Cristopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles (far from their good performance in "Ryan's Daughter") just go through their roles and are not very excited either. <br /> <br /> You will not miss much if you skip these.
