I just saw this movie on Bravo! and it was absolutely terrible. It has the storyline of a Shannon Tweed movie without nudity. The premise was interesting enough, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money. The characters were as banal as the observations on human nature and greed. For a movie called Class Warfare he had very little to do with class differences except the first 20 minutes and the foreseeable end. This movie could have been a lot better if there were more characters who had the motivation to get the ticket, and "who did that?" such a terrible script. Lindsey McKeon is very cute and I would like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. It's probably the only reason why I've eaten the whole movie. <br /> <br />
