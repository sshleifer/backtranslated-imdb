In the early '00s, production companies in France had a short-lived craze for supernatural genre films after "The Crimson Rivers" and "Brotherhood of the Wolf" turned out to be hits, so several films were greened or rescued by their "councils." Direct-to-Video "Destiny Unlike the United States, Britain or Italy, however, France has little tradition with Fantasy B films, and it quickly turned out that" Samouraïs "," Bloody Mallory "or the sequel to" Crimson Rivers' failed attempts to rebuild itself were a kind of magic that had not existed in French cinema at all - when they flopped, the producers went back to their usual price: derived farces or the umpteenth self-referential homage to French New Wave by a former critic from "Les Cahiers du cinéma". <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" could only have been lit in green in this short window as it does not fulfill any other discernible purpose - it's your slash movie after the book Fused with indefinite mythological elements and horror references, here you will find bimboesque female characters, a French university that looks like an American campus itself for an hour before, even before the movie started. <br /> <br /> These elements make the fun of a 70s or 80s B movie and you expect them in a 70s or 80s movie. However, we are no longer in the 80s and nobody warned director Doug Headline, because this tribute to the Slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative Slasher movie. The headline itself is not a beginner and has been a critic for this type of imagery since the early '80s, but as the first director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes "Brocéliande" boring. <br /> <br /> When you put together stereotypes from a movie subcategory and hand them over to an experienced and resourceful director like Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get a "scream" or "death proof", movies that are imitations of old are guilty pleasures, but also enlarge these clichés and add much to it. This is called "talent" and therefore you can not confuse these new films with their original inspirations decades ago. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" treads the lazy path and reproduces only the worst elements from previous films (unfortunately) for the male observer usually lacks free nudity). There are very strong (presumably unintentional) similarities between the conspiracy of "Brocéliande" and the "Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch" as they both deal with supernatural Druidic evil rituals and a stupid Halloween night's attempt. Since even the plot of "Halloween 3" is more meaningful than this, it means that something serious was going on with "Brocéliande".
