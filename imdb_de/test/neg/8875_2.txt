I have not even seen this whole movie. Well, I like the sci-fi movies of the '50s, even if they're pretty inaccurate, but that just annoyed me. For one thing, a crew member talks and discusses the spaceship as if it had made it into tenth grade. He sounds like he needs to be in a bowling league, not in a spaceship. From the spaceship's window, the crew admires the earth and this boob says, "Can you see Brooklyn?" and another says "safe". And the boob says, "I wonder who nods?" Forgive me for a moment, I think my pages are splitting. <br /> <br /> When they get into orbit for the first time, the boob says' The moon is only for viewing! Take me down again! "It's also not one of the better moments to watch the crew straighten their mouths and scream at the acceleration forces during the start. (Perhaps the best moment of the movie is seen on a big "THE END" on the screen.) We also find that they can not open the hatch because "Boob" greased them before has taken off. Sure, a spacecraft is "smeared" by a crewman we later learned that there has never been a space suit before and nothing about weightlessness. As Baby Huey, the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said, "That sounds logical!" The effects of no gravity in space are so bad that it is painful to observe them. (Everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go up.) <br /> <br /> How this film gets 6.3 out of 10 stars, when other, far superior films have no higher value, is one Puzzle me. I really like old sci-fi movies, but this one is not realistic, and the lame attempts to create humor by throwing this boob from a gas station in a gutter do not work at all - it just ruins the movie. In hindsight, I think it's not the whole movie I hate, but the fact that "boob" is obviously not someone who would be on a spaceship - not even to "smear" the hatch. OH MY GOD. I wonder if he has also checked the fan straps. Maybe if they had let the 'boob' off the journey, it might not have been so distressing. Still, it's just average. I do not know what everyone else is talking about. <br /> <br /> You want to see a well-kept space movie of the 1950s? "Rocketship X-M" beats everything. Maybe not so much "realism", but a more serious story and less silly characters.
