As mentioned in the other comments, this may be a surprise to those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you seen delicatessen, there is nothing new in this movie. I found Delicatessen great when it came out, but this movie is just too late to be of interest. I do not think it's a worse movie than Delicatessen, but it's boring to see it now, as if it's likely to see delicatessen again. The movie really does not make sense, nothing that really matters or stays with you. There may be a distant resemblance to the films of Kusturica, but he's really in a different league, so you'd better watch his films than waste your time with Tuvalu.
