"Red Sonja" is flawed, weak and missing. Even the camp is not good. <br /> <br /> There are only two good things about "Red Sonja"; The costumes (even though the red Sonja costume is ridiculous), it is ironic that a girl who is even afraid of being touched by men because she was raped will still wear so few garments, even if it rains.) And the music of Ennio Morricone. The film is still something to see, but certainly not recommended. <br /> <br /> The story is extremely simple and they did not even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been good action sequences and humor, both are there, but in many ways serious. The film takes itself too seriously and tries to impress, but fails completely. Brigitte Nielsen is a terrible leading actress. I do not know who has the accent is worse. Her or Arnies and more; She can not act. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two characters, which makes the love story unbelievable. Even worse, Sandahl Bergman was the main villain who acts worse than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was a bit good in his role, but my God, he looked awful, he has changed so much since his (only known) role in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Maybe it had something to do with his illness, which claimed his life in 1991? By the way, what about all those "Raiders of the Lost Ark" actors in this movie? In addition to Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared in a role that seemed to be a kind of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" association. <br /> <br /> The only time the film arrives Something interesting during the (sword) fights, even though some of them are unnecessary and weak. <br /> <br /> Only really to see for fans of the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> 4/10
