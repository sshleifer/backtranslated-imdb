This was a catastrophic show. In short, it was about this boy named Doug, who tripped a lot of debt. Seriously, he could feel guilty for killing a fly and feeling guilty about feeling guilty for killing the fly, and so on. The animation was uncomfortable and the jokes cheap. <br /> <br /> It was aired here in Sweden as part of the "Disney Time" show and I remember I liked it a bit but then I got 13 years old The characters were also green and purple. What was wrong with that? <br /> <br /> Really a horrible show. Apparently it's a movie that I've never seen before, but I have no expectations for this movie either.
