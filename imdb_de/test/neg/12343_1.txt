Eleven years after the release of this film, only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this utter lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is coherent, but it lacks cinematic virtue. In this movie you will find examples of horrific production in every way. The header, for example, are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. Michael McKean ends up staring out of a prison window and says, "There are many secrets out there." followed by a clip-montage / music video of all uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in between is terrible. I struggled to find a value in this movie and ended up empty-handed. Although it's hard to believe, even a cameo role by Burgess Meridith (always a crowd pleaser) disappointed me. This movie is like a ridicule about the special feature of films. On paper, the film is below average. Women living together in a trailer. But what was actually produced, was hard to beat. The film tries to descend in many directions, but never follows one. The unsightly conflict of having a friend in prison is never resolved. No conflict is ever resolved. There really is no conflict. The women try to be hookers, but that never happens. Instead, they get jobs as bartenders and shelf retailers. Sounds exciting? It was not like that. It was stupid. And the main part of the film are the two women who talk and construct constructed conflicts. The women are capable actresses, but the script was beyond the poor. Useless. This was a horrible movie, but even worse, they got Burgess Meridith out of his retirement home to make it. Bad from start to finish. Like the lion without teeth, this film has no bite.
