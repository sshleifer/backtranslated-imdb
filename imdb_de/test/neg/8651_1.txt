This movie is worth nothing. I mean, if you want to look at these things, switch to Hollywood movies! This is a shame for the name Bollywood. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. For the actors, it seems that the acting genes skip a generation. Tanisha could not have worn less and Uday Chopra was obviously only selected because he was the spoiled son of the director. (All of Halla Re were amazingly stupid.) The songs are anyway, and I hope the director did not spend too much money on them. Do not let your kids see it, and if you have it in your house, it's a stupid movie, so throw it away! Buy the CD if you have to. (As I said, the songs are anyway.) At least it's better than the movie.
