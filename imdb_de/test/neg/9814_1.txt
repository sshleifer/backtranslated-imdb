I saw this movie about 8 years ago when it first came out, and the only memories I have of it are: 1. That it was awful. 2. That Linnea Quigley repeatedly applies sunscreen on her arms and legs for about 15 consecutive minutes in one scene (it seemed to be so long anyway). 3. A scene where a character gets a sledgehammer rammed into his head. In this scene, when the hammer joins, the head breaks like glass. It is pretty bad.
