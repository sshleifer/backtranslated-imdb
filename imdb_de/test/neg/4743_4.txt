When I faced Alien Vs. Predator, I must say, was as stupid as a sequel, it was still something pleasing. Unfortunately there are not enough good movies in the movies lately, so my friend and I decided to just see what AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem was all about. So we saw it a few nights ago and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing exciting about this horror sequel. It took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie. It's not a bad idea that they have taken Alien and Predator to the suburbs of the upper class, but from the idea of ​​the first, which explained their reasons for existence, this was just an average and predictable horror episode. Not to mention a story that introduces new characters in each scene, where I did not know who the main character should be and why, so I could not really keep up with the story. <br /> <br /> From what I have gathered, the Predator and the alien are of course in space and have to deal with the stuff of typical sitcom neighbors. You just turn off the lights and decide why, why not? Go on and take it with some earthlings. So they crash and Alien takes over the utopia of the suburbia. But teenagers, including a restless couple that looks like Ken and Barbie, a female Marine and her daughter, will see to it that the Space Butt is kicked, that is, if the predator is not there first. Since he's signed off on the alien, I think he started the party without him, lol, just a joke, in fact, because he killed some of his friends. AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is not the worst movie of all standards, it's still pretty cool with lots of visual effects and the battle sequences between Alien and Predator are so cool to watch. As with the first sequel to Alien Vs. Predator is the cast of what ruins the movie and it seems they are not well developed. I know it's a horror, but the original Alien and Predator movies had characters you worried and wanted to win. But it was a halfway decent continuation that I'd say worth a look, especially for Ken and Barbie's sake. <br /> <br /> 4/10
