Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible action Not necessary! Decent spectacle Not necessary! Respect for his powerful ancestor? Unnecessary! Yes, it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the Butch Bruce canon. <br /> <br /> I mean, where do you start with this movie? Okay, let's start with the sad misconception that people may have that is somehow related to the book or the original movie The Day of the Jackal. It is not. In fact, it is so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked him to reject his name. Now I'm not necessarily a stuffy Brit who can not hack Hollywood when he makes British films. Okay, maybe I'm a bit like that, but luckily it's superfluous in this case. This movie is so different from the original that the name and the odd reference are the only ones that survive. <br /> <br /> Let us now proceed to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster is killed in a police raid in Moscow (the FBI is somehow involved, though there is no one to explain the reason). In revenge, the gangster brother decides to take revenge by killing the US president's wife (though nobody bothers to explain why this is a good move?) Although it was fair to be 9-11, So he was not 'to know that this would have led to a bombing of the US Air Force on Eastern Europe). Gangster hired "evil" murderer (Willis). Police hire "cuddly" killers (Gere), "cuddly" killer tracks "evil" killers. Policewoman is nearby and is regularly killed. "Cuddly" killer kills "bad" killer. First Lady is saved, and we all know that the IRA is just so many really cute guys who happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice. <br /> <br /> Let's put aside the hideous Hollywood habit of playing in the difficulties of Northern Ireland as if it were a sandbox in a theme park (I'll go into more detail on the news boards). If Hollywood directors want to make the Belfast butchers with heart of gold whores, it's up to them. Of course, I reserve the right to despise her for it. It is a free country. Even more annoying is the fact that the film manages to patronize and offend the Irish while trying to support them. This is not politically unpleasant, it is much worse: it is incompetent. It's no wonder Gere, for example, still looks so damned good, having slept through the six months to make this piece of crapp. The fact that Geres Akzent is not only from the south of Ireland, but a frightening parody of Southern Irish shows that the filmmakers did not seek much beyond America to make money from this film. Then there's the beautiful scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this movie) says he wants to drink a coffee, offers to bring our "cuddly" IRA man, and then casually says, " Ah, but then people drink Guinness, right? "Yes, that's right, Sidney. The Irish live on Guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> While we deal with Poitier: Why? In the original movie, the detective is the tracker. In Jackal, Gere is the tracker. What is Poitier doing? Well, he just hangs around and of course looks like a twin. He has absolutely nothing to do, except for the Marines at the end, and he does so only because the nice IRA man asks him to. <br /> <br /> Talking about Gere, why? I suppose it's only a matter of time before Hollywood redesigns Gandhi, while Vin Diesel plays the former Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi, who heads his way through India in the 1940s and 50s). Let's not forget that Gere's character is a murderer and therefore a bad piece of work. And if not, why does he know the jackal? If not, why does he know all his steps? And if so, why is he such a flabby cookie and such a "lovable" person? <br /> <br /> All this shows that the creators of this movie do not have the trouble to (a) think about the plot (b) when the characters make decisions that fit their character (c) avoid cheesy clich√©s like the big boss who kills his own friend? I honestly thought that this movie had become a Bond movie (d) had something to do with the "central" characters (e) owe a certain amount of intelligence to the audience. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to the British and Irish killed by terrorists, it is an insult to the Irish people, it is an insult to not great, but pretty good movies that break, and one Insult to the secret services. But mainly ?? and unforgivable? It's an insult to me because I had to sit for more than two hours. Honestly, you would think without action, without characters and without dialogue, it would be over in no time. But they did not even have the decency to stop early.
