The movie is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, there are too often unfocused and very rough scenes. With a decent amateur camera and $ 100 video editing software, you can easily get a cleaner movie. The man on the street does not mean sloppy editing. Unfocused scenes that contain no important statements should have been deleted. The same is true to ensure that the head / hand / other objects of the object remain in the frame. My 8-year-old son knows that by now. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long. The main point (anti-globalization) is understood after 30 minutes, why the rest of the matter has to take care of. After the interview with James Suckling I pressed the "Stop" button. What a waist of time. <br /> <br /> The main topic just does not work for me anymore. I've seen too many small wineries producing mediocre, commercialized wines, and many great wineries producing great and unique wines. The film identifies the small producers as those who produce wines with more identity or terroir. The larger ones are accused of producing "internationalized" or "commercialized" wines. The film tries to make a black and white statement in a world full of shades of gray. The film did not prove this claim. They consider some sporadic examples, "tie" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism, and make "interviews" with key persons. Have all the small producers spent the Second World War in resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has something to do with Bulldogs? The film is very manipulative and unconvincing.
