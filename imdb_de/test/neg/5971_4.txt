After seeing Darwin's Nightmare, you have to get the impression that Tanzania is a hell. The population is essentially a slave, providing the best-nourished Europeans with the best fish, while the fish bones are left to the starving population. In exchange for the fish, they receive western weapons, which are eagerly awaited by the mainly unemployed population, because as a soldier, they are the only source of income. <br /> <br /> So it's all dark with the trade incarnation of evil and source of all misery? Not quite. Fortunately, Darwin's Nightmare shows only the dark sides and spares the positive aspects completely. In fact, the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecological significance that the Victoria-perch has for the region. For the countries on Lake Victoria, Victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income. Wages in fisheries are far above average. Tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen. The neighboring states have made agreements to keep fishing at a sustainable level. The lakeside towns benefit from the taxes that fishermen have to pay for each kilogram of fish caught, as well as taxes on factory exports and profits. In addition, Tanzania has banned the export of local traditional fish, which still plays an important role for the local population. By ignoring these positive signs, the documentary scares off much-needed Western consumers and investors and threatens to exacerbate Africa's situation. <br /> <br /> For further reading, I can recommend two articles that the German newspaper wrote with alternative topics on this topic: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / text print http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
