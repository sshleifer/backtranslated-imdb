Extremely slow film. There are good performances by all actors, which is why there are over 5 points to be found. Suya and Jyo are said to be this ideal husband and ideal wife, and we are shown this until it comes to a point where you start to ask. Then there is a story One day, Jyo discovers Surya's diary to find his failed college love story. The college love story is utterly unconvincing, as Surya is an arrogant senior who always picks on Bhoomika, beat his girlfriend, calls her in public, and screams in spite of the fear of him falling in love with him. Even after coarsely speaking them, I could not appreciate the character played by Bhoomika, I do not think that a woman who respects herself loses herself in real life to such idiots. Jyo decides to bring them together and what happens after that; is the highlight. The story is extremely weak in their characters. An extremely arrogant Surya to Bhoomika is the exact opposite of Jyo (and there is no reason for the sudden change of character). An Extremely Gentle Bhoomika Becomes a Great Extrovert When It Comes Back If she had grown so confident, why did not she try to find her love because she no longer feared anyone.
