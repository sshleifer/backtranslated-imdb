This is not a horrible movie, just fade. The plot is profoundly flawed and implausible. It tries to be a set of genres and fails at everyone. It fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. Almost succeeds as science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, sweet cherub-face who she is, should model teenage clothes rather than acting. The only thing stopping this movie from being a 1 in 10 is Helen Mirren. Their performance is unbelievably shameful and worthwhile (almost) suffering from the rest. Their ability to switch from the imperial to the faux-friendly to purposely manipulate and control their prey shows a masterful reach. Apart from Marissa Coughlin's wonderful exorcistic interpretation, Mirren is the only reason to watch this movie. A solid 3.0.
