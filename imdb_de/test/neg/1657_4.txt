Very slow, boring, enigmatic film. MAybe would be the film that Jean-Luc Godard would have made if he had been Italian. Certainly it conveys how boring, repetitive, joyless and empty a person's life can be, but I usually do not go to the cinema to find out! The act (as it is) does not convince. Why a beautiful hotel reception (an exception to the movie's stupidity) is the least bit interested in a moody, chain-smoking, silent loner who speaks in "deep" aphorisms. Very hard to feel sorry for the main character. It feels as if you shake him by the neck and tell him to "snap out"! His brother is much more human. The end is not conclusive and puzzling. Everyone in the movie theater (when I saw the movie) mumbled that he was almost asleep. Of course it should not be a Hollywood Bruce Willis style, the "Shhot-em-Up" and "Crash-Bang" -festa, but a bit of energy and action would have made it more exciting. One of the best Italian films ever? Pleease ... An art house, curiosity at best.
