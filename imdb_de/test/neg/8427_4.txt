I sat last night to see how this movie is being played on Greek television because of the upcoming Olympics being held in my city. Knowing it was an American movie, I had already expected him to be more focused on American athletics history. But what I saw was ... too much! I mean, if a movie has such a title ("First Olympiad: Athens 1896"), even if it's of American origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandistic and so on at the same time, ignorant of athletes and others' efforts Countries. The American athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, wisdom, generosity, kindness, courtesy ...) unlike their "sin athletes" in games who seemingly are not even able to express their thoughts or feelings express. The frequency with which the American anthem is played during the film must be an all-time record in filmography. Malmalomania at its best! The Greek nation is being ridiculed, for example, by Greek citizens who serve the foreign marathon athletes with wine to help the local athlete win the race. So much for the Olympic spirit. <br /> <br /> Think about it and a movie whose title is also Greek, to give a bad sign, is something that does not make me happy at all. But after what I've seen, I can not stand it anymore than 4 out of 10 (actually pretty generous).
