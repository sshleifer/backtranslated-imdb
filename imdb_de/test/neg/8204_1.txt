This distinction must go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt to make a high-quality science-fiction film had the dubious "star" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell, and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities. What could have been an interesting and exciting conspiracy against a downtrodden aristocrat in a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, from the harsh dialogue and monotonic action of amateurs whose lines lead like lead weights into a sea of Stupidity sinking, devastated. The "special effects" that took place in someone's bathtub darken this movie in addition to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted by an individual in its final stages contradicts the conspiracy that the aristocrat Fallon and his wife, Cassandra, are suffering the disease and end up as the original inhabitants of Castle De Sade, leading to madness and inhumanity Cruelty are doomed. It is interesting to note that no member of the cast has made another film. No wonder, talent brings talent; Lack of talent creates oblivion, and here this film should find a regrettable ending.
