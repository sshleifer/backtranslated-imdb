The title comes from a biblical passage (Deuteronomy 28:28). Let's just say, it's terribly out of context - but still, the title of this tormenting movie originated. The other reviewers handle the details of the plot so I will not reuse them. The husband, a psychiatrist, gives a lecture on "Inferior Functions," in which he discusses how a person can meet another person, and that in their lives they can experience a "catastrophic crisis" in which they stop, even master to become and are incapable of fair judgment. He says that exactly on the podium when he sees Leonora Vail in the audience - the woman who will become his lover. Not very subtle to show that this will actually happen to the poor man. <br /> <br /> I think the whole premise of the film is not plausible and just did not work. Here's an over-the-top psychiatrist, and we're supposed to believe that this young, beautiful woman falls into him and falls between the happiness he and his wife shared. Even more implausible is how the betrayed woman reacts when she learns of the unfaithfulness. Not only is she understanding, she is also INAUGURATING that her husband is going on a multi-month holiday with the Trample - "so that we can all recover a bit from this unbearable stress". GIVE ME A BREAK!! I wanted to reach through the screen and strangle not only the adulterer, but also the woman with the weak wit. <br /> <br /> The fact that the entire movie takes place as a flashback already shows the end of the film at the beginning (the fact that the husband had a terrible accident) - it leaves no doubt about the outcome of the filthy affair , I think that was a bad decision, as there are absolutely no twists to look forward to, as the entire movie is completely predictable. You already know that at the beginning of the film, the woman resisted the matter when she called the mistress to the dying man's bed and expressed no evil will. <br /> <br /> Not only the script is broken, but Noel The Coward is a terrible failure (though it's HIS script). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the canvas. It is interesting that Michael Redgrave was originally cast in this role, but was replaced during the filming. I wonder what it was about. In the end, neither the husband nor the wife made you feel sorry for them either. I think Margaret Leighton played the role of the Strumpet pretty well. But she could not possibly overcome all the negatives of this film. As in many British productions of this era, the dialogue is difficult to understand due to the cut-off, fast language pattern of the actors. I saw it on TV and could not even rely on subtitles to fill in the blanks for me. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with it.
