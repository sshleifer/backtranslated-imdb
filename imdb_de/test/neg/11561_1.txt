Robot Holocaust is about the most annoying and pathetic attempt to make a post-apocalyptic film I've ever seen. And I thought the Italians were the masters of miserable Mad Max wannabees. Some of these movies like Escape 2000 are positively brilliant compared to this piece of Poo. The story is nonsense? even with a narrator setting up every scene. And the boy pulls it. Scene by scene in which nothing interesting happens. The special effects (and I use the word "special" loose) consist of sock puppets. Yes that's right ?? Sock puppets! Acting is miserable. Angelika Jager is in the race for the worst performance I have ever seen. Sure, she is French or German or whatever? but man is she bad. I can not imagine anything positive about the movie. I'll stop there because ten sets for this garbage are about ten to many. However, and fortunately for me, I have seen the MST3K version of Robot Holocaust. Some of the things that made the movie so bad made this MST3K episode a winner. For an episode of the first season, the riffs come quickly and furiously and almost always mark their destination. On my MST3K rating scale, I give this episode 4/5 ?? Seek it out
