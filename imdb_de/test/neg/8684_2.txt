This film was a completely yawning feast that took forever, but never really did. It was just boring to watch so much that I could never really make it. This movie is not a horror movie with a fantasy, the cover of the videotape made it one. Instead, it's a thriller movie with some elements of horror that make the movie more interesting. Of course, this movie does not help at all. Mostly, I just remember that this movie is a 1970s movie called "The Deep". Bundle looking for treasures, rival groups of this kind of thing. There are also supernatural twists, but to tell the truth, I was so bored when I saw this movie that I'm somehow numbered, so I can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were. I somehow remember footprints on the ocean floor, so maybe it was a kind of dead gang, or I think of Lucio Fulcio's "Zombie" movie, as if it were a horror movie playing on a tropical island as fancy as this one was more entertaining than this movie. That day we learned a valuable lesson and never rented a movie because of its cover art.
