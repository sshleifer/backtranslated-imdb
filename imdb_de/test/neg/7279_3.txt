This film was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive comments from this site, I bought a copy of the movie from Ebay. The acting in the film is average and a bit malicious, especially among the cannibal family. A sequence comes to my mind when Jupiter chats in front of the burned corpse and speaks directly into the camera. It's one of those performances that scares you and makes you feel bad for the poor actor. It's also a testament to some of the worst edits I've ever seen. There was a terrible leap in the middle of his "speech". But there are a few scary moments, and sometimes the music works well ... but overall, the movie is not great and I do not know why people think Wes Craven is such a great director. So far, he has not shown me anything that I think is brilliant. The only thing that has improved with Craven's films, the production to production was his budget.
