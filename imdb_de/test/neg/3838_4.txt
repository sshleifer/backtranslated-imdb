I thought choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better movie. It had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed somehow pointless. When the background to the two main characters was shown, part of it really seemed to go awry. Most of it was somehow useless and did not help the movie at all. This was not the best hour of Dennis Hopper. However, the main salvation for this film was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this movie, he makes Mr. Blonde look almost like a nice guy. All in all, it was observable. Nevertheless, I thought that some things could be done differently. These things would have significantly improved the movie in my opinion.
