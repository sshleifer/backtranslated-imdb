I suppose I should take something with a grain of salt. These lab films (and yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab) always fail in one dimension: it is understood that individual people fooling around have discovered secrets that go beyond the understanding of each human being. Of course, they pay a price because their experiment has the same deficiencies as Dr. Frankenstein. There is always something they did not expect. There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover-ups that do not work here. The young woman picks up safely and the doctor can not help himself, but he could have been a bit discreet or even tried to protect what he did. Things go awry, and because of this intellect, it gains tremendous power, including understanding how it came into being. Rock Hudson looks pretty fit here. In this role, however, he never quite succeeds. It wanders everywhere with many clich√©s and stupidities, which reduces the basic problem. As soon as she can take revenge, it would be best for her to go away and allow her to track her down and destroy her in a big way.
