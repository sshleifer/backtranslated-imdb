This movie was bad, but it was so bad that he could reach cult status in the distant future. A kind of film noir meets Plan 9 from space. The story was good, there really was no story. There is a place for the Ed Woods and Russ Meyers of the world, and this movie proves it. "It can be so bad," is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt if this movie will be picked up by a legitimate distribution company. Therefore, it is unlikely that a broad release will be seen. I'll add that I'm expecting more actor Ron Carey. He made the most of what he had. The rest of the acting, if I can call it that, was pretty much forgotten. I have seen worse studios with big budgets.
