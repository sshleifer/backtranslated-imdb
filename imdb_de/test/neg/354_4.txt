They would hardly know that MGM brought Norma Shearer into THE DIVORCEE a year later, which shines with MGM's technical know-how. How far had they come in a year? CHENEY is an early talkie. The camera barely moves. Shearer is her usual charming self and Rathbone plays a romantic lead role. They are all very intent on talking slowly and clearly into the microphone source, which softens up against a naturally flowing dramatic scene, but the game is a sturdy and entertaining war horse, so you can have fun if the expectations are not too high. By the way, the conspiracy is a ring of high-end thieves who invade society and capture their victims. There are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers everything. An Oscar nomination for the best script adaptation.
