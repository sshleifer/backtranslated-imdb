A few clarifying comments are fine. Herschell Gordon Lewis gave a brief introduction to the video release of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), in which he described his collaboration with J.G. "Pat" Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson has put together the "Gore effects" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and several other Lewis films of the late 1960s. Lewis notes that 2,000 MANIACS was a five-gallon film (based on the amount of stage blood needed), the Lewis Patterson productions "15 gallon" images. Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a "fifteen gallon" movie - he talks only about the films he and Patterson have made together. Lewis has confessed (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE was improvised before he even saw Patterson's movie! So take it with a salt of salt. <br /> <br /> This may be an "unfinished" movie, but like some unfinished novels it has an "end". It only lacks some connective tissue. <br /> <br /> Patterson has a clear stage presence and a dry sense of humor, which helps make this simplistic show a bit more visible than it should be. There is an extremely bare plot - even BLOOD FEAST is more complex - and a repeating music by William Girdler. A bit of nudity and a lot of skin. The entire middle section of the film includes the construction of a "perfect woman"; This is concentrated blood for bloodthirsty and laughing. <br /> <br /> Patterson, the director, is upside down, but strives to tell his story creatively when it's possible to use Frankenstein clich√©s creatively. But the best reason to watch this movie (on Something Weirds DVD, if possible) is the perfect Nashville trill, Bill Hick's "A heart dies every minute". Is not it the truth!
