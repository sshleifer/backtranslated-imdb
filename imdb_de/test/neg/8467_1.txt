It was brought to you by the following people: <br /> <br /> 1- Yigal Carmon (Hebrew יגאל כרמון) is the President and Founder of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) Career: <br /> <br /> Colonel, Israeli Army Intelligence from 1968 to 1988 Deputy Head and Advisor for Arab Affairs, Civil Administration in Judea and Samaria, 1977-1982 2- Raphael Shore is an Israeli-Canadian film author, producer and rabbi, full-time Aish HaTorah was employed. He is the founder of The Clarion Fund, a non-profit organization that seeks to promote the idea that the United States is threatened by radical Islam. Shore is also a regular critic of media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The reporting is reportedly anti-Israeli on a regular basis. (LMAO) <br /> <br /> 3 - Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Funny how ADL supports this heinous propaganda. You can never read it by reading the name "anti-defamation". <br /> <br /> Use your mind and see how purposeful these individuals are. They have their own agenda! <br /> <br /> I think so I am.
