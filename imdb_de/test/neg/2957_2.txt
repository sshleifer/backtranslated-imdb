This movie is way too long. I lost about an hour in history. Saratoga Trunk tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, a child of a prominent New Orleans man and his lover. After her mother died in Paris, Bergman returns to New Orleans to scandalize and blackmail her father's "legitimate" family. She meets Gary Cooper, who also seeks revenge on the railroad magnate who cheated his father out of his country in Texas. She draws him into her plans, and the film reaches its climax in a Saratoga resort. Long and boring, but worth seeing if you're a Bergman or Cooper fan. The dwarf Cupidon is the only bright spot in this spiraling story.
