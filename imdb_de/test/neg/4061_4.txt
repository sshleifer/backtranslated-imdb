As a massive DM fan, I've often seen this movie, of course. But I just look at it for the concert material ... the rest of the movie is um, pretty awful, sad to say. <br /> <br /> The famous director of rock music, DA Pennebaker, followed fashion on their late 80s Music For The Masses tour, which advertised the eponymous excellent album. The title 101 derives mainly from the fact that the included concert material from the 101st and last concert of the tour in the Pasadena Bowl comes, but is also an indication that the film is a "beginner's course" for the band and how it ticking Depeche Mode 101. In the middle of the quartet's footage, which plays live and explores America, is a second story thread that describes a group of DM fans who have won a contest to meet the band in their own tour bus to go and participate in the final gig <br /> <br /> Well, as I said, the concert material is great. Fashion is in the foreground as stadium rock gods, which was an unusual achievement for an electro rock band in the late '80s. Although the film captures the band before recording their 1990s masterpiece "Violator", there are still countless outstanding pieces to be heard and heard here, such as Behind The Wheel, the majestic Never Let Me Down, everything counts, it's easy not enough of them get Vince Clarke years, Shake The Disease and many more. <br /> <br /> When fashion is on stage, they are brilliant. If not, they are very boring. The boys do not find anything out of the ordinary as they check out the US in the last days of the Reagan administration. The likely "highlight" of the material is, for example, a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. Not exciting stuff. I know that all bands do not have to be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir look like Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only real excitement comes from various clips that focus on singer Dave the band Gahan Gahan appears as mildly psychotic 101, he speaks of a violent power inside him that he can not control, and remembers a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. There's a point in the movie where he throws a poor guy behind the scenes with a prima donna tantrum - really embarrassing. The man clearly had problems at the time, which thankfully were solved. Songwriter Martin Gore and keyboarder Andy Fletcher are presented as very articulate, clearly enormously talented, but also totally colorless men. The somewhat enigmatic fourth member Alan Wilder is the only member of the quartet that demolishes the rock star personality with any kind of sovereignty. <br /> <br /> And as for the 'Fan Tour' thread, it's unsurpassed slags. Let's not fool ourselves. Maybe it's just because it's all so much in the late '80s, but the babble of young devotees does little to me, but it creates a sense of irritation. For a human, they are uniquely flat and vapid, whose antics are banal if they are not hiding. Let me repeat again ... * nothing * happens in footage that is not on stage and of interest. Nothing. Endless scenes of children spraying their hair, arguing senselessly, changing clothes, getting lost in cities on the way to appearances, and finding their partners in bed with another winner make me realize only one thing - whether Cure fans throw that spirit back I can definitely relate the love the adolescents have for the band and is sometimes contagiously happy, but if what we see is the most interesting stuff from what they filmed , then I would hate to see the outtakes. <br /> <br /> But the music is all that matters, and in that respect it surpasses 101. The Pasadena concert, one of her best gigs ever, makes the movie worth seeing. The current DVD edition of the film comes with a bonus CD containing the rest of the unprocessed concert material (more than 80% of the performance). Thus, the DVD is an absolute must for fans. The band's audio commentary (minus Wilder, who left fashion in the mid 90's) on the first CD is, strangely, far more interesting than the movie itself. As a documentary the boys Depeche Mode 101 from Basildon during his time as an amphitheater idol is priceless Value. However, if you're looking for excitement, you'd better get the associated double live album (now in Super Audio CD format).
