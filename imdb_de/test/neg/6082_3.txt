The movie was awful. The production company should be forced to pay a fine to waste electricity that transmits this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The property had too many holes. Why should the DOJ send a killer to assassinate a world leader? If they were not the DOJ, why would they send someone they thought would not do the job? To quote Butch Cassidy, "Who are these guys?" Apparently the director does not know because he never told us. <br /> <br /> The characters were amazing. They did not behave as it seemed who they were supposed to be. With the exception of the doctor, none of the characters were particularly captivating or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste money on the power needed for the movie, feel free. Otherwise, do the opposite direction.
