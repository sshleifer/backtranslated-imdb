When I saw one, when I saw George Romero's Creepshow, then, when someone has come across a mysterious old box that obviously has put a lot of effort into hiding, just leave it alone: There's probably something unpleasant inside. Of course, Professor Gordon Crowley, Robert Englund's character in "Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer," is not a fan of Romero because he opens the old wooden box he buried in his garden just to discover it ? "Surprise, Surprise", an ancient demon that owns his body (initially causing him to eat and vomit quite a bit). <br /> <br /> When the demon finally breaks out of Crowley's body during chemistry classes and begins to turn students into hellish, meat-rending beasts, it's up to Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to stop the lazy creatures that are just using them armed with a pipe and fueled by a lifelong hatred for everything monstrous! <br /> <br /> The DVD packaging for Jon Knautz's low-budget monster movie promises hell is a fun ride that offers cheesy thrills and treats that you'd expect from an average creature of the '80s Guys, rubber monster suits, cruel bloody and absolutely no CGI!) And in the last 15 minutes. That's exactly what viewers get: non-stop splattery effects; a silly tented demon thing in the Jabba style; and mucho macho monster mashing! <br /> <br /> So it's a pity the rest of the movie takes 70 minutes, mostly after Jack, when he gets bored. Everyday business: plumbing, visiting his shrink, attending chemistry lessons and having trouble with his girlfriend. If you think you can enjoy a movie that deals primarily with dealing with childhood traumas and annoyances, buying replacement boiler valves in a hardware store, and the chemical properties of sodium, this is the film for you. However, if you are looking for a huge dose of monster chaos then I would advise you to look elsewhere!
