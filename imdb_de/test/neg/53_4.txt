I do not get it The teenage stars in "Horror Star" are supposedly all avid horror fans, but when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) dies, they dig his body and do all sorts of irreverent things, like disco dancing in the house and Throw food scraps on it. That does not sound like what real horror fans would do, now? I'm a big horror fanatic and I adore enormously deceased icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never occur to me to mock their memory. No wonder Conrad is coming back from the dead? Granted, after a session? to wipe them all off the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff was not known for his kindness in life because he occasionally killed the directors who did not agree with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from an enormous ego. Even in his grave there are video messages to petrify potential visitors, and the group of teenagers will vividly learn that he also enjoys the murder business outside of the movie set. "Horror Star" (aka "Frightmare" and "Body Snatchers") is a rather lame horror movie of the 80s, but there are a handful of cheesy & gory highlights that you can enjoy. The film suffers mainly from its own stupid act, since nobody? not even a film student? is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and really believe he could get away with it, and there are too many boring moments to fight through. Conrad's video-speeches from outside the tomb are overly talkative and definitely undermine the suspense, but on the other hand his killing methods are gratifyingly resourceful. One teenager enjoys the experience of being burned alive alive, and another (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) Loses his head in a delightful beheading sequence. In the most chaotic order, a poor girl's head is crushed by a casket. The writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to pay tribute to the vintage horror movie and obviously make the movie look scary. The locations and landscapes are great, but Vane did not have the money to give his film adequate continuity and editing. The acting performances are overall decent, with Ferdy Mayne (mimicking Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs delivering the most memorable roles. "Horror Star" can hardly be described as a must-have or even as a good movie, but it's worth tracking if you're an avid B-horror.
