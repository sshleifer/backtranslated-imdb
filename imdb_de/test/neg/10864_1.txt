This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I've recently seen Starship Troopers 2 !!!). I could not find anything to save this movie. Acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen plays it in his standard characteristic. Denis Hopper does not seem to know what he's supposed to be. The accent of Vinnie Jones is bizarre. On the positive side, Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her acting is pretty bad, but I doubt she's there for that. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is really horrible. It's just garbage. I do not know who signed up for it, but next time they really need professional help. <br /> <br /> This movie is why the IMDBs rating system should include zero out of ten stars. Avoid at all costs.
