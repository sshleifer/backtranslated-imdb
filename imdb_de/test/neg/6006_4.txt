This movie was really bad. I went to the theater and expected something exciting. Instead, I got the opportunity to guess my abilities. Seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even the thrill was met with such a total suspension of belief that it really was not much too much. <br /> <br /> The excessive wisdom and the conversation of the police at the crime scenes made everything appear more fake. And the scene in which Lambert's character grapples with the clues and reaches his "investigative Epiphany" is very anxious to show the audience's expected intellectual level - little The cinematography was the "X-Files" treatment: every building in the movie, whether the station building or a house at noon or a hospital, suffers from a lack of recognizable lighting (not to mention patient deficiency) 'in the case of the hospital). I do not remember a single scene when someone pressed a light switch. It would have been nice. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert is not really an Oscar-winning actor, so I assume you have to take this movie as it is worth. In the end, I came to the conclusion that the only thing that makes this movie more entertaining is to watch it after "The Warriors". Otherwise there will be an effort that is boring and unoriginal and far from equal in movies like Silence of the Lambs.
