Blame Guy Ritchie. The success of Ritchie in the late '90s, when Ritchie clichés were played with his clichéd Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, triggered a series of pathetic gangster films that never really recovered from the genre. Unfortunately, Rise of The Footsoldier - the true story of Essex-Hardnut Carlton Leach - is not likely to reverse this trend. Despite a decent lead performance by Hartnett, the film falls victim to well-known East End stereotypes. They are either busy blowing someone's brain off or fucking a lightly dressed blonde. <br /> <br /> From fearsome football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld of the nineties: Footsoldier charts Leach soars through the world ranks of brawls. Leaving the terraces for nightclubs, Leach becomes a bouncer where he gave Carte Blanche to elicit shit from everyone. Here he comes into play with the infamous Gangland leaders Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone) and begins to realize that gang warfare is not what matters. <br /> <br /> It was fun to be deconstructing writer-director Julian Gilbey's ridiculous join-the-dots yob patois as each set begins with one, "I'll fackin '??" or "you fackin '??" or occasionally: "Then I just did a 'Fackin', usually with a mandatory 'Caaaant!' The direction also smells of sadism, especially the obvious joy that Gilbey achieves by shooting violent scenes in close-up and, in the case of the bloody shotgun, in triplicate. <br /> <br /> Director Gilbey's use of the classic up-and-down gangster narrative is not what makes Footsoldier condemn to delusion on big screens, nor is it the fact that halfway the movie annoys Leach in favor of the events that took place in Tate's and notorious filming It's Gilbey's miserable appetite for blasting power that ruins the film, whether it's a stone on the face or an ax in the head during a vicious attack on a train, all is unnecessarily tedious Footsoldier does not hit as hard as if You feel hurt, and more importantly, it robs you of two hours of your life that you can not get back ...
