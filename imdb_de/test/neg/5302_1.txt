Although I think the reviewers who hated this movie encapsulated what they did wrong (everything!), I had to add my two cents. If you want a long version of how awful this movie is, please read the review by Coinlightning. <br /> <br /> Here's the short version: shameless use of the actor's NAMES to advance the storyline your talent (no one brought her "One Game"), blatant commercialization (I think Pepsi can afford it, an advertisement - or 40 - now in a movie) and a conspiracy (???) that was so confused "rock star" stereotypes that it was totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me put it that way. , , I thought about 'Wayne's World' the whole time I saw this movie, but I did not laugh! Every time you try to include Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) in your movie, you are in serious trouble. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, warn your friends and family - this movie is shit.
