I just caught "Farewell to the King" on cable, and maybe it's just that I'm a girl, but I thought that was on the craptastic side. The script and manual are presumptuous (when I found out that John Milius was in charge, everything became clear). The supporting actors were not bad at all - James Fox was outstanding. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, whom I usually enjoy. Once he's at home, he speaks a very stiff, stiff English, and half the time he seems to be distracted, as if he had just smoked some of the bounty of Borneo's rainforest. And then the end - what is that ??? Learoyd happens to be on the same boat as The Botanist (by the way, had the botanist dumped the girlfriend, or what?) ??? The boat runs randomly and close to a rogue takeover of an island by a crazy Anglo-Ex-Headhunting Army deserter?
