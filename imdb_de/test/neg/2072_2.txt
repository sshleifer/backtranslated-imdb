Another sophisticated movie by Vicente Aranda. If "Juana la loca" looked the same, its quality was at least superior (mainly thanks to the great performance of Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala), but "Carmen" is boring and full of themes (passionate brunette with a dagger in stocking, poor man of passion to Madness dragged, Sierra Nevada gangs, "toreros", ...) <br /> <br /> Obviously, Paz Vega is a pretty woman, but about her talent there is more doubt and Sbaraglia's role is so stupid that the result almost unbelievable. The script is weak and Aranda's presumptuous character influences the entire movie. With these ingredients, the result could not be good. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but in my opinion a complete failure.
