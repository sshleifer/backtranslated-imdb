This was shown on a premium channel, so I did not know it was made for television. Still, I like a few movies during my lifetime (lifestyle here in the UK), but that was terrible. The family was so cheesy, "Love you mother" "Love you even more sweetheart" Then, after they had broken in for the second time, 10 minutes later, they were back, "Love you mother", big smile etc. She calls her husband and tells him not to come home. You were only broken in by a man who wanted you to be dead, have a nutty neighbor, who needs help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not long) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> As a comedy I would give her a good 7 times I have her around. Could be fun after a bottle of vodka or 10!
