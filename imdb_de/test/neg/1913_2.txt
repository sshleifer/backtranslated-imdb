I recently rented this movie because I love love stories, but this was the worst I've ever seen in my life. It's hard to believe that Sam would fall in love with Kelley after saying little more than two words when she has a great longtime friend who gives herself to her completely. I thought that Kelley was a big jerk throughout the movie, and he never changed. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought he did a wonderful acting job and I'll see more of his films.
