Drifter guy returns to his hometown (?), Meets with old friends etc ... the usual annoying child, single mother, local bigmouth and so on director see "close encounters"?). Good actors? Good story? Good camera angles? Good cut Not here! Do not rent, unless you share the costs and have plenty of beer at hand. Do not watch TV, but drink a lot of beer - you will enjoy it more!
