The loot has an interesting story. Unless you remember the advertisements in the newspapers in June 1984, you might have caught them on the movie channel in the summer of '85, but otherwise little is remembered. The plot is again your basic killer in the forest. Ironically, however, this was filmed before Friday, the 13th. The loot was actually shot in 1978 by one of the actors in an interview. But released for about a week on some drive-ins (Yes, Jim, Namans-Drive-In showed this in June 84). But it has a dated look on it. Maybe they later released it to pay for all the other terror movies that flooded the market until 1984. Now the story has a kind of backstory, a forest fire in the 1940s leaves many gypsies burned to death. But one of her children survives (our monster), so that today's day 1978 has evolved. We have an older middle-aged couple who is only sent by the monster. The tagline for this image claims to get ITS NOT MUMAN AND ITS A AX, but an ax was only used in these first two murders. Now we have a group of teenagers who look like they are in their mid-twenties camping. We all know they are the prey, and the monster beats them one at a time. For an 80-minute movie, it seems to be longer. We also have a lot of wildlife material to fill in the cavities for the 80 minutes. Overall, it looks like you're in a horror movie of the 80s on the road. Hey the Prey has the potential to be a good horror killer in the forest, but falls short. It does, however, contain a rather scary, cool-looking monster at the end, and we have to wait until the last 2 minutes to see it. Incidentally, the monster played in the 1990s in the Addams family.
