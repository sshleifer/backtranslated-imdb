My roommate and I have another friend working on a local blockbuster video. He finds really horrible films for us and tells us about it. One of them was a "Christmas horror" movie starring former wrestler Bill Goldberg as killer Satna Claus. We did not look at it immediately, but we did not think there could be anything worse. Apparently we were wrong. We showed this Slasher movie starring Ken Shamrock in the lead role of a murderous scarecrow. At first we thought Ken would be the killer scarecrow and that's why we wanted to watch, but he was not and that made the movie even worse. What absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama. If you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape, you should never see this movie.
