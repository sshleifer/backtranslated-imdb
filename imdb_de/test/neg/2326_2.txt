I bought the video for Â£ 13 at HMV (we pay more in the UK) because a friend had told me it was rated high and the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the opening credits were a disappointment ... the dancing / music was not very powerful. <br /> <br /> The car ride and the unexpected crash when the passenger was about to be injured was a nice touch ... something unexpected ... though the way she walked out of the car with perfectly groomed hair and always still wore a handbag for which most of the directors looked crazy. But for Lynch was something else. The shock was amplified by a regular, low noise similar to the fingers along a board. I thought another lynch master might touch the demons gnawing at their defeated and traumatized self-esteem. After a while, this noise was a bit annoying and further investigation, I discovered that the new video cassette squeaked. I do not know if this squeaking gives me much pleasure, but this movie was a waste of time. (and money) <br /> <br /> The two female characters were present and the lesbian scenes were fair, if predictable. There were no male characters of value and apart from a few vaguely good scenes (turning on the vacuum cleaner), there were far too many horrible scenes that were just weak and ridiculous. For example, the coffee from the menacing Loon and the stupid monster face spit into the napkin at the back of the restaurant. Oh, and what about the color in the wifes gems..boill and naff. <br /> <br /> This whole movie gives you the feeling of a failed genius..you know when you hear the worst Dylan track and thinks my god, that was embarrassing ... was that really Bob? <br /> <br /> The whole feeling is that of a failed television movie that was badly put together with a few (not many) extra bits to give it a 15 rating. <br /> <br /> I burned it in the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Give me another chance and look again. If I'm confused and want to work hard to understand a movie, I look at Frank Wood's Guide to Consolidated Accounting. <br /> <br /> Lynch has a classic. Blue Velvet and Straight Story were nice. <br /> <That was like Wild at Heart a failure; His madness is now predictable and stale. Everyone wants to buy a second-hand video? <br /> <br /> Make room for a younger original talent, David. Four out of ten (and not more). We are sorry.
