Quentin Tarantino's partner in crime Roger Avary (co-writer on "Pulp Fiction") ventures on his own for this overcrowded French thriller (this time with QT). <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is Zed, the top-notch safe cracker who came to France at the request of an old friend from the US. There he works with a motley crew of well-traveled hippies who, with little or no planning, believe they could shoot down a bank vault full of gold bars on a French national holiday. Avary overhauled that A robbery is a wrong topic that Tarantino has so well developed in "Reservoir Dogs". Only "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive on this power alone. Avary has a pretty nice distraction. Julie Delpy is Zoe, a student called Callgirl, who entertains Zed on his arrival in Paris. Surely she is an overwhelming distraction, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> I guess our director wanted to give this basic theme a different perspective, but unfortunately the move did not help to add the depth of his flat plot so desperately needed. There has never been a story in this idea that was nothing more than an idea. Even the surreal journey into the dodgy dives of Paris is unimaginative. I think you'd have to admit that there's never been a big movie in history where a few gangsters shell out at each other over a botched jewelry raid, that is, until you add complicated characters and connect dialogues. "Reservoir Dogs" did not have it, "Killing Zoe" did not. <br /> <br /> Stoltz's strong interpretation of the dubious Zed and Jean Hughes-Anglades crazy depiction of the obsessive ringleader did nothing to reverse the process. In short, Avary has been trying unsuccessfully to create entertainment out of nothing. Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
