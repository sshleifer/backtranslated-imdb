Sure, I like some indie movies. Very much. I do not always understand them and that's okay. Not all of them should be understood, especially by mainstream people like me. I probably show my ignorance, but I'm still confused why the Book of Revelation is so called. I love these doomsday stories and the only thing I could see like the end of the world, and this movie was the torture it took to get through it. I'm not talking about the topic; Maybe I've been subjected to all the other torture / porn I've seen. It was just the incredibly slow story, one hour and fifteen minutes of footage stretched for nearly two hours. (Big spoilers lie in front of him) The hetero-man dancer is kidnapped, seduced and raped in six ways on Sunday, or 12 days in this case, by three undercover women. After his release, after his slightly confused dancer has hesitated a bit (except to drop a glass), she wonders what she misses more: him or the cigarettes she had originally sent after kidnapping. He is still in a reasonable state of shock and refuses to speak, and she continues to work without a hug as if nothing had happened, and he takes a good shower. Problem. As much as he is tormented by the flashbacks to his "attacks", he is just as excited. Granted, I was not tied and used as a toy, but I doubt I would really be in the mood. Oh, I forgot and how does he try to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as you can to spot the moles or babble of criminals. I see where they are going? show a gang rape from the male POV. Fine, despite the twist, you could never feel for this guy. The only salvation was the good acting of the LifetimeTV dancer / cancer teacher. But even she could not save the movie.
