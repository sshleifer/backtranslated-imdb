Seriously, all these Satan films go down to earth and always involve the Catholics. Why does not Lucifer make out the other terms? <br /> <br /> The plot states that Asmodeus (played by the former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has an act to become human (but he was not always a demon) by having this young girl, his sister is pregnant with his child. Except maybe she is not his sister. The plot is not clear, and they connect those scenes where he sees a problem. <br /> <br /> The main girl becomes pregnant, even though she is still a virgin, with an incredibly scary scene. Her father, who gives her a gynecological exam to prove that she is proving her hymen, is still intact. ... Eeeewwwwww. Her sister (played by a washed-up and much worse-looking Denise Crosby) concludes that this is a sign of heaven. Praise be! <br /> <br /> Well, the demon baby takes Mama's body for a ride and drives off to make a truck driver, her friend's boyfriend and her boyfriend, all are watched by a former military priest who is his mission Kill baby when it's born. We discover that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic Cardinal who leads the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The end is pretty incomprehensible, and if you could pull it that far, you have a stronger belly than me. (I stopped the movie a couple of times, it was so awful.)
