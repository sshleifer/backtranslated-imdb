HANA-BI has a lot of quiet moments and a pretty slow pace. Unfortunately, the viewer has to contemplate the last scenes that have just been watched during the many thoughtful interludes, and many questions arise and annoy. <br /> <br /> Why, for example, the wheelchair user did not drown in the sea when he got stuck in the sand and the tide came around him? No rescue was seen or implied. <br /> <br /> Can it be true that the Japanese police are so incapable and unqualified in the arrest process that they do not first remove the suspect's ability to reach for a weapon? This detectives-level Japanese police seemed to have no experience with a suspect. <br /> <br /> Why is not the main character's right eye squinting? One eye blink was distracting and it was not cleared up. <br /> <br /> What exactly was the main character who spent all his money borrowing so much from loan sharks? He was not seen playing. As a non-government employee in the entry level, his wife must have full health insurance. What was the single man doing alone in nowhere in the nature park? What was his reason to be there? <br /> <br /> How on earth could the gangsters find the main character and his wife in the far-away nature reserve? It did not make sense. <br /> <br /> And how could the gangsters later find the main character and his wife in the remote mountain. Fuji Resort? There was absolutely no clue to these gangsters to even know which country the main character and his wife were in, not to mention the right place at the right time! <br /> <br /> And a third question, how could the young detectives know at which feet of the Japanese coast the main character and his wife can be found? The Japanese coastline has to be big. Did all these characters have psychic powers? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: The cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach - where did she come from? She did not seem to have a transport or companion with her. And why on earth did she still try to fly what was left of her dragon after it was torn to pieces ?! That was weird. Unintentionally Python-like. <br /> <br /> Positive was the background music. It was dramatic and flowing and added a lot to this movie. Photography, imagery and art were pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> In the end, the woman was overly enjoyable for the eye. Not once did she approach a dying patient. She looked very healthy. If anything, these people seemed to be depressed and mentally ill and not physically ill. The husband treated his wife as if a recent gay man were treating a respected wife ... a friendship but no tenderness. <br /> <br /> A mixed movie in any case.
