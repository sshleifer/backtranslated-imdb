I thought this movie was alright. <br /> <br /> On paper, this movie has everything a human wants! Romance, comedy, drama. A bank robbery, a unique cast, great music and storytelling! <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie ended up mostly in garbage, and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> a) That's my biggest problem: the editing. This movie is by far the worst cut I've ever seen, except at local car dealers. The editing could have been done better if a deafening Parkinson's patient knocked on a dead cat on iMovie. There are scenes where two characters talk to each other and you can see how their lips are moving and the audio / video is out of sync, as it is clearly dubbed. Why was it synced? I dont know! His english synchronization english! The voices were played in a different studio in certain scenes! Could not you find a boom mic ?! They are not expensive. Jesus, even I own one! And I do not do movies! <br /> <br /> b) Andrew Keegan's performance leaves a lot to be desired. It did not really seem like he wanted to be part of this project, and his acting corresponded to a sketch by D.A.R.E. for students. At least John Krasinksi showed some enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason I rented this movie, and that's the only reason it's worth seeing. He showed a good, witty performance and he was the most three dimensional character. Dean Edwards's character was thin, as was her face. <br /> <br /> Final Word? If you are a fan of John Krasinski, this is worth your time. If not, do not bother. The editing
