This was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been selected to be a little more similar to the real people (not very difficult). Sissi did not go to Mayerling to see her dead son; she did not die on the street; They carried her to the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I am not sure about the wedding night, but I find it exaggerated that a waitress takes off the Empress and leaves her completely naked (and that in the 1850s) or that the Emperor would announce very proudly: "Yes, I finally lay down . " As far as I know, this was done on the first night, and no one rewarded her as if she were a street runner.The saving grace of the film is truly Stephane Audran, an excellent actress and characterful character.
