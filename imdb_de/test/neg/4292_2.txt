Great actors, good shooting, a potentially interesting plot and a good dialogue. Nothing else is good about this movie. Maybe the author or director believed they could make a movie of annoying characters as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> Within 10 minutes, I did not like Caroleen Feeney's portrayal of Kim so much that she became a distraction. Although Kim is supposed to be a disagreeable character, I'm not sure if I wanted to commit violent violence against her. The first (of many) bizarre things to happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) steals from "I miss $ 50.00" to "She has $ 50" in about 3 seconds. It was quite implausible since she (Kim) had no access to his wallet or was a master pickpocket - there was no reason to suspect her. Most people have lost / missed money and just assume that we lost it. The same applies to Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what I think, a look at real people. The character of Kim suffered at least from a BiPolar disorder. Wes had big shortcomings, Nancy was just boring and Matt was crazy (especially in terms of music). I've actually switched that off 2/3 of the way. However, to write a valid comment, I have forced myself to turn it back and hope that something will come together in this film. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make a point to miss it.
