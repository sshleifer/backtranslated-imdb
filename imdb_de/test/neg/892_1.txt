I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved her, but it was not funny at all. First, it can not be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play, right? This is shit and it was more of a black version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off than a house party movie. Who is John-John? These new characters can not even compare with those of the other three films I know why they have translated it directly into the video. It has terrible music, weak plot, untalented actors and no funny jokes. My advice, watch this movie only if you can not fall asleep Series after House Party 3, since Kid'n'Play broke up after that. I hate this movie. I'm glad my local video library does not have this movie and he never wants to buy it or see it on Comedy Central. Chris Strokes has talents managing an emerging R & B group, does not mean he has talent and produces movies. Am I right or what? After all, throughout most of the strip, the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two-dollar hookers. IMX parted one year after this streak was likely released due to the film's failure, and are almost forgotten these days. Simply put, this movie just sucks old !!!!
