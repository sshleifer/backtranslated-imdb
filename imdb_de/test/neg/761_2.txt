Bush seems to get a pretty free rein from these guys, as stupid and confused as he is. gore is a fair game, but please, what do the Republicans have to do with how bad they are To comb the land before these guys finally behave as if they might not only try to give the best they can, and that they really messed up everything ... or maybe just after the hectic Limbaugh ... hes a good target ... or just make fun of the gap teeth of Condoleeza Rice.
