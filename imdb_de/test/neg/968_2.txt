I do not understand jokes. I think that's my problem with modern cinema or movies made with millions of dollars in the hope that it will be the next sensation. Is not that strange? People just do not laugh so much anymore and I believe that one of the diseases of this problem is the movie "Showtime". There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all the jokes between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo as feast for the eyes, with self-usual clichés that fainted the population with pre-programmed laughter, nothing in this movie that made me feel like it Laughing brought. In this whole debacle of a movie, there were no pretentious physical jokes or calculated mental jokes. From the beginning, I have not bought De Niro and Murphy's match as anything more than Hollywood excitement. Throughout the commentary, the director talks animatedly about the hijinks and the laughter that take place during the shoot. where was it in the movie? That either falls on two problems ?? The director really does not feel like comedy or the editor did not understand the value of the movie. In any case, both were sentenced to the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime" for the full hour and a half. Except, no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters in every moment movie. There was a touch of humor with De Niro's desire to learn pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine so the audience would understand ... WHO IS THAT?), But that was dropped and never developed , There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside of this opening monologue nobody would have understood. He rents a room in a producer's house, where he can afford the salary of a police officer? This did not even charge for Hollywood standards. There was a villain who wanted a big gun, but the weapon was never developed, nor was there a real test of weapon capability? Even in the end. It was a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than to remember the guns. Where was the TV show? Russo had to get permission from this random guy in the beginning, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this movie except for further questions and pointless dribbling. Random characters were introduced, forgotten, reintroduced and forgotten. The director and producer laughed about it, while we, the thin spectator, have to suffer through jokes and cliché clichés. <br /> <br /> Was there a love interest in this movie? Was there a really scary villain who moved away from the comic duo to bring the real evil to the screen? Were there references from pop culture that did not go back to Robert De Niro? Was there a random chaos in this movie? Obviously, if you need answers to these questions, you will not find them in Showtime. The fact that I questioned this review question by question means that this sub-par (actually far below sub-sub-sub) did not quote or resemble anything that was of value to the film world. Sure, it had big names and a really decent explosion, but that did not have anything essential. It was almost as if the director before the shoot said that he wanted stereotypes but not regular stereotypes? go with the bad ones. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were monotonous and underdeveloped. This is even among the best "Buddy Cop" films. I like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this movie. Not even Shatner was able to save this movie, and he has also made a great effort. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not suggest this movie to anyone with a pulse. The commentary confirms the pathetic nature of the film only through obvious flaws, terrible jokes and creators who question the validity of their work. If creators can not stand behind "Showtime," why should we do that? I did not want a "deadly weapon" when I saw that, but I wanted something like that. I understand that there was some form of criticism of "reality TV" and the corrupt nature of the media, but this news did not come from the side. I think I saw that "media" left the theater first when I saw that. Shame has a heavy hand on this movie and I can not blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, Comedy was his middle name (see "Coming to America"), but he seems to have lost his lead lately. De Niro, of course, wants to get away from a picture that haunts him, but filming this kind will only throw him back. One of these films corresponds to a Scorsese image. <br /> <br /> Skip this. I promise you that your last movie days will be worthwhile. Oh, and if you laughed at one of the jokes in this movie? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Note: * from *****
