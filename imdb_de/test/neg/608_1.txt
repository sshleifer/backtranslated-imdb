This is a lame comedy. <br /> <br /> Here is the reason: A man and woman sitcom. OK. <br /> <br /> The husband is a shower bag. The wife is the Einstein. <br /> <br /> How original is that? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is exactly the same guy on Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> The gags are lame. No funny one-liners. <br /> <br /> I have enough. Stop that now. <br /> <br /> The last word: stupid. The destruction of the average white continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He just is not here. Leah Remini is a great eye candy, but unlikely. Wasted talent is the word. Bad sitcom.
