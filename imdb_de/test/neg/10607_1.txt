Pure crap, decent cinematography ... I like colors. Besides, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring, lifeless, not even I was interested in one of the characters. I've always been waiting for a real conspiracy and the movie to increase the tempo. Nothing ever happened! I think they've spent too much time on hair and wardrobe, forgetting that a movie was being filmed then.
