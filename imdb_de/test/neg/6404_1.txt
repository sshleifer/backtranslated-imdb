This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I did not have high expectations, but when it started, I thought it might be o-k. It was not Jim Carrey seemed to be trying, but he spoke all his lines as if he were a devilish cartoon character. The other actors all seem to be doing their best but are somehow made of wood. The plot has a good base, but the melodramatic lines make it boring and somehow stupid. I laughed throughout the second half of the movie, and after five minutes I was tired of it. Most of the actions "spins" could be seen from several kilometers away. It's just not worth watching. I really wish I had not wasted my time with it.
