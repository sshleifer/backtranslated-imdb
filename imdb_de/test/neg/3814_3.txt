I'm a hardcore horror / thriller fan ... when I was looking for a good horror movie to scare me on my weekend night. HATCHET..with an impressive BLOOD STAINED HATCHET movie poster that was added to the average ratings in IMDb ... but I was wrong after seeing this crap ... no characterization..sick dialogues, with great tits. I feel like watching porn. And the Substory, which is the so-called main theme or suspense of the story, SUCKS big time .... and here comes the CLOWN, who wears a funny mask to scare. .it earns 1 out of 10 i give 2 for nude tits babes n soundtrack has it ...
