I was fortunate enough to grow up surfing in San Diego (not the biggest waves in the world, but it was a damn childhood, I'll tell you) and I've seen a lot of so-called surfer-flicks in my life. Having just seen NORTH SHORE for the first time, all I can say is THANK YOU that I've never seen that as a kid. If I had seen that and mistakenly thought that this is a realistic representation of the surfing scene, I would sell my board and be completely into accounting or something like that, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the film has as much to do with real surfing as with TOP GUN a real military life. Acting is terrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is a bit weird at best and OH MY GOD, what did Laird Hanilton think ?! IMPRESSIVE!!! DO NOT SEE THIS FILM !!! IT SUCKS!!! If you want a REAL surf movie, read RIDING GIANTS. Hell, look at SURF'S UP. Serious. Sucks. Sucks bad sucks really bad. Brah. ;) <br /> <br /> PS: Did my summery version of "WTF?!" to wtf, because we seem to be whispering on this page. NO SHOUTING !!! (Shhhhhh!); D
