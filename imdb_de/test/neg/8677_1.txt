I doubt that anyone who wrote this script ever read Mansfield Park ... or if he does not. None of the characters is what they should be: Fanny is vivid and aware of her abuse, while Sir Thomas, who has treated her very well, accidentally fell into Aunt Norris's personality. Moreover, Fanny's first-person narration is extremely inappropriate for both the story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine and I would say she is not. In addition, Fanny flirts shamelessly with Edmund in the movie version from the beginning, when they were brought up as brother and sister! Austen's Fanny would have given way before any flirtation, and the novel paints the Fanny / Edmund couple as unpleasant ... as it should. Unlike some other Jane Austen novels (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist. It's a completely different kind of novel than the others; It should not be a love story. I saw this movie because I just read Mansfield Park, and I'm absolutely horrified by what I see. Miss Austen rolls in her grave.
