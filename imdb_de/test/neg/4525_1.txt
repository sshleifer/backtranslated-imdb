Another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays agent Maxwell Smart in a movie so bad that the worst movie you've ever seen is the second worst you've ever seen. The story with the seventh prize - if you can name it, a megalomaniac has conquered the world. It's so unsteady, it's absolutely pathetic. The only thing Anne Hathaway does as Agent 99 is to look good - she seems unable to do anything else. Bill Murray has the fine feeling of limiting his screen time to about 90 seconds, and some faces of the television series appear in very small roles. The film should be part of the thriller and part of the action movie. It is neither. Although I was not really a fan of the TV series, it was at least light years ahead of this piece of light. All we do is drag it through the mud and cheapen the good memories we had. Thankfully, Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it up Hollywood! Keep on doing shitty movies like this and send them to the multiplexes every week. No wonder the movie industry is going to its knees. This movie is so lazy he is not even good for laughing. If this movie was a newspaper, it could be used to change the floor of a birdcage. There is absolutely no reason to see this movie. A root canal is more fun than that! Rating - zero minus five stars. If you are not a masochist, stay away. Better yet, do what the title says - get smart and save your nine dollars. You can buy about 2 gallons of gas with it. Put it in your car and be thankful that you have not wasted seeing this bomb!
