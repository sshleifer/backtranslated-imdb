So I decided to take a look at the entire Puppet Master series, and had just looked at parts 1-3, which I considered excellent for ALL. They had a unique charm and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific pleasure and fun to look at. <br /> <br /> I knew from the beginning that there were problems. The cheesy, Egyptian Skull Skull in Power Rangers style, which watches the dolls in the style of Rita Repulsa through his pyramid glass, came directly from the left field! All the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly, we have a large selection of new and random characters and actions that are a long way from the first three movies. I seriously doubt that the authors, when the first puppet master was written, one day saw an Egyptian Power Rangers villain, totem monsters that annoyed twenty something that seriously can not act (and are supposedly brilliant scientists, but never say anything Intelligent) and a lame "Decapitron" doll, whose head can turn into the spirit of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Another thing that has really disappointed me in this movie is that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly the dolls are back at the Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (minus Blade), and Toulon is for some reason ready to help his dolls again (he reveals her in Part II for his love for Elsa). This is NOT ALL explained ... and with that and all the other garbage I was not amused. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of ridiculous B movies, a connoisseur, if you will. I even collect laser discs from rare B-movies that you can not find on DVD. So I have to say that this was one of the most absurd films I've ever seen in my life. I still love those dolls, the original ones, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester, and the rest, and if they just stayed with what they had instead of trying to fix something that was not broken. Well, the series could still be alive and in good health. Although the reviews are not great, I'm really interested in Puppet Master Retro. It sounds like an interesting tribute to the original themes.
