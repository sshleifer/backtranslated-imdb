My take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to star in an action thriller, even when he's totally boring. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Seagal? Do not worry, there is not much to learn. After Seagal starred in admittedly pleasing, audience-pleasing films like UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal enters the bottom of the bad movie abyss. Now he plays in low-budget B-level action vehicles, some of which are TV-of-the-Week TV-based entries that have lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among those, let's say, dead action movies. A loud and lousy action film, sloppy staged and lazy written (and worse, badly played). This is one of those bad movies that I do not have to see until the end to know it's bad. I did not have the courage to let all my brain cells die while wasting my time. It's this kind of bad movie where you realize that the other movies you hate are not bad. <br /> <br /> The plot (and locale) is completely removed from a similar image, from THE ROCK by Michael Bay, though similar may not be the word to describe it. Both movies are summer movies and should not be taken so seriously. By comparison, even THE ROCK (which is not as important in the writing department as the lights and sounds) has better characters, a more compelling storyline, better action sequences, and a more entertaining atmosphere overall. Although there are action scenes in HALF PAST DEAD, none of them are exciting. All of this is sometimes boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> Although predictability in summer action movies seemed to be a welcome asset, predictability in movies that are not fun never tasted sour, and HALF PAST DEAD is never really that funny, often It's just a pain in the head (if I let the bad rap music in this movie over and over again, then I crave for an aspirin after every aspirie). The drama is terribly mediocre, the plot is distracted, with no compelling or appealing characters. Seagal's character, a covert agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind (Morris Chestnut), a very boring villain, is nothing to be upset about. Seagal's character is also provided with a sidekick (played by rap star Ja Rule) and a lot of Amigo inmates, and there is no chemistry here. <br /> <br /> If in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (What were these films again?) that were finally killed by Seagal's career, half of the death is an overkill. And the audience is warned: they are invited to feel the pain. Note: Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5.
