My friends and I are always on the lookout for chuck-norris filming, just to throb and make fun of it. One of our favorites so far is Lonewolf. I went to a Wal-Mart Christmas shopping and came across this movie in the 5.99 box. I had to get it. I had high hopes for this movie, and although we were sometimes totally funny, we agreed that bells of innocence are the worst movie we've ever seen, made, produced, thought about, etc. ... good idea. Not only is it sometimes confusing, but acting is hard to watch. The man who plays Oren has acting that I can compare to my own vomit, and Chuck did a dive with it, he's not the best actor, but that was awful. and what kind of names are oren, conrad and jux ........ jux. Come on people. If you honestly thought that the movie was on show, great for you because it was hard for me and I had a serious headache and stomach ache after seeing it. I tell you now, if you have not seen this movie, NOT !! Please do not undergo such terrible 90 minutes of your life out of love for God.
