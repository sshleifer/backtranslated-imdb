I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. It did not have much conspiracy and what they had was not so appealing. Although Salman looked good, the film looked young and fresh, but was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad, it was pretty nice. Usually, Indian films are at least two to three hours long, but this was a very short film for an Indian movie. The American actress who starred in the film is from the television series Heroes Ali Larter. Her acting had a lot to be desired. But she looked good in the Indian clothes she wore. The whole movie did not leave much to be desired and I hope Salman makes his next movie a lot better. Many Thanks.
