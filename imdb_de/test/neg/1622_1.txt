There is simply no redeeming quality in this film. OK, some of the costumes are OK, but they're not something you do not see in the Conan movies. And what about Ator's hair? I can not believe that this is part of a series! For this movie I would like to say one thing: it was bad enough for a righteous lampooning of the early cast of MST3K, and I can suggest to anyone curious enough to see how bad this movie is when considering this version of the movie as moral support sees nothing else.
