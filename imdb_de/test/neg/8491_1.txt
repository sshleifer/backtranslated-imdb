Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City, finding and wearing the Norse God of Doom, Loki's mask. The mask helped Jim Carrey reach the top of the comedy, gaining a very popular status for his originality and sheer fun. Everyone knew how to party. PARTY. Why? Because I have to! Well, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie "Son of the Mask". Someone asked the director Lawrence Guterman, why are you doing this? And he answers "Cuz I have to!" Unfortunately, this answer is not dealt with because I still saw the mascot's son and thought, "Good God, why?" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film must realize that responding to the question of why you are making this film should not be as easy as answering the debate about whether a party should take place or The Mask's Son does not begin with Otis, the dog, finding the infamous mask and returning it to owner Tim Avery, a clear tribute to the legendary Tex Avery, the legendary Loony Toons. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a laborious animator who works as a turtle guide for the animation company for which he aspires to a one-day draw. On the night of the Company Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous, insane character we all expect. After the party, Tim goes home, masquerades and picks up a child with his wife. Nine months later, chaos occurs because the baby born from the mask has remarkable cartoons. Otis, the dog jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and takes part in Tom and Jerry. Meanwhile Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is looking for his mask on the orders of his father Odin. <br /> <br /> First, I have to admit that I respect the fact that this movie is so much homage to the classic cartoons like Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with their Wile E. Coyote sets and the infamous dancing frog species. However, this reverence can not save the movie and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is getting more and more silly. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie stupidity is just annoying. The characters are not fun, and what's worse, they're not funny. The languor of the characters is also due to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the biggest things about the original is that obviously computer animations were used, but they relied so much on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of the righteous. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was a real cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just does not have that ability, a fact that becomes clear when you watch him wearing the mask and his facial features rarely move. The baby and the dog were mostly fully animated, which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story in which Loki searched for the mask became more and more amazing. The son of the mask is a sad, sad condition. What I propose is that you rent or buy the original of the mask and thank the Norse gods or whoever brought them to us. And will consider seeing the continuation of my sacrifice while continuing the infamous "WHY?" The son of the mask gets a star, although this star should be split between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be the mask in my book.
