Oh, how I laughed ... that's all ... an Asian / White family, a disabled Asian boy ... everything a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of the BBC. <br /> <br /> What a tribe: This was a total insult to my eyes when I considered this trash an episode and ONLY AN EPISODE towers for example) and then that gets rolling ... It's one vile shame. <br /> <br /> It's all about political correctness and has no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> This is right out of the bowels of hell: But what would you expect from the ultra-left BPC ... I mean BBC.
