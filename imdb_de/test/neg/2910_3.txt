After World War II, Japanese attacks on US forces in Pearl Harbor have "The Eastside Kids": Leo Gorcey (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (as Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (as Glimpy), David Gorcey (as Peewee), Ernest Morrison (as Scruno) and Bobby Stone (as Skinny) want to serve their country. But both the US Army and the Navy reject them as too young. Still wanting to "chop off a million japs," the "boys" attack an Asian office worker who turns out to be Chinese. However, the unfortunate incident causes the gang to uncover some really unpleasant Japanese and Germans. If "too young" is defined as "under twenty-one," only Mr. Jordan and Mr. Stein would be rejected for military service. However, it is possible that HR officers were dismissed by the office methods issued by Mr Gorcey and Mr Hall. "Let's get tough!" was made during what the script describes as "Open Season on Japs" - for this and other reasons, it did not age well. It is a waste of effort, but the regulars are efficient. Tom Brown has brought the story along as Jordan's spy brother. <br /> <br /> *** Let's get tough! (29.05.42) Wallace Fox - Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Tom Brown
