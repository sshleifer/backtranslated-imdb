People! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents implore him to kill them because they want to become senile and be released from their misery. He tries several times to kill her, then changes his mind, saving her from the death traps at the last minute, losing a part of her body every time. The movie seems to hate its main character, making it all the more painful to watch. There is also the usual glued love interest and a predictable ending. <br /> <br /> This movie was also the first time I had seen Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember how his shaved upper lip looked weird and made me feel a bit slick. Perhaps this was only due to the terrible premise and the lame execution of the film.
