If you really want to experience the magic (?) Of Don Dohler, then look at "Alien Factor" or maybe "Fiend", but not these. Alien Factor is quite imaginative and pretty scary given the low budget, but "Nightbeast", which I think is a kind of Alien Factor update, is just stupid. Actors stroll through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone Sheriff, and the monster is a stupid Halloween mask type instead of the wildly resourceful (but somehow stupid) Alien Factor monster. A spaceship crashes on the earth, and of course there is a living thing inside that runs around and vaporizes people. And to tear down his arms, etc. And he has a cool jet cannon that he uses to vaporize people until he is shot out of his hand. And that's really it. "Alien Factor" undoubtedly sets this chaos down. If you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie, have a look. And RIP Don Dohler, 02.12.06.
