Touch Of Death dates back to 1988 and is probably the most frustrating Fulci movie I have seen so far. Then I joined the chorus of horror fans, who generalize that his movies get worse the later you get into his career. Given the storyline, I expected some damn funny fun with this, but despite its bizarre flowering, it feels boring even at a running time of just 80 minutes and suffers from foul smelling production values ​​and movie art (or the lack of it). <br /> <br /> El Story: A gambling addict who seeks widowed wines and edible (and foreign) women he finds over lonely heart pillars before offering them in a cruel way - sometimes to eat or feed animals - and steal their money to keep his debtors at bay. Sure, it's unlikely that only one man will simultaneously take on so many messed-up pathologies (addicts, psycho / sociopaths, cannibals), but this is Fulci! <br /> <br /> Touch is actually the cheapest and most economical looking Fulci movie I've ever seen. There is almost no one inside, even in the background of footage on the street. A news anchor who is constantly on the TV screens to warn of the non-existent cast of the Maniac's latest acts, works from the most miserable television studio in the world. He can never look in the camera because he has to read all the headlines from misaligned paper sheets. <br /> <br /> Some scenes just keep going and the protagonist mumbling about what he's done or what he's done, but the drama is far from good enough to sustain that sort of thing, so the main result is the boredom of the viewer. The movie generally looks bland and ugly too. I've read that it should be an Italian telemovie (has it ever shown in this venue - with the amount of Gore it seems unlikely), and it smells like bad old telemovie output. <br /> This is also Fulci's first foray into sincere black humor, but he's just too cruel as a director to make it work. Sometimes blatantly happy or "crazy" music is used to play against a cruel scene, such as when the hero / villain cuts a corpse in his cellar. The effect is not really cool or funny or ironic, as you would like it to be - it's mostly stupid and crappy. <br /> <br /> There are of course some relaxing moments of the blood (you will wait.) while trying to stay awake), including the murder of a stove (!) on a woman who does not live gives up, even after her face was completely crushed with a damn great club and a homeless person. A car drives back and forth five times. The most terrible touch, however, is the physical deformity of the widows the madman has courted. Beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it's not that he's been looking for women with these qualities, it's just the way all lonely hearts are widows, apparently. There are many attitudes of Mr. Crazy, who secretly warps while he snogs these women. The black humor of such a gross misogyny could have some stamina or resonance if the film was generally not done so badly. In the end, Touch Of Death seems like a really lazy, inarticulate mess.
