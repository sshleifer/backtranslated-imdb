Look no further, it's the worst movie ever made. There may be others who are bound, but there are no worse ones. It can not exist. <br /> <br /> I found this movie on a $ 3.25 laserdisc and thought no movie with these actors might be worth the price. It turns out that it's worth three times that they at least had to pay the money to look at it. <br /> <br /> I'm almost sure that the girl in the picture on the envelope of the package is not the girl in the movie. In the movie, they used a different, a younger and a cute one to make it more attractive. Whatever "conspiracy" was there was about three minutes of the actual movie, the rest is filler. And I do not mean the type of filler that you just know is filler when it's over, or that's some kind of sweets that you do not like to have. I mean, filler that lets you think about your grocery list. I think the "music" must have been made by someone who had a friend who had a radio he had once heard. It is terrible. <br /> <br /> If there were a beautiful mountain, a river valley, a forest or anything, this movie would have something positive. Is not There Self With the Speeder button on the remote, you can not handle it fast enough even at the highest laserdisc speed. <br /> <br /> After years of thinking about film commenting, try not to register with IMDb. I finally cracked because I had to do my part to keep the stinker's user rating as close as possible to press down. <br /> <br /> The guidelines require that you "focus on content and context". I can not. There is not enough content to focus on that, and that's exactly my point. Sometimes bad is just bad, and this movie has to be a lot better than just striving for it.
