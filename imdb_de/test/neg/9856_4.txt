This episode is shit. <br /> <br /> In recent years, I've seen all episodes of "Next Generation" and "Voyager" and now I'm watching "Enterprise." <br /> <br /> I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Until this episode. I stared at the screen in horror as character and entertainment were destroyed. It's more like a slapstick attempt. <br /> <br /> It does not build up the characters, but throws them to their feet - and lets the audience gasp. There is not much to build the series. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised why this was allowed to go up in the air. Was it the letter? Was it the director? Was it the producer? We will probably never know. <br /> <br /> But a bad apple is not bad, I think. I say that it is only a hope.
