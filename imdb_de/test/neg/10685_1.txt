This horrible movie has drawn me constantly. <br /> <br /> The main action of the film is nothing special. It seems that there is a tribe of snake worshipers in a remote mountainous area in northern China, where women rather than men are the leaders and makers. I suppose that among some men that is enough to make "Succubare" a horror film ... Anyway, Chinese men would sometimes go for a walk in the village, get inspired by the local girls, seduce them and then let them down. Unfortunately, the women had cast a spell over the women of snake venom, and they would dreadfully die in 100 days - the belly of a pregnant woman with living worms and snakes - if they did not return. <br /> <br /> Forget the cover of the US video. This has nothing to do with vampires, although there is an intact blood-drinking scene. The title itself is only marginally appropriate: "Succubare" is the Latin verb meaning "to lie underneath," and it is the root of the word succubus, a demoness that would seduce men in their sleep. Actually, it's the men who are the seducers here. <br /> <br /> But it's not the main action of this ridiculous movie that's so reprehensible. These are the minor side events. I'll miss the slaughter and slaughter of an ox running on the screen. The participants seem to be very experienced, as if this were an unpleasant duty that they actually do in real life. and I'm sure that they really ate the animal after that ... though I do not think it's bad when I saw the act as "entertainment" in my face, numerous, completely foreign footage of an unknown man, the history and interrupting by eating live animals. He starts the movie by ripping a live snake with his teeth. In the course of the movie he devours a beetle, a lizard, a toad (I had to leave the room afterwards) and a whole mouse (I stopped seeing at that point and lost his appetite for days). Let me emphasize that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the film ... unless this is a cynical reference to love, as it is portrayed in the film: a blind, selfish, predatory survival mechanism the helpless break ... but on the other hand, I'm probably just rationalizing to get the mean out of my head ...
