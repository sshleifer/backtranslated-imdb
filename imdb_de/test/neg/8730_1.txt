I played this on TV, hoping it would be worth the time ... but dear Gussie, who thought this script would be worth producing? The basic idea is excellent, but the performance is frighteningly poor, with an ever-illogical sequence of scenes, an almost ridiculously melodramatic ending, and poor Rock Hudson roams this with an understandably confused look on his slightly limp face. Looks like a bad B-movie from the 40s ...
