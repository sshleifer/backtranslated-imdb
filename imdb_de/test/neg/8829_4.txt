I love Japanese movies - after seeing at least 100-200. It's obvious that I'm not afraid of Japanese films. Sometimes, however, there are Japanese film concepts that are simply not suitable for Western visitors. They might be hits at home, but abroad they just do not seem to be ... normal. It's like the live fish my wife ate at a business meeting or some PS2 games like dating simulators or Katamari Damacy. This is probably the way other Americans take things for granted, like American football, fried snicker bars and Paris Hilton! Well, the king of weird Japanese films that the Americans just can not seem right could be ATAMA-YAMA. Now the animation style is not the problem - it's different but nice enough. No, it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending. This makes the film a really unusual movie and it goes like this: There was a stingy man who let a tree grow out of his head for no apparent reason. At first it was little and he just cut it off, but it grew again and again - so he decided to let it go. And after a while, people lived on their heads under the shade of the tree. Oddly, they were tiny while under the tree, but when they left, they were fully occupied again. Then, after he got all fed up and tore the tree out, the man drowns himself (!?) In the hole in the head where the tree was! The end. <br /> <br /> See! I told you it was very, very strange - but not as good as TAMPOPO or HAPPY KATAKURIS - just weird. O-D-D .... odd! And if you're not tolerated so much, I doubt you'll be sick if you know this Oscar-nominated film did not win. Honestly, that makes me happy because I DO NOT want this movie to spur such similar films. The only reason it deserves a 4 is due to nice but not spectacular animations. <br /> <br /> This movie hurt my brain ... I hope that's not a sign that I have a tree!
