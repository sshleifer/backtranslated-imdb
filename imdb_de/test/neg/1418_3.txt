The premise of this comedian talk show moderator, who runs for the president as an independent candidate to shake things up, is funny, entertaining, brilliant and even a bit inspirational. (thinking about the West Wing debate when Tom Dobbs left his podium, thought of Steven Colbert announcing his candidacy, good times) The first 15-20 minutes of this film are therefore very entertaining, especially the debate. If he is eventually elected, it is a pity that it is due to a computer error that he wants to win fairly (though that is unrealistic). <br /> <br /> But after that this movie goes completely downhill. I thought we'd get a great movie like "Dave" (1993) in which we would see how it would turn out, if a comedian actually ruled the country. Instead, the film turns from a comedy into a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama, and does no good. The computer glitch becomes the main story, which is really shit. Boy, that is disappointing. I give it 3 stars just for the premise and because I actually managed to watch this movie from start to finish without stopping it, which is usually a good thing for me.
