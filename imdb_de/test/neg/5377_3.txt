I'm a pretty good friend for these ghost hunter shows. From the Cheesy mockumentaries like Discovery Channel "The Haunting" to Scooby Doo reality shows like "Ghost Hunters". When I saw promos for A & E's "Paranormal State", I knew I was going to watch. Especially when "Paranormal State" was faced with a weak Monday night football match. <br /> <br /> Until the end of the pilot of "Paranormal State", when the main "character" in this reality dance macabre is a creepy child gives a bottle Max of Sydow Holy Water and calms him down by to tell this boy that as a child he also had an inappropriate bad experience with things that "came out of the closet" and the (Catholic) church gave him a healing water to ward off the things coming out of the closet I knew I had Monday Night Football should give another chance. <br /> <br /> The blow behind "Paranormal State" is a group of Penn State students who have all banded together and founded their own existence Ghost Hunting Club. Or the company. Or super adventure club. And they walk around in Pennsylvania, exploring the most horrible ghosts and lost conspiracy to make an M. Night Shymalan movie. <br /> <br /> The "you" is a kind of misunderstanding. Really paranormal, it revolves around a Nittany Lion named Ryan Buell, who would probably run Penn State's annual Anime Convention if that show did not exist. He is often accompanied by "investigations" of hot colleagues and some other people you see in the credits, but rarely caught in front of the camera. Hey, are these ghosts too? <br /> <br /> This is the show of Ryan Buell. Paranormal condition is his "vehicle", as we like to say in the Biz. And, oh, what a boring ride in a vehicle he can be. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Ryan tells the entire episode of Paranormal State in a starless date without "Director's Log"? Almost immediately it gets annoying because the obvious intention is to hunt down Ryan's mind, but his filtered monotone only causes a grunt and a laugh. Seriously, any serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter of a Call of Duty video game. <br /> <br /> The "Investigations" - the plot around which each episode revolves - are interesting on the surface. In Paranormal State there are no frequented restaurants or restaurants. This is a show about the fear of the unknown like a good Catholic boy, and they make you fearful of God. <br /> <br /> Little children are molested, things appear in the dark, voices encourage the living to kill, and Aleister Crowely in me rubs my hands. From the two episodes I observed, each was about violent, evil spirits associated with violent, evil deaths. <br /> <br /> Maybe. <br /> <br /> Maybe not. <br /> <br /> Everything in "Paranormal State" is shortened in half an hour, "Dog the Bounty - he, Ghost Hunter" blocks. Every time there is an interesting, demonstrable evidence - the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the 1800s - the evidence is angled in front of the viewer like a cheater trying to convince you to stack a pile of papers The nose is proof that tens of millions have come from Nigeria and then been torn away before you get a good look. <br /> <br /> At least on sci-fi channels "Ghost Hunters" there is an excessive need to tear out any evidence of evidence and present it to the viewer. EPPs, which could be a rat fart, have cold spots in a draughty house and "bullets" that even the Ghost hunters themselves classify as dust. It's a kind of Scooby Doo-like approach that makes Ghost Hunters almost believable. <br /> <br /> While "Paranormal State" claims to have EPPs, it does give the viewer a ten-second video clip of a wave file in Garage Band with no audio. Yes, an EPP, right? People claim to see dark figures in the basement ... Well, let's just have a look ... and let the night-vision camera out of the living room on a rousing stationary shot. Ryan, the intrepid leader of this group of Penn State graduates, claims to see "visions" of the name of a demon he knows and who may be involved in a paranormal haunting ... But he can not please us, the audience or not His team of educated students say because ... He can not. You never say the name of a demon loud, Ryan informs the wide-eyed Co-Ed, who dares to ask. <br /> <br /> Well, how very comfortable for you. Most of all, because this is a TV show where the audience can not read your thoughts. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is all turn and not prestige. The audience is told what's supposedly going on, but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid sees Dead People. Not even a grainy video of a chair moving, or a black spot running between the jail cells. Nothing. You are just being told what happened to Ryan in another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you try to smoke me up, dress it a bit. If you're trying to influence me, show me a bullet or a blob and let the fat chick working at Hot Topic say why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer. And if you want to watch a ghost hunting show, give me something else than to trot Lorraine Warren in the second episode. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is a weak sauce. It's not worth looking at, unless you do not have time to watch TV or just have a thin DVD collection. Or unless you want to know what really happened in this closet with the holy water.
