How many people did I love the original. "American Graffiti" was one of the great films of the 70s. The sequel to "More American Graffiti" is a terrible, depressing mess of a movie. It was not funny, the big-eyed, sympathetic characters were cynical and dull, and the stories were invented (like "Laurie's" character with another brother, because Richard Dreyfuss creates the sequel and "Terry the Toad" rather than "Pharaoh Joe" somehow, to serve together in Vietnam). They even have a policeman named "Falfa" (Harrison Ford's original character) making a "cameo." He does not even look like Harrison Ford, who was too big a star in 1979 to even bother with this garbage. <br /> <br /> The operative word here is "funny". This movie is not even amusing. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper who gets mixed up with a bunch of spider-mixes spewing hippies and trying to free her dealer friend from prison; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), the lovebirds of the original, have two children and have become an annoying, quarrelsome couple; The delightful little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) has become "Rainbow", another hippie child. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a loser racer whose fortune was predicted at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave it such a big flow, is only sporadically heard. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was other writers, another director, and the total lack of a coherent plot that makes this film a bleak failure. <br /> <br /> The episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original can not be found in the sequel. It was a movie that did not have to be shot, and it's best to remember what a great movie "American Graffiti" was and to avoid the movie with "More" in the title.
