That's a big disappointment. The main problem is action. Sylvestre le Touzel is pretty poor as Fanny and the rest is not much better, they are all very stilted and unnatural. Also, the camera work is very 1980s, ie cramped and jumpy, compared to P & P from the year 1995. <br /> <br /> The script is, if anything, too faithful to the book, and there are some dour ones Statements should have been cut. <br /> <br /> This is far inferior in every way to the recent film release, which did bring great freedom to the book, but was far more faithful to the spirit of the book and far more enjoyable.
