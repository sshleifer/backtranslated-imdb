When I saw on the voting panel that some people had given this film a rating of 10, I assumed that they did not know that the rating was not below 100. This is a catastrophe film in the real sense of this term. Badly written and incapable of acting with so-called actors, but empowered to make faces on orders. In the first 60 minutes, the story seems to go in one direction, then it changes and enters into a power struggle with extremely bad special effects. Unable to find an intelligent path for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with superpowers, the "clerk" cheats. It is obvious that the father was included in the so-called storyline, because it was easier than working out an acceptable solution. Not that writing would even know the word "denouement". Some movies go straight to DVD. This should have gone directly to the garbage can.
