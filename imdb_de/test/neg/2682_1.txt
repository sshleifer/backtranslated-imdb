Okay, wait, let me get this road, there are actually some idiots on this site who think this is one of the better, if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone who said it was as good as the original. Pah, what nonsense, I do not think I've seen her every Halloween, and obviously other people know what makes at least a good horror movie, and that shiver of S is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen in my life have. Honestly, if I were John Carpenter, I would either sue the person who wrote it or go there with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels are generally almost all garbage, two were crap, three were stupid, four are fine, five are well five, H20 okay, resurrection painful. In many ways, I find that this is the worst part of a very bad series of sequels. Why? Well, let me just go into a kind of rant, not so much for a review, but for a nonsense chat about why Halloween 6, the cure of Michael Myers, is one of the most terrible movies I've seen in a long time. OK, where should I start, ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. Basically, the storyline is a jumble of cults, signs of Thor, and other crap. It's just stupid that it really is, the movie tries to be flashy and intelligent, but it's put together in such a dreadful way. Why does Michael Myers have a reason to kill people? Simple Explanation Micahel likes to kill his loved ones, but no, we have to have a man in black, mysterious cults and signs of Thor and total crap. God, it's so bad that I wanted to cry, that it really did. The authors have tried to complement the character of Myers, but have actually managed to do the opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit, which by the way has a completely different color, Myers is not the same type as the original, or even two, maybe even four. Is that another thing why Myers became a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it should be the other way around, but Myers is so much like Jason, all he does is kill people in a gorely endless way. In the original, he was annoyed that his victims needed a lot of time, and that made the whole thing much more exciting. He simply walks around and hacks people to death. I mean, within half an hour, we had reached the amount of killings in the original, which was just ridiculous. Oh, and Myers seems to have a really big head in this case, I mean, it's huge and he has a lot of weight. What else is crap, oh yeah, the return of Tommy Jarvis is pretty bad. In fact, all the characters in this movie are Mistbar Dr Loomis. I can not stand the little kid, I wish he had got it, he is really irritating. Our heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family is a terrible group of actors. The mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the father, I mean, was this his first part or something? He was like a comic-villain for God's sake, he was actually meaner than Myers. <By the way, his death is one of the most terrible I've ever seen. What else is garbage, oh yeah Tommy Jarvis, I do not know what the guy's name is, but he can not really act. He's trying his best to be serious and all that, but I just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he had actually died, if all had died, it would have been really good. There is Loomis a terribly aged and dying Donald Pleasence. Although he is on his last legs, Pleasance is still outstanding in the short time he plays. It is such a pity that such a cornerstone of this franchise had to say in garbage like this farewell. What else is garbage, oh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it. First, how the hell did Michael manage to get into that van when he was in his house five minutes ago? Second, it was just a senseless killing that can increase body count, but it's just another nonsense that adds to the hustle and bustle of this movie. It is indeed death that testified everything for me because it was pointless, like this movie.
