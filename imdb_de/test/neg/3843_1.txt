I actually signed up on this page to write about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie was shown in one of the local channels. I made it about an hour before I had enough. Curious to see what the general film-oriented public thought about this film, I looked up on this page. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming number of people who thought it was great. I had to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The "jokes" were uninspired re-enactments from other, better shows and films, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this disgusting character should only be suitable for children under the age of ten. That can be a stretch even for this age. I'm all for slapstick ridicule, but there is not even the slightest hint of wit or wisdom. I have an idea, we take bad, unimaginative obvious jokes and play them at double speed. This is funny. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> Movies you should see when you take stupid humor and add weird timing and originality: The Marx Brothers, A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's Sense of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer , and Uncut, ... and the list goes on. Do not lose one and a half hours of your life with everlasting crap. By the way, I can only assume that the reason why David Bar Katz (the other author) did VERY little in the movie after this movie is because he was immediately blacklisted. I'm really impressed that Leguizamo recovered after this mess.
