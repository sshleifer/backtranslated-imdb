I'll give it a second chance, but was very disappointed at first. It would not hold a candle for the other series. It has a lot of meaningless dialogues that add nothing to the plot. I agree with the others that it does not appear to develop an interesting story. It's slow and cumbersome, and I only know what the Comanches are up to. Maybe everything will be put together in the second part, but I have to force myself to watch it and find out. I'm from Apache heritage from Texas / New Mexico, but I do not know much about what happens. Maybe I'm just ignorant of the facts, but that does not help me much.
