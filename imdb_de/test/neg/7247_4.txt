Director Lesley Selander's routine outdoor yarn "The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954) attacks the Cheyenne against the American cavalry, with the spry, robust Rory Calhoun in the midst as a seasoned suede-clad Indians to keep the survivors safe must bring. This western of the United Artists was in color, but the television imprinted by Turner Classic Movies was inexplicably in black and white. The action begins with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of "Black Spurs"), who avoided some Indians and with his old friend and Cheyenne boss Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"). ) to drive on Palaver who has murder in mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are ready to wipe out a cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians have made with the government. On his way to inform the on-going Camp Commandant Major Ives (Warner Anderson of "Objective, Burma!") About the imminent attack of the Indians, Adam discovers a beautiful forest nymph seductively kicking water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of "I, Jury") is another of those silly Western women bathing naked in the middle of Indian country without caring for the world. Castle also seems to be really naked in her bathing scenes, perhaps the most memorable scene in this otherwise predictable western. Of course, Major Ives Adams refuses Fire Knife's warning until the commander realizes that someone has raided his ammo dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions unanswered by the script of Richard Alan Simmons in this 82-minute trill. Why should the cavalry bury their ammunition in a secret place in the desert instead of keeping it on the grounds of the fortress? No sooner did they make this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out the hero and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, two white prospectors rode into the fortress. Sawyer (Peter Graves from "Stalag 17") puts his partner in the chest with an arrow. While Adam gets hot water to remove the arrow, the greedy Sawyer drags the shaft deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the spread of gold remains unanswered after our heroes have survived the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have requested one last Powwow and Fire Knife that Adam passes Major Ives, or all will die. Of course, Adam refuses and the Indians start to crush the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a purposeful Mexican Boy Scout pursued by a sexy Indian girl named Honey Bear (Oscar winner Rita Moreno of "West Side Story"), and Robert Bray of "Lassie" is briefly present as a sick cavalry officer Kate wanted to marry. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise in this inconspicuous Western setting on the ground in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women and children in the infamous Sand Creek massacre, keeps a secret that he is also a Native American! Ironically, the tight arc Fire Knife has banished from friendship with Adam at the beginning of hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the brave Cheyenne warrior after the bullets go out. "The Yellow Tomahawk" concludes with an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives submit their respective reports on the subject to an army general, but we never know the outcome of that meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or another unanswered question. The producer Howard W. Koch has no connection with the scenarist "Casablanca" Howard Koch. Ultimately, "The Yellow Tomahawk" is one of the many pro-Indian westerns that appeared after "Broken Arrow" (1950), where the Indian is considered a noble savage, who is treated unfairly by some, but not all, whites. Selander, who made dozens of Westerns in the 1950s and 1960s, makes this little Western bearable, despite its thin character and familiar position. Calhoun is an above-average cast who always serves as a serviceable leader, and the handsome Castle is well worth the attention to her feminine charm. Peter Graves plays a skunk, as was common in most of his early roles. In fact, Lesley Selander shot a more satisfying dramatic version of the film the year before with the title "War Paint" (1953) starring Robert Stack. By the way, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both became regulars on The Rockford Files.
