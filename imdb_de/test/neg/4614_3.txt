Ok, I thought that would be terrible. But when I saw it ... I was misunderstood. Emily Bergl did a great job, as did Jason London. Sue Snell was signed and signed. The Meanies were alright, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard are definitely the standout. What teenagers do and how people say it's all wrong. What ever. My friends and I often use the term "swank" and I drove a car and had someone steer when I changed. There is pretty much everything there. I've just never been to an after-game party in a house that's so big with its very own light show. The deaths are good. The best are glasses, a spear gun and a pool ... all in this order. I have to say, there will be people who hate it ... but I'm not one of them.
