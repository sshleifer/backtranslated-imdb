If a movie has an uninspired, choppy story and bland characters, it has to be made good by really, really funny play. If you are funny, you can get away a lot. There are a few amusing moments here and there in Grandma's Boy, but they are so far and few in between that they can not make up for the hacking that the movie shows in such abundance. The movie does not want to surprise anyone. When Alex hides marijuana in his grandma's house in a teapot, you know what will happen later. The film seems to have been written by a committee that did a study on mediocre comedies and grilled every gag that appeared in more than one of them. The game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for a clever comedy. But do not be fooled, this is not a video about video game developers. This is basically a college frat house movie where all the guys were pushed into a big room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The way the movie does not think through the scenery and laugh at the original is seen in the figure of the JPJP, I think more or less was created by the creator of Doom, John Carmack , conspired. At least so much inspired that he's a weird genius making games. In the movie J.P. a funny, disgusting geek who is despised and mocked by the test players of the company. That makes no sense at all. If you are one of the most important people in the history of video games (as it should be J.P.), people will still admire and respect you, even if you are quirky and disgusting. If Stephen Hawking is disgusting, his colleagues will still not get him in the face. <br /> <br /> Even game testers are probably as stingy as JP, but in the movie they are basically frat boys It's fun, normal guys against the vile Dweebs movie. And although this formula has worked very occasionally in the past, it is absurd in the environment of a gaming company. If you choose an unusual setting for a movie, do not just put all the conventions of movies from different settings into it. Unless you are a hack. <br /> <br /> About two thirds of the entire movie I gave up. Something happened that I knew would lead to a series of painfully predictable events. And I realized that I had not laughed in the last half hour anyway. So I stopped (although I moved fast, just to make sure I was right, that they were following the most predictable clich√©s they did). There are no good things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenally modest production That he deserves a long argument talentless nobodies. I give the film 1 point because it gave Shirley Jones the chance to be the anti-Shirley Partridge.
