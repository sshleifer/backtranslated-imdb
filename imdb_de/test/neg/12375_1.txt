The Giant Claw is in the tough competition with films like "Robot Monster" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space" for the worst movie of all time. A fake giant vulture attacks "Lionel Trains" in this totally unconscious movie. The script is so bad that whatever the characters say to each other is ridiculous. It's no wonder that this movie is a prime target in the movie "It Came From Hollywood", in which this gem for the line "A bird as big as a battleship" is hammered with joyous, endless needling. The line appears tirelessly throughout the film, so there is no escape. There are several shots from "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" and "Earth vs. The Flying Saucers" among other fifties sci-fi films to amplify the attacks of the Geier eggs. At some point, the big vulture is responsible for some deaths, so the military puts the whole world under martial law, and no one is allowed to leave its homes. Of course the big buzzard is all about following the stars of this classic Jeff Morrow & Mara Corday wherever they are. However, the director is so lame that he does not even provide a few shots of pretty Mara in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the boredom of this zero-star thriller. This is the second time that this mistake has been made. In 'Tarantula', Mara Corday wears hot clothes all through the movie, but remains banished in 'The Giant Scorpion' pants. The budget for this film can not be more than thirty or forty thousand dollars, and I doubt Morrow or Corday got more than three thousand for it. It looks like the whole thing was shot dead right out of the garage.
