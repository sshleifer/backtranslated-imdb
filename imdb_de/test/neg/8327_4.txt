Danny Lee's performance as a smart cop is the only place of interest in the film, though he has a stellar cast, including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On, and Alex Man. CYF plays a three-headed boss who is attracted to a life of peace and abundance, but Alex Man, a total psycho who has a great grudge against CYF, does not allow it. CYF tries to flee to Malacca, but it does not succeed. After his family is torn to pieces, his cronies are dead or disguised, wounded and broken, CYF returns to Hong Kong to take a serious revenge. <br /> <br /> It sounds a lot better than it sounds. CYF is well dressed and handsome, looks painful, grimacing and crying, but somehow you do not care. Andy Lau looks great, but that's about it. Carina Lau has a tiny, tiny part that was nice, but she gets a bullet in the head early on for that to end. Alex Man is a cartoon villain who is so over the top, which can be intriguing at times, but the writing here is so shallow that it only appears as a nut in the garden. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is great pity, he's just a small spot on the screen of this dark (literally) and essentially boring movie. <br /> <br /> Rent it, do not buy it. Or just leave it out completely. <br /> <br /> This is the sequel to "Rich And Famous," though apparently filmed at the same time; it was first released because of CYF's box office power.
