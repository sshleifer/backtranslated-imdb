Bank robbery / cop thriller sounds alright? <br /> <br /> Chaos looks good: beautifully framed, good production values, high concept action robbery ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> The plot has that a unique achievement, both clever and unbelievable, in "how we actually got the money" and in the section "who has why and why" too straightforward ... <br /> <br /> Also, that's the screaming of Ryan Philippe NOT seriously NOT hard or scary ... and in particular he is not hard or scary when he throws a tizzyan case. Honestly, his big breakout is the only really funny scene in the entire movie. He must be thrilled that he has rejected the role of Anakin Skywalker and is doing so now .... <br /> <br /> Stratham is usually good as a hard but quiet teaser with the self-mocking humor, but here's who Additional lines of reference are so ridiculously bad that even he looks uncomfortable asking for clich√©. More silence seems best? <br /> <br /> Snipes is actually sort of fine, but another nail in the coffin of a talented actor: he needs the role of an actor, not an action hero revival. Perhaps the business with his taxes will allow him to break that mold, and the public and critics will let him vote for sympathy. It would be good if he was not typed that way all the time. <br /> <br /> The lines that these guys are talking about when they are not doing plot development and detective work can be summed up in one word ... <br /> <br /> The film feels totally confused and he never gels: I found him irritating in the first 45 minutes and the closer last part was passable. It could / have been good, but it just can not redeem the terrible lines, the overwhelming score and the general level of irritation with the plausibility level. <br /> <br /> Overall, I almost did not make it: unbelievably irritating and Ryan .... please, please, please, please get rid of the Goldilocks ....
