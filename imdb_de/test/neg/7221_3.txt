Spoiler !! <br /> <br /> I hate this, but it is better than the others afterwards, they are getting worse. I hope Gibson has the wisdom to stay away from the next one. The same goes for humor, eg. For example, for the toilet, for children, etc. How far can we observe how their relationship develops? Drugs, bad guys, why South Africa! I thought that was incredible, maybe South American, a land in the Golden Triangle would have made the script better. It seems that the late '80s had the blond bad guys in the early' 90s, ie The Hard, the mighty ducks that played Ice Land Gary Busey in the last weapon, and so on. This one with a similar story needs to be overdone. The attacks on the police, the beach condo scene and the fight at the end and the towering Gibson girlfriend who was killed by the copper attack was too much. Like many other parts they will be worse and 3 or 4 in this series will speed up the descent. 3.10
