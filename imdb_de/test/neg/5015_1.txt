If someone wants to have a character in a movie that has a disquieting sexual encounter that would embarrass the character later in life, the only thing an audience would consider shameful would be bestiality, and now it's done. Judging from some other comments, this was not so successful. I can not remember a funny scene, though I have to admit I had to turn it off before it was finished. I've looked at part of the director's commentary and it seems like he's as surprised as anyone else that the movie is doing well. If you want the same feeling as in this movie, but only cheaper, put your head in a dunghill and take a deep breath.
