Paul Muni and Bette Davis are outrageously overemphasizing, while Archie Mayo, a glittering studio hack, is distracted and distracting in this racially provocative movie that derives its "bittersweet ending," endorsing segregationist attitudes. The film breaks down hard and bad and has collapsed within its first fifteen minutes with its runaway courtroom from which it can never recover, as Mr. Muni begins to chew the countryside through the yard, which roars in an almost incoherent manner and Howls <br /> <br /> Johnny Ramirez is a Mexican American from the other side of the railways, who by law and sands attains a law degree from a night school on the shop front. In his first major case of a car accident, he shows only ineptitude and is quickly fooled by his well-persecuted opponents and an impatient judge recommending his dismissal. Devastated by the setback, an angry Johnny takes on a job in a game room where he's friends with owner Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette), who likes his style. The owner interrupts him, but there are problems with Mrs. Roark (Davis), who also wants a piece of Johnny. She kills Charlie, implicates Johnny, and slowly goes crazy before being acquitted and free to associate with a Wasp company that coldly tells him that they are from "different tribes, wilder" and that it will never work. When she flees from his anger, she is run over by a car and killed. Ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood to explain that it's best to stay with your own. In addition to this terrible resolution, Bordertown has a number of bad performances to underline the general ugliness of the story. As unfair as it may be, Munir's Ramirez is so abominable and arrogant that it's hard to show sympathy for such a Bull Bull. Davis is no better than the faithful wife who fulfills the same youthful feelings of Muni. Her crazy scenes with Lady Macbeth give no indication that she would become the best movie actress of her time. Margaret Lindsay as Muni's American Dream is cold, secluded and shallow. As bad as Bordertown is (and it is very), it remains an interesting indicator of time and acceptable attitudes. The rest is just a mish-mash of bad acting and uninspired direction.
