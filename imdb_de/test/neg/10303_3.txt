On the recommendation of a friend and my admiration for Philip Baker Hall, I rented the first relay disc of the Loop. It's a typical television comedy with all the clich√©s that the genre uses with the "crazy" scheming brother (Sully), "ditzy". blonde (Lizzy), unrequited token love interest (Piper), sarcastic Asian helper (Darcy, who reminded me of Arliss, as if EVERYONE would have to be reminded of this show). The plot deals with various accidents (mostly by Sully) that assault Sam, putting his work on the plane at risk just to make him save the day, with "hilarious hijks" in the middle. I have not described a specific episode. I have described them all with a T. Therein lies the problem that what seems to be even passable entertainment, at first glance, becomes uselessly blunted when looking at episodes in a row and becoming unimaginably bored with endless repetition. Sully will do something "crazy", Mimi Rogers will say something overly sexual, Russ will be reporting on his gay son, Darcy will introduce herself as Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah blah. The only positive thing is the lack of an annoying laugh track. But do not let that fool you into believing that it is good. Look at a much better comedy. Arrested Development, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, two names two from my head. Surprised that this one is still in the air. Oh, that's right. Fox just canceled the good shows, I forgot. Needless to say, I no longer trust the taste of my friend in shows. <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
