It is disappointing to see such a talented actor as Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role, especially when he excelled in BLACK (which I highly recommend). One line of the movie states, "Sakar is not a mere man, he is a thought and a philosophy." Director Ram Gopal Varma writes THE GODFATHER as inspiration for this movie, and maybe that's the problem. It seems like a badly scoured American movie in India. The Left Elbow Index takes into account seven elements of filmmaking - drama, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, artistry, and production phrases - on a scale of 10 to 1, with 5 given as a. Average score. Film continuity seems to be high, an eight by maintaining a violent tone steeped in dramatic locations and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotion associated with the evil of organized crime. The acting rated a 4, it seems to be too weak, even if someone is beaten or murdered, it seems hoohum. For example, when a character is shot in the forehead, I wondered if or when he would fall. He does not do it and alias Ronald Reagan he sits in a car, his bleeding face like John F. Kennedy. The plot rates a 5 as an example of American-style gangsterism with a family-oriented robinhood at the top. The character development appears static and the characters act like chess pieces on an abandoned chessboard, making them rank 3. The dialogue seems to be stilted and seems forced to conform to a particular Bowery speech pattern - a 4 for dialogue. The production sets seem to be below average - a 4. The craftsmanship is enigmatic, with far too many close-ups, too fast panning and too many group scenes in which the actors appear hasty - a 3rd for me too Many camera movements are disturbing. The average of the Left Elbow Index is 4.4, and with a slight deduction due to a bad derivative, the value drops to 4. Four questions are constantly in the movie: First, why do so many people eat so often, and secondly, not India has one own organized crime? Do films like this have to be dependent on Western cultural examples? As much as I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can not recommend this movie.
