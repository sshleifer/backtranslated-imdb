The daughter of a wealthy merchant who suffered from rheumatic fever as a young girl and is now suffering from respiratory distress, discovers that her marriage was arranged with a charming ne'er-do-well by dad (whom she affectionately calls "darling"). ; Worse still, she may have only a few more weeks to live, leaving her husband free to marry her passionate romantic rival. Pure bunk. Paul Osborn's script (about Jerome Weidman's Skinny Story) transmits the superfluous flashbacks in the second half, rather than proceeding with the conspiracy, flooding the already soapy scenario in grim discussions. Why go backwards, if we can find out what happens to us? This is a "woman's woe" that has no confidence in the target group. So simple is the structure. Dorothy McGuire, wrapped in fur for the most part of the picture, is not a sly, clever heroine at all; When she gets excited, she turns inward and stony. When she realizes that her marriage is basically a farce, she shrinks away from her husband like the perfect maiden (well, that's possible because she and Van Johnson are sleeping in separate beds!). Ruth Roman has the movie's best moments as a corporate shark with her trap for Van, but what exactly do these women see in him? Johnson can be charming when needed, but can bring him into a melodramatic environment and he also gets rocky. The production of MGM is only a median, but director Gottfried Reinhardt attempts to add a visual flair to the flashback segments, and he attempts to begin the first half-hour of the film with brisk steps. ** from ****
