This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no trace of historical accuracy, in fact the reality is reversed. Just one example: Morgan had fallen victim to the few ethnic Chinese whom he encountered. Acting is exaggerated, the script is a poorly written lie. I have never seen worse bad beards. <br /> <br /> Hopper has arrived in Australia and is said to have made the film only when the script was completely rewritten so he could be a hero. Since the script was written ten on-the-fly, it may explain how bad it is and how disconnected the film is. <br /> <br /> Every movie about Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
