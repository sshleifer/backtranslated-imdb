Me and my brother are very big Asian movie fans. When I found this movie hidden in a shop, I bought it on DVD because it sounded very promising and I could not wait to see it. So I saw this movie with my brother and I have to say that in the beginning it was very promising. We both really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But that was probably all. There are some interesting fights, but it is not an action movie, as he claims. Instead, it's a romance ... with the clich√© of love being played with extreme exaggeration, even Shakespeare would vomit on that title. Sorry for my language. By the way: The characters seem like picked up from the street and with 100 ?? for playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, me and my brother have seen it to the end because we thought it could only get better. But, damn it, it never did. This movie claimed # 1 on my and my brothers "worst movies ever seen" list, followed by "Fantasy mission force" - do not look at this.
