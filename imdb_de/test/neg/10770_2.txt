I do not know why they kept the name. How they could call the series "The Scarlet Pimpernel" after deviating so much from the novels that I had no idea. The character names were the only things they kept, and even then they changed some of them and mixed them, changing Percy's relationships with them. Granted, I've only seen the most for about two hours, but that was enough to realize that the series was not comparable to Baroness Orzcy, who portrayed her characters and probably would have rolled around during the shooting in the tomb. Poor woman. I hope that the next person, if she wants to do a movie / series of the book, does not ruin it as completely as this series.
