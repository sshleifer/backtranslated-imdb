I can not believe that someone paid to make this movie. Dumb, unrealistic and stereotypical. Right from the start of the massive 747, the pilot pulled back the throttles to increase the speed. Then you have 5 armed people with semi-automatic to fully automatic weapons, without a bullet breaking through the walls of the pressurized cabin to 38,000 feet. Once down in the belly of the aircraft, a stray bullet hits a FUEL line and we see the fuel leaking sideways out of the aircraft. Acting was just awful and forced. It just did not seem to give direction. I've seen some pretty awful B movies in my life, but with the names featured in this movie, I was extremely disappointed.
