I've seen these months on Netflix Instant and left a review there. <br /> <br /> Let me say, most other reviews are very accurate. This film was poorly written, badly played and directed. I also liked Russell and Pare "in the old days" and was very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I lost interest in the movie, washing dishes and making a sandwich, but still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I returned to the living room, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the movie evolved. I even rewound it to make sure I did not miss anything. This movie was all about how to make a "twist" end. I suspect that the idea sounded good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so lacking that the sets really were missing. And yes, I think all those "bad sets" were an attempt to give the viewer a hint. Everything I was told was "low budget". <br /> <br /> The reason why I came here was that I saw a review of Shutter Island over the weekend and with what the reviewers said or did not say, let me believe that Shutter Island the same deal is only on a budget of 50 to 60 times more! (Actually, I have no idea how much Dark World has cost, but I hope they did not spend more than a million!) A bit more money for a better "look" (whether this meant better landscaping or better painting, only someone with a vision), they could make Dark World a passable product. Now it sounds like Shutter Island is doing that. Looks like they got the vision right, but the scripting might still be over. Money can not buy everything, but it should be in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS My 2 star rating refers to Russell and Pare.
