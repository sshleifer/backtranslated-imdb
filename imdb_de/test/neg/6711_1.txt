From then on, two things have changed. First of all, I'm not a kid anymore, and secondly, most new Seagal movies are just a terrible plot in this movie, the plot is just an excuse to shoot some horrible action scenes that are painful to watch. I love action movies, but this is not an action movie, a group of irritating scenes that are intricately linked to kill viewers for the action movies. I'm sorry, but I have no respect for anyone who liked this movie Seagal will do some good movies in the future. Good luck for him!
