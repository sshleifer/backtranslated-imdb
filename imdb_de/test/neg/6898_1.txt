BARNYARD sucked! I saw this movie last week and it is awful. Which bull has udders? My 2-year-old asked me if all the cows have udders and tried to explain to her that this just was not true and the movie only confused her more! <br /> <br /> Also, the violent topic has made my 2 year old frightened. They made the coyotes cruel and that made my daughter afraid of coyotes. I know that coyotes are not cruel for a fact and are natural predators. The mother and son sitting in front of us shouted in a certain scene in the movie, "Kill him, kill him, yes," in which they say good against evil, and they should stop calling well-known actors a lame movie use. Steve Oederek, who has also made Thumb movies like Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others, is so bad! swallow my diarrhea and post it on Youtube.com ... Enough said!
