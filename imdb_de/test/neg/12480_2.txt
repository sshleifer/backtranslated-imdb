Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter films, mainly for his undead movies like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he has staged a kind of black comedy, but there is only one problem: the nausea. I say this, knowing that I like the city of the walking dead (which is also crude, but not so). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by searching ugly and deformed rich women, then murdering them and stealing their money. The movie makes this plan look so easy. I think the women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash. After the homicide murder, I began to suspect what I've always heard about Fulci: he hated women. He must have. Anyway, this movie stinks, it's not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with Giallo and supernatural zombie movies. Avoid this movie at all costs.
