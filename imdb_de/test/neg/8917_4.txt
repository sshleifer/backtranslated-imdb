Today, You Die was the 4th Seagal movie in a mini-marathon I've just held. Wow, I do not know where to start. He seems to murmur his lines more and more over time, and the scenes between Seagal and Treach, in which they seem to be improving, are embarrassing. And what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? I can not recommend it to anyone except the die-hardest Seagal fan, and even then, you're better off with your previous work. Of the 4 films in my marathon (Submerged, In the Sun, Aliens and Today you die) was the worst today. A previous reviewer mentioned this, but the use of footage was obvious.
