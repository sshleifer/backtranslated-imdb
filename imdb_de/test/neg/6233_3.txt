I had never heard of "The Clearing" until one day I was really bored with some friends in the local blockbuster and got our attention. The description on the DVD jacket caught our interest, but when we plugged it into the DVD player, boredom started. <br /> <br /> The story was dragged on too long. It seemed to follow the same structure as other films involving a kidnapping. The most exciting parts, however, were at the beginning of the film. After that, the outline followed closely and that made "The Clearing" unoriginal. The flashbacks were too numerous and the sorrow of the victim's family did not provide anything interesting and did not add to the nature of the film. And I also thought that I did not like the end, which probably meant that I did not like the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The acting was not terrible ... but not the best. Robert Redford has shown much better performances. Willem Dafoe's tragic character was the only one I could truly develop throughout the story, and the viewer only sees the change in the last ten minutes of the movie. Helen Mirren's portrayal of Robert Redford's wife was flat, following, as it were, the same generic model as other films involving a tragic and heartrending event. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Clearing" is nothing special about. Use your movie rental for something else ... like "Garden State," maybe?
