At first I thought that this little fantasy trip would be entertaining. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A good cast (Roy Scheider as president) did not help. The story had every imaginable worst-case scenario that could occur in a terrorist nuclear disaster. And none of it POSSIBLE! <br /> <br /> The Kidnapping of the President can only be accomplished with the help of an intelligence traitor (ala Air Force One), but all that they describe in terms of FOOTBALL and the helplessness of our people Hands of the enemy falls, it is ridiculous to the Nth degree. Seriously, not even the president can completely override our missile control. The case is only used to forward orders. In this situation, our system would have completely erased the codes and the whole thing would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijing could not take place - there would have been no rocket launch because the silo crews had been instructed not to do so (communication involves a hardwired system). There are just too many safety precautions to prevent it. <br /> <br /> Of course, films like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE have given credibility to the concept of losing control of THE SYSTEM. But this movie goes too far and does not override my concept of the unbelievable. And that makes the experience a waste of time for the viewer. This movie is a failure.
