Ruggero Deodato is often punished for inventing the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But director Umberto Lenzi, who is usually recognized as a Deodato rip-off, led 1972 three years before THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER? Well ... not really ..... <br /> <br /> A photographer accidentally kills a self-defense man and while retreating into the jungles of an Asian country, he is captured by a native tribe, who arrest him Captive, force him into slave labor and finally accept him if he marries the chief's daughter. Throughout the movie, I never had the feeling that this was a horror movie. It was more reminiscent of a drama like A Man CALLED HORSE that I liked better. Ivan Rassimov is pretty good as a photographer, but it's Me Me Lai as daughter of the boss, which is unforgettable and great. I have always been a fan of Me Me Lai since her breathtaking performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, and she is never respected for her acting chips because she barely talks in her films. She is still very talented and charming. Many real animal mutilations are the only thing DEEP RIVER could do to make it a horror movie, but even that does not work well. <br /> <br /> THE MAN OF DEEP RIVER is good to see for all who want it. To see what has started with the cannibal subgenre, but as an entry in the genre, it is from Deodatos entries and even slightly overlaid by Lenzi's later entries. Recommended only for completeists and Me Me La Lai fans.
