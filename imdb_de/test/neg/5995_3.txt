That should have rocked. VH1 moved away from the traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) who had made the 2003 show so stale. Unfortunately, the move backfired. The show did not have an MC holding the show together. Queen Latifah has shown a fantastic show at Divas 2003. The show started with a terrible version of Lady Marmalade starring Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Okay, in the studio with some control they can all sound great. <br /> <br /> However, if they compete (why?), it just sounds agonizing! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings I've ever seen! Cyndi Lauper also performed Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. That was not so bad, but it was barely impressive. The worst should come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle played together to play Cyndi's hit 'Time After Time'. It was acoustic and did not fit the rest of the show. Still, it might have been okay if both had not insisted on squeaking like mowed animals. It was just stupid. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (by Blondie) is always cool. She has her own style and although she may not be able to sing with many divas, though she certainly can sing very well. Debbie came out and played Blondies # 1 hit 'Rapture'. With some nice vocals. She really hit the marks perfectly. She looked stunning. Rapper Eve provided a new but unfortunately inferior rap. It was good. Debbie's next appearance was a team with newcomer Joss Stone. They performed the Blondie hit "One Way or Another". I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just called it over Debbie. A slightly sadder moment was when Debbie tried not to find her screaming style, which spoiled it a bit. She should have just let Joss off with her totally inappropriate Warballing. The entire blondie has performed this track. The last track Debbie played was Blondie's massive hit 'Call Me'. It was pretty bad. Not Debbie's fault because you just could not hear her. The sound was terrible throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also played some songs alone. They were pretty well done. Ashanti also showed two inexplicable cover versions. First she did Diana Ross' 'I'm coming out' and then Chaka Khan's' Is not Nobody '. She is not a diva! She can sing to a certain degree but has no presence at all. Why not just catch the real singers? Chaka was even interviewed on the show. <br /> <br /> Gladys Knight appeared and made a medley. It was very good. She was probably the best part of the show. I do not know much about her except that she is an experienced performer in Las Vegas and really shows through her experience and teaching. Patti Labelle adapted her 80s hit "New Attitude" this time. It was the final and it was okay, but it was too little too late. That was a big guy. Good luck next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a heavily edited 55min version, which was shown on VH1 in the UK. If these were the best pieces ...
