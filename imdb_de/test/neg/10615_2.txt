There are films that are leaders and films that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" was a leader. And here is one of his followers. <br /> <br /> "Party Camp" is about as interchangeable as any of his brothers who pleaded for the depths that "Meatballs" (the original) had broken down so successfully. Of course, this one had a Bill Murray. So, what does "Party Camp" have? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked that question. Jewel Sheperd made these stripes for her bread and what a side dish she offers! Even as an innocent (wink, wink) girlfriend of a rich dwarf (Cribb), she provides the sultry steam she gives to all her parts. And yes, guys, she shows (if you know what I mean and I think you do). My God, that smile could melt through Titan. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yes, the movie. Nothing special, as I said; Every cheap joke is aimed and hit (at step height). And the eternal teenager Jayne is good for a laugh or two. But instead of humor, there is only nudity, lame sex jokes, more nudity, a soft-core dream sequence, a sex symbol nurse who simply serves for (DRESSING!) Laughing purposes, even more nudity .... <br /> < br /> Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea, Bill Murray was NOT in this. <br /> <br /> Two stars. For jewel of course. Much "camp" but not much "party".
