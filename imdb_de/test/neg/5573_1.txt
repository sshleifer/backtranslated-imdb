I see that the majority of the comments so far, if not too positively, have been positive at least. I can not understand this. The only explanation I can find is that the people who were commented had something to do with the film because it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. As a result, "Boggy Creek II" and "Mutant" are depicted as masterpieces of horror. Acting is shaky at best and terrible for the most part. The whole movie is almost pitch black, probably they could all shoot it in the same place. The monster looks like something out of one of Roger Corman's worst films. And the plot ... well, the less you say about it, the better. <br /> <br /> One that is to be avoided at all costs.
