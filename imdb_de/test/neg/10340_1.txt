I am currently 22 years old and remember that I saw this movie in the cinemas when it first came out. You heard me right, I was five, and yet I can still remember exactly what I saw so many years ago this afternoon. Was it a mystical journey through the fantastic world of Mark Twain? ... No, on the other hand, it was a pretty scary movie about Mark Twain's dark, depressed, and indeed suicidal side. One scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain plays the organ at his own funeral. <br /> <br /> Would an adult enjoy this movie? Well, this movie may offer some interesting points of view that a person with a good knowledge of the writing of Mark Twain can enjoy. But believe me, "Adventures" is NOT the movie you want to introduce to your little kids Mark Twain.
