I was Stan in the movie "Dreams Come True". Stan was the friend who worked in the factory with the main character and shattered his arm in the machinery and screamed (where was the ambulance?) From Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. It played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was special to see yourself on the big screen. I may be biased, but overall I liked it. The soundtrack was also the band Spooner, which later became garbage. My brother Steve Charlton was also in the movie. He played Swenson, the man who comes crutching to the door to talk to the police.
