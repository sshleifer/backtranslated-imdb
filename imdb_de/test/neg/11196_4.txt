The summary was promising, but the movie's reputation was a big disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. The plot is linear and without surprise. Normal characters remain normal until the end of the movie, strange characters remain strange until the end of the movie. There is not even a single attempt to convince the viewer that the villain is someone other than the most obvious candidate. On the plus side, actors do play pretty well, and there's a bit of atmosphere in the movie, but far too little to be significant. <br /> <br /> People who choose 10 for this movie did not see it or you are a member of the film production team! 4 is well paid.
