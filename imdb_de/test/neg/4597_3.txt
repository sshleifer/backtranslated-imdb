Most likely, after Matt Dillon's phenomenal appearance at CRASH, most will quickly pick up a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is real or just a lucky recoil from a great script. Well, Factotum certainly has its moments, but the clarity of ... everything will most likely scare off the viewer. Dillon, however, should not be taken. His performance is wonderful and full of excellent, dead humor, proving that he is a solid actor with significant clues. It's just a shame about the director and the script. <br /> <br /> The story is about Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to get used to something that resembles normalcy. In just a few minutes, he is quit or dismissed from work just to find himself in a bleak pub, where he meets even bleaker women while trying to write an unconformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about, except that it's about "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me). <br /> <br /> Jumping from work to work and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a loser friend as discouraged as he is, Hank tries in vain to figure out what his life is for him should. Whether he ever learns what that is, he can interpret. Some may say that he never does so, while others may argue that his life is simply a way to disguise. <br /> <br /> Regardless, Factotum has little substance even in Matt Dillon's excellent performance. The story winds its way through Hank's life without much thought of where to lead the audience. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance would have been even brighter on a decent screenplay.
