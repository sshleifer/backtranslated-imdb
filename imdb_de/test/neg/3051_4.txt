One of the many silent comedies in which Stan Laurel played before he teamed up with Oliver Hardy, "Mud and Sand" is a hummocky hokum. The story is very disjointed - though this might be due to today's editing - and the humor itself is not imaginative at all. Possible plot lines are started and ignored; For example, Stan's promise to pay Fillet de Sole for what she did to him never comes to fruition. Stan does not seem to be very centered either, but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed "Stanley" from Laurel & Hardy's fame. So I expected that I had noticed this lack. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that all silent films should be received and viewed, and I am glad that it is still available. It's just not a great movie.
