The mummy's curse is the last in the series of Kharis mummy movies, and it seems that the creativity got a little drier when they made this film. Kharis and his buddy Ananka both land in the bayous of Louisiana and on his resurrection he searches for his beloved princess. How they land in Louisiana is not clear, but with different people trying to find them, the viewer may be convinced of some mummy murders. <br /> <br /> The mummy's curse was on display, but it was not that unusual. I had the feeling throughout the movie that I had seen this before. The mummy movies are, apart from the original The Mummy with Boris Karloff, not my favorite among the old universal horror. They are not bad, but they get a bit repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are some great scenes in the movie (the scene where Ananka was brought to life in the swamp, for example), but on the whole it does not do much for me. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you want to be complete and want to see all the mummy movies, but otherwise you can share this movie.
