I love the Andersen fairy tales as a kid and have recently seen some intriguing documentary films about this weird but brilliant author. I was really looking forward to watching this TV movie. Unfortunately, the experience was nothing but a disappointment that left me in rage and confusion. First of all, the story / script is full of inaccuracies and outright fantasies, creating an almost completely new story while abusing Andersen's fairy tale, presumably to sell the crap to such jerks as me. Second, Pretty Boy Actors (really ... ever seen a picture of real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to depict Hans Christian as mentally retarded rather than a brilliant but very disturbed figure he actually was. As annoying and irritating as Andersen, Brew misses the necessary charisma to create compassion. Third. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (who was supposed to be Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin) ... Why? This man has led such an interesting life, it should be enough as the basis for a great movie. <br /> <br /> I could continue this list, be a very long list, but it feels safest to just recommend them all. Spend your time and money on something else.
