Here is a decidedly average Italian post-apocalyptic impression of the hunting / killing of people for the sports theme "The Most Dangerous Game", "Turkey Shoot", "Gymkata" and "The Running Man" fun like the other listed entries and is also going through Poor voice-over work, usually mild action sequences, a series of completely tasteless scenes like a lengthy rape sequence and some really stupid and illogical points pulled through. > Take, for example, toward the end of the movie, if our hero manages to infiltrate the bad guys' connection. He first kills a post and leaves him in his jeep. After the discovery of the corpse, the villains answer? (Considering that our hero brutally murdered everyone)? They decide to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> But I think the movie will still be fair, if you can expose it to your disbelief in such stupid scenes and will benefit immensely from the presence of the always excellent Woody Strode (although its screen time is very limited) , <br /> <br /> Not a classic, but in a way just part of the imagination of a clock for Italian B-movie enthusiasts.
