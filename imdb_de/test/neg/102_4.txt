Of course, I saw the previews at the beginning of another Lion's Gate extravaganza, so of course they were just the best parts, so they looked mesmerizing. And that's up to a point. A young student (Sarah) finds puzzles everywhere and is obsessed with answering them, unknowingly involved in a game. This is quite interesting, but unfortunately everything gets pretty confused and so complicated that the viewer (like me) is most likely to get frustrated. The characters appear with little introduction and you are not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows or hangs out with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who years ago tried to drown a little boy. Her reason was that it is "all part of the design". In fact, all of this is part of the "very sketchy script," and when the movie is over, you feel like you've lost about an hour and a half of your life to get more productive use of your time, such as cleaning of the bathroom. 4 out of 10.
