I'm the kind of person who can enjoy a good B-movie if it has a redeeming value, but there's nothing to save at Dead Space! This is the kind of movie that will make you frustrated, restless and sick. <br /> <br /> Bad action. Lame story Terrible impact. Terrible, tormenting dialogue. Dead Space has it all!
