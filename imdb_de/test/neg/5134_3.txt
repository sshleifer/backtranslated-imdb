OK, I do not want to upset anyone who enjoyed this movie, but it was a really bad movie. As the scenes were processed and the acting, I got scared in some places. I really tried to enjoy it, but it was like a student movie, they had the smallest budget. I really liked the story and the characters were nice, but the movie was just awful. Why is it that in almost every movie with lesbian characters, one of them either has to commit suicide or die or go straight?!?! So this is sending a wrong and unrealistic message. I gave him 3 stars and everything I think was very nice of me. Just watch this movie if you want to laugh about how bad it is.
