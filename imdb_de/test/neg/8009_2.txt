They (Dueringer, Dorfer) are good stand-up comedians, young, not ugly, have money, the girls love them, the audience appreciates everything there is <br /> <br /> and then they have this movie made ... <br /> <br /> no story, some jokes were old in the fifties, acting is terrible. Save your money on something useful, such as a gift for your girlfriend.
