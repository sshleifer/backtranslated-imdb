I rated this movie 1/10 and did it in good nature. This movie is not what it seems, and I do not understand what it's about. Take, for example, the first joke. This is this sign in the beginning to start. Well, that was fine, but then they have a guy talking about the bonnet, and then he dies. Then they are the others who talk. Then he dies after the other guy says that people do not get their birthday without dying. and he gets a cake now. then he dies. <br /> <br /> The jokes are just stupid, they are, and I thought they were better than the directors of the scary movie: <br /> <br /> Shawn Wayans (written by) & Marlon Wayans (written by) & Phil Beauman (written by) <br /> <br /> But it was shit and I hope that the next time you want to do another comedy, make good jokes and no lame.
