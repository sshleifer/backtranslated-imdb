This movie was total cheese. It stank. The only good thing about it was the acting. Besides, that's nothing special at all. <br /> <br /> Big Time Spoilers Coming Up! Do not read anymore if you have not seen it yet! <br /> <br /> This film is all about a family whose happy and wonderful life was destroyed by the younger son and later when they learn the older son were abused by their caregivers. Although they are called liars in court and the defender is a real git, the jury finds them guilty and condemns them. <br /> <br /> In the end, I can only tell the director, "The next time you want to make a movie like this, do it differently."
