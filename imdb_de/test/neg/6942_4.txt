Marlene Dietrich is great as Concha Perez, the seductress who drives all men to despair in Josef von Sternberg's "The Devil is a Woman". Her performance has nothing to do with "acting" in the traditional sense, but she's glowing, a true star who masters her material. But she's the only good thing about the movie (she's so good at making you watch this slag, I doubt another actress could have done the same). <br /> <br /> The story is an incredibly lame melodrama. (Pierre Louys's novel was certainly better), in which Dietrich's Amoral Concha ruins the lives of two friends of Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero, whose stiffness borders on fossilization. And for Von Sternberg, it's an ugly-looking movie (perhaps in keeping with its rather ugly theme). Bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough about it to reshape it as "That Obscure Object of Desire" with a stronger focus on the surrealistic aspects of the whole, except for two different actresses in the same role. Neither movie is the director's best hour, and while the Bunuel version is the better, it's Dietrich's "performance" you remember.
