This movie is so bad that he would not buy it at my local CD / DVD store. I only own it because it was in a box that I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". The store bought back the other two films I sold from the four disc sets, but Underworld would not buy them back, and those two other films have redefined the rank. What does that say about this movie? So I tried to return it to another store that even bought budget DVDs that could be bought for a dollar at a local store, but Underworld would not be bought back either. This film is bad at all levels and is one of the films that emerged in the post-Tarantino clashes of the mid-90s. The only redeemable element is Dennis Leary, who tells Joe Montegna that he is a "stinky friend" and calls him "Mister Stinky Friend". This line is so adorable awful that I can not help but describe a smelly friend, at least once a week. But now that I have enlightened you with this quote, you do not have to move through the pains of this movie.
