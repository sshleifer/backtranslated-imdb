This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this movie? A few Americans invade Nazi-occupied France and begin slaughtering Germans. They watch as they scalp their enemies and beat them to death with baseball bats. Of course, jokes are made. <br /> <br /> Some will say that this movie is a parody of a particular genre. For a parody, it's neither funny nor funny. The content is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message, for it is again the "good guys" who kill "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it over. Can you imagine a story in which Nazis (while joking) kill everyone in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is about it, except that it satisfies the strange moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when they are made by the right people because of the hidden Nazi ideology below. It does not consider the enemy as human. And if the latter is meant to be part of the fun then I am glad that this fun is always a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another mystery is how such violence can mesmerize the American crowd, while a bit of nudity will freak them out. However, if a naked body is pornography, this movie, with all its brutality, is pure pornography at its worst. Inglorious Basterds is a pointless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money.
