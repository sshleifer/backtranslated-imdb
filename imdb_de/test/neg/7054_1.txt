My brother worked in a movie theater when I saw this movie. I saw it for free and still went out. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, but that was the worst. When people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I mention this movie in less than a second. This movie is bad because it goes from one lame act to the next, and encourages stereotypes about blacks getting sick and the river awful. If you want to see how children can cry and vomit at the same time, read this movie. Okay, this movie is not good "bad", but terribly bad. If you're like one of those who see awesome movies for fun, like me, you will not even be able to survive this short movie. Please for the love of God destroy all copies of this movie.
