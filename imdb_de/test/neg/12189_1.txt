It's been a long time since I saw this movie and still one of the worst I've ever seen. I like a lot of movies. Sci-Fi, action, drama, thriller and sometimes even horror. No combination of two. That could have been a wonderful movie, but everyone blew it up. I did not want to see this movie, but my friends insisted on looking at it. I did not know it was such a crap. I loved the first installment of Clooney and Tarantino driving through Texas killing everyone (especially the liquor scene was awesome), but at its watershed, everything changed in the hip twister bar. Stupid vampires took over the place and a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like "Nightmare on Elmsteet". If you like horror, look at a real horror movie. And if you love hemostatic thrillers, you do not see it all, you will be very disappointed in the end.
