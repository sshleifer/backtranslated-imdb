As you watch this movie, you immediately notice the cheesy elements of a standard television movie ... although the plot changes throughout the picture (if you're brave enough to say that this movie has a plot), it's the book and unoriginal ... And with every movie the movie KEPTING WORSE! <br /> Candace Cameron Bure, famous for her role as DJ Tanner in the hit television show Full House, does not convince very much of the owner's death. I think she's a good actress ... just not a thriller. <br /> <br /> The shooting was trashy and like I said, the storyline is outdated ... even though I saw it, I knew I was on automatic cheese, I had no idea how much worse this movie was Could be ... <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film ... unless filming and bad writing is what you are looking for
