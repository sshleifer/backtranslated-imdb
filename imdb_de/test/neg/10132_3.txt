Natalie Wood portrays Courtney Patterson, a polio-disabled songwriter who tries to avoid being sacrificed by her first love affair. Her partner is the lawyer Marcus Simon, who is played by Wood Wagner's realistic husband Robert Wagner. The film is heavily cut, but the majority of the remaining scenes show a very weak hand of the director, which allows Wagner to constantly oversleep and devastate a solid and sophisticated performance of Wood, which also offers a fine soprano. The script is a bit trivial, but unfortunately the lingering nature of Wagner's dramatic deficit is in full force everywhere, as he is given a free hand to impose on Wood the daunting look that an actress must discourage. The progression of their relationship is presented unpredictably, and this, along with the jerky editing, makes the viewer less sure about what is going on, almost completely ignoring motivation in writing. Although largely unnoticed, the cinematography lights up during a brief scene where Wood is placed on a terrace, and remains in the middle after the sound of a closing door, while the camera's eye turns steadily away from it, demonstrating its helplessness and frailty. A controlled direction would have allowed the actors, even the slack Wagner, to scale their actions along the lines of an engaging relationship; Since it was released, there is largely an immense lack of commitment.
