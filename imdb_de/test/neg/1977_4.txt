I give this movie 4 points because I'm a tough fan of the video game series. The graphics and animation are excellent and it's nice to see the whole group in CG of Sephiroth, who is still cool. Well, the reasons that they only have a 4. The characters feel like planks of wood with some of the worst cast to actors I've ever seen (I've watched epic movie) <br /> <br /> The movie just seems so cloud-oriented that it even fans embarrassing with cloud and doing so in the cloud. Clouds mention so much that you do not want to see him in this movie <br /> <br /> the bad guys got the award for the worst villains (I was more afraid of the evil witch of the west) <br /> <br /> All other characters in this movie are simply pasted into the movie to give the fans a nod and do not take it further than that the <br /> <br /> WTFs with the chilly chally ??? Summary: I've been waiting 9 years for this movie and this is what I get a big pointless and boring cutscene. I ask the head of Square Cenix to shoot the man responsible for burning every copy of the movie one is involved and creates a new movie from the ashes (it would be nice to have the movie live-based and based) to do on the original game)
