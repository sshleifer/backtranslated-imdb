First, there are some storylines in this film. At the beginning, we see a child dying from the game. But who was tied in the mail van that delivered the package with the game? How did the driver put the parcel into the mailbox when he was tied to the steering wheel? It's not like he's Mr. Fantastic. Wow, that in just the first 15 minutes ... The actors are secondary, take the "bad guy" by Patrick Kilpatrick (who?). like this one). Most of the plays are like TV dramas, I can live with them, but the graphics or special effects are terrible. The bodiless "Game" voice sounds like a bad clone of Hal's "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called zombies looked more like shadows hopping like monkeys from the "Planet of the Apes". The aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies. In most cases, the movie was easily predictable, with neither a hook nor a hidden program. The story was a good idea, but like most of the good ideas that were discussed during lunch, it never developed beyond this good phase of ideas.
