In general, political messages are broadcast on television. If you are a big fan of environmental labeling, look to your heart's content. Most people go to the movies to be entertained and they do not sell political nonsense. The catch here is the big name. Unfortunately, the sum of the performances is a whole movie that has gone absolutely nowhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have minimal screen time. In short, "Silver City" is to be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a non-documentary, far-reaching political exposure to illegal immigration, pollution, and a number of other causes that are only elsewhere on the small screen. - MERK
