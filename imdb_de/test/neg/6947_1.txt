I could not believe it. This movie was a total waste of my life. The title is appropriate. Love did not condemn me, this movie did. I watched and watched and waited and waited, hoping for something to happen. And nothing happened! Nothing!! Terrence Howard could not save this lame piece of film. It was dark and confused and I could not figure out who killed the girlfriend in the end. The tone and the tempo of the film should become a dramatic climax. This only served to confuse the audience, because the movie only ran where it went. If you want pure torture, watch this movie.
