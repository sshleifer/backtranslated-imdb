It says a lot about the UK when TV shows like these are not only produced but also run for three series. Unwilling, politically correct and ill and badly traded. Meera Syal was in no way funny or accomplished, tell me I'm wrong, and Jasper Carrott, funny as he is, is well beyond the value of his eighties. This is such a bad comedy that it could be made by ITV, but even stinkers like The Upper Hand and James Bolam as parking attendants look like Fawlty Towers compared to this garbage. I would like to sit down with the writer / director of this show so they can point out the humor in this program. While the majority of the UK's population consists of poorly trained cooks, that would not tickle their funny bones. That would be if they could part with Big Brother or their phones, but that's another story. Complete and total dirt!
