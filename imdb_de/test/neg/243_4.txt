** SPOILERS ** The third and most compassionate last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy, starring the main star of the series alongside mummy actor Ramon Gay as Dr. Eduardo Almada was gunned down by his indignant husband, a woman on May 28, 1960! However, this did not prevent Gay from being embedded in her from his previous films, and that he was in several future Mexican horror movies over the next four years after his death. <br /> <br /> In "Robot vs the Aztec Mummy" We have the crazy scientist Dr. Krupp trying to get hold of the mummy's golden breast shield and bracelet to decipher it and find the Aztez treasure secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City 500 years ago. "Robot vs the Aztec Mummy" is not really a movie in itself, since it consists of recordings of the previous Aztec Mummy films, which claim more than half of the movie's running time. <br /> <br /> After Getting Here We introduced ourselves to the actors in the film, some of whom have died in previous Aztec Mummy films. We'll go into the basics, with both the evil and the criminal madman. Krupp is also known as "The Bat". Dr. Krupp - who looks like a wild, crazy Orson Wells - is a man with boundless visions of grandeur. Not only does he reveal the long-lost treasure of the Aztecs, but now, unlike the previous two films in which he created and used life, it is an army of human robots conquering the world. An idea he had gotten from Ed Wood's "Atomic Superman" classics classic "Bride of the Monster" (1955). <br /> <br /> Can not handle the mummy in his other two encounters, where he is finally thrown. Krupp had created a robot into a serpent pit filled with deadly rattlers, into which a human carcass had been stuffed to kill him in the mummy. While his mummy is sleeping in a graveyard in Mexico City in her grave Krupp his Robot Man into the tomb of the mummy to fight with her and destroy her with their deadly rays. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The big confrontation of the Aztec Mummy Robot-Man confrontation will be a big disappointment, as the Mummy has no trouble dispatching the "Tin-Man" in less than 30 seconds together with its creator Dr. Krupp - all this, while Dr. Almada and his friend and assistant Pinacate, who came to help the mummy, have nothing to do but sit back and watch the action that the crazy and unconventional Dr. Krupp annoys it, the mummy can return to her eternal resting place, without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world, like Dr. Krupp, in which she really has no interest.
