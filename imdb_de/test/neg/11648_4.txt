The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> The special effects were not. <br /> <br /> The acting was ... not good at all. <br /> <br /> For others, I felt that there were many holes in the plot that allowed you to fly. Well, a space shuttle through. <br /> <br /> I thought the end would be pretty incredible. <br /> <br /> By the way guys, about the "torch in space". <br /> <br /> Torches have their own oxygen supply (hence the name "oxy-acetylene torch"). Two tubes run from the torch: one to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen cylinder. <br /> <br /> A "blowtorch" would work well in the room.
