The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the enormous script errors that only a non-critical viewer can avoid. The main question is: What is the purpose of the killer when it is in the middle of the ground? The film attempts to show that the killer's goal is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with other people's lives and control their fears and weaknesses. Why does he pretend to be dead between the two main characters? A tremendous improbability: Can a man pretend to be dead for more than an hour or two without moving a single muscle, or even breathing, so as not to be detected by two men in the same room? It does not make any sense at all to be the final (d) effect of the movie. The killer always seems to be in control of the plot, and if he lies like a corpse, this is not possible. After all, it does not work. The right place for the killer was to be a darker and untouchable shadow beyond the false shadow (the male nurse), not the floor of the white room. The director should not have seen the murderer's face and the place where he was hiding. Then the movie would be a pretty good thriller. "Saw" is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please come back.
