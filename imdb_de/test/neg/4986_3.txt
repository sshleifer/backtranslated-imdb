I did not like Underdog! I mean, it was really unnecessary and needed a big facelift, and then it might have been passable, but I did not like the main part of those films where parents (who watched the cartoon) wanted to play with kids come to see this, I'm not one of them, so the movie did not touch me in the least. I had some issues with it, like me. I do not think Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog. He sounded sloppy and really unintelligent. Then it was really predictable, which makes you feel tired and crazy. The humor really drove me crazy, it was just too funny and something The only thing that bothered me the most was that almost everything from Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude. The acting was passable, but had to be improved a little. If you have children, you may like them, but if you are not a child By all means you may see it differently than me. 3.4 out of 10 possible stars
