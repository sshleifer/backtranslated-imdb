Let me get this out of the way before I throw this film in the bin: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. Although I think he is the best director working in our time, I can not deny that he understands the camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Besides, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this movie seriously. , , for 1/5 of the term, that is. <br /> <br /> Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché in cinema / literature. I'll never understand how critics can throw garbage at Hollywood blockbusters, and then films like Oldboy that are just as unoriginal and cliched, if not more so. Regardless, Oldboy is one of the most generic, unoriginal films ever conceived. * Spoiler * Man is held prisoner, man seeks revenge, husband finds out that he had sex with a family member, the man's life is over. * Endspoiler * Put simply, this storyline has been used in Greek plays, modern melodramatic soap operas and countless films / books in between. It's so melodramatic and unoriginal when the big revelations happen, I laughed out loud. Does that mean that I'm an insensitive freak with no emotions, as some reviews of this movie say about people like me? What it means, exaggerated actions make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved that, and Oldboy proved it too. Why do not people think of something that is really disconcerting instead of just spitting out the best clichés that are masked with fancy camera work and classical music? This brings the blood / blood issue to light. Simply put, it is not there. The director is too shy to even point the camera at the screen when something "bloody" happens, like watching a kids movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I've heard that Oldboy called the "most brutal movie of all time" and "the most troubling movie of all time", but when I looked at it, I did not even see anything bloody or disturbing remotely. The whole "Gore" is not on screen, and even then the level of violence is nothing you have not seen in PG-13 films like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale. Why that even got an R rating confuses me, let alone "the most brutal movie of all time". Seriously, I've seen movies where Oldboy looks cute on all levels when it comes to violence. <br /> <br /> The other big gross, cheesy mistake is the main villain. For most of his screen, he shows his naked butt in comedic American pie-style to the audience, but I should think he's so evil? When he wears clothes, his hair has gone down like a bad Asian mix of the cutest James Bond villain mixed with something from Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad that I had to laugh again. Seriously, Oldboy laughed more than any comedy this year. , , <br /> <br /> In the end, Oldboy is for those of you who drink good wine, have no sense of humor and talk about how boring your life is at dinner parties. It is for the people who are so stuck in their own egos that they forget how unoriginal they are, and thus forget how unoriginal and boring the "movies" (never "movies") are that they like. <br /> <br /> To these people I can only say: I like "movies" and also "movies". I like contemplative dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and I also like pointless action movies that pull me into a coma. But the thing is, I like both "movies" and "movies", they have to be original. It must be something I have not seen so often when I lost the count of how many times the plot was used. If something is not original, it is expendable. If it does exactly what everyone else is doing, it's memorable and boring. Before you give Oldboy yet another perfect rating because it "touched" you, you might want to think about something: would not a movie be just as touching, but at the same time make you think more? I just wish someone other than me would understand that. <br /> <br /> Overall: Oldboy is forgetful and cheesy. <br /> <br /> 1/10
